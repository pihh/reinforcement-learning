Prepared Remarks 
Sadahiko Hayakawa    General Manager  Investor Relations
Ladies and gentlemen  we shall now start    begin the Earnings Announcement Session for the Third Quarter of the Fiscal Year 2019  My name is Hayakawa  the IR    the General Manager responsible for Financial Affairs 
I d like to introduce our speakers for the day  we have the Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer  Hiroki Totoki  and then  Senior Vice President  Senior General Manager of the Finance Department and Corporate Planning and Control Department  Naomi Matsuoka  and then VP  Senior General Manager  Global Accounting Division  Hirotoshi Korenaga  Mr  Totoki will make the presentation today first  and then we ll follow that with the question and answers  and we plan to spend 40 minutes altogether 
With that  Mr  Totoki  would you please start 
Hiroki Totoki    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer
Before I explain our results today  I would like to speak a little about the spread of infection from the new coronavirus  First  we extend our condolences to the families of the people who have passed away  and send our thoughts to those who have been infected  Sony is very concerned about the spread of infection  At this time  it is difficult to fully grasp what is going on  but we are exerting all efforts to gather information and assess the situation and we are taking actions where possible 
Now  I will explain these two topics  Fiscal  19 third quarter consolidated sales increased 3  year on year to JPY2 463 2 billion and operating income decreased JPY76 9 billion year on year to JPY300 1 billion  Net income attributable to Sony Corporation stockholders decreased JPY199 4 billion year on year to JPY229 5 billion  As is shown on this slide  certain extraordinary items were recorded in both the current quarter and the same quarter of the previous fiscal year  Excluding these extraordinary items  operating income would have increased JPY16 5 billion to JPY276 5 billion  Also  excluding these extraordinary items  net income attributable to Sony Corporation stockholders would have increased JPY58 3 billion from JPY157 9 billion in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year to JPY216 2 billion 
Next is the consolidated results forecast for fiscal  19  Consolidated sales are expected to increase JPY100 billion year on year to JPY8 500 billion and operating income is expected to increase JPY40 billion to JPY880 billion  I will explain the breakdown of sales and operating income for each segment when I explain the segment results 
Income before income taxes was upwardly revised to JPY860 billion and net income attributable to Sony Corporation stockholders were revised upward to JPY590 billion  The forecast for operating cash flow excluding the financial services segment is JPY760 billion  unchanged from the previous forecast  The assumed foreign exchange rates for the four quarter are JPY109 to the US dollar and JPY121 to the euro 
As for the dividend  this fiscal year  we expect to issue year end dividend of JPY25 per share  and when combined with the interim dividend already paid  the annual dividend will be JPY45 per share  JPY10 more than last fiscal year 
Now  I would like to discuss the impact of the spread of new coronavirus infection  I just explained the upward revision of our consolidated results  but that impact of the spread of the coronavirus is not included in that forecast  At this time  it is difficult for us to assess the impact on our results  but depending on how the situation evolves  the impact could be large enough to eliminate the entire amount of the upward revision  We think there could be a major impact on our manufacturing  sales and supply chain operations  especially in the I SS and EP S segment  Going forward  we will continue to gather information and assess the impact and take any necessary actions  Based on  Indecipherable   00 04 45  that  if there is any material change to our forecast for the current fiscal year  we will disclose the change 
Now  I will explain the situation in each of the business segment  First  Game   Network Services  Sales for the quarter increased    decreased 20  to JPY632 1 billion  primarily due to the decrease in PS4 hardware sales and software sales  as well as the negative impact of the exchange rates  PS4 hardware is in its 7th year since launch and partly because we announced the PS5 next generation console  unit sales decreased year on year  The yen based average selling price of the hardware decreased due to the negative impact of exchange rates and an increase in the proportion of units sold during the selling season  However  we were able to secure a margin on hardware  that was flat year on year  because we keep the promotional price at the same level as the last fiscal year  and because promotional costs were offset by year on year reduction in component cost  excluding this and decrease in the free to play titles  the impact of the exchange rate  software sales were essentially flat year on year 
Operating income decreased JPY19 6 billion to JPY53 5 billion  primarily due to the impact on the decrease of the third party software sales  partly offset by the increase in the profit for the growth of the Network Services PS Plus  And revised downward our fiscal  19 sales forecast by JPY50 billion to JPY1 950 billion  and the opening income forecast by JPY5 billion to JPY235 billion  The revision in sales was due to a change in our forecast for third party software sales  including the impact of postponement into next fiscal year of some of our Silver title sales  And despite the benefit of operating cost reductions  operating income was revised downward  mainly due to the decrease in software sales 
Our financial results  this fiscal year  are in a period of adjustment as we approach the transition to the PS5 s new generation console and because the contribution of the free to play titles last fiscal year  that s quite large  On the other hand  when you look at our results over the mid  to long term  you can see that our Game business is steadily growing  as evidenced by the growth of Network Services  such as PS Plus and we expect this growth to continue going forward  The proportion of Network Services revenue continues to increase  mainly due to the increase in PS    the number of PS Plus subscribers  We aim to leverage this large community and network services revenue stream to effect a smooth transition from the current console generation to the next unlike in the past when profitability deteriorated significantly due to development and marketing costs incurred 
Next about Music segment  The third quarter sales increased 4  year on year to 269 point    JPY216 9 billion  but operating income declined JPY110 8 billion year on year to JPY36 3 billion  This decrease was mainly due to the absence of remeasurement gain resulting from the consolidation of the EMI Music Publishing recorded in the same quarter of the previous year  and a decline in sales of mobile games in Japan  Excluding these items  our Music business is steadily growing  mainly due to the growth of the streaming market  Streaming revenue in our Recorded Music business continue to grow at a high rate increasing 16  year on year and 20  year on year excluding the impact of the conversion to the yen  And there is no change to our full year forecast for sales and operating income 
Next is about Pictures segment  The third quarter sales declined 15  year on year to JPY236 0 billion and operating income decreased JPY6 2 billion to JPY5 4 billion  This decrease in profit was mainly due to the significant decline in Motion Picture revenues  partially offset by an improvement in profitability due to the benefit of a channel portfolio review in Media Networks  In the same quarter of the previous fiscal year  the major hit  Venom  was released at the beginning of October  significantly contributing to profitability throughout that quarter  But this fiscal year  the hit  Jumanji  The Next Level  was released only in mid December  so that the majority of the contribution to profitability will come in the fourth quarter and beyond  Well  there were other releases that did not meet our expectations  All in all  I believe that our Motion Pictures business has been performing well 
The fiscal  19 sales and operating income forecast is unchanged  The global box office revenue for calendar year 2019 increased  led by growth outside of the United States  And similar to last year  Sony Pictures had the fourth highest market share of box office revenue in the United States in calendar 2019  However  while all the major studios except Disney experienced the decline in box office revenue  Sony Pictures share increased 1 percentage point  compared to the previous year  mainly due to the contribution of the major hit  Spider Man  Far From Home  I think this success is due to our leveraging of IP such as Spider Man and Jumanji to build strong franchises 
Next  let me discuss our EP S segment  Sales for the quarter decreased 9  from last year to JPY650 4 billion  mainly due to a decrease in sales of smartphones and TVs and the negative impact of exchange rate  Operating income increased JPY14 1 billion year on year to JPY80 3 billion  This increase is mainly due to the benefit of restructuring of mobile communications and reductions in operating expenses in the various businesses within the EP S segment  partially offset by the impact of the decrease in sales  In order to reflect the deterioration of market conditions  we have reduced our sales forecast for the fiscal year by JPY40 billion to 2 070 billion  The forecast for operating income remains unchanged  as the impact of the decrease in sales is expected to be offset by improvements in operating costs across the various businesses 
The competitive environment during the 2019 year end selling season was primarily a test in the key product areas of TVs and the mirrorless cameras  But overall  we were able to control pricing  supply and inventory  Although competition in mirrorless cameras has increased  as other companies have entered the market in earnest  we maintained our share in major markets and produce results for overall digital cameras that are higher year on year  The intensely competitive environment in the TV market continued due to the deterioration in panel prices but we maintained high average selling price year on year by focusing on high value added large screen models  and we have maintained inventory at an appropriate level 
On the other hand  our broadcast  and professional use products business has seen a significant slowdown in China  an important market for the business  due to US China trade friction  And the negative impact that it is having on the economy  To respond to the circumstances  we are taking a variety of actions  including a review of our business structure  Due to the benefit of restructuring that is ongoing  the mobile communications business continued to record a profit in the third quarter  In the fourth quarter  we intend to implement yet another fixed cost reduction plan and take other action to integrate the operations of this business with the other businesses in EP S  We expect to record significant one time costs  primarily due to these actions in the fourth quarter  but the transformation of the business is progressing steadily toward breakeven next fiscal year 
Next is the I SS segment  Third quarter results increased 29  year on year to JPY298 billion  primarily due to the improvement in the product mix  and an increase in unit sales of image sensors for mobile devices  Operating income increased JPY28 7 billion year on year to JPY75 2 billion  mainly due to the impact of the increase in sales  partially offset by an increase in research and development costs  and depreciation expense  We revised upward our fiscal year  19 sales forecast by JPY50 billion to JPY1 090 billion and the operating income forecast by JPY30 billion to JPY230 billion  Demand for our image sensors in the fourth quarter continues to be strong  Also  production capacity is expanding according to plan and we continue to operate at full production capacity utilization  sales increasing due to strong near term demand and that is preventing us from stockpiling strategic inventory as originally planned 
In addition  partly due to the introduction of a highly competitive new product this fiscal year  we have been able to maintain our overall margin  all of which has been enabled us to operate this business extremely well  There is no change to our view that demand would continue to increase over the mid  to long term from next fiscal year  But in regards to next fiscal year in particular  we cannot be too optimistic due to the impact of the spread of infection from the new coronavirus  that I mentioned earlier  as well as competitive environment and various geopolitical risks  We will continue to closely monitor demand trends and external environment as we manage this business going forward 
Now  I would like to talk about the action we are taking over the mid  to long term  Top  Phonetic  sensors  which we expect will be the next growth driver after image sensors have begun to sell well  although then size within the overall business is still small  We expect the adoption primarily in mobile devices to increase further from next fiscal year  Taking a longer term view as we made a point of showcasing at CS last month  we are taking steps to expand the adoption of Sony s imaging and sensing technology in the mobility space and in a diverse industrial factory automation space  We plan to proactively invest even more in technology development to grow this business in the future  such as hiring of personnel  including algorithm and software engineers and the building of an office in Osaka to service design and development center for image sensors 
Lastly  I would like to explain the Financial Services segment  The third quarter Financial Service revenue increased significantly by JPY243 6 billion year on year to JPY407 2 billion  This increase was primarily due to a significant increase in the investment performance of variable life insurance products in the separate account as Sony Life resulting from the rise in the domestic and foreign stock markets during the quarter  Because a significant portion of the investment performance of the separate account is attributable to the owners of insurance policies  the contribution to operating income is minimal 
Operating income decreased JPY5 3 billion year on year to JPY32 6 billion  This decrease was primarily due to the deterioration of net gains and losses as a result of a decrease in the provision of policy reserves and appraisal losses from its hedging activity  both pertaining to minimum guarantees for variable life insurance resulting from strong stock market conditions 
We have revised upward our forecast for Financial Services revenue to JPY1 460 billion to reflect the current market environment  On the other hand  we have revised downward JPY10 billion our focus for operating income to JPY160 billion  This is primarily due to the third quarter results and the fact that increase in policy amount in force is slightly below our expectations 
Lastly  I would like to show the forecast for each overall segments  This concludes my remarks  Thank you

Now  the floor is open to your questions  Those of you with questions  please wait for the microphone and please identify yourself by stating your name and affiliation before asking your questions  When questions are asked in English  there will be consecutive interpretation into Japanese and answers to be given in Japanese   Operator Instructions 
Now any questions 
Masahiro Ono    Morgan Stanley    Analyst
 Foreign Speech  Ono of Morgan Stanley  Thank you  Concerning I SS segment  two questions  The operating income JPY230 billion upward revision and concerning top line  the    what about the volume upside and the improvement of product mix in view of those aspects  Roughly speaking  what do you think had a greater impact on the outcome 
Second question  the increase in fixed asset and you ve reduced this slightly  Is it because of the higher efficiency investment or are there any factors related to this 
Hiroki Totoki    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer
First on I SS  the upward revision for annual forecast  what are the factors  volume increase or product mix improvement  On this matter  we explained this during the second quarter  The balance between unit increase and product mix improvement  the contribution is about more or less the same  and the increase in the fixed asset    a decrease in the fixed asset increase of I SS  Well  with the improvement of efficiency we could secure the assumed capacity without increasing capital expenditure  That was the factor behind it 
Sadahiko Hayakawa    General Manager  Investor Relations
 Foreign Speech  Next question  please 
Mika Nishimura    Credit Suisse    Analyst
 Foreign Speech  Nishimura  Credit Suisse  Thank you  The first question is about I SS  Talking about next year    talking about competitive environment  you are not optimistic about the competitive situation  But looking at the supply and demand  the industry as a whole is enjoying a sort of a good situation  So what is your take of the risk 
And the second question is about the Game business  The free to play business is declining in the third quarter compared to the first and second quarter  the third quarter  What are the signs of the decline  And also over the next year the decline in free play revenue  is this just a temporary situation for this year and not be repeated next year 
Hiroki Totoki    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer
Well  the competitive impairment we explained that we are optimistic about the situation next year  but it s difficult to explain that quantitatively  But the image that I have in my mind is  yes  next year    I think I said this at the previous last meeting  initially forecast was that the first half would be very strong  demand will be  so thinking about the balance  I guess  the production capacity  we were going to build a strategic inventory in the four quarter but as things stand currently most of the strategic inventory that we are going to deliver next year  it would have to be delivered this year  So whether we can meet the demand next year is still a problem 
0 8 million micro sensors  that s contributing to profitability  We are in the second year of production  but the catch up made by the competitors and also the fierce competition will become more severe in the secondary production  So this is a situation that we are forecasting  But needless for me to say  there is concerned about the coronavirus  we have not incorporated any impact of that in our numbers  So  as we learn more about the data  we ll have to create that results forecast 
Next about the Game business  the decline in free to play business  what were the situation in third quarter  How much decline did we experienced  So  as that decline completed this year or is it going to be repeated next year  Well  the so called third party softwares  the significant decline that we experienced  much of that is really to decline in free to play titles but for other software titles  the new titles and also the library of the existing titles  their business is basically flat  So  the free to play titles  it was very difficult to forecast the business and that was the experience this quarter as well  The difficulty of forecasting the business  but for other businesses there has been no significant change  So we ll have to advise methods of forecasting  particularly looking at the free to play titles 
Sadahiko Hayakawa    General Manager  Investor Relations
Next question  please 
Mikio Hirakawa    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst
Hirakawa from Merrill Lynch  My two questions are on the Game business  The first is as follows  you discussed about PlayStation Plus  Now  in your previous statements  if there are major titles that would trigger the increase of the membership of subscribers  In that context  I saw that you will struggle during the October December period  But nevertheless  that you were able to increase the subscription or the members base  What did you do to achieve this growth  And as you move on to the next generation  what would happen to your subscriber or the customer base 
Hiroki Totoki    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer
We have to steadily increase the membership for PS Plus  And how to increase the efficiency of retention  There are a number of plans and ideas  Of course  in August  there was a revision of the price  If you subscribe for the entire year  you enjoy a certain discount  and this has led to the increase of steady stable users  In providing such users would enjoy the online multiplay and free play and also 100 giga PlayStation 4 is also combined and also they enjoy the promotions for discount  And by combining different ideas  the users favored our stance  Phonetic   And we were able to increase the membership  There is a trend of increasing the membership during the third quarter  but by improving the services and providing a variety of services we d like to continue this trend and have a robust increase of the customer base 
Now  about the future generation  Of course  we would definitely like to increase the base to prepare for the next generation of the product  but there is very little that I can discuss about the future generation of the console today  But when the time is right  we will disclose the new product 
Mikio Hirakawa    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst
The PS5 is to be launched in the selling season toward the end of the year  So what would be the guidance    the future guidance for March  21  You have not disclosed the price for PS5  So what would happen to the guidance that you will be releasing in April for the next fiscal year 
Hiroki Totoki    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer
It s very difficult to really discuss this timing wise  but as of today  we will provide the guidance at a time period  which is comparable to the past  So we will not change the time schedule 
Sadahiko Hayakawa    General Manager  Investor Relations
Next question  please   Foreign Speech 
Kota Ezawa    Citigroup    Analyst
Ezawa  Citigroup  Two questions  First one concerning EP S  the    I wonder about the guidance of operating income for the fourth quarter  I understand that there will be a major loss  And you talked about the recording of one time expense  But in the way of your break down what is the trend for each product and what sort of factors you foresee  Or what about the amount of one time expense to be recorded  And for the coming fiscal year  to what extent the profit of EP S business be improved  including the impact of one time expense 
Hiroki Totoki    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer
Okay  During the fourth quarter  EP S operating income would be in a deficit  And in my presentation I made a mention that structural reform of the mobile business and recorded a one time expense and the impact of this is considerably large  But to what extent we can control this amount  is something we are scrutinizing at the moment  and we d like to minimize the amount as much as possible 
And other categories of product  we do not think any expense would go or beyond the normal seasonality  The level of inventory as I mentioned  and during the third quarter  we could successfully control the level of inventory  And concerning TV  for the time being  as I mentioned during the last time earnings announcement  we are thinking of launching some products during the fourth quarter  And that plan remains unchanged  However  the current supply chain concern in China may surface  There may be some delay in ramp ups 
Kota Ezawa    Citigroup    Analyst
Do you have the factors for increase the profit next fiscal year 
Hiroki Totoki    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer
About the new fiscal year  we have not finalized our plan yet  But our plan intention are that in the course of fiscal    next fiscal year  we d like to make a good start so that we will not be drawn by the negative legacy and make solid plan 
Kota Ezawa    Citigroup    Analyst
One point of confirmation  the fourth quarter with sub contracting  Phonetic   that is minus JPY35 8 billion and the restructuring budget for the fiscal year was increased by JPY20 billion and subtracting that what remains would be around JPY13 billion and that will go to mobile  And then would there be other deficit in other sectors than mobile will deduct  Phonetic  the JPY38 billion 
Hiroki Totoki    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer
Well  as you analyze  that may be a appropriate line of understanding  But we do not show the details in terms of individual breakdown 
Kota Ezawa    Citigroup    Analyst
And another point concerning the Game business  my second question  Third party software performance was not very good  But what about the first party titles performance  To the extent possible  was it higher than or lower than the expected first party title performance over there any major titles 
Hiroki Totoki    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer
Basically  we cannot answer in terms of the amount compared to how we expected  So  I d like to give you the impression observation  the    about the third party full game  our assumption of the other titles were lower and we could not reach it  And the first party full game  our assumption was    our expectation was higher  And we did not quite reach that level  And concerning PS Plus and so forth along the line of our regional expectation and assumption 
Sadahiko Hayakawa    General Manager  Investor Relations
 Foreign Speech  Please raise your hand if you have questions 
Yu Okazaki    Nomura Securities    Analyst
 Foreign Speech  Thank you  Okazaki  Nomura Securities  Firstly  about I SS  You always disclose the actual product capacity end of December  And can you give us the figure again 
Sadahiko Hayakawa    General Manager  Investor Relations
Mr  Korenaga  can you answer that question 
Hirotoshi Korenaga    Vice President  Senior General Manager  Global Accounting Division
Yes  The Imaging   Sensing production capacity at the end of the third quarter  our capacity was 115 000  Our expectation is    before it was 7 000 and there was some decline  but this is due to the change in process mix  So  this  Phonetic  capacity itself  there is no delay in setting up the capacity  At the end of fourth quarter  it s going to be 124 000  it s going to be 124 000  About input  the third quarter situation does full operation and for the fourth quarter  we expect to operate at the capacity fully as well 
Yu Okazaki    Nomura Securities    Analyst
The second question is about Pictures  You are enhancing the franchise business  you mentioned  Can you talk about inventory you made    investment you made in October and December  The Game Show Network is the nature of investment is different  And I think you are working on non profitable franchises  particularly  So what are you doing in terms of investment for the acquisition and plans 
Hiroki Totoki    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer
Well  the Game Show Network  we fully subsidiarized  Phonetic  this operation  Originally it was held by AT T  we acquired 42  stake in that  And then made a full subsidiary  Sorry  we acquired AT T s 42   Originally  we had 58   They have the original Game Show s distributed in US cable TV s  That s the nature of the business  And GSN and games    online games are also provided  And this business unit for us  from this point of view  believe is profitable going forward  And therefore  in order for us to be able to make strategic decisions  and the first we re going to  Phonetic  we felt that making this 100  full subsidiary was a good idea and therefore  we did that 
Another point is about the Silvergate  I think this is for anime development in production for the children  Also   Indecipherable  licensing  And SVOD  cable TV  we ve prepared seven titles for them  original titles  So    but was in this business is to get excellent talent and this business of the categories be attractive  There has been a view consistently and connect with titles and now that we found this opportunity for acquisition  we moved quickly to make the decision for acquisition 
Sadahiko Hayakawa    General Manager  Investor Relations
We re going to take the next question  So please raise your hand 
Junya Ayada    J P  Morgan    Analyst
 Foreign Speech  Thank you  J P  Morgan  Ayada is my name  My question first is on I SS  to reflect back the third quarter  there has been a product mix and increase of volume  Now  in the fourth quarter  what is the momentum for sales of increase per wafer  I think the second quarter  there was a better momentum  was it true for the third quarter 
Hiroki Totoki    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer
Now  also during the third quarter  was    I think the inventory fluctuated and that resulted in a negative impact on P L  Now  I SS third quarter you re right in saying that most the mix and the volume increased  And the momentum per wafer  no  I think you are referring to the unit cost of wafer  which we are not disclosing  So I would like to refrain from making any quantitative statement  But as the wafer size enlarges  the yield would come down per wafer  And therefore  we have to make the average selling cost  which would offset and which will surpass that drop  That s the logic  Therefore  the sales per wafer and the sales cost or unit cost momentum should be maintained  And we are working on that  And also in the meantime  we are working on the betterment of yield  And for new products  we would like to make sure that the ramp up would be very smooth because which would consequently improve profitability  So we will be focusing on those measures 
Junya Ayada    J P  Morgan    Analyst
Now  the third quarter  the inventory fluctuation  what impact would it have on the P L 
Hiroki Totoki    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer
The second quarter and the third quarter  if you compare the two quarters  the inventory declined by JPY7 8 billion  approximately  and this is true that it has pushed down the earnings    the profit  Now  compare on a year on year basis  the difference is more than JPY10 billion 
Junya Ayada    J P  Morgan    Analyst
Thank you  The second question is on the Game and Network Service  and please answer  if you can  to the best you can  Mr  Totoki said that you intend to have a smooth transition to the new generation  And as you do so  what are the factors that you can control such as marketing or development cost  Or there could be factors which are not visible  could be volume or price  So the best you can  can you discuss on what you can discuss and what is already visible 
Hiroki Totoki    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer
First  we must absolutely control the labor cost  the personnel cost  It must be controlled  And it leads to what should be recognized as a cost  We will definitely control that  And the initial ramp up  how much can we prepare initially  We will work on the production and the sales  And we will have to prepare the right volume as we launch this  And what is not very clear or visible is because we are competing in the space  So  it s very difficult to discuss anything about the price at this point of time  And depending upon the price level  we may have to determine the promotion that we are going to deploy and how much costs we are prepared to pay  So  it s a question of balance and because it s a balancing act  it s very difficult to say anything concrete at this point of time  but when I said smooth transition  we mean that we will definitely choose the optimal approach and that we would try to have the best balance so that will be profitable in the life    during the life of this product

Ryosuke Katsura    SMBC Nikko Securities Inc     Analyst
Thank you  Katsura  Mitsubishi Nikko Securities  Concerning I SS one point  in the slide you referred to the products other than image sensors  And what do you think of the contribution of these products from next fiscal year onwards 
And on the investment side  in your explanation you mentioned that probably you do not have to do as much investment as you expected  because of higher efficiency of the operation  including the use of outside capacity  probably you are thinking of the various ways  And you have the overall framework of JPY700 million in three years in MRP and what are the other factors 
Hiroki Totoki    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer
Other than    the contribution by other than mobile image sensors  the sensing sensors one for FA  Phonetic  and automotive applications are the ones  So other than mobile application by 2025 we d like to increase the contribution percentage up to 30   That s what we have been talking about  And this target remains unchanged  And we will    we are doing what is necessary to achieve that target right now  And short term products or maybe the tough sensors for mobile with shorter lead time and by  Phonetic  we will be able to show the possible percentage from next fiscal year onward 
About top sensors  the    it s not that we need the capital investment only dedicated for top sensors  So it has a high potentiality for business contribution  And we should be able to secure the appropriate margin on top sensors 
About the investment efficiency  about the decline investment by JPY15 billion  thanks to higher efficiency  But over the medium term JPY700 billion  this number  we do not foresee any major change  But next fiscal year  we will be looking at the next MRP from  21 to  23  So at that timing  we will look at the rate of investment over the coming three years for the next MRP  We should be able to show our view on such investment

 Foreign Speech  Time constraint  Phonetic   So this next one will have to be the last question 
Kenji Yasui    UBS Securities Japan Co   Ltd     Analyst
Yasui  UBS Securities  On I SS I have a question  The short term question  Until the fourth quarter what will be the inventory situation  is it going to be less or greater the line of inventory  And  of course  it depends on the market demand  But what is your target  It will be more or less  the inventory for the fourth quarter 
The second part of the question is  October December your business is very good  But your largest customer in the United States  I understand the change in the mix  The rest of the Company  it was effective notably because of this mix and there was a difference in results between the two and three sensors cameras  So there is an adjustment in the business in China starting in December  So  the consequence January to March  and also April to June  can you expect the demand sufficient to fill all your capacities and supply 
Hiroki Totoki    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer
Well  initially for the four quarter we had a plan to increase the strategic inventory to prepare for the next year  But what happened was a strong demand from the customers for the fourth quarter  Therefore  it was difficult for us to actually build up the strategic inventory for the future  We had to deliver whatever we had  But this impact of this coronavirus and it may not mean much for me to explain the decision  excluding that potential possibility  but there is a likelihood demand will slow down because of that  So  considering all this  altogether  the inventory will only slightly increase compared to the third quarter  So  we re not changed significantly in the fourth quarter  That s our current expectation  But then  again  nothing is definite now  I cannot say that for definite  but that s generally our view 
Kenji Yasui    UBS Securities Japan Co   Ltd     Analyst
Well  if you may add this  the output basis  what is your plan for January March period 
Hiroki Totoki    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer
The output or the shipment 
Kenji Yasui    UBS Securities Japan Co   Ltd     Analyst
I think you gave us data output based on production capacity 100 000 for the first quarter  That s you re talking about capacity 
Hiroki Totoki    Senior Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer
Well  it s still base an input and output  there are three elements  capacity is already installed  input is what you are putting  output is the result of that input  The shipment is not included in this  So the point of your question is  again  will January March wafer shipment the production  What will be the amount  So we do not disclose output numbers  but the lead time is between five and six months  So  use that as a basis of calculation

111921,333436,SNE,Sony s Image Sensor Business Sparkles in the Third Quarter,news,"Sony  NYSE SNE  recently posted its third quarter earnings report  The Japanese conglomerate s revenue grew 3  annually to 2 46 trillion yen   22 6 billion   while its adjusted net income rose 37  to 58 3 billion yen   530 million  
Its GAAP net income    which factors in the consolidation of EMI Music  the public listing of SRE Holdings  the transfer of its shares in NSF Engagement  pension charges  and various tax adjustments    fell 46  to 229 5 billion yen   2 1 billion  
Sony s numbers topped estimates on both the top and bottom lines  but does the stock deserve to go higher after rallying more than 50  over the past 12 months  Let s dig deeper into the company s strengths and weaknesses to decide 

Sony s two core growth engines remain strong
Sony s two strongest businesses over the past year were its image and sensing solutions  I SS  unit and Sony Music  which also includes its anime and mobile games unit Aniplex 
Its I SS revenue rose 29  annually and accounted for 12  of Sony s top line  Its operating profit jumped 62  and accounted for 25  of its operating income 

The I SS unit produces image sensors for about half the world s smartphone makers  The smartphone market remains sluggish  but demand for Sony s image sensors is surging as OEMs install higher quality cameras or multi camera setups in their phones  The unit s growth enables Sony to profit from the growth of the smartphone market even as its own Xperia phones control less than 1  of the market 
Sony raised its full year guidance for the I SS unit back in October and did so again in its latest report  It boosted the unit s full year revenue guidance from 18  to 24  growth and lifted its operating profit forecast from 39  to 60  growth  Those rosy estimates indicate that the I SS unit will remain Sony s core growth engine for the foreseeable future 
Sony Music s revenue rose 4  and accounted for 9  of its top line  The unit benefited from higher streaming revenue  but lower revenue from Aniplex s Fate Grand Order    the highest grossing mobile game of 2019    offset some of those gains 
The unit s operating profit fell 75  and only accounted for 12  of Sony s operating income  but the decline was largely expected  and attributed to its consolidation of EMI  It left the unit s full year forecast unchanged  with a 5  growth in revenue and a 40  decline in operating profits 
Pictures and consumer electronics remain sluggish
Sony Pictures  which produces the company s films and TV shows  struggled as it faced tough comparisons to last year s release of Venom  It also generated lower TV and home entertainment licensing revenue 
The unit s revenue  which accounted for 10  of Sony s top line  fell 15   Its operating profit tumbled 53  but accounted for less than 2  of Sony s operating income  Sony expects the unit s revenue and operating income to rise 4  and 28   respectively  for the year  unchanged from its prior forecast 
The electronic products and solutions  EP S  unit also remained weak due to poor sales of TVs and smartphones  Sony faces intense competition in both markets from Samsung and cheaper Chinese competitors 
The unit s revenue fell 9  and accounted for 26  of its top line  However  its operating profit    which accounted for 27  of Sony s operating income    rose 21  as it aggressively cut costs at its struggling mobile division  Sony lowered the unit s full year revenue forecast from a 9  decline to an 11  decline  but it maintained its operating profit forecast for 45  growth    which suggests that it will continue to cut costs to hit that target 
The gaming unit approaches a cyclical trough
Expectations were low for Sony s game and network services  G NS  unit since many gamers are postponing their purchases ahead of the PS5 s arrival at the end of the year  That s why it wasn t surprising when the unit s revenue  which accounted for 26  of Sony s top line  fell 20   Its operating profit  which accounted for 18  of Sony s operating income  tumbled 27  
Sony attributed those declines to lower hardware and software sales  It expects the unit s revenue and operating income to decline 16  and 24   respectively  compared to its prior expectations for 13  and 23  declines in revenue and operating profits  respectively 
On the bright side  the G NS unit could be poised for a strong recovery when the PS5 launches during the holidays  That launch  along with the strength of Sony s I SS unit  could offset its other weaknesses in fiscal 2020 and beyond 
The key takeaways
Sony s massive business can be tough to read  but its strengths still outweigh its weaknesses  The growth of its I SS business should offset the softer growth of its electronics and pictures businesses  and help the company tread water until the PS5 launch restarts the gaming unit as its core growth engine 
Analysts expect Sony s revenue and earnings to rise 4  and 7   respectively  next year  as its growth evens out again  Those are solid growth rates for a stock that trades at 16 times forward earnings  and indicate that the stock could still have plenty of room to run this year ",2020-02-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqyxb,2075626
111956,333471,SNE,What the Release of PlayStation 5 Will Mean for Sony Stock,news,"Video game fans have known it was coming for a while  But there s something about confirmation that makes the matter palpable 
Consumer technology and entertainment icon Sony  NYSE SNE  will release its next iteration of the PlayStation  the PlayStation 5  late this year  A  supposed  leaked picture of the console only further whets gamers  appetites 
For investors  however  prospects for the PS5 may mean little  The company s movie division has been hit or miss  its music arm has finally figured out how to thrive in the streaming era  and its tech component business is all the rage 
The company s even teasing drivers with an electric concept car    which could prove distracting before it proves profitable  should the company move forward with it  Gaming consoles could easily get lost in the shuffle  with its fiscal effects buried by everything else 
Don t jump to the wrong conclusion  though  Despite all Sony s got going on  gaming remains one of its biggest businesses  and the PlayStation 5 s predecessor carried a lot of weight for a surprisingly long time 

The gaming business is less cyclical  almost a staple
The first PS4 was released in November 2013 and marked a major leap from the PlayStation 3 s capabilities 
Just a few days later  the Xbox One from Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  debuted  Both would compete  albeit indirectly  with the Wii U from Nintendo  OTC NTDOY  released a year earlier to create what should have been a short lived buying frenzy  followed by a price war    after full price payers made their purchase 
That s not how things panned out though  Sales of the PlayStation didn t peak until 2016  Granted  it had help that year  with the PS4 Slim as well as the PS4 Pro both launching in 2016 
Still  given that the PS3 and the PS4 were both available in 2013  one would have expected sales to surge that year and then taper off  Likewise  given the virtual reality capabilities of the PS4 Pro  one might have also expected sales of the console to at least hold steady between 2017 and 2019 as the VR industry matures  But  nope 

Microsoft s Xbox followed the same path  by the way  It peaked in 2016 with the release of the Xbox One S that    like the PS4 Pro    didn t drive the sustained growth its less powerful predecessor did  Yet  the Xbox One did drive sales tempered growth for years after its initial 2013 launch 
The big takeaway for investors  Updates and technological improvements of consoles don t necessarily help grow sales for long  But  a manufacturer can grow a brand new  significantly superior gaming platform s revenue for several years following a launch 
Impact on Sony s results
And that s very good news for Sony  which already does more    and more sustained    business on the back of its PlayStation franchise than most investors might guess 
Sony s consoles and their corresponding games consistently account for about one fourth of the company s top line  That figure is growing too 

Ditto for the impact of video gaming on Sony s operating income  For the quarter ending in September  it fell back to 21 4   but as the graphic shows  games and consoles can mean upwards of 25  of Sony s bottom line  That number was in the teens for years after the PS4 was released 

Worth the wait for Sony
None of this is to guarantee the PlayStation 5 will extend these existing trends  Other business units could accelerate their relative growth  which isn t a bad problem to have   or video gaming could level out for Sony  rather than continue to expand 
Perhaps Microsoft s next Xbox will lead to the dethroning of the PlayStation as the best selling console franchise of all time  The Nintendo Switch is still growing unit sales too  which may have already peeled off some of Sony s prospective PS5 buyers  Never even mind that PC gaming is growing again 
A lackluster response to the PS5 just isn t the plausible outcome from here  however  The tide is still rising  PWC foresees 5  annual growth in video gaming revenue through 2023 
Meanwhile  Ace Research Institute analyst Hideki Yasuda anticipates that 21 million PlayStation 5 consoles will sell by early 2022  Best of all  given that the earliest PlayStation 4 consoles are now seven years old and have been made nearly obsolete by technological advancements  the number of gamers itching for an upgrade may be even greater 
Critics will point out it s still only a fraction of the more than 100 million PlayStation 4 consoles sold  in total  through late last year  Don t sweat it  Again  history has shown new console uptake to be a slow  smoldering burn  with PS4 sales not peaking until four years after its initial launch  This version could yield a similar result  with the earliest PS4 s not turning a full decade old until after the timeframe Yasuda is considering 
Whatever s to come  given all the new ways Sony has proven it can monetize gaming platforms  game downloads  subscriptions  etc   as well as grow its already significant profitability for years rather than months  the impending launch of the PlayStation 5 is nothing for investors to shrug off ",2020-01-24,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmek0,2067113
111957,333472,SNE,Sony  Not Tencent  Owns the Highest Grossing Mobile Game of 2019,news,"Sony  NYSE SNE  and Tencent  OTC TCEHY  are the two largest video game companies in the world by annual revenue  Sony generates most of its revenue from PS4 consoles and games  while Tencent makes most of its money from mobile games 
That s why it was surprising when App Annie s annual  State of Mobile  report revealed that Sony s Fate Grand Order was the highest grossing mobile game of 2019  marking the second straight year it beat Tencent s Honor of Kings  Let s take a closer look at Fate Grand Order to see how it complements Sony s other businesses 

A brief history of Fate Grand Order
Sony Music s subsidiary Aniplex mainly publishes music and anime series  It eventually diversified into mobile games and launched Fate Grand Order in 2015  The game was a mobile expansion of Type Moon s Fate Stay Night  a visual novel franchise launched on Windows PCs in 2004 
Prior to Aniplex s launch of Fate Grand Order  the Fate franchise had already expanded to console games  comics  anime  novels  spin off series  and toys  Those products gave Fate Grand Order a massive audience  especially across Asia  when it launched on iOS and Android devices 
Fate Grand Order is a free to play RPG which encourages players to collect  servants  to fight their battles  Servants can be bought with  Saint Quartz   an in game currency which can either be earned or purchased with real money  The game is particularly popular in Japan  South Korea  and China 
Aniplex publishes the game in Japan and North America  Netmarble handles the game in South Korea  and Bilibili  NASDAQ BILI  publishes the Chinese version  Sega of Japan also launched an arcade version in 2018  Fate Grand Order notably generates the lion s share of Biibili s gaming revenue  which accounted for over half of its top line last quarter 

What does Fate Grand Order mean for Sony 
Aniplex is a subsidiary of Sony Music  so Fate Grand Order s revenue feeds its music business instead of the game and network services  G NS  division  which houses its PlayStation consoles  games  and services 
Sony Music s revenue grew 18  annually to 421 5 billion yen   3 85 billion   or 11  of its top line  in the first half of fiscal 2019  The unit s operating income grew 19  to 75 8 yen   690 million   or 15  of Sony s operating profits 
The growth of that division  along with Sony s growing image sensor business  offset the softer growth of its consumer electronics and PlayStation gaming divisions in recent quarters  For the full year  Sony expects Sony Music s revenue to rise 5  to 850 billion yen   7 8 billion   but for its consolidation of EMI Music to reduce its operating profit by 40  to 140 billion yen   1 3 billion  
Sony splits its Music unit into the Music Publishing  Recorded Music  and Visual Media and Platform divisions  Aniplex s business is included in the Visual Media and Platform segment  which generated 28  of the Music division s revenue  or 3  of Sony s total revenue  in the first half of the year  Sony doesn t break down its Visual Media and Platform s revenue by games  anime series  or other media content  but most of its business likely comes from Fate Grand Order 
Is Fate Grand Order losing momentum 
Fate Grand Order is a major growth engine for Sony Music  but it could be losing its momentum as it approaches its fifth anniversary  Sony already stated that its Visual Media and Platform business generated lower sales in the second quarter   primarily due to lower sales for Fate Grand Order   but noted that the growth of its music publishing and streaming revenue offset that decline 
Aniplex also recently announced a new anime series based on Fate Grand Order  which suggests that it s trying to revive interest in the aging game  Fate Grand Order s slowdown might marginally impact Sony  but it could be more meaningful to publishers like Netmarble and Bilibili 
The key takeaways
Fate Grand Order s success indicates that Aniplex could launch more Fate games to expand its mobile gaming business  That growth could complement Sony s larger PlayStation business  pull more licensing revenue from partners like Bilibili  and nurture the franchise s growth across other media platforms ",2020-01-25,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmu1v,2067789

AMD S stock has been on this roll over the past two years largely due to expectations that it would challenge dominant Intel Corp

                                         do  Analysts are obviously frustrated  Before the call even started  Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers wrote in a note that  AMD needs to provide investors with greater revenue transparency   i e   more quantifiable details on server and data center GPU results     Our business is reported in two segments  with one around the PC business  Computing and Graphics  and non PC business  Enterprise  Embedded  and Semi Custom    an AMD spokesman said in a statement   We do not separately report the businesses below the segment level but we do try to provide color commentary and data to help investors best understand our business drivers   If AMD wants to continue to be thought of as a PC company  that s fine  But if it wants to be known as a server data center provider  it needs to break out that revenue separately for investors  Otherwise  it may be increasingly difficult to view AMD as a serious contender in that market

111989,333504,SNE,Sony Teases a Big Expansion Into Electric Vehicles With a Concept Car,news,"Sony  NYSE SNE  recently stunned attendees at CES 2020 by unveiling an electric concept car called the Vision S  The prototype car looks sleek  but Sony isn t entering the EV market to compete against Tesla or NIO    it merely manufactured the car as a showcase for its other technologies  Let s see how those technologies could shape Sony s future 
The future of its I SS business
Sony s image and sensing solutions  I SS  unit has been its core growth engine over the past year  It generates most of its revenue by selling image sensors to smartphone makers  and sales have been surging on the rise of multi camera phones 
Sony s I SS revenue rose 19  annually to 541 4 billion yen   5 billion   or 13  of its top line  in the first half of fiscal 2019  Its operating profit soared 63  to 125 9 billion yen   1 2 billion   accounting for a quarter of Sony s operating profits 

Sony s I SS unit already supplies image sensors to roughly half the smartphone market  With the Vision S  it demonstrates that the business also has a bright future in connected and driverless vehicles 
The Vision S features 33 sensors embedded throughout the vehicle s interior and exterior  Time of Flight  ToF  camera sensors detect and recognize passengers in the cabin and measure their distance relative to the nearest digital screens  External CMOS image sensors track vehicles and pedestrians near the car 
Sony s sales of image sensors to smartphone makers may eventually decelerate  but the growth of connected and driverless cars    which require a massive amount of cameras    should easily pick up the slack 
The future of its electronic products and solutions business
The dashboard of the Vision S is a wide edge to edge digital screen  and its rear seats are also equipped with digital screens  All four seats sport headrest speakers  which are equipped with  360 Reality Audio     which Sony calls a  deep and immersive experience  that will  encapsulate passengers in sound  
Those devices suggest that Sony s electronic products and solutions  EP S  segment  which sells digital cameras  medical equipment  smartphones  TVs  and audio devices  could have a bright future beyond consumer electronics  It also mirrors Samsung s  OTC  SSNLF  moves into connected cars after its takeover of audio device maker HARMAN in 2016  Samsung and HARMAN notably unveiled a concept car at CES in 2018 

But for now  Sony s EP S unit is struggling  Its revenue fell 13  annually to 977 4 billion yen   8 9 billion   or 24  of its top line  in the first half of 2019  Sony mainly blamed the decline on sluggish sales of its smartphones and TVs    two saturated markets that are dominated by Samsung 
However  the unit s operating profit rose 35  to 66 5 million yen   600 million   or 13  of its operating income  as Sony cut costs across its product lines and restructured its struggling mobile unit 
But does Sony have a future as an auto supplier 
Sony s Vision S indicates that the Japanese tech giant could benefit from the growth of connected and driverless cars  However  plenty of other companies have similar ideas 
NVIDIA s  NASDAQ NVDA  DRIVE AutoPilot and Qualcomm s  NASDAQ QCOM  Snapdragon Ride are both bundled cockpit solutions for Level 2   semi autonomous  driving  Intel s  NASDAQ INTC  Mobileye already provides advanced driver assistance systems  ADAS  to about 90  of leading automakers  and a mix of Intel s chips powers Alphabet s Waymo vehicles 
Sony probably won t compete against those tech giants with end to end cockpit solutions  but it can aggressively market its image sensors  screens  and audio devices to those companies  In fact  NVIDIA  Qualcomm  and other companies all contributed to the development of the Vision S    so investors should see these companies as Sony s potential allies instead of adversaries in the automotive market ",2020-01-15,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pidrr,2060115

112006,333521,SNE,4 Reasons Sony s Stock Could Head Higher in 2020,news,"Sony s  NYSE SNE  stock surged 40  to its highest level in nearly two decades in 2019 as the growth of its image sensor business offset the softness of its gaming and consumer electronics divisions  Investors might be itching to take profits after that historic rally  but I believe the stock could still head higher in 2020  for four simple reasons 
1  Surging demand for image sensors
Sony s imaging and sensing solutions  I SS  unit supplies image sensors for roughly half of all smartphone makers worldwide  including Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Samsung  and Huawei 
Smartphone shipments have declined annually since 2017  according to IDC  However  that market saturation prompted smartphone makers to aggressively upgrade their cameras and launch multi camera devices  New features like facial recognition and augmented reality also require multiple cameras 

That paradigm shift caused orders for Sony s image sensors to surge even as smartphone shipments remained sluggish  In the first half of fiscal 2019  Sony s I SS revenue grew 19  annually  making it the company s fastest growing unit  Its operating profit grew 63  and accounted for a quarter of Sony s operating income 
Sony expects the unit s revenue and operating income to grow 18  and 39   respectively  in fiscal 2019  which ends on March 31  Sony s I SS chief Terushi Shimizu recently told Bloomberg that the unit still  can t make enough  image sensors to meet market demand even as it runs its manufacturing plant 24 hours a day    which suggests that it will continue to be Sony s core growth engine throughout 2020 
2  A strong music business
Sony Music  one of the three largest record labels in the world  generated 10  of Sony s revenue and 15  of its operating profits in the first half of 2019  Its revenue rose 9  annually during that period  thanks to its consolidation of EMI and higher revenue from streaming platforms  Its operating profit grew by 19  
Sony expects the unit s revenue to rise 5  in fiscal 2019  and for its operating profit to decline 40   mainly due to expenses related to its consolidation of EMI in late 2018  But looking ahead  Sony Music should generate stronger growth in 2020 on the back of popular streaming music platforms 
The music streaming market could grow at a compound annual growth rate of 16  between 2019 and 2023  according to TechNavio  which indicates that Sony Music will remain a stable growth engine for the foreseeable future 
3  The upcoming launch of the PS5
Sony s gaming and network services  G NS  unit was its core growth engine in previous years  but its growth sputtered out in 2019 as the aging PS4 console matured 
The unit s revenue declined 11  annually in the first half of 2019 and accounted for 23  of its top line  Its operating profit fell 20  but still accounted for 27  of Sony s operating income  Sony expects its gaming revenue and operating profits to decline by 13  and 23   respectively  for the full year 

Those forecasts are bleak  but the growth of Sony s I SS and Music units should help it tread water throughout the rest of 2019 and the first half of 2020  However  the unit should receive a big boost in the second half of fiscal 2020 when its eagerly anticipated PS5 hits the market 
Sony hasn t officially revealed the PS5 yet  but it s expected to be a significantly more powerful console that will be able to go toe to toe against Microsoft s  NASDAQ MSFT  Xbox Series X during the holidays  Both companies are counting on their next gen consoles to reboot their sluggish gaming businesses 
Sony already shipped over 100 million PS4s over the past six years  making it the world s top console maker and one of its top game publishers  This gives Sony an edge against Microsoft  and a warm reception for the PS5 at the end of the year could propel its stock to fresh highs by 2021 
4  A reasonable valuation and room for dividend hikes
Analysts currently expect Sony s revenue and earnings to grow 2  and 4   respectively  next year  Those growth rates seem tepid  but they indicate that Sony s strengths will continue to outweigh its weaknesses 
Sony s stock still trades at a reasonable 17 times forward earnings  which indicates that it still has plenty of room to run before it overheats  It could also attract more investors if it raises its dividend yield of 0 5   which used up just 5  of its free cash flow over the past five years 
The key takeaway
At first glance  Sony might seem like a slow growth investment with too many moving parts  However  this 73 year old company still has a surprising number of irons in the fire  and its evolving business could lift the stock even higher this year ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfezi,2054925

the Wireless Segment  Shaw Communications added 57 900 net RGUs  While the company added 66 900 post paid subscribers  it lost 9 000 pre paid customers Post paid addition reflected continued demand for the Big Gig data centric and Absolute Zero pricing and packaging options  However  a higher churn rate due to stiff competition negatively impacted the pre paid subscriber base Post paid churn of 1 50  in the reported quarter was higher than 1 28  in the year ago quarter Notably  the company now serves approximately 18 million people  almost half of the Canadian population  Moreover  Freedom Mobile s total wireless customer base increased to more than 1 7 million customers The company s wireless service is now available in more than 700 locations  courtesy of partnerships with retailers

with  1 44 billion as of Aug 31  2019 Cash decreased primarily due to the repayment of  1 25 billion of senior notes and other financing activities as well as cash outlays for investments Further  the

year  However  the company continued to spend on the deployment of 700 MHz spectrum and expansion of the wireless network into new markets Free cash flow was  183 million compared with  163 million in

pushing the company in the red  net loss  Net Profit Margin  Net profit Sales   100 In simple terms  net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs  interest  depreciation  taxes

essential for rewarding stakeholders  Further  strength in the metric not only attracts investors but also draws well skilled employees that eventually add to the value of the business Moreover  a higher net profit margin compared to its peers gives the company a competitive edge Pros and ConsNet profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company s business model in terms of pricing policy

112032,333547,SNE,The Week Ahead  Virus Saga Continues  Iowa Caucuses Are Here  RBA To Deliver,opinion,"The primary driver for financial markets remains the coronavirus and its potential impact on the global economy   It is still too early to forecast the peak of the virus or even the impact it will have on the Chinese economy   The virus was spreading for a month before containment efforts were in place and most cases were mild   If the virus continues to spread at a rapid rate  we might see Chinese businesses lose confidence in having their employees return to work around Feb 10th   If China gets a big hit to GDP  we will see all their major trading partners suffer   We should not be surprised if they are unable to deliver on their promises with the phase one trade deal   The risks to the global outlook are growing and we could still see the strong demand for US Treasuries help keep the dollar bid 

In addition to all the incremental virus updates  it will be an extremely busy week with rate decisions  voters in Iowa hit the polls in the first contest for the Democratic nomination and the US employment report which is expected to show the economy is not weak  but nowhere near overheating 
Robust Start To US Earnings SeasonEarnings season has been pretty robust  but the focus remains stuck on the coronavirus and its impact on the global economy   US Treasury yields will continue to freefall if the coronavirus impact intensifies   The dollar will likely see safe haven flows if the 10 year breaks the record low of 1 32    US stocks could remain vulnerable as Asia reopens 

Next week  Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU   Sony  NYSE SNE   Cigna  NYSE CI   BP  LON BP   Total  NYSE TOT   Disney  NYSE DIS   and General Motors  NYSE GM  report results and they may struggle to replicate the strong results we just saw from Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  
US Politics Center Stage
The Iowa Caucus is here and Former Vice President Joe Biden  the front runner looks to derail Vermont Senator Bernie Sander s recent momentum  The Democrats look to get closer in narrowing down the field and if we see Buttigieg or Warren deliver lackluster results we could learn quickly if Sanders can win over Warren s supporters 
President Trump will also deliver his State of the Union address to a joint session in Congress   This however is likely to be more of a campaign event than the announcement of anything new 
UK Exits EUThe UK is finally leaving the European Union which means the topic of conversation can finally change from if to how  Trade discussions will now begin with the EU  something that should be less interesting and controversial for the UK public  Instead the last few weeks  the Bank of England has been the main topic of conversation with the odds of a rate cut having spiked  The central bank refrained from doing so this week and even indicated that the next move could be higher  rather than lower  just not likely soon  The pace of tightening is also now likely to be slower than previously anticipated  Of course  a lot could change over the coming months as we get more reliable data  The surveys have been better but the hard data needs to confirm or policy makers may be tempted to dip into the tool kit 
Russia  Rate Cut The Central Bank of Russia meets next week as policy makers look to solve the conundrum of why inflation has slipped below target and is continuing to trend lower even as it cuts interest rates  Another rate cut looks on the cards for the central bank as it looks to jump start the economy and hit its inflation target  two things that are currently eluding it  The economy may have other issues that  as with the rest of the world  could be resolved with more central government action but policy makers have plenty of room to lend a hand  At 6 25   easing are efforts may be far from done but the recent cuts have been incremental and that looks likely to continue 
Mexico Inflation Data
 
In addition to tracking the weakness that is emerging markets  investors will pay close attention to Mexico s release of January inflation data   If we don t see a strong rebound with prices  we could see calls for another rate cut to grow for the Banxico 
Virus Dominates Headlines In ChinaThe only game in town is the spread of the coronavirus in China and beyond  The number of virus related cases has now surpassed the total during the SARS epidemic in 2002 03  though fatalities remain low in comparison  The incubation period for the virus is estimated at 14 days  so the numbers are likely to continue to get worse until the 14 days of the first  lockdown  of cities in China  That should be the middle of next week  Any reports of virus related deaths outside of China would be a severe hit for risk appetite 
Data has taken a back seat with the Wuhan virus grabbing the headlines  Next week s data releases include the Caixin PMIs for both the manufacturing and services sectors  both seen little changed from the previous month  and the trade data for January  January included the Lunar New Year celebrations  so the risk is the headlines will look far worse than December s solid numbers  Generally the market aggregates the January and February numbers to remove the distortions of the Lunar New Year break  A better than forecast number would be a positive for risk appetite 
Risk
The severity of the escalation in the spread and death toll from the Wuhan virus would hurt risk appetite  pressuring equities to the benefit of the usual safe havens of gold  the yen  the US dollar and US Treasuries  It would be negative for oil and industrial metals  
Hong KongProtests have died down though Carrie Lam is facing the same predicament one of her predecessors had in 2002 03  At that time  the leader faced opposition to China backed national security legislation just as the SARS epidemic hit  Tung Chee hwa resigned a few weeks later  Current leader Carrie Lam has already faced opposition to her plans to turn a newly built housing estate into a quarantine facility as protesters set fir to the lobby area 
Risk
The severity of any protests remains the risk driver  with any escalation and violence a negative for the HK33 index and could push USD HKD back to the upper half of the trading band  A single death in the SAR would intensify pressure for Carrie Lam to resign 
IndiaThe Indian central bank is likely to leave its benchmark rate unchanged at Thursday s meeting  This would be the second meeting in a row the Bank stands pat after five consecutive cuts in a row during the 2018 2019 period  India reported Thursday its first case of the coronavirus infection 
Risk
A surprise rate cut would push USD INR higher but may benefit equities  More coronavirus reports would hurt sentiment  
AustraliaThis week s data has forced local banks to push back RBA rate cut expectations to the middle of the year  though this has not helped the Aussie amid the current risk off environment  Tuesday s meeting is expected to keep benchmark rates unchanged with a forward guidance that refers to the spreading coronavirus 
Risk
A surprise cut or a very dovish accompanying statement would be negative for the AUD  We may get a reference to the economic impact of the bushfires in New South Wales and Victoria states 
New ZealandQuarterly unemployment data is not expected to spring too many surprises  with estimates suggesting a slight improvement in Q4  The Kiwi dollar continues to be impacted by the risk off theme across global markets 
Risk
Nothing particular to influence apart from global themes 
JapanNothing of note for this week
Risk
Not really applicable   the stronger yen on the back of safe haven flows is not expected to influence the economy too much 
MarketsOil
After the biggest monthly drop in several months  OPEC   will look to see if they can do anything to prevent prices from collapsing any further   Oil will have trouble stabilizing unless we see positive news on the virus front or if we see a significant amount of supply removed   If OPEC delivers another 500k barrels per day of cuts  that could help stabilize prices 
Gold 
It seems gold prices are on the verge of ripping higher   The impact of the coronavirus on the global economy is unknown and it seems many investors may have been too optimistic   Gold has been capped the  1 600 an ounce level  but if we see severe weakness when Asia returns to the market  we could easily prices target the  1 650 area 
  0 Bitcoin  Bitcoin remains stuck near the upper boundaries of its 5 month range   Positive steps on attracting mainstream commerce and as regulatory concerns take a backseat in the news cycle have helped Bitcoin rally above  9 000   It will be difficult to break the  10 000 mark  but if it does we could see crypto enthusiasts return strongly

billion compared with  73 1 billion in the prior year quarter Sales at Music grew 3 6  to  216 9 billion led by higher sales for Music Publishing resulting from the consolidation of EMI  and higher sales for Recorded Music attributable to an increase in streaming revenues  The unit s operating income was  36 3 billion  which declined from  147 1 billion in the prior year quarter  due to a remeasurement gain of  116 9 billion resulting from the consolidation of EMI in third quarter fiscal 2018 Sales from Pictures decreased 14 7  to  236 billion due to lower revenues for Motion Pictures

s potential returns by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples  At the same time  it s important to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers  or the appropriate benchmark If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors  then it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative  However  those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance to provide considerable returns Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid

112150,333665,SNE,Should Value Investors Now Choose Sony Corporation  SNE  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Sony Corporation   NYSE SNE   stock into this equation and findout if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Sony Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 31  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 09  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Sony Corporation s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 13 54 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands significantly below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  Moreover  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Basic Materials Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 24 27  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Sony Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 16 79  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Sony Corporation has a P S ratio of about 1 11  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 48 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Sony Corporation currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Sony Corporation a solid choice for value investors For example  Sony Corporation s P CF comes in at 7 27  which is better than the industry average of 11 63  Clearly  SNE is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Sony Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and Momentum Score of B  This gives SNE a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current year has seen three upward revision in the past sixty days compared to no downward revision  while the full year 2020 estimate has also seen three upward revision compared to no downward revisions in the same time period The current year consensus estimate increased 8 6  in the past two months  whereas the full year 2020 estimate rose 9 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Sony Corporation Price and Consensus   Notably  the stock with a solid earnings surprise history and long term EPS growth rate of 7 70  has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which is why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineSony Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  the favorable estimate trend indicates that the broader factors are favorable for the company So  value investors might want to delve deeper in this stock as it appears to be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  24 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  77 6 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2019-12-23,Zacks Investment

sharp rebound as the one again off again  Phase One  deal seemed to back on track  After the decline  which was triggered by President Trump s remarks that there was no specific deadline for the ongoing trade negotiations  the markets rebounded as media reports confirmed that the partial trade accord was around the corner  However  intense volatility  which has been the hallmark of the stock market in recent times due to the fluid nature of the prolonged negotiation process  continues to keep investors on edge As investors employ a wait and see approach in a classic example of  backing and filling  in the market  they can benefit from  cash cow  stocks that garner higher returns However  singling out cash rich stocks alone do not make for a solid investment proposition unless these are backed by attractive efficiency ratios  like return on equity  ROE    A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return ROE  A Key MetricROE   Net Income Shareholders  EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher  the better  It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Parameters used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we have added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow lesser than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for  1 of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  The higher the ROA  the better it is for

112283,333798,SNE,Top 3 ROE Stocks To Profit As Earnings Season Heats Up,opinion,The U S  equity markets are widely anticipated to trade near all time highs with expectations of solid quarterly results across the board as the earnings season gets heated up  With the Sino U S  trade relations nearing a historic deal to ease the tensions related to tariff war  the overall sentiments appear bullish  However  a slowdown in China is likely to be a dampener of sorts  hindering the smooth sail of the equity markets in general As investors employ a wait and see approach in a classic example of  backing and filling  in the market  they can benefit from  cash cow  stocks that garner higher returns However  singling out cash rich stocks alone do not make for a solid investment proposition unless these are backed by attractive efficiency ratios  like return on equity  ROE    A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return Why ROE ROE   Net Income Shareholders  EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher  the better  It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we have added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow lesser than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for  1 of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  The higher the ROA  the better it is for the company 5

112322,333837,SNE,Snap shares plummet as investors mark down first earnings report,news,"By Anya George Tharakan and David Ingram
 Reuters     Snap Inc   NYSE SNAP  shares plunged on Wednesday after the owner of Snapchat reported slowing user growth and revenue in its first earnings report as a public company  missing some Wall Street estimates as it competes with copycat messaging apps 
Shares tumbled 23 percent in after hours trading to wipe some  6 billion from Snap s market value  a reversal for the company after a red hot March initial public offering that was the biggest for a U S  tech company since Facebook  NASDAQ FB  Inc s 2012 debut 
The stock fell to  17 66  just above its IPO price of  17 
Some investors were hoping Snap would surprise them with big numbers in its first quarterly report  BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said 
 The fact that they failed to live up to expectations  let alone exceed them  disappointed people   he said 
The performance echoed slides in Facebook and Twitter after they posted debut scorecards following their IPOs  Twitter shares cratered 24 percent the next day  while Facebook s tumbled 11 percent  still the biggest ever one day losses for both 
Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel sought to reassure investors during an earnings call  fielding a dozen questions that ranged from strategy to how it would deal with competitors 
He also did not shy away from one query that allowed him to take a feisty jab at Facebook 
 If you want to be a creative company  you ve got to get comfortable with and enjoy the fact that people are going to copy your product if you make great stuff   he said 
Making a comparison to the search industry  Spiegel added   Just because Yahoo  NASDAQ YHOO  has a search box doesn t mean they re Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   
Snap said its daily active users  DAUs  rose 36 1 percent to 166 million in the first quarter from a year earlier  marking a slowdown from the 47 7 percent rise for the fourth quarter and 62 8 percent jump for the third quarter that the company reported in its IPO filing 
The slowing rate of growth was in line with an estimate from JPMorgan  NYSE JPM   which accurately expected 166 million DAUs for the first quarter  Monness  Crespi  Hardt   Co Inc had pegged them even higher at 173 million 
Snap s March IPO priced above the company s target range as investors put aside concerns about a lack of profits and voting rights to get a piece of the action  The IPO raised  3 4 billion and gave the company a market valuation of roughly  24 billion  and shares surged 44 percent in their first day of trading 
Facebook  which made a  3 billion bid for Snapchat in 2013  has upped the ante by offering camera related features similar to Snap on its platforms  including Instagram and WhatsApp  The company said in April that Instagram Stories alone had reached 200 million daily active users 
Snapchat s growth was faster than Facebook  however  which said its overall daily user base grew 18 percent year over year in the first quarter  as well as Twitter  which reported growth of 14 percent in DAUs from a year earlier 
REVENUE DISAPPOINTMENT
Like many other Silicon Valley businesses  Snap is closely tied to its young founders 
Spiegel  who received a stock based bonus worth nearly  600 million for taking the company public  is 26  and co founder and Chief Technology Officer Bobby Murphy is 28  The company  though  has brought on others with more experience  including Chairman Michael Lynton  former chief executive of Sony Corp  T 6758  s movie and music businesses 
A lot is riding on Spiegel to build products that delight people  said analyst Greenfield   The future of Snapchat is on Evan Spiegel and his team to out innovate everyone else  Time will tell whether that s possible   he added 
Snap s revenue jumped nearly four fold year over year to  149 6 million but fell short of the average analyst forecast of  158 million  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S  Revenue was also down from the fourth quarter of 2016  a seasonally stronger period for ad sales  when it was  166 million 
Revenue was  a relatively disappointing number   Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser said   To their credit   he added   they did guide towards a number that would be lower  which it was  
Average revenue per user was 90 cents in the first quarter  Snap said  up from 33 cents the same quarter a year earlier but below the  1 05 per user in the fourth quarter of 2016 
Snap s net loss widened to  2 21 billion  or  2 31 per share  in the first quarter  from  104 6 million  or 14 cents per share  due to stock based compensation related to the IPO 
Although the figure of  2 billion in total stock based compensation was known ahead of time  investors were surprised to see all of it show up in a single quarter rather than spread out over time  said Eric Kim  managing partner at Goodwater Capital 
 It is an eye popping number for sure   he said 
Snapchat launched in 2012 as a mobile app that allows users to send photos  known as snaps  that vanish within seconds  The company rebranded as Snap Inc last year  and moved into the hardware space with Spectacles  its colorful sunglasses that record short videos to post on Snapchat 
Users created more than 3 billion snaps daily on average during the first quarter  up from more than 2 5 billion during the third quarter of 2016  the company said 
Snap receives some revenue from branded or sponsored filters and lenses  but depends on advertising dollars for the bulk of its overall revenue 
Digital marketing firm eMarketer in March had trimmed its 2017 U S  advertising revenue forecast for Snap by  30 million to  770 million  citing higher than expected revenue sharing with the company s partners 
The total U S  digital advertising market is meanwhile expected to reach  83 billion  according to eMarketer  up nearly 16 percent from last year ",2017-05-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/snap-daily-users-rise-36.1-percent-in-first-report-after-ipo-482680,482680

112408,333923,SNE,Facebook s virtual reality ambitions could be threatened by court order,news,"By Jan Wolfe  Reuters    Facebook  NASDAQ FB  Inc s big ambitions in the nascent virtual reality industry could be threatened by a court order that would prevent it from using critical software code another company claims to own  according to legal and industry experts  Last Thursday  video game publisher ZeniMax Media Inc asked a Dallas federal judge to issue an order barring Facebook unit Oculus from using or distributing the disputed code  part of the software development kit that Oculus provides to outside companies creating games for its Rift VR headset  A decision is likely a few months away  but intellectual property lawyers said ZeniMax has a decent chance of getting the order  which would mean Facebook faces a tough choice between paying a possibly hefty settlement or fighting on at risk of jeopardizing its position in the sector  For now  Facebook is fighting on  Oculus spokeswoman Tera Randall said last Thursday the company would challenge a  500 million jury verdict on Feb  1 against Oculus and its co founders Palmer Luckey and Brendan Iribe for infringing ZeniMax s copyrighted code and violating a non disclosure agreement  Randall said Oculus would possibly file an appeal that would  allow us to put this litigation behind us   She did not respond to a request for comment for this article  An injunction would require Oculus  which Facebook acquired for  3 billion in 2014  to stop distributing the code to developers or selling those games that use it  Such a court order  would put a huge stumbling block in front  of Oculus  said Stephanie Llamas  an analyst with gaming market research firm SuperData  It would offer the company s rivals in the new market  which include HTC  Sony Corp  T 6758   Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Inc and others an  important opportunity for them to become first movers   Sales of the Rift itself would not be barred  but Llamas  said a lack of available titles could hinder Facebook s offering relative to HTC s Vive headset and Sony s Playstation VR   That market is relatively small at the moment   sales of VR hardware and software totaled  2 7 billion in 2016   and mainly limited to gaming  But Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has predicted the technology  will become a part of daily life for billions of people   revolutionizing social media  entertainment and medicine  SuperData says the VR market will be worth  37 billion by 2020  Likewise  investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald last year issued a report predicting VR would account for 10 percent of Facebook revenue in four years  time   ZeniMax s lawsuit arose from 2012 correspondence between Luckey and famed video game developer John Carmack  creator of the Doom and Quake series and then a ZeniMax employee  Luckey signed a non disclosure agreement with ZeniMax covering his communications with Carmack   Carmack joined Oculus in 2013 as chief technology officer  ZeniMax sued in 2014  claiming Carmack s work while its employee was crucial to the Rift  At trial  Facebook said ZeniMax concocted its claims because of  sour grapes  over missing the VR trend   Zuckerberg testified that  the idea that Oculus products are based on someone else s technology is just wrong   The jury decided Oculus had not stolen trade secrets but had infringed ZeniMax s intellectual property  It also said Oculus breached the non disclosure agreement  IP lawyers said the judge would consider factors such as whether ZeniMax continues to be harmed and whether money is sufficient compensation   Edward Naughton  a Boston based copyright lawyer with Brown Rudnick  said ZeniMax has a strong argument because its technology continues to be used without its permission and the jury s verdict does not compensate for that   I think they have a pretty good shot here   Naughton said  Mitchell Shelowitz  a copyright lawyer in New York  noted that the non disclosure agreement explicitly stated ZeniMax would be entitled to an injunction in the event its terms were violated   Not all lawyers agree ZeniMax has the stronger position  Chicago based IP lawyer Joshua Rich said he thinks Facebook has a good chance to repel the injunction by arguing that ZeniMax is not being harmed by the sale of the Oculus products because it is not direct competitor   If Facebook can get past the injunction fight  the calculus could change  said Naughton  Facebook may believe it has strong arguments on appeal or  because it has so much cash on hand  it may hope to wear ZeniMax down to the point where it settles on favorable terms  
 Facebook has deep pockets   said Naughton   That allows them to put their opponent into litigation fatigue  ",2017-02-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/facebook's-virtual-reality-ambitions-could-be-threatened-by-court-order-462465,462465

Can Other Popular Franchises Aid Activision 
Activision s biggest problem is that it depends heavily on a handful of franchises namely Call of Duty  World of Warcraft  Overwatch and Kind Digital s Candy Crush that make up more than 70  of its revenues 
Although the release of Call of Duty  Black Ops 4 in fourth quarter 2018 aided Activision Publishing s revenues  the game s sales were lower than management s expectation in the second half of the quarter due to lower retail demand and pricing  Moreover  in game net bookings were low initially in the reported quarter 
Further  Blizzard witnessed a decline in monthly active users  MAU  due to underperformance of World of Warcraft  In game net booking for both Overwatch and Hearthstone declined sequentially 
Notably  declining bookings and MAUs are expected to drastically hurt Activision s financial performance  Activision is expected to face intensifying competition from the likes of Electronic Arts   NASDAQ EA   and Take Two Interactive   NASDAQ TTWO    which is expected to negatively impact growth in the near term

NEW YORK  Reuters    AT T  NYSE T  Inc s upcoming DirecTV Now online video service will cost  35 per month  including mobile streaming costs  and target viewers who shun pay television subscriptions  Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said on Tuesday 
The wireless company s streaming video service  which launches late next month  will have more than 100 channels  Stephenson said at the WSJ D Live conference in California 
AT T said on Saturday that it would buy  Time Warner  Inc  NYSE TWX  for  85 4 billion  as it looks to diversify its business into the media and entertainment market 
The Time Warner deal gives AT T control of cable TV channels HBO and CNN  film studio Warner Bros and other coveted media assets  Time Warner content will be incorporated into the upcoming video service  Stephenson said 
 Thirty five dollars  you don t find that for a hundred channels in the marketplace  with wireless streaming   Stephenson said

112490,334005,SNE,Sony bullish on sensors after quake causes quarterly profit to halve,news,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO  Reuters    Japan s Sony Corp  T 6758  on Tuesday said it remained bullish about the long term prospects of its cash cow imaging sensor business after earthquake damage to a major factory contributed to a 48 percent drop in quarterly profit 
Sony s imaging sensors for cameras and smartphones helped the electronics manufacturer emerge from years of restructuring during which it pulled out of low margin consumer goods to concentrate on entertainment  videogames and sensors 
But progress stalled when a series of earthquakes in April caused stoppages in sensor production  leaving the broader semiconductor division swinging to a second quarter loss  Sony said it took almost half a year for shipments to fully recover 
 Demand for  camera  sensors from smartphone manufacturers  including Chinese players  has been strong   said Chief Financial Officer Kenichiro Yoshida at an earnings briefing   We are also receiving many inquiries for the next year  
Sony earlier reported operating profit of 45 7 billion yen   436 million  for July September  just 1 2 percent shy of a Thomson Reuters Starmine SmartEstimate drawn from 10 analyst estimates 
Yoshida also said Sony was taking steps toward entering the automotive market as it seeks to reduce reliance on the volatile smartphone sector  One such step was automotive parts supplier Denso Corp deciding to adopt Sony sensors 
 It will take three to five years before shipments of automotive sensors begin in earnest   he said   But we are confident that we will be able to build a solid position in the market  
In videogames  Sony said profit fell 20 5 percent as income earned abroad was dulled by a strengthening yen 
But investors are betting on momentum in the gaming business to pick up toward the year end holiday shopping season with the launch this month of the PlayStation 4 Pro  an upgrade to its flagship console capable of rendering high definition graphics 
Sony is also widely expected to build an early lead in the fledgling virtual reality  VR  market  with a headset priced more modestly than those of rivals and compatible with the 40 million PlayStation 4 consoles it has sold to date 
Sony s earnings report came a day after the manufacturer lowered its full year profit forecast by 10 percent to 270 billion yen due mainly to an impairment charge brought about by the sale of its battery business 
A 0 7 percent decline in Sony s share price on Tuesday indicated investors were unfazed by the revision  as Sony had already flagged the impairment charge and maintained its sales outlook of 7 4 trillion yen

the Day  Red Cott Corp   NYSE COT   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on AVX Corporation   NYSE AVX    Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   and Advantest Corp    OTC ATEYY   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  The market has been coming strong off the Christmas Eve lows  Leading the way out of the gate  tech stocks have been surging  This has helped several stocks bounce off their 52 week lows  Once the darlings of the market  tech took a mighty tumble into the fall  This restoration of valuations recently could be enough to put tech stocks on center stage again  One such tech stock is today s Bull of the Day  Sony Sony Corporation designs  develops  produces  and sells electronic equipment  instruments  and devices for the consumer  professional  and industrial markets worldwide  The company offers network services related to games  videos  and music contents  and home and portable game consoles  packaged software  and peripheral devices  as well as broadcast professional  integrated circuit card technology  and medical and imaging device solutions  It also develops  produces  markets  and distributes recorded music  publishes music  and produces and distributes animation titles  game applications based on animation titles  and various services for music and visual products  Sony is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  in the Audio Video Production industry which ranks in the Top 14  of our Zacks Industry Rank  The reason for the favorable rank lies in the recent earnings estimate revisions to the upside coming from analysts  Current year EPS estimates have rocketed from  4 18 ninety days ago to  4 93  Next year s number has gone from  4 35 to  4 65 in the last week alone The stock had a great start last year  topping out over  60 before the market ran out of steam  The retrace under  50 has provided investors with a nice entry point  With estimates still moving to the upside  it could set up Sony for another run back to the 52 highs  That high sits up at  61 02  With the broad market coming so strong off the lows  investors are looking for opportunities  It may be tempting to jump in there and buy the stocks which are off the most from their highs  Afterall  they are likely the stocks with the most to gain on some sort of reversion to the mean  However  that is not the best idea as these stocks are likely off their highs for a reason  One of those reasons could be a change in earnings estimates  The Zacks Rank provides an easy way for investors to screen stock ideas to see if this is in fact the case One stock which is off considerably from its highs  which investors may want to avoid  is today s Bear of the Day  I m talking about Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Cott Corp  Cott Corporation

cereals  beverage concentrates  and mineral water  Cott is currently a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   The reason for the unfavorable ranks lies in the recent earnings estimate revisions to the downside  Over the last thirty days  analysts have cut their estimates for the current quarter  next quarter and next year  The negative revisions have dropped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for next quarter from a 2 cent gain to a 5 cent loss  Next year s number has dropped from 40 cents to 35 While there is still some growth in EPS estimates for next year  the estimates have come down considerably from their highs  Looking at the Price  Consensus  and EPS Surprise Chart for Cott  you can see that the company has had a tough time delivering real earnings growth year in and year out 3 Tech Stocks for

second quarter sales  continues to outperform the industry and has enabled it to gain significant market share  In the second quarter  segment revenues  GAAP  increased 17  year over year to  778 4 million Portfolio expansion across majority of the operating domains bode well  Notably  Microchip is now focusing on improving driving experience to strengthen its position in producing autonomous vehicle controllers In fact  the company unveiled cost effective three dimensional  3D  gesture recognition controller  MGC3140  which offers a robust single chip solution for sophisticated automotive HMI designs  The new solution is aimed at reducing driver distractions  in turn enhancing the in car capability of the drivers Robust adoption of company s low power PolarFire solutions is a positive  Recently  Microchip also announced availability of MPLAB X Integrated Development Environment  IDE  version 5 05  that support AVR family of the company s MCUs The company added two new devices

112545,334060,SNE,Alphabet  Sony  FedEx And Qualcomm Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 3  2018    Alphabet Inc    NASDAQ GOOGL   as the Bull of the Day  Sony Corp    NYSE SNE   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on FedEx   NYSE FDX   and Qualcomm Inc    NASDAQ QCOM   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Stocks have looked stronger in recent trading sessions  lifting hopes that the worst of December s selling would not extend into the New Year and encouraging investors who were looking forward to a strong 2019 If the bottom does indeed hold  it won t take long for Wall Street to jump on the newly created bargains formed by market wide volatility  And one area that is sure to attract bargain hunters is large cap technology  which was previously one of the market s hottest segments An example of a tech behemoth that looks attractive in the wake of the selloff is Alphabet Inc  The Google parent is sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   and its shares are trading on the cheap right now The foundation of the Zacks Rank are earnings estimates and earnings estimate revisions  When analysts become more optimistic about a company s earnings outlook  typically that s a bullish indicator for the stock But earnings trends take time to develop  and share prices move up and down every day  so an even better way to capitalize on estimate revisions is when a stock has not yet followed the bullish move in earnings estimates What we have here is a divergence between the share price trend and the earnings trend  While Alphabet s earnings outlook for 2019 and 2020 has moved sharply higher in the past month  the stock is down about 6 5  in that time This is a solid indicator for timing when to buy a stock  since share prices and earnings estimates eventually move in the same direction most of the time  We can already start to see this with GOOGL  as the stock found a bottom during the Christmas Eve selloff and is on the move higher Luckily though  Alphabet still looks cheap compared to its recent valuation history  This is another advantage to buying on the rebound  As we can see  GOOGL is not only cheaper than its industry s average earnings multiple  but also below the stock s average valuation over the past 52 weeks If those two indicators weren t enough  Alphabet also sports impressive growth prospects  The internet behemoth is expected to finish the current fiscal year with EPS growth of 31   That bottom line growth is projected to continue to the tune of 13  in the upcoming fiscal year  Analysts are also estimating that Alphabet will see 20  revenue growth in 2019 Alphabet is the king of internet search  and its core advertising business is firing on all cylinders as the number of connected devices continues to grow  But Alphabet s growth outlook for the next few years feels more a result of the company s new initiatives  including its hardware products  The Pixel phone is certainly a powerful device that runs on a familiar platform  while the Google Home is a massively popular automation assistant just to mention a few things The truth here is that Alphabet is among the FAANG stocks that led our relatively smooth bull market for years  December s volatility stopped just short of ending that bull market  but it s clear that the extent of its remaining life is uncertain  Nevertheless  we should expect the stocks that have steered the ship for years to serve as a primary signal of that life If Alphabet s recent bottom holds  that s good news for other tech stocks and the broader market  and that will reinforce the fundamental argument we just laid out here  Investors are rightfully on the hunt for bargains  as stocks have shown stronger signs in recent trading sessions and some of the market s most battered companies welcomed a rebound  With that said  even some of the most beaten down stocks still look like ones to avoid thanks to sluggish trend in earnings estimates One such example is FedEx  The shipping giant has lost nearly 30  of its value over the last six months  largely because of a weak earnings report and guidance issuance that was delivered in mid December FedEx posted adjusted earnings of  4 03 per share in the most recent quarter  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by two cents  Revenues managed to improve 9 3  from the year ago period to reach  17 8 billion and beat consensus estimates  but Wall Street was unimpressed with the rest of the story FedEx told Namely  FedEx trimmed its earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2019  The company now expects adjusted earnings in the range of  15 50 to  16 60 per share  down significantly from prior guidance of  17 20 to  17 80 in earnings per share Another notable piece of FedEx s outlook was management s commentary on its Express segment  The company had planned for this unit to reach  1 2 to  1 5 billion in revenue by fiscal 2020  but it now thinks that is unlikely to happen FedEx said this weakness is attributable to lower than expected express package volume due to sluggishness in the European economy  Overall  the company said that the major segment s performance is declining  thanks to a global slowdown in trade over the past few months  FedEx Express accounts for a plurality of the company s total revenue Weakness in Europe and other key markets is a real concern for FedEx  This is not only troubling for near term results  but also long term growth plans  For instance  FedEx opened a new hub in Shanghai earlier this year in order to boost its presence in China  With trading activity slowing in the Asian economic powerhouse  this initiative is likely off to a slow start Sluggish activity comes at a particularly tough time for FedEx  as the company is also shelling out large amounts of cash in an effort to upgrade facilities and integrate a new acquisition  TNT Express  FedEx s total capital expenditures were up 11  to  5 66 billion in fiscal 2018  and the company has forecast for roughly the same amount of spending this year FedEx is also relatively highly leveraged  The company has a long term debt to capitalization ratio of 45 9  which compares unfavorably to the market s average of 42 9 Moreover  FedEx is sporting a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  right now  The foundation of the Zacks Rank are earnings estimates and earnings estimate revisions  When analysts become more optimistic about a company s earnings outlook  typically that s a bullish indicator for the stock But the opposite is also true  so investors should avoid stocks with slumping EPS estimates  And of course  FedEx has seen a plethora of negative revisions since its earnings outlook and weak guidance  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2019 is down to  15 90 from  17 34 thanks to 11 negative revisions  and that s just near the middle of the company s guidance  If the aforementioned pressures pile on  FedEx could even underperform that muted consensus  which would drag the stock down further Unfortunately  investors looking for better options in the transportation business have limited options  In fact  our  Transportation   Air Freight and Cargo  group falls in the bottom 11  of the Zacks Industry Rank  and no stocks in the category have a buy rank 3 Blue Chip Tech Stocks to Buy NowRecent volatility has spooked individual and institutional investors alike  but as the dust settles  it is likely that money will find refuge in strong  consistent companies with businesses that can withstand near term headwinds This might mean that the world s tech leaders  which have dominated Wall Street over the past several years  are now on sale  Tech has been at the helm of our historic bull market  and it seems likely to remain that way  so long as the bull regains its footing Of course  this year s volatility has made some investors hesitant  with bearish traders quick to draw similarities between this latest tech rally and the infamous dot com bubble of the late 90s and early 2000s However  unlike the dot com bubble  there is real earnings and revenue growth fueling this tech rally  In fact  the average P E ratio of our  Computer and Technology  sector currently sits at 18 4  which compares favorably to the dot com era s average that soared into the 100s for a few weeks Another interesting trend in today s tech rally is that  rather than obsessing over the next big thing  investors seem to rewarding tried and true brands for their respectable growth  This means that some of the strongest tech stocks are the household names that consumers already know and love With that said  check out these three blue chip tech stocks to buy now 1  Alphabet Inc Google parent Alphabet has found itself with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  rating after several months of down trading  The position comes after the internet giant witnessed positive revisions to its earnings estimates  Analysts  on average  now expect Alphabet to record  47 45 in earnings per share in 2019  up from  47 33 a month ago  This would represent EPS growth of 13  from Alphabet s projected 2018 earnings Alphabet shares are down about 18  from their all time highs and looking cheap compared to recent history  The stock now has a P E of 24 9  which is a discount to the industry s average of 26 1  GOOGL also has a PEG ratio of 1 4  so its earnings growth outlook is coming at a decent price as well  Alphabet sports a beta of 0 99  meaning that it is a solid low volatility option if recent unpredictability picks back up again 2  Qualcomm Inc Qualcomm is one of the world s largest telecommunications equipment and semiconductor manufacturing companies  QCOM currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   One feature of the stock that tech investors looking for stability might like is its dividend  QCOM yields about 4 4  annualized right now  and management has a great track record of adding to the payout every year since 2009 Chip stocks have been widely battered recently  but QCOM likely holds up better because it offers exposure to different business  including large swaths of untapped growth in 5G  This is one thing that could help the company reach its long term projected annualized EPS growth rate of 10 9   Continued earnings growth will  in turn  help Qualcomm improve its balance sheet and offer investors more dividends and buybacks going forward 3  Sony Corp This Japanese electronics giant has a dominant position with many key products  including audio and video equipment  televisions  displays  semiconductors  game consoles  computers and computer peripherals  and telecommunication equipment  Even with recent selling  Sony shares have managed to stay in the green over the past year  and the stock is still reasonably valued  SNE is trading at about 10 7x earnings and has a PEG ratio of 1 1  both of which present discounts to their industry averages Meanwhile  management is generating  5 94 in cash per share  which should strengthen the company s ability to invest in new technologies  Earnings growth is expected to reach nearly 38  this fiscal year  and that should be inspired by revenue growth  as marginal expansion is expected to continue on the top line going forward The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty

112564,334079,SNE,Japan  Israel upgrade relations as Arab oil influence wanes,news,"By Tova Cohen
TEL AVIV  Reuters    Japanese executives say they are increasingly drawn to investments in Israel as the price of oil falls and  with it  the influence Arab oil suppliers have on Japan s decision making 
Over the past two years  Japan and Israel have strengthened business ties  signing a series of economic agreements on the back of a visit by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to Israel in 2015 and Benjamin Netanyahu s trip to Tokyo in 2014 
 Abe had a good impression  he liked Netanyahu s mentality   Yoshimitsu Kobayashi  chairman of Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings  told Reuters when he led a delegation from Keizai Doyukai  the Japanese business lobby  to Israel in May 
For years  trade between the two was minimal   Japan was reluctant to upset its oil suppliers  many of whom belong to the Arab League  which has long backed a boycott of Israel 
 Geopolitics is changing in the Middle East and as oil prices come down  strategically it s not as important   said Kobayashi   Japan is changing its mind  
Israel s prowess in Internet  biotech  and automotive technologies is particularly attractive  Kobayashi said 
This is not to say Japan has given up on the Arab world 
Isamu Nakashima  chief researcher at the Middle East Institute of Japan  said Japan s need for oil will always trump its need for anything Israel can offer  though past worries that trade with Israel could annoy Arab nations have mostly faded 
 But for things to really improve a lot  there needs to be a peace settlement  between Israel and the Palestinians    Nakashima said 
Bilateral trade in goods in the first seven months of 2016 rose to  1 4 billion from  1 1 billion  making Japan Israel s fourth largest market in Asia  It is part of a growing shift in focus as Asia overtakes the United States to become Israel s largest trading partner after Europe 
BUILDING FROM A LOW BASE
The deal that put Israel on Japan s business map was the  900 million acquisition of chat app Viber by Japanese e commerce giant Rakuten Inc in 2014  Viber has a big user base in Asia and was approached by Rakuten while doing business there  said Michael Shmilov  Viber s chief operating officer 
 There are strong cultural differences but at the same time  Rakuten is a global company where English is the official language and we are working closely to reduce the impact of these differences   he said 
The biggest obstacle  he said  is the lack of direct airline flights  something Israel wants to change 
The Viber acquisition was followed by several others  including the  212 million purchase of Israel s Altair Semiconductor by Sony Corp  T 6758  this year 
Net investment by Japanese firms in Israel  after subtracting Israeli investment in Japan  nearly doubled in 2015 to 5 2 billion yen   50 million   according to the Japan External Trade Organisation  citing Bank of Japan data 
 The last two years     we ve seen a great expansion of Japanese activities  many large corporations are coming here  setting up R D centres and investment flows are rising   said Avi Hasson  Israel s chief scientist 
Seven Japanese companies   including Panasonic  NEC and Ricoh   have joined his office s multinational R D programme  creating 12 projects with Israeli companies 
Gilad Majerowicz  head of the Japan desk at Israeli law firm Herzog Fox   Neeman  said several large Japanese companies planned to set up R D centres in Israel 
For Israel  Japan offers a large market and a source of capital at a time of growing calls by some activist groups in Europe and the United States for a boycott of Israel because of its policies towards the Palestinians 
They seek a state on land captured by Israel in a 1967 war  The most recent peace talks between the two fizzled in 2014 
Israeli mobile advertising analytics firm AppsFlyer opened an office in Tokyo last year and has over 100 Japanese clients 
 People who are tech savvy really respect Israeli companies   said Naoya Otsuba  AppsFlyer s manager in Japan 
An area where Japan is a particularly attractive market is in defense and cyber security  a sector that faces restrictions when it comes to China  Health is another key area as Japan s aging population seeks affordable medication

112607,334122,SNE,Sony  Bank OZK  K12  Bridgepoint Education And Grand Canyon Education Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 2  2018    highlights Sony Corporation   NYSE SNE   as the Bull of the Day  Bank OZK   NASDAQ OZK   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onK12 Inc    NYSE LRN    Bridgepoint Education  Inc    NYSE BPI   and Grand Canyon Education  Inc    NASDAQ LOPE   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks   Sony Corporation is crushing it as its Playstation division cashes in on the gaming craze  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  recently raised full year guidance Sony is a global technology  entertainment and gaming company headquartered in Japan Big Beat in Fiscal Q2On Oct 30  Sony reported its fiscal second quarter 2019 results and blew by the Zacks consensus by  0 29  Earnings were  1 20 versus the consensus of  0 91  for a beat of 31  It was the 6th consecutive earnings beat Total revenue was up 6  to  19 6 billion The Gaming division led the results  with gaming revenue  fueled by Playstation  jumping 27  year over year to  5 billion  On those sales it made  803 million in profit 75 1 million games were purchased  Playstation Plus  its subscription gaming service  also had record subscribers for a second quarter at 34 3 million  up from 33 9 million a year ago The Pictures segment has also recovered thanks to Hotel Transylvania 3 and the television licensing rights to Jumanji and Peter Rabbit  Pictures revenue actually fell 1  in the quarter  but at least it wasn t the drag it used to be Music revenue also declined 1  year over year but the company hasn t yet closed on its deal to purchase the rest of EMI Publishing  which will make it one of the biggest music publishers in the world Surprising areas of growth included its smaller Semiconductor segment  which saw revenue jump 11   and the Financial Services segment which saw revenue climb 27  thanks to gains in Sony Life Insurance It s mobile division  which is the smartphones  was a disaster however  It continues to take losses there as sales fell 32   This was offset by the phenomenal gaming revenue  but it s not something that s a positive for the company right now Estimates Moving HigherZacks only has 2 full year estimates as not many analysts cover Sony  despite its size and reputation 1 has already been raised since the earnings report  however  as the company raised full year operating income guidance to 870b yen from 670b yen However  the analysts believed that the prior guidance was really conservative  so the increase didn t come as any surprise  Through the first half of the fiscal year  the company has already made 451b yen and the second half of the year  thanks to the holidays  is always bigger The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 is now  4 18 up from  4 11 just 3 months ago  That s earnings growth of 27  as the company earned  3 29 in fiscal 2018 Analysts expect earnings to grow another 10 7  in fiscal 2020 as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate has jumped to  4 63 from  4 36 in the prior 90 days  Bank OZK shocked Wall Street by taking a large charge for real estate loans gone bad  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  has seemingly been infallible to real estate losses  until now Investors are left wondering  what will be next Bank OZK is headquartered in Arkansas and has  22 billion in assets  For years  it was considered a growth story  and not a value banking story  as it aggressively expanded its real estate portfolio after the Great Recession when many other banks stayed on the sidelines Big Miss in Q3On Oct 18  Bank OZK reported third quarter results and shocked the Street by missing on the Zacks Consensus Estimate by  0 32  Earnings came in at just  0 58 versus the Zacks Consensus of  0 90 Why the big miss It took a  45 5 million charge on 2 loans in its Real Estate Specialties Group   RESG    one in South Carolina and one in North Carolina  The two loans were not related One was for a regional shopping mall property which was anchored by struggling retailers JCPenney and Sears  and the other was for a housing and land single family home development The loans were from 2007 and 2008  respectively   On the conference call  OZK tried to reassure the analysts that these were isolated incidents  They don t have much exposure to the retail problems at shopping malls  outside of this property Additional content U S  Trade Deficit with China Puts These Stocks in FocusU S  China trade war has been a major damaging factor for financial markets since its commencement in July 2018  In fact  the constant tariff impositions affected the businesses of most industries in the two nations Chinese indexes have been heavily affected by the ongoing trade dispute  with Hang Seng Index  HSI  and Shanghai Composite Index  SCI  losing 11 4  and 5 4   respectively  since Jul 6  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2 6  and Nasdaq Composite lost 5 2   respectively  in the same timeframe According to the U S  Census Bureau  United States  trade deficit with China increased 9 2  year over year to reach  38 6 billion in August 2018  Some of the country s major imports from the Asian nation include consumer electronics  machinery and apparel President Donald Trump s protectionist measures in trade with China were aimed at narrowing United State s trade deficit that has been highest globally since 1975  but the broadening deficit indicates that a different approach would perhaps have been apt While most U S  industries are experiencing a widening trade deficit with China  a few industries  such as education  have been barred from the trade war effect  Therefore  it would be prudent to focus on a few stocks from the U S  education services industry at present U S  Trade Surplus With China in EducationAlthough U S  China trade dispute is dominating global economic tensions  United States enjoys a trade surplus with China and rest of the world in the field of education  The Chinese education industry has been largely unaffected by the ongoing trade war as well As of 2016  U S  education exports amounted to  39 4 billion while its imports were only  7 5 billion  Foreign students attending American higher education institutions were responsible for the trade surplus in education and remain a major driver for the continuing growth in the domestic education industry  The figure is indicative of only the tuition fee foreign students pay in the United States  A lot of Chinese students study in the US and pay large amounts of tuition fees and living expenses  This is a huge sum of money that flows from China to the US   China s central bank governor Yi Gang said at the G30 International Banking Seminar 2018 earlier in October Chinese students account for nearly 30  of foreign nationals enrolled in America s educational institutions  The students not only contribute to the U S  economy  but are also responsible for creation of jobs  According to NAFSA  during the 2016 2017 academic year  1 078 822 foreign students studying in the United States were responsible for adding  36 9 billion to the U S  economy and supported 450 000 jobs in the country According to Zion Market Research  U S  education market is estimated to reach  2 040 billion by 2026  The industry is set to witness a compound annual rate of more than 4 5  in the2018 2026 period  The rising number of Chinese students enrolling for U S  higher education could be a contributor to this growth Some of the leading players in U S  education industry include Adobe Systems  NASDAQ ADBE   McGraw Hill  NYSE SPGI  Education  Blackboard Inc  and Wall Family Enterprise Stocks in FocusHere we present a few stocks from the U S  education industry for your consideration K12 Inc  provides proprietary curriculum and educational services created for online delivery to students in

more than a year now  In the days ahead  demand for capital goods is expected to boost exports  Also  growth in manufacturing activity increased in April  Moreover  the global economy is expected to grow this year  which will likely aid Japan s exports  Given this scenario  it makes good sense to invest in Japan stocks Japan s Economic Growth ShrinksJapan s economy slid 0 2  quarter over quarter in the January March period  snapping eight straight quarters of economic expansion  The economy contracted 0 6  on an annualized basis  more than the median estimate of a 0 2  decline The slower growth can be attributed to an unexpected decline of 0 1  in capital investment  Japan s economy had grown above its potential for more than a year  thanks to huge production and investment driven by robust expansion of exports  Private consumption remained flat in the first quarter after a 0 2  rise in the final quarter of 2017  Also  private residential investment declined 2 1  after a 2 7  fall in the fourth quarter of 2017 Another major reason behind this contraction is that exports of goods and services have slowed  with a meager 0 6  rise compared with 2 2  in the fourth quarter  Understandably  being an export heavy country  Japan has high hopes on a growing global economy Economic Growth to ReboundEconomists strongly feel that the slump is temporary  According to Toshimitsu Motegi  Japan s Economy Minister  the government still believes that the moderate recovery in the economy is intact  He further anticipates economic recovery to be driven by private consumption and capital expenditure Interestingly  domestic demand was low in the first quarter  leading to a contraction in economic growth  Also  high vegetable prices because of bad weather and one time selloffs ranging from stock market selloffs to a strengthening yen led to shrinking economic growth Overseas Factors to Boost GrowthAnalysts and economists believe that overseas factors will hold the key to Japan s economic growth  According to the International Monetary Fund  IMF   the global economy is expected to grow 3 9  in 2018    its fastest pace since 2011  This is likely to give a boost to Japan s exports Also  U S  tax cuts are likely to help the global economy rebound in the second quarter  Naturally  this will create overseas demand  resulting in higher exports of machinery and other goods from Japan  Interestingly  despite this slowdown  Japan s manufacturing growth picked up in March Japan s Manufacturing Purchasing Manager s Index  PMI  increased 53 8 in April  marking the 21st consecutive month of rising production in its manufacturing sector  Moreover  industrial output is expected to increase 3 1  in April  Also  inventories of electronic parts like flat panel displays and semiconductors rose 12 8  in March compared with 1 7  in February  Our ChoicesJapan s economy may have slowed down for the first time in two years  but both economists and the government believe that the slump is short lived  Given that the global economic outlook is bullish  exports are expected to rise in the second quarter and give Japan s economic growth a solid push While adding Japan

Yoshida also unveiled a three year plan highlighting Sony s increasing reliance on income from gaming subscriptions and entertainment  The Japanese gaming giant plans to invest  1 trillion   9 billion  over the next three years  primarily in image sensors  per its revamped strategy to fortify hardware and creative content 
In its mid year plan  the company projected profit growth in most divisions over the next three years  but offered a somewhat conservative outlook  Sony expects operating profit in its video games and network services business to fall between  130 billion and  170 billion in the fiscal year ending March 2021  down from the  190 billion forecast for the current fiscal year

112656,334171,SNE,Why Did Nvidia  NVDA  Stock Hit A New High Today ,opinion,"Shares of Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA   surged more than 2  to hit a new all time intraday trading high on Monday  This is clearly good news for investors  but what exactly caused today s gains  Let s take a closer look 
Movie Bump 
Analysts at Jefferies think that Steven Spielberg s upcoming futuristic action blockbuster Ready Player One has the potential to boost the stock price of companies like Nvidia and rival AMD   NASDAQ AMD   
Analysts claim that the premise of Spielberg s latest film  which features a world where humans spend a large amount of their time living through virtual reality based avatars  will lift sales of the company s high performance chips  known as graphics processing units  GPUs  
 We believe that the movie will drive sales of VR headsets that require high performance GPUs from NVDA and AMD    
Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis currently has a buy rating for Nvidia and sees its shares surging to  300 over the next year  This climb would mark more than a 20  jump from Friday s closing price of  245 33 per share 
 A lot of the demand for increased compute cycles is becoming parallel in nature  like neural networking  gaming  virtual reality and blockchain cryptocurrency mining   he added 
For many investors and consumers  virtual reality seems far off  but the technology has come a long way in a relatively short period of time  Facebook s   NASDAQ FB   Oculus headsets and Sony s   NYSE SNE   PlayStation VR both currently offer affordable virtual reality tech  and a slew of other companies have joined the market recently 
Ready Player One  which is geared towards kids  is set to be released on March 29  With that said  let s take a look at a few more of Nvidia s current fundamentals to help gauge whether or not the stock looks poised to continue its current hot streak 
More Fundamentals  
Nvidia reported record full year revenues of  9 71 billion last month  which marked a 41  jump from the year ago period  Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are now calling for the computer chip giant s first quarter fiscal 2019 sales to soar 50   Nvidia s bottom line is also expected to surge over 76  to hit  1 50 per share 
Looking at the company s current full year  Nvidia is projected to see both its top and bottom line jump by over 28   Investors might also be happy to note that the company has beat or matched earnings estimates in 11 straight quarters  This includes posting an average earnings surprise of nearly 41  in the trailing four periods 
Nvidia has also recently earned a large number of estimate revisions for its current quarter  next quarter  current year  and following year earnings  with 100  agreement to the upside 
The company is also currently trading at 39 43x forward earnings  This might seem like a rather high figure for some value investors  but Nvidia s median P E was roughly 47 5 over the last two quarters  Investors have clearly been willing to pay a premium for Nvidia stock recently  But investors should also note that at its current P E  Nvidia is relatively cheap compared to where it has been recently 
On top of all of this  Nvidia is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and sports a  B  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system

112657,334172,SNE,GoPro Tanks 34  YTD  Is A Turnaround Possible ,opinion,"The past couple of years has been a rough ride for GoPro  Inc    NASDAQ GPRO   and its troubles are far from ending  The leading manufacturer of the world s most handy camera and related accessories has seen its shares fall almost 34  year to date  underperforming the  s growth of around 6  by a huge margin 

 
The company s underperformance  in part  can be attributed to repeated operational stumbles  multiple layoffs  decaying fundamentals and macroeconomic woes  The company has been grappling with sluggish demand for its Hero cameras amid stiff competition from lower priced action camera alternatives 
Moreover  in light of the company s dismal fourth quarter 2017 results  the management anticipates its revenues to decline further in 2018 and incur a net loss for the full year 
Meanwhile  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has moved south over the past couple of months  from earnings of 4 cents to a loss of 37 cents  This indicates extremely bearish sentiments surrounding this Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  stock  mirrored by eight downward estimate revisions versus none upward  You can see  
Factors Troubling GoPro
Of late  GoPro s market share has been threatened by lower cost alternatives from established industry players like Sony Corp    NYSE SNE    Nikon Corp    OTC NINOY   and new entrants  For instance  the launch of Google clips   which has a 12 megapixel sensor and a 130 degree field of view lens   has enabled Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL   to penetrate into capture devices market  thus pushing the level of competition a notch higher  Another such product having features similar to GoPro s Fusion is Sony s action camera RX0  We believe that increasing commoditization of action cameras is hurting the company s premium brand image  and pressurizing prices and margins 
Also  high product concentration risk and product cannibalization are persistent demand issues  which are likely to drag down the company s top  line growth in coming times  even as it strives to find explore revenue streams 
Price reductions have also affected the top line in recent times  despite strong marketing support for key products  Late in 2017  GoPro slashed prices for the Hero 5 Black and Hero 5 Session cameras  It also cut the price of its latest camera  HERO 6 Black  to  399 from  499  The constrained demand and price cuts are likely to impact the top line in the coming quarters as well 
Furthermore  in recent years  the company has struggled with multiple operational stumbles including product recalls and messed up launches  Also  the company is shutting its drone business  Not a long while ago  GoPro had hoped Karma would help revive the company s fortunes and stoke growth for the beleaguered action camera company  Karma witnessed a roller coaster ride  punctuated mostly by lows rather than highs  thanks to problems like production delays and recall of 2 500 units due to a battery issue 
Will the Stock Rebound Any Time Soon 
GoPro remains committed toward regaining its growth momentum  backed by its camera portfolio  a smooth distribution channel  and interesting products like Fusion  Fusion is a waterproof  mountable 5 2K spherical camera that the company launched last year 
GoPro is focused on intense restructuring  streamlining its supply chain and expanding its market  As a result  its significant investments toward its expansion plans in Asia  China and Japan and counter the aforesaid challenges might take some more time to deliver credible top line growth 
For 2018  the company has a target to limit operating expenses to below  400 million compared with  476 million incurred in 2017  A large part of the reduction can be attributed to the company s decision of exiting its drone business and reducing employee headcount 
The company s turnaround efforts might yield results in the long run  But for now  it appears that investors don t believe GoPro s initiatives can outweigh soft demand and operational weakness that the company is struggling with

112658,334173,SNE,5 Consumer Stocks To Yield Returns Despite US China Tensions,opinion,Escalating trade tensions between the world s largest economies  United States and China  are likely to cast a shadow on economies  Also  the disturbing recollection of the stock market crash of 1929  which was followed by the Great Depression  hounds investors After U S  President Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on up to  60 billion of annual Chinese imports  China retaliated by revealing plans to levy tariffs on 128 U S  products  This has given rise to fears of an all out trade war between the countries How Will U S  China Clash Hurt Consumers The present U S  market scenario shows increased consumer demand for goods and services   According to the Fed s latest forecast  the economy is anticipated to grow at a reasonable rate of 2 7  in 2018  Unemployment is predicted at 3 8  for 2018 against the current 4 1   Moreover  high real disposable income and low inflation are resulting in the favorable purchasing behavior  The fourth quarter of 2017 saw the highest consumer spending after three years  offsetting the impact of a surge in imports A trade war can therefore alter the rosy scenario as American consumers will now have to face a dearth of China imported products  Tariff on Chinese imports will unquestionably bump up prices  directly affecting consumers and their discretionary spending Cyclical Sectors at RiskCyclical sectors are likely to suffer a great deal if a trade war rages on as these are sensitive to the business cycle  Any economic crisis inevitably results in lower discretionary income  This is because higher prices compel consumers to prioritize spending The  and sectors are most likely to bear the brunt of the trade conflict  Top retailers like Walmart   NYSE WMT   have voiced concerns about the imposition of tariff as rising prices will affect sales The retail sector  which consists of companies providing food  drug  mail order  Internet commerce  consumer electronics  restaurants  apparel shoes and jewelry are most likely to face a slump in sales if consumer discretionary spending falls Per a recent press release  China retaliated by raising import duties on a  3 billion list of U S  pork  fruit and other products  On Apr 2  the nation raised tariffs on pork  aluminum scrap and some other products by 25  while 15  was imposed on apples  almonds and other goods This will deal a bigger blow to consumer income as U S  farmers  who had exported nearly  20 billion worth of goods to China in 2017  will now face a deficiency Should Investors Fret Though the effects of a war are quite apparent  smart moves might help investors rake in profits from a few stocks in these sectors  Based on unique business strategies to drive profits  a few companies within the Consumer Discretionary and Retail sectors promises solid returns Top operators in these sectors are making pragmatic use of advanced technologies to innovate across value chains and thereby hold consumers  Consumer demand for goods is increasing and shifting among a range of formats and channels  Digital innovation  focus on continual product customization as well as launch and delivery of seamless consumer experience are expected to help these consumer oriented companies make the most of the current economic condition The Consumer Discretionary sector has returned 4 7  over the past year as compared with the S P 500 s gain of 9 6   Since the sector is by large sensitive to macro economic factors  its volatility is a pressing concern  Meanwhile  the Retail Wholesale sector has been displaying steady growth  In the past year  the sector has gained 20 8  Per an analyst report by Deloitte  the retail market is projected to grow 3 2  to 3 8  in 2018  The linchpin to the strong near and long term retail industry outlook is a strong labor market and rising consumer income Investors can therefore zero in on a

April  WikiLeaks published the trove of emails  memos and presentations from the Sony hack in an online searchable archive   We are not going to comment on stolen emails or internal discussions about specific content decisions   said a spokesman for Sony Pictures  a unit of Tokyo based Sony Corp   There are myriad factors that go into determining what is best for a film s release  and creating content that has wide global appeal without compromising creative integrity is top among them   Chinese government and film industry officials didn t respond to requests for comment for this story  A PALATABLE  ROBOCOP   Pixels  wasn t the only Sony movie in which the China content was carefully scrutinized  The emails reveal how studio executives discussed ways to make other productions  including the 2014 remake of  RoboCop   more palatable to Chinese authorities  In a 2013 email about  RoboCop   the senior vice president at Sony Pictures Releasing International at the time  Steve Bruno  proposed relocating a multinational weapons conglomerate from China  His solution  Put it in a Southeast Asian country like Vietnam or Cambodia  Ultimately  that change wasn t made  a viewing of the movie shows  Bruno has since left Sony  The Sony emails provide a behind the scenes picture of the extent to which one of the world s leading movie studios exercised self censorship as its executives tried to anticipate how authorities in Beijing might react to their productions  The internal message traffic also illustrates the deepening dependence of Hollywood on audiences in China  where box office receipts jumped by almost a third last year to  4 8 billion  as revenues in the United States and Canada shrank   Other studios have made changes to movies in a bid to get them approved by Beijing  altering the version that is screened in China  A scene showing a Chinese doctor who helps the main character in  Iron Man 3   for example  was lengthened in the Chinese version and included popular Chinese actress Fan Bingbing  a comparison of the Chinese and international versions shows  Produced by Marvel Studios   Iron Man 3  was the second top grossing movie in China in 2013  Marvel declined to comment  THE LOGIC OF SELF CENSORSHIP In the case of  Pixels   in which the aliens attack Earth in the form of popular video game characters  the Sony emails point to the creation of a single version for all audiences   a China friendly one  The logic behind Sony s thinking was explained by Steven O Dell  president of Sony Pictures Releasing International  in a September 12  2013 email about  RoboCop    Changing the China elements to another country should be a relatively easy fix   O Dell wrote   There is only downside to leaving the film as it is  Recommendation is to change all versions as if we only change the China version  we set ourselves up for the press to call us out for this when bloggers invariably compare the versions and realize we changed the China setting just to pacify that market   Efforts by the U S  motion picture industry to woo China come as the ruling Communist Party under President Xi Jinping is engaged in the biggest crackdown on civil society in more than two decades  About a dozen human rights lawyers were taken into police custody this month  and hundreds of dissidents have been detained since Xi took power in late 2012  As China rises  its efforts to contain civil liberties at home are radiating outward  The removal of scenes from  Pixels  thought to be offensive to Beijing shows how global audiences are effectively being subjected to standards set by China  whose government rejects the kinds of freedoms that have allowed Hollywood to flourish   I think the studios have grown pretty savvy   said Peter Shiao  founder and CEO of Orb Media Group  an independent film studio focused on Hollywood Chinese co productions   For a type of movie  particularly the global blockbusters  they are not going to go and make something that the Chinese would reject for social or political reasons  That is already a truism   Sony s emails were hacked ahead of the release of  The Interview   a comedy depicting the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong un  When Sony halted the film s release in response to threats made against movie theaters  U S  President Barack Obama warned of the dangers of self censorship  Ultimately  Sony released the movie   If somebody is able to intimidate folks out of releasing a satirical movie  imagine what they start doing when they see a documentary that they don t like  or news reports that they don t like   Obama said at his year end White House press briefing   Or even worse  imagine if producers and distributors and others start engaging in self censorship because they don t want to offend the sensibilities of somebody whose sensibilities probably need to be offended  That s not who we are  That s not what America is about   FAST   FURIOUS GROWTH  For Hollywood studios  the allure of the Chinese box office has become increasingly difficult to resist  While box office receipts in the United States and Canada combined fell five percent last year to  10 4 billion compared with 2013  box office receipts in China jumped 34 percent to  4 8 billion in the same period  according to the Motion Picture Association of America Inc  China is on course to set a new record this year  Box office receipts were  3 3 billion in the first half of 2015  China s state run media reported  Action movie  Fast   Furious 7  was the best ticket seller in China by early June 2015  grossing  383 million   higher than the  351 million in the United States and Canada combined  It was followed by  Avengers  Age of Ultron  and  Jurassic World   Last November  the vice president of the China Film Producers  Association  Wang Fenglin  said the Chinese film market would overtake the United States to become the largest in the world within three years  The importance of the China market appears to have informed decisions taken by Metro Goldwyn Mayer Studios Inc in its 2012 remake of the action movie  Red Dawn   MGM changed the nationality of the soldiers who invade the United States from Chinese to North Korean in post production  according to Red Dawn producer Tripp Vinson  MGM did not respond to requests for comment  APPARATUS OF CONTROL To get on the circuit in China  a movie must win the approval of the Film Bureau  which is headed by Zhang Hongsen  a domestic television screenwriter and senior Communist Party member   Foreign films come to China one after another like aircraft carriers  we are facing great pressure and challenges   Zhang said last year   We must make the Chinese film industry bigger and stronger   The Film Bureau is part of the State Administration of Press  Publication  Radio  Film and Television  SAPPRFT   which reports directly to China s cabinet  the State Council  The administration controls state owned enterprises in the communications field  including China Central Television and China Radio International  Censorship guidelines are included in a 2001 order issued by the State Council  The order bans content that endangers the unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity of China  harms national honor and disrupts social stability  Harming public morality and national traditions is forbidden  SAPPRFT guidelines also include bans on material seen as  disparaging of the government  and political figures  The broadening scope of these guidelines can be seen in an email sent last November by Sanford Panitch  who has since joined Sony as President of International Film and Television  to Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton  The email outlines new measures that were being implemented by SAPPRFT officials   What is different is now they are clearly making an attempt to try to address other areas not been specified before  decadence  fortune telling  hunting  and most dramatically  sexuality   Panitch wrote  Studios also have to work with China Film Group Corp  a state owned conglomerate that imports and distributes foreign movies  In some cases China Film also acts as an investor  In the emails  Sony executives discussed a co financing arrangement whereby China Film will cover 10 percent of the budget of  Pixels   China Film is run by La Peikang  a Communist Party member and the former deputy head of the Film Bureau   TOO MUCH MONEY ON THE LINE  A total of 34 foreign films are allowed into China each year under a revenue sharing model that gives 25 percent of box office receipts to foreign movie studios  Fourteen of those films must be in  high tech  formats such as 3D or IMAX  The censorship process in China can be unpredictable  the Sony emails show  In early 2014  the studio was faced with a demand to remove for Chinese audiences a key but disturbing scene from  RoboCop   the story of a part man  part machine police officer   Censorship really hassling us on Robocop trying to cut out the best and most vital scene where they open up his suit and expose what is left of him as a person   reads a January 28  2014 email written by international executive Steven O Dell   Hope to get through it with only shortening up the scene a bit  Don t think we can make a stand on it either way  too much money on the line  cross fingers we don t have to cut the scene out   The political climate under President Xi may also be playing a role  one email indicates   As to greater flexibility  I am not so sure about that   Sony China executive Li Chow wrote in early 2014  commenting on a media report that Beijing was mulling an increase in its foreign film quota   The present government seems more conservative in all aspects and this is reflected by the repeated cuts to Robocop  Lately  members of the censorship board seem uncertain  fearful and overly careful   In the messages in which  Pixels  is discussed  Sony executives grapple with how to gauge the sensitivities of the Chinese authorities  In a November 1  2013 email  Li Chow suggested making a number of changes to the script  including the scene in which a hole is smashed in the Great Wall   This is fine as long as this is shown as part of a big scale world wide destruction  meaning that it would be good to show several recognizable historical sites in different parts of the world being destroyed   she wrote  She also advised altering a scene in which the President of the United States  an ambassador and the head of the CIA speculate that China could be behind an attack using an unknown technology  In the final version  which moviegoers are now getting to see  the officials speculate that Russia  Iran or Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  could be to blame   China can be mentioned alongside other super powers but they may not like  Russia and China don t have this kind of technology    Li wrote in the email   And in view of recent news on China hacking into government servers  they may object to  a communist conspiracy brother hacked into the mail server       THE UNWRITTEN RULE  In mid December 2013  Li suggested doing away with the Great Wall scene altogether  saying it was  unnecessary   Around the same time  the emails show Sony executives also discussed relocating a car chase scene involving the video game character Pac Man from Tokyo to Shanghai  and whether that might help with the release date in China  Li Chow advised against the change   As to relocating the Pac Man action from Tokyo to Shanghai  this is not a good idea because it will involve destruction all over the city and may likely cause some sensitivity   she wrote in a December 18  2013 email   In other words  it is rather hard to say whether it would be a problem because the unwritten rule is that it is acceptable if there is no real intention in destroying a certain building or street and if it is just collateral damage  But where would you draw the line   Ultimately  all references to China in the movie were scrubbed  That decision appears to have been made in early 2014   It looks like Doug is going to heed Li s advice and get all China references out of Pixels  including not using the Great Wall as one of the set pieces    international executive O Dell wrote  referring to then Columbia Pictures President Doug Belgrad  The cost of not winning approval to distribute a movie in China is also evident in the Sony emails  In February 2014  a Sony marketing executive circulated an email   Please note that CAPTAIN PHILLIPS will not be released theatrically in China    a reference to the movie in which Tom Hanks stars as Captain Richard Phillips  who was taken hostage by Somali pirates in 2009  Budget discussions about  Captain Phillips   contained in the emails  show Sony executives had expected to earn  120 million globally from the movie  but that changed when they didn t get approval for it to be screened in China   We are short  9M and we won t be getting into China   emailed notes from a conference call read   We need to grab every dollar we can to meet our objectives  It is incumbent on all of us to try to figure out how we can get more money from this picture   In a December 2013 email  Rory Bruer  president of worldwide distribution at Sony Pictures  had speculated that  Captain Phillips  was unlikely to be approved by China s censors  In the film  the U S  military rescues the ship s captain  That plot element  Bruer noted  might make Chinese officials squirm   The reality of the situation is that China will probably never clear the film for censorship   wrote Bruer   Reasons being the big Military machine of the U S  saving one U S  citizen  China would never do the same and in no way would want to promote this idea  Also just the political tone of the film is something that they would not feel comfortable with   
Beijing shows every sign of being comfortable with  Pixels   This week  Sony had some good news   Pixels  has been approved for release in China  It opens there on September 15 ",2015-07-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/special-report:-how-sony-sanitized-adam-sandler-movie-to-please-chinese-censors-352799,352799

112728,334243,SNE,3 Tech Stocks To Buy For The Virtual Reality Revolution,opinion,"With some of the biggest names in tech investing billions in virtual reality  which many see as the future of both entertainment and communication  now might be the best time to buy stocks poised to benefit from VR s growth before the industry really booms 
The mainstream commercialization of VR is still in the early stages of development   estimated that the global virtual reality market was valued at just  2 02 billion in 2016  However  by 2022  the firm projects that the industry will bring in  26 89 billion  growing at a CAGR of roughly 54  between 2017 and 2022 
With that said  let s take a look at three tech powerhouses that could be great VR stock plays ahead of this massive growth 
1        Facebook   NASDAQ FB    
Facebook s purchase of Oculus VR for  2 billion in early 2014 helped usher in a new wave of virtual reality in Silicon Valley  Oculus VR headsets are some of the most popular in the current market  and the company has introduced several new models with the last few months 
Outside of Oculus  Facebook has invested heavily in VR tech and rolled out its own virtual reality hangout platform called    not too long ago  On Monday  Mark Zuckerberg s company announced that it invented a new unit of time  which is slightly longer than a nanosecond  called   The hope is that Flick will allow for a more crisp VR experience  Facebook is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and sports an  A  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system 
2        Sony   NYSE SNE  
Japanese entrainment and electronics giant Sony is a great VR pick because of its widely popular video game console  PlayStation  The console s new PlayStation VR has   Sony has also sold 12 million PSVR games and recently introduced a new model of its VR tech 
On top of that  Sony Pictures released an accompanying VR experience for the recent release of its new film Jumanji  Welcome to the Jungle  Going forward  Sony is likely to see continued growth in its VR video gaming segment  as it slowly pushes towards a more immersive movie experience  Sony is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and boasts an overall  A  VGM score 
3        Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA   
Video gaming chip giant Nvidia is already helping power the VR industry  but the company is ready to keep expanding its VR division as the market becomes more mainstream  Nvidia currently boasts multiple VR solutions  including its industry leading Pascal GPUs  The Pascal GPU has helped Nvidia expand its VRWorks segment  which tries to create more life like VR experiences

112735,334250,SNE,Electro Scientific  Advanced Drainage Systems  Nvidia  Facebook And Sony As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 25  2018    highlights Electro Scientific Industries   NASDAQ ESIO   as the Bull of the Day and Advanced Drainage Systems   NYSE WMS   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Nvidia Corporation   NASDAQ NVDA    Facebook  Inc    NASDAQ FB   and Sony Corporation   NYSE SNE   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks   Electro Scientific Industries is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and recently guided higher  This caused the stock to rocket higher to the  27 range  but in recent trading the stock retraced back below  24   The question is  should you be buying this stock   Well  today  it is the Bull of the Day and this article might help you make that decision DescriptionElectro Scientific Industries supplies laser based microfabrication solutions for the microtechnology industry worldwide  It provides printed circuit boards  including laser via drilling systems for electrical interconnect applications  micro via drilling technology that addresses the changing applications in integrated circuit packages  multichip modules  and high density interconnect circuit boards  and ultraviolet laser processing systems comprising single beam and multi beam systems  Electro Scientific Industries  Inc  was founded in 1944 and is headquartered in Portland  Oregon Guiding HigherOn January 17  the company raised guidance for the current quarter   They now expect revenue to be  106M    111M  up from  80M    90M when the consensus was calling for  85M   Management noted that EPS will come in above the previously guided to range   0 48    0 60  when the consensus was  0 55 This was a big guide higher  but it wasn t the first of its kind On November 1 the company set forth the original guidance during the previous earnings call   At that time  the revenue estimate for the next quarter  the one that will be reported on 1 31  was  45M in revenue and  0 02 in EPS Earnings HistoryI see a very solid earnings history for ESIO  with four of the last four reports coming in ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  In fact  the beats have not been small ones  they have been very large   The average positive surprise is an impressive 110  ValuationThe multiples that I see on the Zacks Website make me scratch my head   I see a 10x forward earnings multiple and a 40x trailing number   That can happen when estimates skyrocket like they have for ESIO  so the real question is why investors haven t taken hold   The price to book of 5x and price to sales of 3 3x are more or less in line with industry averages AnalystsNeedham first moved their target to  27 following the November 1 earnings report   Now they have moved their target to  35 and that is before the company is reporting earnings on 1 31 It isn t a secret that I hold ESIO in Home Run Investor  a subscription service that send buy and sell alerts for small and mid cap stocks   I tweeted some time back that Home Run added shares on October 25 at just under  17 a share   Here is the tweet    so think about this when ESIO reports again on January 31  Advanced Drainage Systems should probably be poised to move higher  but earnings estimates are moving lower and the purpose of this article is to show why this stock is the Bear of the Day DescriptionAdvanced Drainage Systems  designs  manufactures and markets thermoplastic corrugated pipes and related water management products The company was founded in 1966 and is headquartered in Hilliard  Ohio TailwindsRecently  the outline for the upcoming infrastructure bill was leaked and we saw a lot of places that a company like WMS could benefit   I saw a lot of sewer and pipeline projects and I just skimmed the document   mostly because we cannot be sure that it is the real thing at this point The end idea is that there is going to be some major federal spending coming down the pike  but maybe this isn t in the analyst s models Earnings HistoryThis is a mild sore spot for WMS   The company has missed on 3 of the last four earnings reports   That one that was not a miss was a meet  so no beats in the last four reports Estimate RevisionsThe Zacks Rank is based on earnings estimates from analysts at multiple brokerage firms  When the consensus is moving lower  the stock tends to slide in terms of the rank   Right now  we are seeing a host of company s raise guidance as a result of lower tax rates and those that are seeing even the smallest of decreases find their way to being the lowest Zacks Rank This is the case with WMS who has seen only a two penny move lower in earnings estimates for fiscal 2019  60 Days ago  the Zacks Consensus Estimate was at  0 93 and now it is at  0 91 This is not a huge move lower or one that would get this stock on your list of stocks to potentially short    The lesson learned from this Bear of the Day is that most stocks are seeing estimate increases   That means the ones that are not moving significantly higher are being left behind  Additional content 3 Blue Chip Tech Stocks to Buy NowThe technology sector dominated Wall Street throughout 2017  and if the market s reaction to the first wave of Q4 earnings reports is any indication  that trend should continue well into 2018  While many will feel that they have already missed their chance to win big on tech stocks  there are still plenty of opportunities to cash in as we head further into the New Year Of course  this is not the first notable tech rally  The cloud of the dot com bubble still lingers over this sector  and plenty on Wall Street remain hesitant to load up on tech stocks because of it However  unlike the dot com bubble  there is real earnings and revenue growth fueling this tech rally  In fact  the average P E ratio of our    sector currently sits at 22 54  which compares favorably to the dot com era s average that routinely soared into the 200s Another interesting trend in today s tech rally is that  rather than obsessing over the next big thing  investors seem to rewarding tried and true brands for their respectable growth  This means that some of the strongest tech stocks are the household names that consumers already know and love With that said  check out these three blue chip tech stocks to buy now 1        Nvidia CorporationThanks to its strategic investments in datacenters and artificial intelligence  Nvidia has emerged as one of Wall Street s most popular stocks  Of course  the company s industry leading GPUs remain its backbone and are the number one choice for PC gamers worldwide  Nvidia shares have gained over 122  within the past year  and now that the stock sports a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it is showing few signs of stopping Our current consensus estimates are calling for Nvidia to end the fiscal year with earnings growth of 63   and that expansion is expected to continue with EPS growth of an additional 12  next year  Nvidia is also expected to grow its revenues by another 16  in the upcoming year  What s more  management is strengthening its financial stability with cash flow growth of 124  right now 2        Facebook  Inc Facebook is the world s premiere social networking website  and through its WhatsApp and Instagram subsidiaries  the company has a stranglehold on internet advertising and communication  What s more  Facebook has invested in original content and livestreaming and now stands ready to become a dominant multimedia force for years to come  The stock is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and is widely considered a must own internet play Despite pouring money into new projects in 2017  Facebook is still projected to end the fiscal year with earnings growth of 39   And even though management has promised to spend money on security in the upcoming year  our consensus estimates are calling for further EPS growth of 13   Meanwhile  shares are trading at a reasonable 29x earnings  and with the stock s PEG ratio of just 1 07  investors are clearly getting a great price for that aforementioned EPS expansion 3        Sony CorporationThis Japanese electronics giant has a dominant position with many key products  including audio and video equipment  televisions  displays  semiconductors  electronic components  computers and computer peripherals  and telecommunication equipment  Sony is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and looks like a promising tech stock for both the near term and in the coming years Sony shares have soared more than 65  over the past year  but the stock is still trading below 18x earnings and 0 90x sales  Meanwhile  management is generating  2 93 in cash per share  which should strengthen the company s ability to invest in new technologies  Thanks to softer year over year comparisons  earnings growth is expected to fall in the triple digits this fiscal year  but that expansion is expected to continue with EPS growth of 8  next year Bottom LineWhile there are no guarantees in the stock market  several bullish indicators point to continued strength in the tech sector  With corporate tax reform on the horizon and earnings growth already present  these blue chip tech companies should be able to continue their dominance Want more stock

112738,334253,SNE,Data hacked from U S  government dates back to 1985  official,news,"By Andrea Shalal and Matt Spetalnick WASHINGTON  Reuters    Data stolen from U S  government computers by suspected Chinese hackers included security clearance information and background checks dating back three decades  U S  officials said on Friday  underlining the scope of one of the largest known cyber attacks on federal networks  The breach of computer systems of the Office of Personnel Management was disclosed on Thursday by the Obama administration  which said records of up to 4 million current and former federal employees may have been compromised  Accusations by U S  government sources of a Chinese role in the cyber attack  including possible state sponsorship  could further strain ties between Washington and Beijing  Tensions are already heightened over Chinese assertiveness in pursuit of territorial claims in the South China Sea  The hacking also raises questions about how the United States would respond if it confirmed that the Chinese government was behind it   Several U S  officials  who requested anonymity  said the hackers were believed to have been based in China but that it was not yet known if the Chinese government or criminal elements were involved  Another U S  official said the breach was being investigated as a matter of national security  meaning it may have originated from a foreign government  The cyber attack was among the most extensive thefts of information on the federal work force  and one U S  defense official said it was clearly aimed at gaining valuable information for intelligence purposes   This is deep  The data goes back to 1985   a U S  official said   This means that they potentially have information about retirees  and they could know what they did after leaving government   Access to data from OPM s computers  such as birth dates  Social Security numbers and bank information  could help hackers test potential passwords to other sites  including those with information about weapons systems  the official said   That could give them a huge advantage   the official said  According to a U S  House of Representatives memo seen by Reuters  OPM knows what types of data were exposed to the hackers but not what data was taken  The memo was sent to House staff by Chief Administrative Officer Ed Cassidy  whose office provides support services to the House  including cyber security services  In addition  the State Department said in a memo to its employees that most of them had not been exposed to the breach because their data was not housed on the hacked OPM systems  Only those who had previously been employed by another federal agency may have been exposed  it said  Investigators have linked the OPM breach to earlier thefts of personal data from millions of records at Anthem Inc  N ANTM   the second largest U S  health insurer  and Premera Blue Cross  a healthcare services provider  It was the second computer break in in less than a year at OPM  the federal government s personnel office  and the latest in a string of cyber attacks on U S  agencies  some of which have been blamed on Chinese hackers  A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said such accusations had been frequent of late and were irresponsible  Hacking attacks were often cross border and hard to trace  he said  White House spokesman Josh Earnest said   It s not clear who the perpetrators are   but he noted that President Barack Obama and his aides regularly raise with their Chinese counterparts concerns about Chinese behavior in cyberspace  Disclosure of the latest computer breach comes ahead of the annual U S  China Strategic and Economic Dialogue scheduled for June 22 24 in Washington  D C  Cyber security was already expected to be high on the agenda  U S  officials said the talks would proceed as scheduled  as would Obama s plans to host Chinese President Xi Jinping on a state visit to Washington in the fall  U S  LIKELY TO MOVE CAUTIOUSLY At Friday s White House briefing  Earnest dodged the question of whether Washington might retaliate if it was determined that a state had been involved in the hacking  In December  U S  officials moved swiftly to accuse North Korea of being behind a high profile attack on Sony  T 6758  over a movie depicting the assassination of North Korea s leader  and Obama vowed that the United States would respond  Some lawmakers and defense officials want a more aggressive U S  stance against cyber breaches  including legislation to strengthen U S  cyber defenses  But the administration is likely to move cautiously in response to any Chinese role  mindful of the potential harm from escalating cyber warfare between the world s two biggest economies  The Federal Bureau of Investigation has launched a probe of the OPM attack  and vowed that it would bring to account those responsible for the hacking  OPM detected new malicious activity affecting its information systems in April and the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  said it concluded early in May that OPM s data had been compromised and about 4 million workers may have been affected  Hackers hit OPM s IT systems and its data stored at the Department of the Interior s data center  a shared service center for federal agencies  a DHS official said on condition of anonymity  Chinese hackers were also blamed for penetrating OPM s computer networks last year  The New York Times reported last July  citing unnamed U S  officials  James Lewis  a cyber security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank  said the administration s disclosure of the hacking could be a signal to China of Washington s plan to push hard on cyber issues at this month s talks  
 The Chinese have been saying privately  and somewhat in public  that we want the summit to go really well   Let s not talk about espionage  Let s talk about how we can work together    said Lewis  a former State Department official   This might be a U S  response to that   No  we are going to talk about espionage   ",2015-06-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/data-obtained-in-u.s.-government-hack-dates-back-to-1985:-u.s.-official-345277,345277
112739,334254,SNE,Obama vows to boost U S  cyber defenses amid signs of China hacking,news,"By Jeff Mason and Mark Hosenball KRUEN  Germany WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Barack Obama vowed on Monday that the United States would aggressively bolster its cyber defenses  as U S  officials said the probe into a massive breach of federal government networks has yielded growing signs of a direct Chinese role  Obama stopped short of pointing the finger at Beijing for the recent cyber attack  which threatens to overshadow broader annual U S  China talks in Washington this month at a time when tensions are already high over Beijing s pursuit of territorial claims in the South China Sea   We have to be as nimble  as aggressive and as well resourced as those who are trying to break into these systems   Obama told a news conference at the Group of Seven  G7  summit in Germany  U S  officials  speaking on condition of anonymity  have blamed Chinese hackers for breaching the computers of the Office of Personnel Management and compromising the records of up to four million current and former employees in one of the biggest known attacks on U S  federal networks  The mission of the intruders  the officials said  appears to have been to steal personal information for recruiting spies and ultimately to seek access to weapons plans and industrial secrets  Though China has denied involvement  U S  investigators looking into the computer break in  which was disclosed on Thursday  have uncovered  markings   or digital signatures  left by the hackers that indicate it was likely an official Chinese government operation  two officials said on Monday  They did not  however  offer further details as to how they reached that conclusion  Investigators have all but discarded the notion that Chinese criminal elements might have been behind the hacking and believe it was unlikely the Beijing government hired outside hackers  though one official said that possibility had not been completely ruled out  U S  authorities have also begun discussions on whether to go public once they make a final assessment of responsibility  but no consensus on that has emerged  a source familiar with the investigation said  The White House  which has yet to assign blame  has given no sign whether retaliation might be considered  In December  U S  officials moved swiftly to accuse North Korea of being behind a high profile attack on Sony Corp  T 6758  over a movie depicting the assassination of North Korea s leader  and Obama vowed that the United States would respond  But the Obama administration is likely to move cautiously in response to any Chinese role  mindful of the potential harm from escalating cyber warfare between the world s two biggest economies whose interests are closely intertwined  OBAMA CITES  SIGNIFICANT VULNERABILITIES  In Germany on Monday  Obama declined to say whether he believed China was behind the OPM cyber attack  the second in less than a year on the agency that holds personnel data a security clearance information for the federal workforce  But he said the United States has old computer systems with  significant vulnerabilities  and needs to be  much more aggressive  in stepping up defenses  He urged the U S  Congress to move forward on passing cybersecurity legislation   In some cases  it s non state actors who are engaging in criminal activity and potential theft   he said   In the case of state actors  they re probing for intelligence or in some cases trying to bring down systems in pursuit of their various foreign policy objectives   U S  government officials and cyber analysts say Chinese hackers are using high tech tactics to build massive databases that could be used for traditional espionage  such as recruiting spies  or gaining access to secure data on other networks  The latest incident gave the hackers access to a trove of personal information  including birthdates  Social Security numbers  previous addresses and security clearances  One official said the stolen information would enable an intelligence service to chart out relationships among U S  government employees and build pictures of individuals and their families  potentially enabling them to figure out ways to target or blackmail people for espionage purposes  
 I see this an intelligence play by the Chinese to get as much high level information about people as they can   said Mike Walls  a former U S  Navy cyber warfare commander who is now managing director for security operations at EdgeWave  a private cybersecurity firm ",2015-06-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/obama-says-us-needs-to-aggressively-bolster-defenses-against-hackers-345575,345575

112751,334266,SNE,Alibaba Stocks Slips Despite Car Vending Machines  Video Content Deals ,opinion,"Shares of Alibaba   NYSE BABA   were down more than 2  in morning trading Thursday  despite the emergence of several new stories involving the Chinese e commerce giant including details of its plan to build vending machines for cars and its new video content licensing deals 
First  we learned more about Alibaba s deal to help Ford   NYSE F   sell electric vehicles in China  When Alibaba announced the deal last week  it hinted at using large  vending machine  style buildings to help with sales  and today  the company revealed exactly what that experience will look like 

Alibaba s vehicle vending machines do quite a bit more than your traditional candy dispenser  In fact  customers can use the Taobao mobile app  which uses facial recognition software  to arrange a test drive 
Customers then head over to the vending machines  scan their face  and receive their desired test vehicle  These tests can last up to three days  after which the car can be purchased through Taobao or returned to the vending machine  and another model can be tested 
Of course  allowing just about anyone to test drive a car for three days would be relatively risky  Alibaba is relying on its own financial services unit to verify and track drivers  Customers must be Alibaba Super Members and have to reach a certain level on the Zhima credit scoring platform 
The company said that it will open two of its new vending machine stores in January  with one location in Shanghai and another in Nanjing  Eventually Alibaba intends to open  dozens  of the stores throughout China 
Alibaba has roughly outlined its plans to integrate its e commerce services with new age brick and mortar concepts  but these car vending machines are one of the first clear manifestations of the strategy 
In a different vein  the company flexed its video content muscles with a pair of new licensing deals  Indeed  Alibaba announced that its video streaming service  Youku Tudou  just inked deals with Comcast s   NASDAQ CMCSA   NBCUniversal and Sony s   NYSE SNE   Sony Pictures Television 
The multiyear agreements give Youku users access to hundreds of films from the two studios  according to a company statement  Subscribers will also get faster access to newly released films  including Blade Runner and Jumanji  Welcome to the Jungle 
 I am confident that expanding our relationships with more international studios will further enhance our platform s penetration into the home entertainment business and push the online video   said Youku president Yang Weidong said 
The deals are another sign that Alibaba is willing to spend plenty of cash on its entertainment and media units  which management has identified as key growth drivers outside of its core e commerce business  Meanwhile  a deal with Youku represents a significant expansion into the Chinese market for both NBCUniversal and Sony 
Nevertheless  Alibaba shares briefly dipped to an intraday low of  169 91  or about 3 7  lower than Wednesday s close  on Thursday morning  The stock has since rebounded a bit  but shares are on pace to end morning trading in the red

We have been looking for a bottom in the New Zealand dollar  suspecting the market was overreacting to the new Labour New Zealand First government  We expect the pro growth orientation will be rewarded over time  In recent days  the downside momentum faded as the Kiwi approached the lows for the year  set in May near  0 6800  However  the bias was still to sell into rallies  Until today  when the stronger than expected Q3 employment figures spurred a powerful short squeeze 
The Kiwi is up more than 1  to trade at its best levels in a week near  0 6930  The bears may try to make a stand  but we anticipate an upside correction will continue and look for a move toward  0 7000  0 7050  even if a modest pullback is seen first  At the same time  New Zealand shares were hit by profit taking after a strong run  as the Kiwi fell  The 1 15  loss was the largest since March

The FOMC meeting is a low key event  Four hikes into the cycle and the Fed has not managed to hike rates outside of a meeting in which there is a press conference and updated economic projections  It is a shame because that it cuts in half the number of  live  meetings  and denies it greater flexibility  There is not going to be a change of rates today  and there cannot be much of a commitment to hike in December  If it were a done deal  as the vernacular would have it  then the Fed would hike rates now 
We suspect Fed officials have been pleasantly surprised by the continued strength of the economy  and could  in its economic assessment  recognize it  We would not push this point too hard though on the grounds that final domestic sales were rose by an uninspiring 1 8  
The Fed has finished its first month of allowing its balance sheet to shrink  It may adjust the technical section to reflect this  Otherwise  we expect the FOMC statement to be little changed  We note that this will be Governor Quarles first meeting  The market will wait for December s meeting to try to tease out his dot on the plot  For the record  assuming no chance of a rate hike today  and making some allowances for year end behavior  we estimate that fair value for the December Fed fund futures contract would imply a 1 295  yield  It has been fairly steady at 1 275  
The ADP jobs estimate and US auto sales may provide some insight into the economy  but there seems to be an asymmetrical risk   Strong data may spur less of a reaction than weak data because of the response to the storms  ADP showed a 135k increase in jobs in September while the national figure showed a 33k loss  The median Bloomberg survey forecast is for the 200k increase  To put it in some contest  this year s average through August was 221k and last year s average was around 180k 
The key focus for investors is not the number of jobs being created  It is on earnings and wage growth  We will write more about it in the weeks ahead  but we suspect that the Phillip s Curve has been prematurely buried and will  over the next few quarters  make itself more visible  Suffice for the time being to note the importance of wage pressures as a new Fed takes shape early next year  and that the employment cost index  0 8  increase in wages in Q3 2 5  year over year  has begun accelerating 
Auto sales are expected to have slowed from the storm inspired pace of 18 47 mln vehicles in September  Estimates suggest between the two storms that struck as many as 700k vehicles were destroyed  They all are not going to be immediately replaced  though clearly some are being replaced  In the eight months before the storm  the US sold an average  SAAR  of nearly 16 8 mln vehicles a month  This jumped to nearly 18 5 mln in September  It is expected to slow to 17 5 mln  but the risk seems to be on the upside  Note that in October 2016  17 8 mln vehicles were sold  which was the last year until December ",2017-11-01,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/super-48-hours-200257502,200257502
112778,334293,SNE,Sony s Stock Jump Portends Bright Future,opinion,"Sony Corp ADR  NYSE SNE   the tech giant which was once viewed as old and decaying  roared back in dramatic fashion on Tuesday as it reported record profits which smashed analyst expectations  As Reuters reported  Sony s profits from July to September  jumped almost 350 percent to 204 2 billion yen  compared to a profit of 45 7 billion yen during the same period last year  Furthermore   Sony raised its full year operating profit forecast by 26 percent to 630 billion yen  compared to a Thomson Reuter forecast of 585 billion yen 
 Sony s stock value has unsurprisingly surged in value after such impressive results  jumping from  38 to  43  While any such sudden jump will naturally create concerns that investors may be overreacting  this is an appropriate response to Sony s success  Sony has successfully restructured itself into a profitable niche of games  superconductors  and other businesses which have thrived  It also has other avenues to grow into such as artificial intelligence  Investors should legitimately consider buying Sony and watch it continue to grow 
Knowing its Niche
A quick look at Sony s earnings report underlies the reasons for its recent success and how the company has found its niche  In Sony s words  the significant profit increase  was mainly due to the improvements of operating results in the Semiconductors and G NS  Game and Network Services  segments as well as All Other   G NS operating income rose from  19 billion to almost  55 million  while Semiconductors went from a loss of  4 2 billion to an income of  49 billion  Operating income rose in all of Sony s sectors with one exception which will be discussed below 
 Sony s impressive games numbers are hardly a surprise  In addition to the success of the PlayStation 4  the  also points out the importance of the mobile game  Fate Grand Order   which has millions of players as well as a player base willing to spend thousands of dollars to summon historical figures 
 Sony can also point to its success in the semiconductor business  where it has wisely pushed mobile image sensors which can be used with other smart phones  as well as the success of Sony Pictures thanks to  Spider Man  Homecoming   Sony s products are successful practically everywhere  which speaks well to how this company has reorganized itself under the current leadership and has made great decisions 
Growth Opportunities
If this success is not good enough  Sony has made it clear that it does not intend to rest on its laurels even after such success  The company is determined to branch out  with particular emphasis on the increasingly important field of artificial intelligence 
 On Wednesday  Sony announced that it would be bringing back the Aibo  a robotic toy dog which it had first began making back in the 1990s until stopping in 2006   reports that the Aibo will cost over  1 700 and will only be sold in Japan  But what makes this decision so important is that it signifies that Sony is growing more interested in artificial technology  Given how important and lucrative that technology will be  especially in Japan  this is a good sign that the company is staying aggressive 
 Aside from the Aibo  Sony has plenty of major projects to look forward to  The upcoming holiday season means that the PlayStation 4 will see new games such as  Erica  and  Final Fantasy XV  Episode Ignis   and demand for Sony s semiconductors will still remain high  There is no reason to assume that the conditions which have propelled Sony to these heights will fade away soon 
 It should be noted that not everything is quite rosy for Sony  Despite the success in its games department  Sony is not upgrading its games operating profit forecast in light of intense competition from a resurgent Nintendo 
 Furthermore  Sony s mobile department struggled in the quarter  with virtually flat growth and an operating loss of  2 5 billion compared to a profit of  3 7 billion the year before  Sony can point to   but the reality is that Sony s phones are a failure and should be shut down as soon as possible  Given the small size of its phone division  failure here is a not a serious concern 
Growing  Innovative and Profitable
Sony has been successful since the beginning of the year  and there is plenty to like both in its wild success earlier as well as its potential for growth  PS4 sales will continue to thrive as the company adds in new games  and its commitment towards AI research as shown by the Aibo release is a good sign given the growing importance of the field 
 Sometimes  going with the flow is not a terrible idea  The Sony bandwagon is large right now for a reason  and it will continue to thrive going into the holiday season  Sony still has plenty of room to grow  and investors should consider hopping on now rather than later ",2017-11-01,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sonys-stock-jump-portends-bright-future-200257703,200257703

multiple of 58 2  Sony s stock is presently trading at a forward P E multiple of 26 9  which is lower than Dolby  which is trading a multiple of 30 4 Rank   Sub industry RankingWhile both Sony and Dolby currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   the  is ranked  69 out of the 265 industries in Zacks coverage  The Audio Video Production industry currently falls within the top 26  of the 265 different industries tracked by Zacks  Thus  any positive industry developments should benefit both companies Earnings TrendFavorable jobs scenario as well as enhanced consumer confidence has been driving the performance of these consumer and industrial electronic equipment manufacturers Sony has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters with an average earnings beat of 47 3   Dolby is also riding high on impressive market traction of offerings and delivered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters  with an average earnings beat of 44 3  Estimate RevisionsFor 2017  Sony witnessed two upward estimate revisions versus none downward in the last 60 days  increasing the Zacks Consensus Estimate from  2 36 to  2 87  which depicts decidedly bullish analyst sentiment  In contrast  Dolby s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 declined from  2 25 to  2 24 in the same time frame  due to two upward and downward estimate revisions each  indicating somewhat bearish analyst outlook VGM ScoreSince both these consumer and industrial electronic equipment manufacturers are fighting neck and neck  let us fall back on our   This score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and pick the winners Sony is the clear winner here  as it currently boasts a VGM Score of A  while Dolby has a VGM score of D Other Key FactorsSony believes positive industry trends will fuel growth of most of its business segments  Music sales are predicted to be driven by higher than expected Visual Media and Platform sales as well as Recorded Music sales  Additionally  Sony remains confident that it will be able to achieve the targets of its mid range plan set in February 2015  where it expects operating income to go beyond  500 billion yen and 10  or higher Return on Equity Dolby s three impressive projects  namely  Dolby Vision  Dolby Voice and Dolby Cinema  are likely to accelerate growth going forward  Presently  the company is focusing on bolstering its leadership position in audio solutions and bringing new audiovisual experiences to market to grab a greater market share  In terms of fortifying leadership

112814,334329,SNE,3 Consumer Facing Tech Stocks To Buy  ,opinion,"Many investors look for companies and industries they  or someone they re close with  understand well and interact with in a tangible way  This is why consumer facing firms can become investing staples 
Yet  on its face  picking stocks just because they are familiar is far from a strong investment strategy  This is where pairing easily understood companies  from top performing industries  with strong fundamentals can prove very useful 
Today we will look at three companies in the consumer facing electronics world with great Zacks Ranks that also fall within highly ranked industries  whose businesses can also be easily explained 
Sony Corp   NYSE SNE  
This electronics company is a household name around the world and has its hands in everything from cameras and televisions to video games and major motion pictures  as well as behind the scenes technologies such as semiconductors 
Sony is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and sports an  A  VGM score  The company calls the  Audio Video Production  industry home  which is currently within the top 13  of the 265 different industries tracked by Zacks 
Sony s  A  grade for Value in our Style Scores system is backed up by its 0 66 P S ratio  which marks a major discount compared to its industry s average  The company s P B ratio of 1 61 also represents a discount against the  Audio Video Production  average  On top of that  Sony is currently trading below the industry average at 15 60x earnings 
The maker of PlayStation also scored a  B  for Growth in our Style Scores system  based in part on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates that call for massive earnings increases 
Based on our consensus projections  the company s full year earnings per share are set to skyrocket 362 75   What s more  Sony revenues are expected to pop 6 71  to touch as high as  74 75 billion  And within the last 60 days  Sony has received two upward estimate revisions for its full year earnings 
Sony s recent history is also something investors might want to consider  The company crushed earnings estimates in its last two quarters  and its shares have surged over 32  this year  Yet  the company currently sits over 10  below its 52 week high  This fact  accompanied by its large growth projections  and strong value metrics  helps make Sony a potentially enticing stock 
GoPro  Inc    NASDAQ GPRO  
The founding father of action cameras has taken its lumps since going public  to say the least   But over the last three quarters  GoPro has topped earnings expectations and has seen its stock price climb 4 25  since the start of the year  Though GoPro s small gain is well below the S P 500 and the  Audio Video Production  average  it represents a trend in the right direction 
GoPro is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock  which scored  A  grades for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system  And within the last 60 days  GoPro has received four upward earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter  as well as three for its full year 
GoPro s revenues are projected to soar 30 65  in its current quarter  based on our current consensus estimates  On top of quarterly growth  the company s sales are expected to hit  1 35 billion for the full year  which would mark a 12 85  jump  And after a string of down years  GoPro s earnings are projected to skyrocket over 100  this quarter and 99  for its full year 
In terms of its stock price movement  shares of GoPro have gained over 14  in the last 12 weeks   This positive movement has been driven in part by a commitment to its bottom line  which involved restructuring some of its business  as well as new holiday season product launches 
Still  shares of the action camera company sit well below their 52 week high something many investors will like based on its current upward trajectory  GoPro is set to report its third quarter earnings on Nov  1 
Take Two Interactive   NASDAQ TTWO  
Video game powerhouse Take Two Interactive  which owns titles such as NBA 2K  Grand Theft Auto  and others  is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Take Two is also part of the  Toys   Games   Hobbies  industry that currently rests in the top 15  of companies tracked by Zacks 
Take Two has gone on a meteoric rise over the last few years  Shares of Take Two have skyrocketed over 112  so far this year and currently rest just below their all time high of  107 53 which they reached earlier this month 
Take Two could see its stock price continue to climb if investors keep seeing the growth projection they have come to expect  The company sports a  B  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system  and its 28  current cash flow growth blows away the industry s average helping show that Take Two is on a solid growth trajectory 
On top of that  the company has topped earnings estimates often by a wide margin in each of the trailing eight quarters

GuidanceConcurrent with the fiscal second quarter results  Sony revised its revenue guidance for fiscal 2017 upward once again  Currently  the company expects total sales to be around  8 500  up 2 4  from the earlier figure of  8 300  The upward revision is largely attributable to changes in the expected impact of foreign exchange rates  as well as higher sales in Music and HE S segments The company also raised its operating income guidance and now expects it to be around  630 billion  earlier projection   500 billion   a jump of 118 2  from fiscal 2016  Improvements in operating income are anticipated to be driven by growth in Semiconductors Music and HE S segments Per segments  four of the company s divisions  namely GN S  Music  Semiconductors and HE S  are estimated to garner higher revenues than previously expected in August Overall  the GN S segment is anticipated to benefit from an expected increase in PS4 hardware sales as well as network sales  while Music sales are predicted to be driven by higher than expected Visual Media and Platform sales as well as Recorded Music sales  Image sensor unit sales for mobile products will likely drive Semiconductors sales higher  while an expected increase in television unit sales will benefit HE S revenues The forecasts for sales and operating income for the IP S  Pictures and Financial Services segments remain unchanged from the August forecast  On the other hand  MC sales are forecast to be lower than earlier expected due to an expected decrease in smartphone unit sales Our TakeSony s first half of fiscal 2017 was impressive  with spectacular top  and bottom line growth and impressive numbers  The lingering effects of the Kumamoto earthquakes  which had washed out a chunk of its profits for fiscal 2016  have subsided for the most part  Also  the impressive rebound of the Semiconductor business is a major positive and is likely to accelerate the company s growth momentum In addition  Sony s focus on cost saving initiatives  lower exposure in low profit geographic regions  and reduction in advertising and promotion expenses are projected to drive the top line  Over the past few quarters  major restructuring efforts and internal shuffles have helped Sony optimize its business structure  thus raising profitability  This apart  we believe the company s bolt on acquisitions and strategic

112844,334359,SNE,Low Rates  Yet No Inflation  Global Week Ahead,opinion,"For the Global Week Ahead  the newsroom Reuters produced five big themes likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders 
Be mostly concerned about how to solve this riddle  Rates are at record lows  Why no consumer price inflation 
 1  CONSUMER INFLATION STAYS ELUSIVE
Inflation remains elusive in both the United States and the Eurozone  complicating efforts to normalize monetary policy after years of extraordinary stimulus 
U S  inflation will get another reading on Thursday  Sept  14th  A Reuter s poll of economists forecast prices in August rose  0 3   Stripping out the volatile food and energy components  core CPI is expected to rise  1 6  in the 12 months through August  still well below the U S  Fed s  2 0  target 
 2  THE BANK OF ENGLAND MEETS   WEAKER POUND IN PLAY
While the European Central Bank  ECB  struggles with low inflation and a strong currency that exacerbates the problem  the Bank of England  BoE   which meets in the coming week  faces the opposite scenario   above target consumer inflation and a U K  pound that some see falling to parity with the euro 
Traders cite the possibility BoE policymakers might express concern about the weak pound s impact on inflation  Analysts place a one in four chance the pound sterling will reach parity with the euro in the next year 
 3  BANKS WANT HIGHER RATES   ECB HIKES WON T HAPPEN
If anyone needs a  normalization  of monetary policy  it s the banks  Earlier this year  as an improving global economy brought the prospect of steadily rising interest rates  investors scooped up bank shares in a big bet on recovery Yet as ECB President Mario Draghi made clear after last week s policy meeting  rate hikes  which have a major impact on lenders  revenue and profits  remain a distant prospect in the Eurozone 
An index of bank stocks has underperformed the wider market  Not that everyone is giving up on banks  With Eurozone growth picking up so  eventually  must interest rates 
 4  CHINA S YUAN   NEW SAFE HAVEN
Is the Yuan s sudden surge driven by a bid for safe havens against North Korea s nuclear threats  Or has the market taken on board the People s Bank of China s desire to root out depreciation expectations 
The Yuan currency had its best monthly gains ever in August and has wiped out all of the 6 5  losses it suffered against the dollar in 2016  Its rise immediately after North Korea s sixth nuclear test on Sept  3 was two standard deviations more than average daily moves in the past year  far outpacing the gains seen in the yen and gold 
FX reserves rose  11 billion in August  suggesting the People s Bank of China  PBOC  might have reined in the currency through some form of intervention  But it can t do more without giving Washington the ammunition to complain about currency manipulation 
 5  RUSSIA MAY CUT RATES  TO MATCH BRAZIL
Russia s central bank will ponder a cut in its key rate to as low as 8 5  when policymakers meet on Friday  according to a senior official  The bank has already flagged that rate cuts are on the cards 
Brazil s 100 basis point rate cut last Wednesday ramped up the pressure  leaving Russia in the top spot for the highest forward looking real interest rate among major emerging market economies

112845,334360,SNE,Sanderson Farms  Hertz Global  Sony  HSBC And Tencent Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 12  2017    Sanderson Farms Nasdaq    NASDAQ SAFM     as the Bull of the Day  Hertz Global Holdings  NYSE    NYSE HTZ       as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onto Sony Corp  T 6758   NYSE    NYSE SNE       HSBC Holdings  LON HSBA   NYSE    NYSE HSBC      and Tencent Holdings  OTCMKTS    OTC TCEHY      Here is a synopsis of all five stocks   Sanderson Farms Nasdaq        a Zacks Ranked  1  Strong Buy  is a fully integrated poultry processing company engaged in the production  processing  marketing and distribution of fresh and frozen chicken products  The company sells ice pack  chill pack and frozen chicken  in whole  cut up and boneless form  primarily under the Sanderson Farms7 brand name to retailers  distributors  and fast food operators principally in the southeastern  southwestern and western United States Recent Earnings SuccessThe company recently reported Q3 17 earnings where they easily beat both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates for the second consecutive quarter   On a year over year basis the company saw net sales up  28   and net income rose by  111 7    The main drivers behind the great quarterly results were increased market prices and a decline in feed cost  jumbo boneless breast meat prices were up almost  24 5   bulk leg quarters rose by  15 8   and jumbo wing prices increased by  40  while the company s average feed cost per pound fell by  0 32 cents per pound   1 3   compared to the year ago data   Management also stated that they are starting construction this month on a new Tyler Texas facilities  and that their new facility in St Pauls North Carolina is now operating at three quarters capacity and remains on track to reach full capacity in January of 2018 Management s TakeAccording to Joe F  Sanderson  Jr   chairman and chief executive officer   Sanderson Farms  financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 reflect a continued favorable balance of supply and demand for fresh chicken sold to retail grocery store customers  That balance was reflected in relatively strong market prices for that product during the current third fiscal quarter  Market prices for boneless breast meat  bulk leg quarters and jumbo wings produced at our plants that process a larger bird were all higher this year when compared to last year s third fiscal quarter  Food service traffic and demand in the United States remain below pre recession levels  but demand from and the popularity of local chain concepts and restaurants that focus on wings are offsetting reduced traffic at casual dining restaurants  This demand contributed to a good supply and demand balance during the quarter    Hertz Global Holdings NYSE       a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  operates car rental business  The company s product and services consists of Hertz Gold Plus Rewards  NeverLost R   Carfirmations  Mobile Wi Fi and unique vehicles offered through the Adrenaline  Dream  Green and Prestige Collections  It operates primarily in North America  Europe  Latin America  Asia  Australia  Africa  the Middle East and New Zealand  Hertz Global Holdings  Inc  is based in FL  United States Recent Earnings ResultsIn the company s most recent earnings report  Hertz missed the Zacks consensus revenue estimate  and came in short of the Zacks consensus earnings estimate for the fourth consecutive quarter   The company reported a second quarter net income from continuing operations net loss of  158 million   Further  HTZ saw total revenues fall by  2 0   and losses from continuing operations before income taxes for the quarter were  245 million  which included  86 million in impairment charges  the year ago quarter saw only losses of  35 million   Finally  adjusted corporate EBITDA fell from  184 million last year to  35 million this year   Management s TakeAccording to Kathryn V  Marinello  president and chief executive officer of Hertz   We have made significant progress in the first half of the year  executing on our operating turnaround plan  Of course  the hard work always comes before the pay off as reflected in our second quarter results  where increased spending to fix areas of weakness and invest in areas of opportunity were exacerbated by a challenging vehicle residual environment in the U S  On the upside  we have now completed our U S  fleet transformation  redesigned 37 Hertz airport locations for Ultimate Choice  updated our financial and revenue management systems  and introduced new management tools and resources to drive service excellence  Admittedly  we still have a lot of work to do  but these early wins are evidence that we have the right plan in place to ultimately achieve best in class outcomes  Additional content Low Rates  No Inflation  Global Week AheadFor the Global Week Ahead  the newsroom Reuters produced five big themes likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders Be mostly concerned about how to solve this riddle  Rates are at record lows  Why no consumer price inflation  1  CONSUMER INFLATION STAYS ELUSIVEInflation remains elusive in both the United States and the Eurozone  complicating efforts to normalize monetary policy after years of extraordinary stimulus U S  inflation will get another reading on Thursday  Sept  14th  A Reuter s poll of economists forecast prices in August rose  0 3   Stripping out the volatile food and energy components  core CPI is expected to rise  1 6  in the 12 months through August  still well below the U S  Fed s  2 0  target  2  THE BANK OF ENGLAND MEETS   WEAKER POUND IN PLAYWhile the European Central Bank  ECB  struggles with low inflation and a strong currency that exacerbates the problem  the Bank of England  BoE   which meets in the coming week  faces the opposite scenario   above target consumer inflation and a U K  pound that some see falling to parity with the euro Traders cite the possibility BoE policymakers might express concern about the weak pound s impact on inflation  Analysts place a one in four chance the pound sterling will reach parity with the euro in the next year  3  BANKS WANT HIGHER RATES   ECB HIKES WON T HAPPENIf anyone needs a  normalization  of monetary policy  it s the banks  Earlier this year  as an improving global economy brought the prospect of steadily rising interest rates  investors scooped up bank shares in a big bet on recovery Yet as ECB President Mario Draghi made clear after last week s policy meeting  rate hikes  which have a major impact on lenders  revenue and profits  remain a distant prospect in the Eurozone An index of bank stocks has underperformed the wider market  Not that everyone is giving up on banks  With Eurozone growth picking up so  eventually  must interest rates  4  CHINA S YUAN   NEW SAFE HAVENIs the Yuan s sudden surge driven by a bid for safe havens against North Korea s nuclear threats  Or has the market taken on board the People s Bank of China s desire to root out depreciation expectations The Yuan currency had its best monthly gains ever in August and has wiped out all of the 6 5  losses it suffered against the dollar in 2016  Its rise immediately after North Korea s sixth nuclear test on Sept  3 was two standard deviations more than average daily moves in the past year  far outpacing the gains seen in the yen and gold FX reserves rose  11 billion in August  suggesting the People s Bank of China  PBOC  might have reined in the currency through some form of intervention  But it can t do more without giving Washington the ammunition to complain about currency manipulation  5  RUSSIA MAY CUT RATES  TO MATCH BRAZILRussia s central bank will ponder a cut in its key rate to as low as 8 5  when policymakers meet on Friday  according to a senior official  The bank has already flagged that rate cuts are on the cards Brazil s 100 basis point rate cut last Wednesday ramped up the pressure  leaving Russia in the top spot for the highest forward

112859,334374,SNE,At U N  council  U S  calls life in North Korea  living nightmare ,news,"By Louis Charbonneau  UNITED NATIONS  Reuters    The United States and other Western members of the U N  Security Council on Monday slammed North Korea s human rights record after voting to overrule China s objections and add alleged grave abuses by the hermit state to the council s agenda   U S  Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power described life in North Korea as a  living nightmare  and dismissed as absurd Pyongyang s demand for a joint U S  North Korean investigation of the hacking of Sony Pictures and threats of retaliation if the United States refused   North Korea rejected the council move and warned that decisions on how to respond would be made in Pyongyang    The council meeting on North Korea came after a rare procedural vote sparked by China s objections to the inclusion of North Korea on the council s agenda   There were 11 votes in favor  two against and two abstentions  Russia and China voted against the inclusion of North Korea on the council s agenda  but as there are no vetoes in procedural votes of the council  the Chinese attempt to defeat the measure failed   The last time the council held a procedural vote was in 2006  when it added Myanmar to its agenda  Until now  the council s discussions of North Korea have been limited to its nuclear weapons program  But with Monday s vote  all aspects of the country can now be scrutinized by the 15 nation body   Before the vote  China U N  Ambassador Liu Jieyi said  the Security Council is not the forum to get involved in human rights issues  and it  should refrain from doing anything that might cause an escalation    After the vote  a formal meeting on North Korea began immediately  as requested by Australian Ambassador Gary Quinlan and nine other mostly Western ambassadors  He described the council move as  an historic step     The DPRK  North Korea  is in effect a totalitarian state which uses violence and repression against its own citizens to maintain itself and its threatening military apparatus in power   Quinlan said   The regime s atrocities against its own people have created an inherently unstable state    HORRIFIC ACCOUNTS  Monday s meeting comes after the General Assembly on Friday urged the council to consider referring North Korea to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity as alleged in a U N  inquiry report released in February   North Korea did not participate in the meeting  Pyongyang says the rights criticism is based on lies  A North Korean diplomat warned that a decision on how to respond to the Security Council move on Monday  which he blamed on the United States  will come from Pyongyang   In a letter to the council sent on Monday  North Korean Ambassador Ja Song Nam said the council actions were  a politically motivated dangerous attempt to lay a ground for an invasion of the DPRK under the pretext of  human rights     He said it was  the most undisguised manifestation of the hostile policy pursued by the United States against the DPRK    Power cited horrific accounts from defectors who fled North Korean prison camps   accounts Pyongyang dismisses as fabricated     Ahn Myong Chul  a former guard at Prison Camp 22  spoke of guards routinely raping prisoners   she said   In one case in which a victim became pregnant and gave birth  the former guard reported  prison officials cooked her baby and fed it to their dogs    Power also touched on the hacking of Sony Pictures  which Washington blames on North Korea  She dismissed as  absurd  North Korea s calls for a joint investigation of the incident with the United States and threats of retaliation if it refused    It is exactly the kind of behavior we have come to expect from a regime that threatened to take  merciless countermeasures  against the U S  over a Hollywood comedy  and has no qualms about holding tens of thousands of people in harrowing gulags   Power said   North Korea diplomat Kim Song reiterated that his country has  no relation  to the hacking   She urged the council to heed recommendations of the U N  Commission of Inquiry that North Korea be referred to the ICC   Other council members gave similar speeches   The international community cannot ignore such detailed and grave findings   said British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant   The Commission of Inquiry report details wide ranging abuses in North Korea  including prison camps  systematic torture  starvation and killings comparable to Nazi era atrocities    Rarely has such an extensive charge sheet of international crimes been brought to this council s attention   Assistant Secretary General for Human Rights Ivan Simonovic told the council    It documents a totalitarian system that is characterized by brutally enforced denial of the right to freedom of thought  conscience and religion  as well as the rights to freedom of opinion  expression  information and association   he added   Council scrutiny is unlikely to land North Korea at the ICC  which looks at genocide and other crimes against humanity  as China could veto a council referral to the ICC

112897,334412,SNE,Sony CEO ordered  The Interview  toned down  Rogen objected  emails,news,"By Jim Finkle and James Pearson
NEW YORK SEOUL  Reuters    Sony Corp   T 6758  Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai ordered the film  The Interview  to be toned down after Pyongyang denounced it for depicting the assassination of North Korea s leader  according to emails apparently stolen from Sony s Hollywood studio 
The comedy  slated for U S  release on Dec  25  is about journalists played by Seth Rogen and James Franco who are hired by the CIA to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong Un 
According to emails that span from August through October and were obtained by Reuters  Hirai asked Amy Pascal  co chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment  to change a key shot in the film  It depicts Kim struck by a tank shell  causing his head to explode 
Pascal noted to Hirai that she had encountered resistance from the film s creators  including Rogen  who wrote and co directed it 
Hirai s interest in the film shows the company s leadership was worried about Pyongyang s objections  even before a devastating cyber attack on Sony s Hollywood studio network last month that crippled most of it for more than a week 
A Sony Corp  official told Reuters that Hirai rarely reviews specific scenes in films 
North Korea complained to the United Nations in July  accusing the United States of sponsoring terrorism and committing an act of war by allowing production of the movie 
In an exchange with Rogen  Pascal said she was in a difficult position because Hirai had asked her to make changes in the film 
 And this isn t some flunky  It s the chairman of the entire Sony Corporation who I am dealing  with    she said 
Rogen responded by promising to remove three of four burn marks on Kim s face  and reduce the  flaming hair  by 50 percent  But he said he could not meet all the demands 
 The head explosion can t be more obscured than it is because we honestly feel that if it s any more obscured  you won t be able to tell it s exploding and the joke won t work   he said 
Representatives for Rogen declined to comment 
Details of the emails were reported late on Tuesday by Bloomberg News 
More than 100 gigabytes of information purportedly stolen from Sony have been released on the Internet  according to cybersecurity experts  who say the documents appear to be authentic 
Rogen initially told Pascal he objected to requests to modify the death scene  which he said would be viewed as censorship and hurt sales 
 This is now a story of Americans changing their movie tomake North Koreans happy   he said in an Aug  15 email   That is a very damning story

112907,334422,SNE,Sony  DineEquity And Tenet Healthcare As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   August 21  2017   Zacks Equity Research highlightsSony  NYSE   NYSE SNE      as the Bull of the Day DineEquity  NYSE   NYSE DIN      as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Tenet Healthcare Corp   NYSE   NYSE THC      Here is a synopsis of all three stocks   Though some investors might be worried about Japanese stocks in the current geopolitical environment  several are intriguing values right now  One such company is Sony  NYSE       as this Japanese giant is firing on all cylinders and could be an interesting choice for investors Why you might ask  Well  the company is really turning things around on the earnings and sales fronts  and that is very evident from the company s most recent report  Let s take a look at some of the key factors to get a better idea of what makes Sony such an intriguing pick right now Recent EarningsThe most important thing for Sony is the company s latest earnings release  In the report  Sony posted earnings of 56 cents per share which easily beat out the consensus estimate of 48 cents per share  The strength of this beat was largely predicated on newfound positive trends in the semiconductor and imaging divisions Imaging went from an operating income of 7 5 billion yen a year ago to 23 2 billion yen today  while the semiconductor market saw an even more dramatic turnaround  This went from a loss of 43 5 billion yen a year ago to a positive operating income of 55 4 billion yen in the most recent quarter Continued strength is expected in these divisions going forward too  as both saw a boost to their forecasts  And with a number of other areas of the business humming along  there is plenty of reason to like Sony right now Other FactorsAnalysts also seem to be embracing the trend  as we haven t seen a single cut to the full year consensus estimate in the past two months for Sony stock  Instead  we have seen the full year consensus increase by nearly 10  in the past two months  while the following year earnings consensus has risen by 7 4  in the same time frame Additionally  the sector and industry trend has also been impressive for Sony and its industry at large too  SNE s industry was actually ranked in the bottom 10  two months ago  but has moved up to the top 10  since then  This is a dramatic turnaround  and it underscores the strength in this market as of late  No wonder Sony has been able to move up to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   and why good times could be ahead for shares of this name in the near term Bear It has been an extremely rough stretch for companies in the restaurant space Competitive pressures have been increasing  and it is clear that consumer tastes are changing as well  So  for companies representing the old guard of the restaurant chain world  such as DineEquity  NYSE      and its IHOP and Applebee s brands  it has been an especially difficult time But the pain might not be ending just yet  as companies like DineEquity make actually have some more weakness in their near future  This is especially clear if we look to recent earnings estimate revisions for a guide to how DIN stock may be positioned for the months ahead Recent Estimates Despite a recent earnings beat  things are not looking good for DIN shares  The company saw earnings slump by over 18  when compared to the year ago period  while revenues declined and missed estimates on top of that The company also revised its comps forecast lower  and is looking for a decline of 6  8  for its Applebee s brand this year  Add this to the fact that the company is looking to close more restaurants for both its IHOP and Applebee s brands than first anticipated  and you don t exactly have a recipe for stock success No wonder analysts have been slashing their estimates as of late  The current quarter consensus has fallen from  1 20 share 60 days ago  to just 88 cents a share now  The current year and following year consensus estimates have also been on the move lower  falling a double digit percentage level in the same time frame Additional content Tenet Healthcare  THC  Rallies on Board s UpheavalOn Friday  shares of healthcare services company Tenet Healthcare Corp   NYSE      were rallying  up over 11  in morning trading after two members of the company s board of directors resigned   board members Randy Simpson and Matt Ripperger notified the 10 members of Tenet s board of directors of their decision in a joint letter on Thursday  citing  irreconcilable differences   Simpson and Ripperger had joined the board early last year  and are both partners at Glenview Capital Management LLC However  with the members  departure brings the potential for a possible proxy fight  Simpson s and Ripperger s resignations apparently end a  standstill  agreement that prevented Glenview from  evaluating other ways to be a constructive owner of Tenet   they wrote in their letter  but continued   Glenview remains fully committed to its ownership stake in Tenet and its desire to drive improved performance  culture and valued  Tenet is one of the largest hospital owners in the United States  THC is currently a  3  Hold  on the Zacks Rank  with a VGM score of  B   Shares of Tenet have lost well over 14  year to date  as the company was affected by the ongoing healthcare bill talks earlier this year 4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market s record highs  but picking the

112956,334471,SNE,Japan Completes Longest GDP Growth Stretch In A Decade  5 Picks,opinion,"In a sign that Prime Minister Abe s stimulus policies were having their desired impact  data released on Thursday showed that Japan s economy had expanded for the fifth successive quarter  The rise in Japan s GDP overshadowed the improvements experienced in the U S during the first quarter  bringing the world s third largest economy squarely into focus 
While sluggish inflation continues to be a worry  steady gains over successive quarters suggests that Japan s growth trajectory is stabilizing  Meanwhile  the recent pickup in consumption is likely to deal with the inflation situation in the near future  which makes this a good time to invest in stocks from Japan 
Record Stretch of GDP Gains
During the first quarter  Japan s GDP increased by 0 5  on a quarterly basis and at a 2 2  annualized rate  Most analysts and market watchers had expected GDP to come in at 1 7   which the figure exceeded by a significant margin  Growth also hit its fastest pace since the same period last year  Moreover  Japan s economy has now expanded for five successive quarters 
This is the also longest stretch of gains recorded since 2005 06  During that period  the economy expanded for six successive quarters  This time around  growth was fueled by an increase in household expenditure and higher export levels  Exports increased by 8 9   marking the third successive quarter of gains  This was a result of a rise in global demand  particularly for tech related items 
Household expenditure increased by 1 4   primarily due to an increase in the demand for durable goods  This was the fifth successive quarterly increase for household spending  even though previous increases have been largely moderate in nature   
Inflation Remains a Worry  Household Spending the Key
Even though the increase in GDP provided proof of steady economic improvement  Japan s economy minister pointed out that the country was yet to overcome sluggish inflation levels  Economy minister Nobuteru Ishihara s concerns are justified  since the economy actually contracted by 0 1  in nominal terms  Most corporations remain reluctant to raise price levels  Such a tendency persists despite the fact that a soft yen and rising fuel prices are driving up the cost of imported materials 
However  the increase in household expenditure  which contributes nearly 60  of GDP  comes as a welcome development  Such increases are crucial for Abenomics  success going forward  Abe s stimulus program seeks to increase wages  expenditure and prices and this chain of increases is the key to Japan s economic success going forward 
Our Choices
Successive expansions in Japan s GDP indicate that the country s economy is in fine fettle  The fact that these gains have been powered by higher consumption and a rise in exports is particularly heartening  since it provides a firm basis for future gains

112993,334508,SNE,Sony  SNE  Reports Lackluster Q2 Earnings  Guidance Tepid,opinion,"Sony Corp  T 6758     NYSE SNE   reported second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings per share of  3 76  4 cents   down 85 6  from the year ago tally 
The earnings plunge is largely attributable to dismal top line performance and poor operating income  Other factors including currency headwinds  damage and restoration costs related to the Kumamoto earthquake and impairment charge associated with the planned transfer of the battery business also weighed on the bottom line performance 
Inside the Headlines
In the quarter  Sony s sales and operating revenues were down 10 8  year over year to  1 688 9 billion   16 7 billion   Net sales also declined 15 1  to  1 411 9 billion   14 0 billion  
Sony s lackluster revenues resulted from the weak performance of six of its nine segments  Foreign currency headwinds and the aftermath of Kumamoto earthquakes also proved to be a major drag on second quarter revenues  
Additionally  operating income came in at  45 7 million   453 million  compared with the year ago tally of  88 million  Primarily  the deterioration of operating results at the Semiconductors and Components segments more than offset the improvements recorded in the Pictures and Mobile Communications   MC   segments 
The Music segment experienced an 8 0  rise in sales and operating revenues to  150 2 billion   1 487 million  on a year over year basis  buoyed by an increase in Recorded Music and Visual Media   Platform sales  Strong performance of the game application   Fate Grand Order   for mobile devices drove Visual Media   Platform sales  Recorded music sales were supported by Celine Dion s Encore unsoir  Nogizaka46 s Hadashi de Summer and Kana Nishino s Just Love 
Pictures Segment s sales and operating revenues were up 4 6  year over year to  192 1 billion   1 902 million   Higher sales of Motion Pictures  Television Production and Media Networks acted as primary growth drivers for this segment  Blockbusters  including Ghostbusters  Sausage Party and Don t Breathe  propelled Theatrical revenue growth during the quarter  While higher subscription  video on demand licensing revenues  for shows like The Crown and The Get Down drove Television Production revenues  higher advertising revenues in India and Latin America fueled Media Networks  growth 
Financial Services revenues jumped 23 6  year over year to  260 5 billion   2 279 million   Improvement of revenues at Sony Life  driven by a rise in the Japanese stock market  boosted the performance of this segment 
Sales and operating revenues at the Game   Network Services   GN S   segment fell 11 3  year over year to  319 9 billion   3 167 million   Currency fluctuations and price reduction of Play Station 4   PS4   hardware more than offset the improvements in PS4 software sales 
MC s sales and operating revenues tumbled 39 6  year on year to  168 8 billion   1 671 million  stemmed by the decrease in mid range smartphone unit sales as well as reduction in smartphone unit sales in unprofitable region  This segment is in the midst of a transformation as Sony has decided to prune its non profitable businesses to optimize growth 
The Home Entertainment   Sound   HE S   segment witnessed an18 7  year on year decline in sales and operating revenues to  234 9 billion   2 326 million   Foreign currency fluctuations acted as major dampeners  along with decrease in home audio and video unit sales 
Additionally  Semiconductors sales and operating revenues declined 5 0  year over year to  193 7 billion   1 918 million   Weak image sensors sales had more than offset higher image sensors sales for mobile products  resulting in the overall decline 
Components sales and operating revenues plummeted 23 7  year on year to  46 7 billion   462 million   Prolonged weakness in battery business  along with foreign currency headwinds weighed on sales 
Moreover  the Imaging Products   Solutions   IP S   segment recorded a 25 2  year over year drop in sales and operating revenues to  135 4 billion   1 340 million   Hindrance in procuring components since the Kumamoto earthquakes has hurt sales of Still and Video cameras  adding to Sony s woes  Also  a general contraction of this market and foreign currency headwinds aggravated the fall 
Liquidity   Cash Flow
As of Sep 30  2016  Sony s cash and cash equivalents were  525 2 billion   5 200 million   down from   983 6 billion recorded at the end of Mar 31  2016 
Long term debt totaled  654 9 billion   6 484 million  compared with  556 6 million as of Mar 31  2016

Based on the present market scenario  Sony has revised the forecast for consolidated operating income downward by  30 billion compared with the July forecast  Also  a loss of approximately  37 5 billion is projected to be recorded in the company s net income  Sony anticipates incurring impairment charge of approximately  33 0 billion on account of transfer of the battery business 
As a matter of fact  a loss of  33 0 billion associated with the transfer of the battery business to Murata Manufacturing  is responsible for this downcast operating income outlook  Also  an anticipated rise in operating loss in the Components segment is expected to hamper the operating income 
In addition  the Kumamoto earthquake is expected to have a negative impact of  10 5 billion and  39 5 billion on consolidated operating income of the IP S segment and Semiconductors segment  Meanwhile  Sony affirmed that the sales of these two segments are expected to be lower than the level anticipated prior to the earthquakes 
As per segments  Sony believes that the estimated fall in smartphone sales will hurt Mobile communications sales more than what was predicted earlier  Better than expected improvement in product mix and cost reduction initiatives is expected to benefit operating income of this segment  Sales and operating income forecast of the G S segment remains unchanged  While higher network sales are expected to benefit this segment  deferrals in launch date of software titles may act as a spoilsport 
IP S segments  sales are expected to be higher than the previous forecasts as timely recovery in the supply of components of still  video cameras after the Kumamoto are proving to be conducive to segment s growth  Also  an uptick in LCD television sales has caused the company revise the sales expectations of the HE S segment  Similarly  Sony expects better sales at the Semiconductors segment on account of increased demand for image sensors and timely recovery of production sites after the earthquake 
However  sales for both Components and Pictures segment have been revised downward  While dismal sales of and recording media is expected to play a dampener for Components segment  Pictures segment is likely to take a beating from the weakening Media Networks revenues and the negative influence of the appreciation of the Yen  For its other two segments  namely Music and Financial Services segments  sales forecasts remain unchanged 
SONY CORP ADR Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 
   To Conclude
Sony s second quarter fiscal 2016 performance was quite similar to the previous one  wherein both bottom and top line declined significantly  on a year over year basis  Also  the downcast outlook may be an additional disappointment for investors  Precipitous decline in sales across multiple segments  including Mobile Communications  Home Entertainment   Sound  Semiconductors and Components  is adding to the company s woes  Also  currency fluctuations are thwarting the sales growth of the GN S segment  the company s key profit churner  
This apart  the Kumamoto earthquakes are also proving to be a major drag on the company s financials  Also  the recent shift of the battery business may continue to exert pressure on the company s margins in the near term 
Despite these negatives  Sony has braved most headwinds  leveraging on the strength of its flagship gaming product  PlayStation  PS   PS4 hardware and software sales have surpassed all the previous versions  bolstering Sony s revenues to a great extent 
Going forward  we believe that the launch of the PlayStation s VR headset  interesting lineup of PS4 games and strategic collaborations to expand its portfolio will act as meaningful growth drivers  Also  we perceive that diligent changes in its internal administration and uptick of sales in MC  HE S and IP S segments signal brighter days ahead for this Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company

112994,334509,SNE,GoPro  GPRO  Q3 Earnings  Will The Stock Beat Estimates ,opinion,"GoPro  Inc    NASDAQ GPRO   is slated to report third quarter 2016 results after the closing bell on Nov 3 
In the preceding quarter  the company bucked the trend after a hat trick of negative surprises and posted an earnings beat of 11 1   Still  on average  the company has missed estimates by 28 6  over the trailing four quarters 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
This was a happening quarter for GoPro  as it brought to market its first significant update to its flagship line of action cameras in two years   the new Hero5 Black camera and the smaller  cube shaped Hero5 Session  The Hero5 is attractively priced   100 less than the previous version at launch  and boasts several new  interesting features  It s reasonable to assume that the new camera will spark interest among consumers 
The action camera maker also launched its first drone   Karma  This is likely to open a fresh revenue stream for the company  We believe that Karma will draw huge attraction from consumers as the first drone from an established brand with a huge  loyal fan base and boost revenues for the company 
Presently  GoPRo is developing various types of software solutions and hardware to curtail the complexity of managing  editing and sharing contents on different media platforms  Its decision to emphasize on software solutions that make it more convenient for users to offload  access and edit their content will prove to be a significant step in the right direction for the company  The company s efforts to improve software solutions  and transform itself from a camera maker to content maker have been quite successful 
In fact  during the quarter  GoPro unveiled an app named Quik  which will enable users to instantly edit GoPro footage on their phones and create short videos for networking sites like Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Instagram  This should bolster the company s revenues as users shift to paid subscriptions in order to take advantage of the same 
GoPro has had a tough time of late  with ill timed product missteps   delays  strategic pricing errors  and intense competition from Sony Corporation   NYSE SNE    However  the action camera maker has done a great job of clearing out channel inventory and streamlining its product portfolio  It has also taken huge strides in developing content distribution and software recently 
Steep declines in sales of the company s HERO4 session cameras owing to increased adoption of its HERO4 black and silver cameras have been hurting the company s overall revenues in recent times  GoPro seems to be standing on the edge of a huge turnaround and it depends largely on the success of Hero5 cameras and the Karma drone 
After three quarters of sharp year over year revenue declines  GoPro has finally created a product lineup that could potentially reverse the trend  We believe that the new products and software updates will provide a much needed boost to GoPro s top line 
GOPRO INC A Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 
   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that GoPro will beat earnings estimates in this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for the company is currently pegged at 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 54 cents 
Zacks Rank  GoPro s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP as well to be confident about an earnings beat 
Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Rank  4 or  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some companies that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Avon Products Inc    NYSE AVP    slated to release earnings results on Nov 3  has an Earnings ESP of  33 33  and a Zacks Rank  1 You can see  
Ball Corporation   NYSE BLL    scheduled to release results on Nov 3  has an Earnings ESP of  5 44  and a Zacks Rank  2

113019,334534,SNE,Will The Karma Drone Help GoPro Soar To Its Past Highs ,opinion,After an uninspiring couple of years  GoPro  Inc    NASDAQ GPRO   finally seems to have a few ace gadgets up its sleeve  Following weeks of attention grabbing teasers  the action camera maker officially unveiled its first drone   Karma   at an event in Squaw Valley  CA yesterday GoPro also launched the first significant update to its flagship line of action cameras in two years   the new Hero5 camera  and the smaller  cube shaped Hero5 Session GoPro shares were up 8  at one time during the much awaited event  but later fell and closed 2 3  higher Karma  The SpecificationsPriced at  799  the Karma is a compact  sleek quadcopter  with props that fold into the device  It has one button for takeoff  landing  and returning to home and comes with four pre programmed shots  dronie  cable cam  reveal  and orbit GoPro s Karma works with a controller that has two joysticks  a few buttons and a touch screen  Its simple design makes it easy to use for amateurs  with several pre set routes to take neat selfies and videos with gradual reveals of landscapes GoPro is also offering a  passenger app  that allows another person to see the live video feed from the drone and even control the camera position  The front positioning of the camera is intended to help eliminate the appearance of rotors  which can crop up in shots with DJI or Yuneec drones  when they fly forward at full tilt A distinctive feature of the camera is that it easily detaches from the drone and attaches to a handheld gimbal  The drone can be hooked up to Hero4  Hero5  and the Session cameras We believe that as the first drone from an established brand with a huge  loyal fan base  Karma will draw huge attraction from consumers The Hero5 CamerasThe company also showcased the latest version of its signature line of cameras   the Hero5   and the smaller Hero5 Session  The Hero5 is now waterproof without additional casing and includes GPS with a great voice control feature which supports 7 languages  The company has also improved its image stabilization pre edit  which can ensure really smooth footage at break neck speeds  Further  Hero5 Session   a simpler  smaller version of the Hero5  can now shoot video in 4K resolution GoPro also unveiled an app Quik  which will enable users to instantly edit their GoPro footage on their phones and create short videos for networking sites like Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Instagram The Karma hits stores on Oct 23 and the new camcorders are scheduled to go commercial on Oct 2  GoPro s drone   which comes with a backpack and controller   can be packaged with the Hero5 Black and Hero5 Session for  1 099 and  999  respectively Karma s Hand in GoPro s FateKarma has entered the burgeoning market for consumer drones as one of the first models that is more than a plaything  However  the market is already stuffed with devices from companies like DJI  Yuneec and 3D Robotics  Further  the quadcopter is releasing at a time when several cities and businesses are restricting such aircraft from their skies Analysts expect GoPro to sell about 100 000 drones this year  generating sales of over  50 million  While this figure might be somewhat insignificant for a company that posts  1 5 billion in annual revenues  we believe that it could restore the company to profitability  GoPro has had a tough time of late  with ill timed product missteps   delays  strategic pricing errors  and intense competition from Sony Corporation   NYSE SNE   and China s Xiaomi With Karma  GoPro is veering outside its core video capturing devices  and its success or failure is likely to shape the company s immediate future  This winter holiday season will be a test for consumers  appetite for the new products  and is likely to foretell the success of the new drone Summing UpGoPro s last action camera upgrade   the Hero4   was outrageously successful  and drove a spike in sales and record profits  However  the craze eventually died away and the company s stab at a new design   the Hero4 Session   faltered GOPRO INC A Price and Consensus   GoPro s revenues plunged to almost half year over year in the first half of 2016  However  the action camera maker has done a great job of clearing out channel inventory and streamlining its product portfolio  It has also taken huge strides in developing content distribution and software recently After three quarters of sharp year over year revenue declines  GoPro has finally created a product lineup that could potentially reverse the trend  However  in order to achieve its full year sales target  it needs to generate about 70  of the same in the second half of 2016  compared to an average of 58  over the past four years  The Hero5 is attractively priced   100 less than the previous version at launch  and boasts several new  interesting features  It s reasonable to assume that the new camera will spark interest  However  Karma seems more of a wild card  GoPro will have to contend with ample competition in that market  but again  GoPro has priced its drone very competitively  which should work in its favor It will be quite interesting to track GoPro s stock price gyrations  as consumers absorb and decide whether Karma and Hero5 are good enough to change this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock s dwindling fortunes Stocks to ConsiderA couple of better ranked stocks in the broader consumer discretionary sector include Electronic Arts Inc    NASDAQ EA   and Hasbro Inc    NASDAQ HAS    both carrying a

113037,334552,SNE,Sony  SNE  Q1 Earnings   Sales Fall Y Y  Guidance Slashed,opinion,Sony Corp  T 6758     NYSE SNE   has managed to swing back to profits in the first quarter after posting losses in the prior quarter  The company reported first quarter fiscal 2016 earnings per share of  16 44  16 cents   down 76 6  from the year ago tally The bottom line decline is largely attributable to escalating charges related to the Semiconductors segment after the Kumamoto earthquakes  Also  dull top line performance and foreign currency headwinds affected the bottom line performance Inside the HeadlinesIn the quarter  Sony s sales and operating revenues were down 10 8  year over year to  1 613 2 billion   15 7 billion   Net sales also declined 9 3  to  1 362 5 billion   13 2 billion  Sony s unimpressive top line performance resulted from weak performance of six of its nine segments  Foreign currency headwinds and the aftermath of Kumamoto earthquakes also proved to be a major drag on first quarter revenues  Additionally  operating income came in at  56 2 million   546 million  compared with the year ago tally of  96 9 million  Primarily  the deterioration of operating results at the Semiconductors segment more than offset the improvements recorded in the Game   Network Services   GN S   and Mobile Communications   MC   segments Sales and operating revenues at the G NS segment increased 14 5  year over year to  330 4 billion   3 208 million   As expected  phenomenal PS4 software sales  including sales through network  drove growth at this segment  However  currency fluctuations and soft PlayStation3 hardware and software sales acted as headwinds The Music segment experienced an 8 7  rise in sales and operating revenues to  141 5 billion   1 374 million  on a year over year basis buoyed by an increase in Recorded Music and Visual Media   Platform sales  U S  pop sensation Beyonce s Lemonade album sales drove Recorded Music growth during the first quarter Pictures Segment s sales and operating revenues rose 6 9  year over year to  183 3 billion   1 780 million   Higher sales of Motion Pictures and Media Networks acted as primary growth drivers for this segment  The Angry Birds Movie  the strongest crowd pulling animation this summer  propelled Theatrical revenue growth during the quarter  Also  higher advertising revenues in India and Latin America fuelled Media Networks growth However  Financial Services revenues dropped 16 7  year over year to  232 7 billion   2 259 million   Deterioration at Sony Life proved to be a drag on revenues MC s sales and operating revenues tumbled 33 7  year on year to  185 9 billion   1 805 million  due to the decrease in smartphone unit sales as a result of the company s decision to prune this business  Overall sluggishness in smartphone sales across the globe added to Sony s woes The Home Entertainment   Sound   HE S   segment witnessed a 6 8  year on year decline in sales and operating revenues to  235 9 billion   2 290 million   Foreign currency fluctuations acted as a major dampener  offsetting the improvement in LCD television unit sales Additionally  Semiconductors sales and operating revenues declined 22 9  year over year to  144 4 billion   1 402 million  on account of weak image sensors sales  Also  factors including the Kumamoto earthquakes  lower demand from mobile makers and foreign exchange rates compounded the fall Components sales and operating revenues tumbled 22 7  year on year to  44 1 billion   1 805 million   Prolonged weakness in battery business coupled with foreign currency headwinds weighed on sales Moreover  the Imaging Products   Solutions   IP S   segment recorded a 25 8  year over year decline in sales and operating revenue to  122 2 billion   1 187 million   Hindrance in procuring components since the Kumamoto earthquakes has impacted sales of Still and Video cameras  adding to Sony s woes  Also  a general contraction of this market further aggravated the fall Liquidity   Cash FlowAs of Jun 30  2016  Sony s cash and cash equivalents were  631 1 billion   6 127 million   down from   983 6 billion recorded at the end of Mar 31  2016 Long term debt totaled  533 7 billion   5 182 million  compared with    556 6 million as of Mar 31  2016 GuidanceBased on the present market scenario  Sony has revised its forecast for fiscal 2016  year ending Mar 31  2017  downward  The company now expects sales to be affected by stronger currency headwinds as well as lackluster sales in MC  Pictures and G NS On a year over year basis  consolidated operating income is expected to improve marginally on the back of better operating results at the MC and G NS segments  Sony has reiterated this operating income guidance  Meanwhile  the earthquake is expected to impact sales by  26 billion and  48 billion at the IP S and Semiconductors segment  respectively  Sony affirmed that since the sales of these two segments are expected to be lower than the level anticipated prior to the earthquakes  it will result in total expected negative impact on consolidated operating income of approximately  80 billion As per segments  Sony believes that expected decrease in smartphone sales and foreign exchange rates will hurt  Mobile communications sales more than what was expected earlier  This might aggravate the deterioration of sales at this segment  Sales of G S  Pictures and HE   S are also expected to be lower than the earlier forecast on account of negative currency effects  Similarly  sales at the Semiconductors and Components segments are also expected to be lower  While lower than expected image sensor sales are expected to hurt the Semiconductors segment  a lackluster battery business is likely to dent margins at the Components segment However  sales at Music and Financial Services are expected to remain in line with the guidance provided earlier  Impressive performance of Recorded Music and Visual Media are expected to boost Music sales  IP S is the only segment for which Sony has raised the sales guidance  banking on factors like the shorter than expected delay in the supply of components used for still and video cameras SONY CORP ADR Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Going ForwardSony started fiscal 2016 on a rather dull note with bottom and top line declines on a year over year basis  Also  the downward guidance revision by the company is not likely to go well with investors  At present  the company is making concerted efforts to fend off the challenges posed by the Kumamoto earthquake at the beginning of the year  However  tepid sales across multiple segments including Mobile Communications  Home Entertainment   Sound  Semiconductors and Components signal at no immediate respite  In addition  currency fluctuations continue to pose as a major concern for the beleaguered Japanese conglomerate Despite these challenges  the company s Games business is expected to be its strongest growth driver  as signaled by robust console sales and increase in subscribers to its PlayStation network  Also  Sony has high expectations from the Virtual reality field  which allows it to leverage from several of its capabilities like cameras and shooting  content production capabilities and entertainment assets During the first quarter of 2016  Sony s gaming division  Sony Interactive Entertainment America LLC   SIEA    unveiled an attractive line up of PS4 including Days Gone  Spider Man  LEGO Star Wars  The Force Awakens  God of War  Death Stranding  Final Fantasy XV  Resident

113057,334572,SNE,Virtual Reality Revolution  4 Stocks Set To Cash In,opinion,"Envision moving from your couch to a land where dragons still soar throughout the skies  or onto a dogsled in the middle of Antarctica  within a manner of seconds  Virtual Reality  VR  stands to do just that  and has made significant progress in recent years  as the once humble technology has seemingly entered the mainstream 
With this year s release of the Oculus Rift  HTC s Vive along with the expected Fall release of Sony s   NYSE SNE   Playstation VR  the budding industry is slowly but surely teeming with activity  As new as the industry may be  firms are already beginning to see notable sales 
Before discounting VR as a fad and moving on  it is important to note that it is an already marketable venture  According to   Samsung  KS 005930  has already seen sales of 5 million units worldwide of their Gear VR product  while Facebook s   NASDAQ FB   Oculus Rift has sold 3 6 million units  Not too far behind is the HTC Vive with sales of 2 1 million units and the not yet released Sony Playstation VR with 1 4 million unit sales 
Although this is an industry that many know little to nothing about  it has the potential to serve as a notable source of revenue for firms moving forward  and could be in as many as 9 6 million households by the end of the year  Let s take a look at four firms for whom  if all goes well  will benefit greatly from VR 
Sony 
Sony is currently developing the Playstation VR  dubbed  Project Morpheus   Part of what separates it from competing VR products is the fact that it does not require a PC for use  as    
PSVR is slated for release on October 13th at a price of  400  It connects to the Playstation 4 and is a headset that will be used along with the Playstation Eye and the Move controller  Sony s counter to the WiiMote from Nintendo   OTC NTDOY    This remote is part of the critique of the product  with some arguing that it does not allow for precise enough control 
The critique is met equally by those satisfied with the pricing  especially when compared to Oculus Rift s  599 and the HTC Vive s hefty  799 price tags  Should their release go well  SNE will be on track for a great 2016 
Alphabet
Alphabet Inc    NASDAQ GOOGL   has been busy in the world of VR  partnering with New York Times to distribute nearly two million copies of Google Cardboard  their low cost VR creation  The cardboard device has a cell phone insert and special lenses through which users can view articles  images  videos  play games  and participate in virtual field trips 
GOOGL also invested  542M in tech startup Magic Leap in October of 2014  The firm makes use of Augmented Reality  AR  glasses and creates holograms that users can see within their field of vision when using the glasses 
GOOGL has a separate VR division which is head by Clay Bavor  Not much is available on their secret VR project  titled  Project Tango   but consumers have high expectations 
Facebook
Facebook first entered the VR scene when it purchased Oculus Rift in March of 2014  Released on March 28th of this year  Oculus Rift has advanced motion tracking  having reduced lag to just two milliseconds 
CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes that Oculus will be used for more than video games  such as experiences like movies  courtside basketball games  and in an educational setting  to name a few  According to   VR hardware sales are projected over  2B  the bulk of which is expected to comprise of sales from HTC s Vive and the Oculus Rift with the PSVR to follow suit later in the year 
GoPro
GoPro   NASDAQ GPRO   first made progress towards VR in April of 2015 when it acquired the startup firm Kolor  an acquisition meant to enhance video editing and help with Odyssey  their 360 degree video capture product 
GoPro has a partnership with Google  through which they can upload 360 degree YouTube videos that can be watched using Google Cardboard  The success of Google s VR division will directly benefit GPRO as well 
The 16 camera Odyssey is currently priced at  15 000 and is currently only available to  certain industry professionals  as per their official website 
Bottom Line
VR is very much still an industry in its infancy  but therein lies the potential  Each of these firms are very large companies that derive revenues from a variety of sources  Because of this  VR will likely not have a major effect on their bottom lines just yet  However  should VR technology really take off  they are worth watching in the long term 
Although these firms have an opportunity to capitalize on VR  whether or not they will follow through on expectations is something that investors will find out in due time ",2016-06-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/virtual-reality-revolution:-4-stocks-set-to-cash-in-200138518,200138518

 Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is looking for a loss of 57 cents per share on  210 46 million  right in line with Wall Street
Demand for action cameras is hitting an all time low as the market reaches its saturation point
GoPro shares are down 75  in the past 12 months and should continue to flounder as growth declines
What are you expecting for  
Shares of GoPro jumped over 13  early last week despite any company related news  Rather it was the hit mobile app Pokemon Go and the excitement surrounding AR VR technology that pushed shares higher  GoPro has been one of the most beaten down tech stocks since its IPO 2 years ago 
Its troubles extend each and every quarter as growth continues to reach new lows  Investors are hopeful that the beleaguered action camera maker can turn it around things around with strong Q2 earnings this Tuesday  However  early indications suggest shareholders shouldn t get their hopes up 
The Estimize consensus is looking for a loss of 57 cents per share on  210 46 million  right in line with Wall Street  Compared to a year earlier this represents a resounding 256  decline on the bottom line and 49  on the top  Estimates have seen heavy downward revisions over the past 3 months  typically a sign that a weak report is in on the way  The market for action cameras has changed dramatically in a very short time   GoPro s core products were in vogue at the time of its IPO but have now become an afterthought to today s best technology  Consequently  growth has significantly decelerated over the past 8 quarters  turning negative in Q4 2015 
In fact  last quarter saw earnings dip  363  with sales close behind at  50   Its most recent product  the Hero4  has been largely disappointing  continuing to miss sales forecast since its debut  In fact  GoPro was forced to cut the price of its newest camera in half in order to drive sales 
Investors are hopeful new products and a potential transition to AR VR technology can jumpstart shares  GoPro expects to launch its Hero5 and Karma drone later this quarter which will feature upgraded video resolution 
It won t be surprising if both products fall flat given the market is reaching saturation  XIaomi and Sony Corp  NYSE SNE  have effectively closed the gap with GoPro by offering similar products at a fraction of the price 
Since action camera s aren t particularly an important or necessary device  it s easy to see why consumers would opt for a cheaper one  Until GoPro breaks ground in AR VR technology  which is what this most recent pop might be indicating  then don t expect things to change anytime soon  Do you think GPRO can beat estimates ",2016-07-27,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-in-the-world-happened-to-gopro-200144342,200144342

113072,334587,SNE,Sony Offers Lukewarm Fiscal 2016 Guidance  Stock Flat,opinion,Multinational conglomerate Sony Corporation   NYSE SNE   recently issued its forecast for fiscal 2016  for the year ending Mar 31  2017  The forecast release has been delayed by the Kumamoto earthquakes  the worst that has hit Japan in recent times  Despite Sony s tepid guidance  shares of the company remained relatively flat as investors had been anticipating a downcast outlook since the release of the company s fourth quarter fiscal 2015 results Sony had earlier hinted at possibilities of the earthquake affecting the earnings results of its segments  namely  Mobile Communications   MC    Game   Network Services   G NS    Imaging Products   Solutions   IP S    Home Entertainment   Sound   HE S   and Devices  However  the company has confirmed that as per the preliminary assessment  the forecast of the remaining segments   Pictures  Music and Financial Services   will remain unaltered Inside the HeadlinesSony forecasts a year over year decline in net earnings which is likely to irk investors   The bottom line may be affected by the absence of a  46 8 billion gain from the sale of Olympus Corporation shares in the previous year quarter and a higher income tax The company foresees a year over year decline in consolidated sales  largely because of the dismal sales at the IP S and Devices segments on account of the earthquake   Also  lower sales at the MC  IP S  HE S and Music segments are expected to offset the robust sales at G NS  Pictures and Financial Services On a year over year basis  consolidated operating income is expected to improve marginally on the back of better operating results at the MC and G NS segments  Meanwhile  the earthquake is expected to have had impacted sales by  45 billion and  60 billion at the IP S and Devices segment  respectively Segmental ImpactSony has been undergoing organizational restructuring since Apr 1  2016  for positioning certain operations under the IP S and Devices segments  The company has altered its business segments from the first quarter of the fiscal year ending Mar 31  2017  Under the reshuffle  the IP S segment s automotive camera business and Corporate and Elimination s Imaging Device Development Division have been absorbed in the Devices segment MC  Sony believes MC sales will take a hit owing to the ongoing shift in demand to value added smartphones from the mid range models  Also  waning smartphone sales in unprofitable geographical areas are expected to hurt the sales performance further G NS  PlayStation4 software and hardware have acted as major sales driver and are expected to retain its strength even in the fiscal ending Mar 31  2017 IP S  Plummeting sales of digital cameras and professional use products are expected to mar the revenue performance of this segment  Also  the Kumamoto earthquakes are expected to delay the supply of certain components at this segment  which is another dampener HE S  Sales at this segment are expected to decline on a year over year basis  largely on account of adverse foreign exchange rates and tightening home audio and video markets Devices  This segment is expected to witness relatively flat sales on account of negative foreign exchange rates  This is also likely to offset the improvement arising from increased sales of image sensors for mobile products  Also  this segment was affected majorly by the earthquake as some of its operations were suspended translating into huge costs  In addition  the company decided to terminate the development and manufacturing of high functionality camera modules as the production center of these devices   Kumamoto Technology Center   was hit by the earthquake as well  Expenses on account of this is likely to be around  30 billion The company reiterated the guidance for three of its segments  Sony expects Media Networks to ramp up sales at the Pictures segment  Music sales are likely to decline substantially due to currency fluctuations and lackluster sales at Recorded Music  Nevertheless  an increase in insurance premium revenues at Sony Life is expected to drive sales in fiscal 2016 To ConcludeIt appears that the Kumamoto earthquakes have significantly aggravated problems for this beleaguered company  Factors like intense rivalry in each of its product lines including television  game platform  smartphone and services  along with weakness in the cameras business and no immediate rebound in the image sensor segment add to Sony s challenges  We believe that strong headwinds in the devices business and currency fluctations are likely to worsen matters for Sony Desite these negatives  strong service related revenues from the G NS segment and the administrative shakeup to attain a leaner organizational structure raise hope  Also  strategic acquisitions and joint ventures may supplement inorganic growth for this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company Better ranked

GoPro  O GPRO  shares have tumbled 40  year to date and over 60  in the past 3 month 
Increased competition has flooded the market with cheaper and better alternatives to GoPro s HERO series

Once the darling of Wall Street  GoPro s stock fell over 40  in 2015 on weaker demand and an economic slowdown in China  The company recently issued very weak Q4 guidance which saw saw share prices plunge even further  With layoffs looming and share prices trending just above  10  GoPro is poised to underwhelm shareholders when they report fourth quarter earnings
At the moment  the Estimize consensus is calling for EPS of  0 16 and revenue of 437 02  slightly higher than Wall Street s estimates  That said  the Estimize community has made heavy downward revisions in the past 3 months  cutting EPS by 75  and revenue by 33   Compared to Q4 2014  this reflects a projected YoY decline in EPS and revenue of 84  and 31   respectively

There was a time when its competitors looked at GoPro as a force to be reckoned with  Even though the company still uses advanced technology  competitive forces from Sony  N SNE  and Xiaomi have put pressure on GoPro  The company s target market has become saturated with cheaper and more innovative products  severely hurting its bottom line  The  400 HERO4 camera has consistently missed sales forecasts  leading to steep price cuts to spur demand 
To add insult to injury  GoPro faces the threat of a class action lawsuit after shareholders have lost large sums of money  A majority of the potential cases claim GoPro deceived stakeholders by inaccurately projecting sales growth for the 3rd and 4th quarters  CFO Jack Lazar anticipated annual revenue would increase by 56   but in reality  he was off by 13   Moreover GoPro s recent Q4 corporate guidance of a 31  decline significantly deviates from its initial expectations of a 17  dip  While most of the suits have not been filed  there remains the possibility that GoPro will settle with numerous disgruntled shareholders

Lately  GoPro can t do anything right  Sinces its IPO in 2014  the stock has declined nearly 65  and in the past year and a half that number reaches 90   The biggest problem for GoPro has been waning demand in an oversaturated action camera market  GoPro was so successful in the past because it was the only one of its kind  Now there are a plethora of companies which manufacture similar cameras that are more inexpensive  As a result  earnings and revenue have been relatively lackluster  Last quarter featured a 180  decline on the bottom line while sales slipped 31  compared to a year earlier  This quarter  GoPro is expected to take a loss of 57 cents on  171 28 million in revenue  according to the Estimize consensus data  Since its last report  per share estimates have been cut 137  and now reflect a 325  drop from a year earlier  Revenue estimates on the other hand have fallen 36  and could be half of what we saw in Q1 2015  Given GoPro s track record  it s not surprising that the stock reacts negatively during earnings season  
Once a favorite of Wall Street  GoPro s stock has fallen from its good graces on weaker demand and an economic slowdown in China  Just last Monday shares tumbled once again after analysts at Pacific Crest lowered expectations for 2016 and 2017 EPS and revenues  as well as average selling price  ASP  expectations  The action camera space has become increasingly crowded and commoditized  with peers such as Sony  NYSE SNE  and Xiaomi putting pressure on GoPro  The company s target market has become saturated with cheaper and more innovative products  severely hurting its bottom line  The  400 HERO4 camera has consistently missed sales forecasts  leading to steep price cuts to spur demand  Investors are holding out hope that GoPro s Karma drone  set to launch later this quarter  is the product that can resuscitate the company  It still remains to be seen how several recent acquisitions of smaller companies such as Kolor  which produces 360 degree videos  and video editing startups Stupeflix and Vemory  can help the company diversify their business Do you think GPRO can beat estimates ",2016-05-05,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-happened-to-gopro-200128281,200128281

The Fed will raise rates someday  just not today  The FOMC  today  and they left interest rates unchanged  again  The biggest change in the wording dealt with international markets  saying   Recent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term  
The statement also included this new line   The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced  but is monitoring developments abroad   You may recall that China was also frequently referenced in the Beige Book published a couple of weeks ago in preparation for this FOMC meeting 
The Fed also released  and they seem to be forecasting more of the same  GDP just over 2  for 2015  the unemployment rate finishing the year at 5   inflation still significantly short of their target  and the outlook for a rate hike before the end of the year  But don t bet on it  this Fed might never get off the Schneid  There will be growing pressure for a rate hike  if only to avoid the perception that the Fed is weak  or the idea of a Yellen put  or the view that market volatility is enough to stay the Fed s decision again 
And the Fed s decision to wait raises concerns about global economic weakness  Slowing growth in China has rippled across the world  hitting commodity producing countries hard  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index  which captures stock markets in nations such as Brazil  Chile  Egypt and China  is down 14 percent this year  Just how bad is the situation in the emerging markets  And is it about to get worse 
The statement from the Fed also featured the first dissenter  Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker was gung ho for a 25 basis point increase  And in the economic projections  known as the  dot plot   which include forecasts of where each policymaker thinks the Fed should have its policy rate at the end of a given period  there s one remarkable outlier in the projections 
For the first time ever  one monetary policymaker thinks the U S  needs to move to negative interest rates until at least the end of 2016 to achieve full employment and get inflation back to 2 percent  That was probably the parting shot of outgoing Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Narayana Kocherlakota  Beyond that one vote for negative rates  most of the dots point to higher rates by the end of the year  And there is a good chance that might happen  if only to prove they can 
The decision to leave rates unchanged doesn t mean much  remember we re talking about one quarter of one percent  The Fed hasn t chosen to resolve the doubts about whether its monetary tools can raise rates without causing upheaval in the banking system  But it has also chosen not to create new uncertainty over whether a rate hike is a one off or a signal of more to come  Even so  forecasts show policymakers predicted that the Fed s benchmark rate would rise gradually  reaching 2 6 percent by the end of 2017  In June  they predicted that the rate would reach 2 9 percent by then 
Futures traders are pricing in a 21 percent probability the central bank increases it target range in October  a 49 percent chance by the December meeting and a 56 percent likelihood by January  Treasuries rallied  pushing yields lower  while the dollar tumbled to a three week low  stocks wobbled then slipped   there is bound to be some concern that slowing global growth could hamper the domestic economy 
There was some speculation that if the Fed didn t raise rates today  they would at least come out with a hawkish statement  reaffirming their intent to raise rates soon   but that didn t happen  And so this is being interpreted as a very dovish statement from the Fed  It might also be giving us some insight into the Yellen led Fed  Greenspan or Bernanke probably would have hiked rates  right or wrong  And I thought Yellen would be a bit more hawkish  just to be assertive  That was not the case  Yellen appears more cautious  but that doesn t mean she made a mistake 
There is more danger in hiking rates prematurely than in waiting  The Fed may think inflation is transitory but for now  it certainly isn t a problem   no harm in waiting  The Labor market has been improving but there is still plenty of slack  a stronger labor market might attract some discouraged workers to try again  a stronger labor market might result in push on stagnant wages   no harm in waiting 
If the Fed raises rates  no borrower will feel the pain more acutely than the federal government  the nation s largest borrower  and fiscal policy has been irresponsible at best  the Fed couldn t feel confident raising rates with the prospect of a federal government shutdown in less than 2 weeks   no harm in waiting 
The housing market has finally shown signs of life  but many markets  like Phoenix  still haven t fully recovered  a Fed rate hike would almost certainly result in higher mortgage rates   no harm in waiting  A Fed increase might have prompted investors to pull money out of emerging  damaging their economies  and hurting their abilities to buy goods from developed countries   no harm in waiting 
The problem for the Fed is that any action they take will take time to work  steering the economy one way or the other is like trying to steer a huge ship  not a small sports car  there is lag time before the effects of policy are felt  And there might never be a perfect time to change policy  If they don t get to it by the December  next year we move into an election year  which means there will be political implications thrown into the mix

In addition to DigiTour  separate contracts were finalized with e commerce powerhouse   O AMZN  and multinational corporation Sony  N SNE   The provisions of the Amazon deal include the wide circulation of Viacom owned programming on Amazon Prime  although they recently decided to drop many of Viacom s shows as viewers become fatigued with reality TV 
The agreement with Sony is revolutionary as it may be the future of television platforms  Sony has been working and developing an Internet television service to combat cable companies and attract cord cutters  The service will carry Viacom owned channels and both companies will be spearheading the campaign against cable and dish programming 

The New York City based group has also tapped into the likes of   O TIVO   Both firms have entered into a partnership that allows for the entertainment company to utilize TiVo box user data to help advertisers place more strategic commercials on the Viacom networks  This deal comes shortly after the relinquishment of Viacom Vantage  Viacom s in house attempt at helping the advertising firms target specific consumers 
Viacom has been working hard to find additional revenue sources  but results may not be seen until the following few quarters ",2015-11-11,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-will-the-decline-of-cable-and-and-increase-in-cord-cutting-affect-270924,270924

The Japanese stock market regulator  SESC  announced the amount of fine to be paid by Toshiba  OTC TOSYY  for wrong accounting  The penalty comes to 7 37bn yens   59 8mln   That is a good deal of money but Toshiba is able to pay it out  We may assume that the row will gradually abate  Will it support the stock price growth  And will the traders  saying  sell rumours   buy facts  work in this case 
The Toshiba stocks slumped 41  since the start of 2015 while Nikkei 225 index advanced 13   Meanwhile  the recent company s statement for April September this year has shown the improved financial standing  The operating loss fell to 90 5bn yens from 228 4bn yens in the same period of last year  In the first six months of the present fiscal year  the company got the net profit of 37 3bn yens against the loss of 15 3bn yens  This happened due to the non operating income from the securities sell off and the reduced expenses  As part of restructuring  Toshiba sold to Sony  N SNE  its image sensor business and is on track to derive of several other unprofitable enterprises  It is hard to tell yet whether the restructuring is successful  The company weighs various options on collaboration with Fujitsu  OTC FJTSY  and Sharp  OTC SHCAY

113144,334659,SNE,3 Stocks In Focus Amid The Semiconductor Industry Turmoil,opinion,"The Nasdaq Composite Index touched a 15 year high of 5056 06 on Thursday  It is broadly believed that the strong results from tech companies were largely responsible  In fact  the tech sector has had one of the best stock price responses to Q1 earnings announcements   the 5th best among the 16 Zacks sectors in the S P 500 Index 
The Dark Horse of the Tech Sector
The semiconductor industry is one of the best performing spaces within the tech sector at the moment  However  it is often overlooked as hot stocks in the social media or cloud computing space grab the headlines 
But semiconductor stocks can be compelling investments too  These companies often form the backbone of the technology world and are part of an industry that posted sales of  340 3 billion in 2014  up 7 9  from  315 4 billion posted in 2013  The semiconductor industry was one of the top performing industries in 2014 
The growth was fueled by a stabilization in the PC market  continued strong adoption of tablets and smartphones as well as automotive electronics and frequent updates in the new category of wearable devices 
Gartner expects worldwide semiconductor revenues to reach  358 billion in 2015  a 5 4  increase from 2014 
Bumps on the Race Course
While the factors seem in favor of the industry  things might not go as expected  The recent first quarter earnings reports bear testimony to the fact 
A number of chipmakers have provided a soft guidance for the second quarter  The outlook created a stir in the semiconductor market with steep declines in share prices  This has put investors in a dilemma about whether to hold on to the stocks or to sell them 
The recent concerns stem from issues related to corporate fundamentals  softening enterprise demand  a strong dollar and Fed policy uncertainty 
The dollar has risen about 23  against a basket of major currencies in the past year and the situation may not change for the rest of the year as well  The latest reports form Gartner and IDC reveal that total PC shipments further declined in the first quarter of 2015  indicating that smartphones continue to steal PC dollar spend  As per data provided by Gartner  PC shipments contracted 5 2  on a year over year basis to 71 7 million units in the first quarter of 2015 
All is not lost  though  There are still some overlooked companies in the space that are somewhat buffered from the industry weakness  and have impressive growth drivers 
We have three semiconductor picks  which will take investors on a smooth road 
The 3 Underdogs
Cypress Semiconductor Corporation  NASDAQ CY  is a developer and manufacturer of a broad range of digital and mixed signal ICs  It sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   The company s advanced technology  momentum in new products  and increased customer wins will continue to drive growth 
Also  its merger with Spansion is expected to create a global provider of microcontrollers and specialized memory chips for embedded systems and generate more than  2 billion in annual revenues  Also  Cypress  entry into the wearables market with its TrueTouch controllers is a major achievement  The use of its TrueTouch controllers in Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  and Sony Corp Ord s  NYSE SNE  smartwatches are likely to boost the company s revenues 
Cypress has generated a return of 33 2  over the last 52 weeks  The company has a long term expected earnings growth rate of 13 4   It has delivered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters with an average surprise of 83 2  
We expect this trend to continue when it reports its first quarter 2015 earnings on Apr 30 
Broadcom Corp  NASDAQ BRCM   a Zacks Rank  1 stock  provides semiconductor solutions for wired and wireless communications  Broadcom provides a portfolio of system on a chip  SoC  and software solutions to manufacturers of computing and networking equipment  digital entertainment and broadband access products  and mobile devices 
It has generated a strong 52 week return of around 46 4   The company has a long term expected earnings growth rate of 11 5   It has delivered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters with an average surprise of 9 2  
Moreover  it reported strong first quarter 2015 results with both the top and bottom lines beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
NVIDIA Corp  NASDAQ NVDA  is a worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit or GPU  It sports a Zacks Rank  1  The company should benefit from the increased adoption of its Tegra K1 processor  which should act as a catalyst  going forward 
Also  growth in GeForce GPUs and strength in gaming  data center  cloud and automotive platforms are encouraging  NVIDIA s innovative product pipeline and strength in gaming and high end notebook GPUs remain its strengths 
NVIDIA has generated a return of 19 0  over the last 52 weeks  The company has a long term expected earnings growth rate of 10 3   It has delivered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters with an average surprise of 29 1  
NVIDIA s fiscal fourth quarter 2015 earnings and revenues exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The results were helped by an increase in the sale of auto infotainment systems  mobile devices and SHIELD tablets 
The Bottom Line
Looking at the strong growth fundamentals of these companies  we expect them to emerge as winners ",2015-04-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-stocks-in-focus-amid-the-semiconductor-industry-turmoil-249955,249955

113163,334678,SNE, A Simple Method For Avoiding Value Traps,opinion,"In April 1968  Sony Corp   NYSE SNE  released its ground breaking Trinitron cathode ray tube television set  The prominent brand would go on to sell 280 million units  Even more revolutionary was the Sony Walkman  which was released in July 1979  Sony sold 200 million units of the iconic portable cassette player  Then  in December 1994  Sony introduced the   It was the first video game console ever to reach sales of 100 million units 
Unfortunately  Sony s halcyon days are long gone  The firm has failed to keep up with the pace of technological advancement in the industries in which it operates  and on Wednesday  the  former  electronics giant made a stunning decision  Sony announced that it was canceling its dividend  which had been paid since 1958 
The company also admitted that it will lose over  2 billion in the current fiscal year  largely due to a write down of its floundering smartphone business 
Sony s shares fell as much as 13  in Tokyo trading on the news  Sony s American depositary receipts trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker SNE  
But even though shareholders reacted violently  Sony s woes are nothing new  Management has continually promised a turnaround that hasn t materialized  as you can see from the chart below 

Still  many investors   including activist hedge fund manager Dan Loeb   have seen value in Sony shares over the years  However  management has been sending a simple  yet overlooked  signal that we should stay away 
Signs of a Value Trap
A management s inability or unwillingness to raise a company s dividend payout is often a warning sign that the stock may be a value trap 
Indeed  up until now  Sony paid a constant 25 yen dividend  annual total  for years without an increase 
What s more  Sony s experience is reminiscent of a long struggling U S  retailer  J C  Penney Co   NYSE JCP   which has also ensnared many value investors 
J C  Penney paid a constant  0 20 quarterly dividend from 2007 to May 2012  at which point management canceled it entirely  Activist hedge fund manager  Bill Ackman  tried to turn the company around  but he ultimately failed  Doesn t all of this sound eerily familiar 
Since killing its dividend  JCP has declined 68   which isn t surprising 
Ned Davis Research  NDR  has conducted analysis showing that dividend cutters and eliminators significantly underperform the market 
NDR has also shown that dividend growers and initiators outperform the broader category of dividend paying stocks 
Bottom line  Keeping an eye on dividend growth is a great way to avoid companies in death spirals and sidestep stocks that will eventually pull the plug on their dividends 
Sure  we ll miss some successful turnarounds  but we ll also avoid the biggest dogs  Our average returns will improve by seeking value but requiring dividend growth  thereby avoiding the nastiest value traps

113164,334679,SNE,Veteran Pioneer Set To Dominate Wearable Tech,opinion,"Just like mobile technology exploded into our lives a decade ago  wearable devices are quietly gatecrashing the tech scene 
With new products like the Apple Watch hitting the market in 2015  Juniper Research says wearable tech will be a  19 billion industry by 2018 
To put that in perspective  retail revenue only reached  1 4 billion last year 
So if you think wearable tech is a fad that will quickly pass  think again 
And one company in particular stands to profit the most 
In fact  it s already thrived in the wearable tech space for 53 years 
Welcome to the Next Explosive Tech Trend
Wearable technology refers to any kind of device that you can  well  wear 
For example  there are the high tech glasses from Google  NASDAQ GOOG   called Google Glass  Smartwatches are currently on the market from Samsung Electronics PK  OTC SSNLF   Sony Corp  NYSE SNE  and QUALCOMM Incorporated  NASDAQ QCOM   And Nike  NYSE NKE  has its fitness FuelBand 
But this barely scratches the surface of all the wearable devices that have been developed 
For example  in the healthcare space alone  there s a device that can predict strokes  a wearable patch that monitors blood pressure  the world s first wireless pacemaker  smart glasses for the blind  a smartwatch that tracks Parkinson s Disease symptoms  a helmet for depression  and robotic exoskeletons 
The gaming industry has advanced  with virtual reality systems and motion sensing devices 
And don t forget these rechargeable bio batteries  or these mind blowing  dissolvable electronics 
The list goes on and on 
Indeed  wearable technology is on a massive growth curve that can t be ignored 
But none of this would be possible without the groundbreaking work of early pioneers 
Like this one 
53 Years of Wearable Innovation
The company is Plantronics  NYSE PLT   Founded in 1961  the electronics and audio technology firm makes lightweight communications headsets  phone headset systems  and various other communication products and accessories for businesses and consumers 
Its innovations have won many honors and awards over the years  and I recently met with Plantronics  Vice President of Global Communications  Genevieve Haldeman  who gave me an inside look at the company s history and upcoming products 
Check out the company s huge claim to fame at the 0 52 mark  too 
With a long standing and impressive history of designing breakthrough audio products  Plantronics is perfectly positioned to capitalize on the next wave of innovation in wearable technology 
And as you saw in the video above  it s doing just that   even amid fierce competition in the industry 
The question is  Will that translate positively to Plantronics  share price  You bet 
There are several factors that should help Plantronics outperform the bulk of its industry rivals 
Balance Sheet Diagnosis  Rock Solid
For starters  Plantronics has no debt 
In fact  with a quick ratio of 5 1  it s incredibly solvent 
The quick ratio essentially measures a company s liquid assets against its liabilities   and Plantronics could cover its debt five times over 
How does it achieve that 
Well  revenue  net income  earnings per share  and operating income have all trended higher for the past few years  Take a look 

As a result  the company is able to give a bit back to its shareholders by offering a small  0 60 per share annual dividend  a 1 3  yield  
That s also grown in recent years   and Plantronics is one of the only companies in its peer group to offer one 
My colleague  Alan Gula  Wall Street Daily s Chief Income Analyst  had this to say about Plantronics  dividend   In April 2014  Plantronics increased its dividend payout by 50   which we love to see  of course  Most importantly  though  the company is generating more than sufficient free cash flow  operating cash flow minus capital expenditures  to cover this higher payout  
A 24  Gain on Tap 
To compare Plantronics to its competitors  I like to use Vitaliy Katsenelson s Absolute P E Valuation Model 
Katsenelson s Absolute P E uses five conditions to arrive at what Katsenelson considers to be a  fair value  multiple 
Earnings growth rate
Dividend yield
Business risk
Financial risk
Earnings visibility
After running Plantronics through this formula  the model suggests that the company should be trading at  54 27  based on its  fair value   That would represent a 24  gain from current levels 
While this is only one indication  there s no doubt that Plantronics has successfully and reliably grown important areas of its business  And as a result  its balance sheet is rock solid 
With its small dividend payout  to boot  Plantronics is a great company to own in today s market

113165,334680,SNE,Yellen s Blast Off  Will It  Help The Markets ,opinion,"If ever there was a week in the equity markets which was emblematic of Ben s Graham s famous remark about Mr  Market  the past week was it  The first two days saw waves of selling as the continuing plunge of the price of oil and Russia s central bank surprise rate hike of 6   to nearly 17   brought all kinds of fear from every place imaginable  On Wednesday  the Fed s policy statement and Janet Yellen s press conference where she essentially said  We ll See  about interest rate hikes gave lift off to equities  which have subsequently rallied nearly 800 points during the last three days  Yellen pretty much said the middle of 2015 is the earliest the governing body would think about raising interest rates  and it would be totally dependent on economic data centering around inflation  employment  and growth  This really should not be a surprise and the current Federal Reserve Board s long stated policy has been easy does it  but certainly  for a market scared about the ramifications of the commodity downdraft  it definitely calmed a few frayed nerves as the year ends  Let s not even mention how it helped people s portfolio values  why would anyone be concerned about that  yeah  right  
Over the last few weeks  an interesting situation occurred with a holding of ours which has agreed to be bought out  Last Monday  we woke up and discovered the company granted a ten day extension with its largest customer  which currently makes up about 33  of the revenues  Well  investors immediately believed the company had lost this customer  and naturally  the stock got sold off very hard to the price where it was at before it agreed to be bought 

In a merger agreement  there is typically a  material adverse  clause which allows the buyer to cancel the purchase if there is some kind of event which would materially harm the business of the entity which is being acquired  In this case  the loss of 30  of a company s revenues would have to be considered material  In any event  the existing customer had been doing business with this holding for over ten years  so chances were good this was just a delay  In fact  the same thing happened a few years ago and the large customer remained with our holding  Sooooo  we woke up Wednesday morning to find out the customer remained satisfied and signed the extension  and yup  the stock price recovered nicely  yay good guys   Anyway  the point of this anecdote is to show readers we are still in a rip your face off first and ask questions later mentality  where all news is considered bad until proven otherwise  Makes for an interesting investing environment  but you have to be very careful and think circumstances out very carefully 


Elsewhere in the market  Veriphone reported a nice quarter on Monday and the stock bounced pretty well  Nike Inc  NYSE NKE  also beat its numbers on Thursday but investors were not crazy about the guidance for 2015  Oil rallied back a bit after the first two days of the week  but the large integrated oil companies have really had a strong rally after the last few weeks drubbings 


Bill Ackman released his latest video and thinking on his Herbalife LTD  NYSE HLF  short  The lesson for investors to think about is last year  Mr  Ackman had sub par performance because of his problems with Herbalife and the J C  Penny s situation  In 2014  he has returned well over 30  for the year with his success in Allergan and the Herbalife short  among others  The point is no matter how great an investor is  and Ackman has a fabulous track record for well over a decade  there are years when you will have so so performance 


The whole mess with the hacking of Sony  NYSE SNE  and pulling of the movie   The Interview   again reminds us the importance of the security industry  especially related to software  mobile devices  or retail  Every time the market sells off  this particular segment of the market will probably continue to see great interest 


Finally  it was interesting to listen to the President s comments about Keystone yesterday and how he believed the only country which would benefit from the pipeline would be Canada  When you consider the real potential the country currently has to work with our North American neighbors of Canada and Mexico to secure our energy future for decades  the lack of a long term perspective regarding this issue is negligent  almost bordering on criminal  It is just par for the course as it has been this way for a very long time  Ho Ho Ho

The North Koreans and the Russians are both very proud  and neither one is going to back down any time soon  If a foreign power wanted to really make us hurt  it wouldn t take much imagination at all  There are thousands of ways to do it  So Americans should not just smugly assume that we are untouchable  In a war  it is often those that are overconfident that get hurt the worst 
Last week  Barack Obama blamed North Korea for the nightmarish hack attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment and he promised that the U S  would respond 
Well  it looks like that response began on Monday  According to   North Korea s connection to the Internet was totally cut off 

North Korea s limited access to the Internet has been cut off  according to a network monitoring company  days after the U S  government accused the country of hacking into Sony Corp   6758  s files 
North Korea  which has four official networks connecting the country to the Internet   all of which route through China   began experiencing intermittent problems yesterday and today went completely dark  according to Doug Madory  director of Internet analysis at Dyn Research in Hanover  New Hampshire 

Needless to say  that got the attention of the North Koreans 
On their end  the North Koreans are still denying that they had anything to do with the attack on Sony  NYSE SNE   And we may never know the actual truth  In reality  Russia could have carried out such an attack  Or it could have been the Chinese  Or it could have even been a false flag cyberattack conducted by a three letter U S  agency  We just don t know 
But what we do know is that North Korea is now vowing to take action against    

 The DPRK has already launched the toughest counteraction  Nothing is more serious miscalculation than guessing that just a single movie production company is the target of this counteraction  Our target is all the citadels of the U S  imperialists who earned the bitterest grudge of all Koreans   a report on state run KCNA read 
 Our toughest counteraction will be boldly taken against the White House  the Pentagon and the whole U S  mainland  the cesspool of terrorism   the report said  adding that  fighters for justice  including the  Guardians of Peace    a group that claimed responsibility for the Sony attack    are sharpening bayonets not only in the U S  mainland but in all other parts of the world  

So can North Korea back up those bold words  We shall see 
But without a doubt our Internet infrastructure is very vulnerable  As I have written about previously  our big banks are under Internet attack   And in recent months we have seen a whole host of retailers and major corporations get hacked 
This is an emerging threat that should not be underestimated  As a society  we have become extremely dependent on the Internet  and these attacks are constantly becoming more powerful and more sophisticated 
I think that Steve Quayle put it very well during one recent interview 

 Cyberwarfare is increasing dramatically as we speak  There are serious concerns about the ability of the United States  banking system to whether extremely sophisticated cyberattacks  The Sony breach is just one example of how a detrimental cyberattack can bring one of the world s most prominent entertainment giants to its knees  

And we do know that the North Koreans take hacking very seriously  In fact   that North Korea has a small army of hackers that are continually harassing the western world known as  Unit 121  

Just like in a Bond movie  an army of teenage geniuses tap away at keyboards in fortified complex tucked away from prying eyes in a rogue state  bent on bringing cyber carnage to their Western enemies on the orders of their leader who is bent on revenge 
But this isn t the plot line from a film  This is North Korea in 2014  And the cyber warriors inside have diverted from their usual work of disrupting governments and big business to turn their collective fury on Sony 
The building  the Kim Il Sung Military Academy  is one of four North Korean universities known to train children  hand picked for their intelligence from all around the country  and turn them into recruits for an elite group of hackers simply known as Unit 121 or Bureau 121 

Meanwhile  the struggle between the United States and Russia over Ukraine has escalated into a full blown economic war  At first  both sides started slapping each other with relatively minor economic sanctions 
But then things started escalating  I think that things really began to get serious for the U S  when Russia started to make moves against the petrodollar  This is not something that has been reported on much at all by the mainstream media in the United States  but it is a very big deal  If you want to become enemy  1 in the eyes of the U S  government  just start attacking the petrodollar  So when Russia began cutting the US dollar out of oil and natural gas transactions  that definitely got the attention of some folks in Washington  You can read much more about what Russia has been doing in this regard in    and  
Of course Washington was not just going to sit back and let this happen  The Obama administration has retaliated by going after two of the most important pillars of the Russian economy   oil and the ruble  And without a doubt  a tremendous amount of damage  
At this point  Russia is facing a full blown currency crisis  major banks are starting to fail and economists are forecasting  

The central bank bailed out its first victim of the collapsing currency  authorities announced a tax on grain exports to protect domestic stocks and a Reuters poll of 11 economists predicted that Russia s gross domestic product would fall 3 6 percent next year 
Russia has been hit by what Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev recently called a  perfect storm  of plummeting oil prices  sanctions related to its military action in Ukraine  and a flight of investors  capital   made worse by a lack of structural reforms that means the economy is overwhelmingly dependent on oil revenues 

But don t count out the Russians just yet  They are a very crafty people  and they are not afraid to fight dirty  And it is important to keep in mind that the Russian Bear never forgives and it never forgets  Most Americans don t realize this  but right now anti American sentiment in Russia is actually higher than it was at the end of the Cold War era  Many Russians believe that this is a new Cold War  and that the United States is the greatest force for evil on the entire planet 
So while many Americans view this current conflict as a temporary foreign policy tussle about Ukraine  many Russians view this as a long term struggle that is absolutely critical to the future of humanity  If you doubt this  you should check out  
This conflict between the United States and Russia is not going to end any time soon  And someday down the road  it could evolve into something more than just an economic war  But before that happens  the Russians have a whole host of other ways that they can damage us 
Yes  the United States can hurt Russia  But Russia can also hurt us  In the end  this conflict is not going to be good for anyone ",2014-12-23,Michael T. Snyder,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-cyber-war-with-north-korea-and-an-economic-war-with-russia-236617,236617

113185,334700,SNE,U S  Dollar Remains On The Defensive,opinion,The May Day holiday has thinned market activity in both Asia and Europe  The US dollar has been unable to sustain even modest upticks  While US Q1 GDP was considerably weaker than expected  investors seemed to look through it  as did the Federal Reserve  There seems to be little doubt that stalling of the economy was a bit a fluke and before the quarter was even over activity was picking up This will be illustrated by April s manufacturing ISM report out today  It is expected to have risen for the third consecutive month ad edge closer to the cyclical high recorded last November near 57  The consensus calls for a rise to 54 3 from 53 7 The personal income and consumption data for March have already been built into the Q1 GDP estimate reported yesterday and therefore  contains no new information  Separately  Fed s Yellen speaks to independent community bankers today  but it seems that Fed policy is about as clear as it gets leaving aside when the first hike is  which is still understood to be more than a year off still  The Fed s tapering continues apace  and neither the stalling of the economy in Q1  nor a few poor employment reports  or stock market corrections is sufficient to knock it off its course There were four manufacturing reports released today  two in Asia Pacific and two in Europe that are noteworthy  First  Australia manufacturing index fell to an eight month low in April of 44 8 from 47 9  Perhaps  the disappointment was blunted by a sharp rise in the export price index  3 6  in Q1  more than twice the consensus forecast   The Australian dollar was bid back toward the week s high above  0 9300 The Australian dollar has also been resilient in the face of the sharp drop in iron ore prices  which have fallen nearly 5  this week  as Chinese officials reportedly crack down on iron ore backed loans as well as the excess capacity and redundant investment in the steel industry  That bring us to the second manufacturing report from the Asia Pacific area  China s official manufacturing PMI edged higher to 50 4 from 50 3  It fits our view that after slowing considerably over the past year or so  the Chinese economy has begun stabilizing  That said  it is uneven  New orders rose to 50 6 from 49 8 and represents a four month high On the other hand  export orders fell to 49 1 from 50 1  This is important  Many observers are concerned that the depreciation of the yuan is to boost exports  We argue against this  accepting that the main driver is trying to break the moral hazard and speculative excesses  The value added by Chinese workers and the yuan denominated input cost more generally are too low to allow a 3 4  currency depreciation to be much of a competitive advantage Turning to Europe  with much of western Europe closed for the May Day holiday  most will report the manufacturing PMI tomorrow  Today  Ireland and the UK did  and if they suggest anything it is potential for an upside surprise  Ireland s manufacturing PMI rose to 56 1 from 55 5  This is a three month high The UK s manufacturing PMI jumped to 57 3 from 55 8  which itself was revised from 55 3  The consensus had looked for a small pullback  instead it is approaching the cyclical high from last November near 57 9  This sent sterling to new four month highs of  1 6920  The  1 70 level beckons  Even if it does not penetrate it on the initial attempt  given the widening interest rate differentials and momentum  it seems as if it is simply a matter of time  Above the  1 70 level  the next targets are near  1 72 Separately  the UK reported somewhat fewer mortgage approvals  but an increase in mortgage lending  Nationwide reported a larger than expected increase in house prices  The 1 2  increase in April  was twice the pace the market expected and lifts the year over year increase to 10 9  from 9 5   Several officials have commented about the increase in house prices  but rather than try to check it with rate hikes  the signals appear to be moving in the direction of macro prudential measures Lastly  we turn out attention to Japan  A key issue for many investors and policy makers is the impact of the sales tax increase  Initially  Finance Minister Aso had been suggesting that the economic hit may not be as great as feared  This seems a very premature judgment  Producers are cutting back sharply  as was picked up in the manufacturing PMI out earlier this week  Today  Japan reported auto sales slumped 5 5  in April  with overall sales down to their lowest level since Abe s election in December 2012  Separately  Sony  NYSE SNE  cut its earnings expectations for the third time in a year  It reported a JPY130 bln 12 month loss after project JPY110 bln loss a couple of months ago and a JPY30 bln profit last October Still the dollar yen is flat  It is capped apparently by the pullback in US yields and is supported by gains in the US equities  We note that the dollar yen is twice as correlated with the S P 500 than the Nikkei 225  on a rolling 60 day percent change  at 0 46  vs 0 23  ,2014-05-01,Marc

113248,334763,SNE,2013 Non Prediction No 1,opinion,Before moving onto our first Non Prediction of 2013  TMM thought they probably should at least comment upon last week s moves in fixed income markets which appear to have caught a lot of people off guard  The FOMC minutes suggesting that QE3 could end by the close of this year evidently surprised a lot of people  TMM were lucky enough to have been short various rate markets  but covered these on Friday morning ahead of Non Farm Payrolls  The spike higher in yields has been very rapid and reasonably large   justified to some extent by the passing of the fiscal cliff deal and generally stronger data  but things do not move in straight lines   There are some strong underlying currents developing at the moment with govvies looking as though they have minimal upside globally  equities showing their strength as alternatives to highly complex and margin tight credit products and reflation trades in general showing their mettle  pun intended  and the post FOMC reaction was like a small  no more QE  earthquake shaking them  Bonds were swiftly shaken lower  equities got shaken down against trend and USD JPY was accelerated on its path  TMM would normally look for opportunity to buy things that have been shaken back against trend in such events  equities in this case   but some things have moved so far forward of where they should be right now we are looking to go countertrend    The fact that things like Schatz   Euribor have also sold off to the extent that barely any chance of a further deposit rate cut is priced in has TMM reckoning that buying things like ERZ3 or ERM4 ahead of the ECB meeting represents compelling risk reward  Additionally  seemingly in contrast to the theme of our first 2013 Non Prediction  TMM purchased some 1 month 86 strike USDJPY puts on Friday  for a cheap looking 33bps  Given the parabolic nature of the recent move and weekly RSIs being as overbought as they have been since 1997  the setup for a countertrend move early next week looks good  We also appreciated the market reaction to an  as expected  NFP which gave strong clues that expectations vs  reality are ahead of themselves in the very short term   And finally    on to our first Non Prediction of 2013   1  Japan will NOT escape deflation this year  but reflation trades will NOT disappoint   TMM have generally been skeptical of these kinds of trades  given that people have been trying them for the best part of 15 years  and especially over the past couple of years  with little or no luck  But  as regular readers will know  TMM changed their minds in recent months  sadly missing the most recent moves from mid late December  but booking a tidy profit so we shouldn t complain  for two main reasons   First  the Basic Balance of Payments  see chart below from GS  has failed to recover from its post Tohuko earthquake deterioration  instead remaining mired in deficit  On the trade side  the nuclear plants haven t been switched back on  much to TMM s surprise   though the poor showing of the anti nuclear parties in December s election   subsequent TEPCO rally as the Keidanren are de facto calling the shots now probably means some reversal of this position   territorial tensions with China have hit  especially  auto sales and Japan Inc  is being hollowed out by Korea  TMM bought a new laptop in the sales  with an equivalent Samsung spec being as much as  400 cheaper than their hitherto trusty Sony Vaios   it wasn t a hard choice      The experience of the UK over the past 10 years suggests that once lost  it is very difficult to regain market share  even after FX depreciation The other main component of Japan s Current Account is the Income Balance  which sits in hefty surplus  The problem here is that maturing bonds are being reinvested at poor yields  which threatens to structurally weaken this component going forward  even after considering Mrs  Watanabe s recent flirtation with the Turkish Lira   It appears that the deterioration in the BoP has become structural Second  there has been a dramatic change in macroeconomic policymaking within Japan over the past year  The BoJ adopted a 1  inflation target and began expanding its balance sheet at a pace it has historically resisted  But it has still opposed being as aggressive as the Fed  with Governor Shirakawa repeatedly arguing that monetary policy cannot do anything to get out of deflation  The recent election  however  with a super major for the LDP led coalition  changes all of this given that the central theme of election campaign was the call to institutionalise a 2  inflation target for the BoJ and to embark upon aggressive policy easing  both monetary   fiscal   TMM cannot imagine an election in the UK or US being centred on such a specific monetary policy framework   the closest parallel really being the UK s 1979 election   the embrace of monetarism  TMM cannot remember political pressure upon the BoJ ever being so great  with explicit threats to change the BoJ Law if they don t play ball  This is doubly important given Shirakawa s term expires in March and it seems likely that the academic Iwata san  who is known to favour aggressive easing  Press reports suggest the BoJ have accepted the government s will Of course  the Nikkei   Yen have moved quite a lot already  but they can certainly move a lot more  When the deleveraging cycle in Japan ended in 2005  see chart below  we were given a hint of the potential for reflation trades  as the Nikkei rallied 60   the belly of the curve sold off 100bps and USDJPY rose 15   And exit from deflation still looked years away  Then  as they often are prone to do  the BoJ torpedoed everything by ending QE and then moving to hike rates  If policymakers are pushing in the right direction and the BoJ don t about turn and crush the reflation  things can go a lot a further Can policymakers raise Japanese inflation expectations towards 2   Well  it s a tough shot  but the evidence from the US   UK is that if central banks are aggressive enough  they can move inflation expectations to where they want them  while nominal yields have fallen over the past few years  whenever forward breakevens have moved too low  monetary easing has followed   TMM are in the camp that believe the BoJ have just not tried hard enough before As far as USD JPY goes  we all know the Yen is overvalued as far as PPP REER metrics go  but the bulk of the reason for the move of the past 5 years is the dramatic fall in real rates in the US  which for the 10yr is now something like  65bps  up from around  90bps in mid December   Stitching together linkers   inflation swaps  not perfect  but good enough for this back of the envelope exercise   Japan has been stuck with 10 year real rates in the 1 2  range in the face of the Fed moving those in the US down from 2 5  to  0 9   The flip side of real rates being so relatively high  despite low nominal JGB yields  is that inflation expectations in Japan sit at just 0 50  for 10 years  Still  since introducing their 1  inflation target earlier this year  the BoJ have at least managed to get these positive  having been showing continued expectations of deflation beforehand  and also to move long term real rates to the lowest they have been since at least 2005  see below chart  The chart below shows the 10 year real rate spread between the US   Japan  blue line  vs  USD JPY  red line   It also shows a few scenarios for what could happen  assuming that US inflation expectations remain unchanged at current levels   The bear case  light blue line  shows a projection of the spread if 10 year Treasuries are largely unchanged from their end 2012 levels  1 75   by the end of December 2014 and the BoJ is unsuccessful in moving inflation expectations higher than current levels  In this case  USD JPY is likely to move back towards 82  not a disaster  The Stable Bonds case  purple line  assumes that the BoJ are able to move these as high as 1   but overall bond yields do not change  presumably the function of continued aggressive easing and tepid growth globally   A gradual move towards 90 for USD JPY can be expected in this outturn  TMM s base case is that US growth reaccelerates as Euro contagion becomes less of a driver of markets   the CapEx cycle ramps up  sending 10yr yields towards 3  by the end of 2014  driven by a 125bps move higher in real rates   In this case  the BoJ are partially successful  getting inflation expectations up to 1  and targets USD JPY at around 110  Finally  the bull case is both a re acceleration of the US resulting in 10 year yields pushing 3  by end 2014  and  the BoJ are successful in moving inflation expectations up to 2   This would send USD JPY back to levels not seen since 2007 However  the rapid acceleration to the topside in USDJPY  outperforming the real rate move so far  since mid December has TMM hoping for a pull back before dipping back in again  it s kind of hard to buy something when the 14 weekly RSI sits at its highest level since February 1997     What about JGBs Well there s not really much to be said other than shorting JGBs has been a graveyard trade  But should the BoJ manage to reflate the economy then it is not too much of a stretch to imagine with 1  growth   2  inflation that medium long dated forwards should be trading around 3   The long end  10Y10Y and 10Y20Y  have already moved towards this level   but then  they have traded these levels before when reflation hardly looked imminent  Should the BoJ gain traction  the 10yr sat at just 0 7  looks very vulnerable and there is plenty of room for the 5Y5Y forward to move higher  The risk reward to shorts here  with so much BoJ easing priced in to the curve strongly favours selling JGBs  though TMM reckon after the move lower in fixed income globally the past week  we get better entry levels  After all  if the BoJ are successful  yields will move sharply higher  if they are not  the negative carry is only around 18bps year with a move to the 2003 deflationary panic lows of 41bps  which seems exceptionally unlikely given the BoJ are easing aggressively and there is no NPL Resona bank shock right now  wiping out a further 30bps And the Nikkei Topix Well  with the recent rally  the forward P E has already expanded from around 12 5x to 15x  which isn t exactly cheap  so buying upside here has to be a function of EPS growth  Which means it is going to be a function of how much the Yen weakens  as far as exporters go   but also the extent to which raising inflation expectations spurs domestic demand  The below chart shows a model of the one year ahead EPS of the MSCI Japan based upon the Yen  the Tankan  ISM  Core CPI   M2  Using relatively conservative assumptions for these variables produces an EPS number of around 44 9  With the index trading 549  this produces an earnings yield of around 8 2   or 12 2x 2013 earnings   That looks cheap enough to want to own some  but again  given the recent moves  TMM are hoping for some retracement to allow them to get back in So that s the theory behind the first of TMM 2013 s first Non Prediction  A little more drawn out than in past years  but the Yen theme needed a more detailed post as we haven t done it justice since it hit

113272,334787,SNE,Binary Options Traders Eyeing Yen,opinion,Talking JapanesseFor most of the year it was the Euro that made the front page of newspapers  but the binary options trader s attention should be on the Yen in December  Following the landslide victory in the elections  Shinzo Abe plans on reducing the independence of Bank of Japan in exchange of producing an inflation of 3   The stocks have surged ever since and the Yen is also thriving  but the question is whether this will last or the trends will enter a reversal quickly  Tipping Point Is NighIf we were to count exclusively on technical analysis  the data would suggest that the market rallies will dwindle by the end of the year  On very short term  binary options traders could still make some money by writing this trend  but the tipping point is just around the corner and it is better to stick to options that expire relatively soon  If we throw into the mix the fundamental analysis  things don t look so bright for Japan who is the riddled by structural problems  Japan Is Not Like U S Japan can t afford to use the same quantitative easing as the United States  because it s debt to GDP ratio exceeds 200  and the demographic problems are chronic  Since Shinzo Abe based his campaign on the promise of rising inflation  there is no doubt that the Prime Minister will resort to measures that will drive inflation towards the 3  mark  The first instinct for Forex and binary options traders would be to open long term positions against the Yen and this isn t necessarily a bad idea  By weakening the Yen  the government will make some Japanese products more competitive  so it might be a good idea to bet on Nintendo  Panasonic or Sony stock  The main problem is that the strategy itself is not sustainable  because the benefits of increasing competitiveness for the most popular Japanese products will be offset by higher costs of energy and food  These goods are imported and the prices are already reaching dangerous levels  so it wouldn t be surprising if the inflation targets will be lowered in 2013  Bank of Japan hopes to fix the problem on the short term by selling bonds  but with the number of young people dwindling  there are simply not enough buyers  Interest rates below 1  are not acceptable for foreign investors  but rising these rates can bring Japan to the brink  The bottom line is that traders should bet against a continued rise in Japanese stocks especially now that they benefit from great entry points ,2012-12-19,Martin Kay,https://www.investing.com/analysis/binary-options-traders-eyeing-yen-148274,148274

   Ryohin Keikaku plunges after earnings

 By Lisa Twaronite	
 TOKYO  Oct 7  Reuters    The Nikkei stock average climbed on
Friday  on track for its second day of gains on hopes that a
plan to support Europe s financial sector is making progress 
but market participants said the upside was limited ahead of a
U S  non farm payrolls report later in the day 	
 Sony Corp dropped 1 percent to 1 455 yen  after
Nomura Holdings Inc  cut the consumer electronics maker s rating
to  neutral  from  buy   Sony was the fourth heaviest traded
share by turnover  with its stock also pressured by a report
that the company is nearing a deal to buy Telefon AB LM
Ericsson s  stake in their 50 50 smartphone joint
venture  	
 The European Union said that it would present a plan for a
coordinated recapitalisation of banks by member states  and the
European Central Bank said it was ready to buy bonds to provide
longer term cheap money for European lenders in need of funding 
    	
  Even though the Japanese market is up today  it s mostly
just reacting to overseas developments  like relief that
Europe s situation might be improving  so the overall market
here can still be called sluggish   said Koichi Ogawa  chief
portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments 	
  No one wants to take a big position ahead of the U S  jobs
report later in case there is a downside surprise  and the
market is also in a  wait and see  mode to see what happens with
the European plan to recapitalise banks and steps to prevent
Greece from defaulting   	
 New claims for U S  unemployment benefits rose slightly less
than expected last week  hinting at an improved labour market a
day before the closely watched non farm payrolls report 
 
 The Nikkei rose 1 percent to 8 604 71  retaking the
8 600 level for the first time since Sept  30 and putting it in
sight of resistance at its 25 day moving average of 8 657  The

 Shares of Ryohin Keikaku fell 8 8 percent to 3 910

113322,334837,SNE,ECB Post Mortem And US Jobs ,opinion,The US dollar has surrendered around half of yesterday s gains as European investors  more so than Asia  seemed to look past the drag from Draghi and anticipate a stronger European response next month and a jobs report that will keep the Federal Reserve looking to provide more support  Asian shares finished lower  ostensibly hurt by the decline on Wall Street  The Nikkei s 1 1  decline was also spurred by poor Sharp and Sony earnings  The 1  gain in the Shanghai Composite was encouraged by news that government was reducing a transaction tax on equity securities  ironically just as several countries in Europe introduce a financial transaction tax    China s non manufacturing PMI slipped to 55 6 from 56 7  News that Chinese officials are warning a more cautious stance in terms of mining deals undermined Australian shares  sending local shares down a little more than 1  and reversing of the week s modest gains  European bourses  like the euro itself  has recouped are half of yesterday s losses  with the Dow Jones Stoxx 600 is up about 1 25  near midday in London  led by a 2 5  rally in financials    Despite the disappointment with the lack of substantive action from the ECB  Spanish and Italian bonds staying a modest recovery at the long end  but Draghi s indication ECB operations would be focused at the short end has seen a more dramatic response in the 2 year sector  Spain and Italy s 2 year yields are off 48 and 54 bp respectively  Note that Moody s cut Slovenia s rating by three notches to Baa2 late yesterday  increasing the likelihood it too will see assistance   The major foreign currencies are well bid in Europe  but the technical indicators warn that additional strong gains are unlikely ahead of the weekend  The euro is likely to meet resistance in the  1 2250 80 area  Similar resistance in sterling is seen in front of  1 5600  The Australian dollar has been capped near  1 0540 for the past four days  except for that brief spike to  1 0580 yesterday  The dollar s shelf near JPY78 00 remains intact and uninspiring    Today s euro area data does little to alter investor perceptions that the euro zone remains mired in contraction stagnation  The euro area non manufacturing PMI came in at a 4 month high of 47 9 vs the 47 6 flash reading and 47 1 in June  The composite reading rose to 46 5 from 46 4  Retail sales in June rose 0 1  compared with consensus expectations for a flat reading  but the year over year contraction accelerated to 1 2  from  0 8  in May  The UK CIPS Service PMI was a bit disappointing at 51 0 from 51 3 in June  This is the lowest reading since late 2010  This follows the poor manufacturing survey earlier in the week  Although much focus is on the Fed and ECB  the BOE is also like to come under greater pressure to extend its gilt purchases and cut rates    The US employment data is the last major event in what has been an eventful week  Of the numerous high frequency time series  the US nonfarm payroll report is among the most difficult for economists to forecast  There are very few inputs that are reliable  The weekly initial jobless claims  the ADP estimate and the surveys  like the ISM  can be vaguely helpful in the general direction  but the discrepancies in any month can be significant    Given the easing bias that we argue the Fed has in effect adopt  perhaps how the data compares to the recent trend  rather than how the report compares with expectations may be more important  Consider that private sector job growth averaged 91k a month in Q2  which is the lowest weakest quarterly average since Q1 2010  March 2010 was the first month since January 2008 that the US economy grew private sector jobs  The Q1  12 monthly average was 226k and in Q4  11 the average was 183k  We anticipate some stabilization now at lower levels  Private sector job growth of more than 85k in July will see the 3 month moving average increase    However  anything below 100k will be disappointing  In any event  even 100k though is sub par and will not dissuade market participants from expecting the Fed use its balance sheet to support the fragile expansion  The jobs data it will set the tone for other economic reports during the month  including industrial production and manufacturing output  construction spending  and personal income and consumption    Many observers blame Germany for preventing the ECB from taking bolder action  We demur  The German board members have been outvoted before  Instead  it seems that Spain s refusal to formally request the EFSF to support its bonds is the main culprit   This is not to say there are not Rajoy does not have good reasons  A public request could trigger a sharp increase in Spanish yields and EFSF buying bout not happen immediately and some countries  like Germany  would have to approve  Moreover  the conditions that would be attached and the stigma associated could also be destabilizing  Press reports suggested that Italy s Monti was encouraging Rajoy to make a formal request  The pressure can only mount going forward as the ECB works on designing what Draghi called  appropriate modalities  for a policy response ,2012-08-03,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ecb-post-mortem-and-us-jobs-131912,131912

113327,334842,SNE,Weekend Update  Market Is Expecting More Volatility Ahead,opinion,VIX reached its lowest point since June 2007  What started off as a potential partial retracement turned into a zigzag extension of Supercycle wave  b   in Elliott Wave terminology  Monday is day 297 of the current Master Cycle and a pivot day  as well  While implied vol atility  provides insight into expectations of risk ahead  it is the premium to realized vol that tells you the real story and currently that premium remains very high   in other words  the market IS expecting considerably more volatility ahead    Will SPX close above its April High   SPX extended even further  making an incredible 97 6  retracement of the decline between April 2 and June 4  This rally may qualify as a  quadruple zigzag  from the March 2009 low if it can rise above 1422 38 on Monday  its next pivot date  A rare event  indeed   From   All those who were patiently waiting for the S P futures to close at new 2012 highs as the catalyst for Bernanke to announce QE3  can now exhale  if we end here   with S P 500 2012 year end earnings estimates the lowest they have been all year  with corporate revenues now negative quarter over quarter  and with US economic output sliding and GDP back under 2   coupled with another step backward in housing  it was only logical that the S P would close at fresh 2012 highs  NDX may go for Cycle Top Resistance   The NDX may reach for Cycle Top resistance at 2808 54 and a new high on Monday  The next cycle pivot comes on Monday  so there is a significant probability that this may be accomplished  I can honestly say that this was not expected until recently  but a new high  even a marginal one  will complete the final wave high and allow a sharp reversal     in the 20 or so minutes since uploading this article  AAPL added another OpenTable in market cap  It has in the course of a day added the same market cap as Linked In and just shy of Sony  Maybe we should change the name from NASDAQ to Apple    Investors prepare for Euro Collapse   The Euro continues to probe at the Head   Shoulders neckline near 123 20 and its 10 week moving average at 123 90  What is interesting is that the Euro  and therefore the Liquidity Cycle   equities and most commodities now have precisely the same pivot dates  Banks  investors and companies are bracing themselves for the possibility that the euro will break up    and are thus increasing the likelihood that precisely this will happen  The development of real disposable income growth across the Euro area adds an additional complication to the increasingly Byzantine Euro problem  Just like the Olympics  much of the attention is focused on the dynamic of speed  Looking at the growth of real incomes over the first few years of the Euro s existence  it is hard to argue against the idea that the peripheral countries should be taking more pain now  The US Dollar finds 10 week support  USD finally closed above the 10 week moving average at 82 59 on Friday   but barely  Once above the 10week moving average and the Head   Shoulders neckline at 83 65  the coast is clear for a very spirited rally to the H S target at 94 38  Gold hoarding continues the consolidation for 14 weeks   Gold seems to be weakening beneath the Head   Shoulders at 1650 00 after 14   weeks of sideways consolidation  Since the weekends usually offer a  gift  of extra liquidity to the markets on Monday mornings  it may be no surprise to see gold make yet a fifth attempt at overcoming the upper neckline before reversing down  The gold hoarding continues      earlier today we were wondering  rhetorically  of course  what China is doing with all that excess trade surplus if it is not recycling it back into Treasurys  now we once again find out that instead of purchasing US paper  Beijing continues to buy non US gold  in the form of 68 tons in imports from Hong Kong in the month of June  The year to date total  6 months   383 tons  Treasuries Bernanke d The decline in USB appears to be accelerating  This is precisely what cannot happen  especially among the banks that are heavily invested in the bond carry trade  Yet the decline is showing no sign of a let up as yet  The fact is  the bond market is teetering on the edge of a technical breakdown  A further decline may spark the first flash crash in bonds Over the last three weeks  10 year US government bond yields increased from under 1 4  to 1 85    while 30 year went up from 2 44  to 2 96    The 20  year Treasury bond ETF  TLT  declined 8 2  from the top  That s more than three years  worth of interest  gone in just three weeks  The  is the  primary  asset of the Fed  The banks will typically buy Treasury bonds because they are  safe  and they pay a yield  In this case  the Treasury owes the bank the money  Notice that whether the bank holds Treasury bonds directly  or whether it holds dollars that are the liability of the Fed backed by Treasury bonds as the asset  the Treasury bond ultimately backs the bank  Do I hear the word  insolvency   Crude bubbles higher  but watch out for the pop  West Texas Crude extended its second zigzag  closing above Mid Cycle resistance at 95 77 while making a 54  retracement of its March 1 to June 28 decline  A slip below mid Cycle support at 92 10 support puts crude oil on a sell signal

Petroleum Deliveries Lowest Since September 2008  Weakest July Demand Since 1995 As Dow Jones notes   U S  petroleum deliveries  a measure of demand  fell by 2 7  in July from a year earlier to the lowest level in any month since September 2008  the American Petroleum Institute  an industry group  said Friday   It gets worse   Demand in the world s biggest oil consumer  at 18 062 million barrels a day  was the weakest for the month of July since 1995  the API said  Year to date demand is down 2 3  from the same period in 2011   Did Americans forget to drive  China begins its rally without fanfare  The Shanghai index appears to have made an inauspicious beginning of its counter trend rally by stopping short of its 10 week moving average at 2191 65  then making a 99  retracement  Friday was its cycle pivot date  so what is commonly called a  double bottom  may in fact be a powerful reversal signal    China will release corn and rice from state reserves to help tame inflation and reduce imports as the worst US drought in half a century pushes corn prices to global records  creating fears of a world food crisis   The release may prompt Chinese importers to cancel shipments in the near term and take some pressure off international corn prices  which set a new all time high on Friday as the US government slashed its estimate of the size of the crop in the world s top grain exporter   The India Nifty extends its retracement   The India Nifty appears to be putting the final touches on its retracement above both weekly mid Cycle support resistance at 5153 25 and its 10 week moving average at 5231 55  The sell signal is on hold until theCNX Nifty Index declines below these levels  CNX Nifty is closely aligned with the Liquidity Cycle  which is bearish through the end of August and even more so later in the fall  The Bank Index in the final surge of a panic formation  BKX made a new retracement high in a final panic blow off before a potential crash  A decline beneath mid Cycle support at 45 95 or its 10 week moving average at 45 76 confirms the sell signal and a probable decline to its smaller Head   Shoulders target at 31 03 in the next few weeks  The efforts of the Fed to re liquify the banks created a cycle inversion  This  kick the can  mentality on Wall Street only makes the inevitable declines worse  The problem with the banks is insolvency

113357,334872,SNE,4 Tech Stocks With Major Catalysts Ahead,opinion,Here at StreetAuthority  we often talk about  catalyst investing   Simply put  it s not enough to find stocks that are inexpensive    hundreds of stocks can bubble up on various value screens  This often leads to the question  Why now   After all  will this stock still be inexpensive six months from now    Instead  it s wise to focus on stocks with near term drivers  This can be a new product launch or an entry into a new market  Other times  it may be the imminent issuance of a first time dividend or a key acquisition  Whatever the catalyst  these stocks have upcoming events  mandates or milestones that can get shares finally moving up    Let me give an example  If you follow my  100 000 Real Money Portfolio  which is available free for a limited time   then you know I m a fan of Calgon Carbon  NYSE  CCC   which I added to my portfolio roughly two months ago  This stock has been stuck in a trading range  but this should change in coming quarters  New mandates that require ships to treat their ballast water are expected to go into effect before the end of the year  This should set the stage for rising sales in 2013 and beyond  Analysts appear to under appreciate this catalyst  anticipating sales to grow less than 10  in 2013  to about  650 million   This low bar spells opportunity    Here are three other stocks with upcoming catalysts      1  AMD  NYSE  AMD  This chip maker has been steadily growing stronger under new management as new high performance low cost chips are helping retain market share against mighty Intel  Nasdaq  INTC    Just a few days ago  AMD launched a new microprocessor called Trinity  which is targeted to the burgeoning niche of  ultra books   These are sleek  lightweight high end laptops that represent the first solid chance to push back against the tablet computer juggernaut    These ultra books will often carry Intel s chip  but their  1 000 plus price may scare off some buyers  AMD s low priced Trinity chip could be a compelling alternative for ultra book makers  as they d be able to charge as low as  600 for the ultra books  Acer  Asus  Lenovo  Samsung  Sony  NYSE  SNE   Toshiba and Hewlett Packard  NYSE  HPQ  have all announced plans to use Trinity  Expect to hear a lot about this important product launch when AMD releases second quarter results this summer    2  Jabil Circuit  NYSE  JBL  This contract manufacturer serves as the factory to many other tech companies  I first wrote about Jabil   when an impressive growth strategy was laid out for investors  Shares moved up sharply  but have since been hit by concerns that Cisco Systems  Nasdaq  CSCO  and Research in Motion  Nasdaq  RIMM     both key customers    will send less business to Jabil  Those concerns are now priced in  and it s time to revisit this stock  especially now that a positive catalyst is in place The catalyst  the next iPhone  which is slated for release in September  In each of the four periods when the previous iPhones were launched  Jabil s stock typically made a nice quick upward move   Jabil doesn t make the actual phone  but a number of subcomponents that go into it  Here s what happened in each of the past two years  The iPhone 4 was launched in June 2011  and two months later  this stock was up 15   compared with a 5  gain for the S P 500 in the same period   The iPhone 4S was launched in October 2011  which fueled a 36  gain in this stock during the next five months    more than twice the gain seen in the S P 500 With an eye toward that trading pattern  Merrill Lynch has recently upgraded its rating on Jabil to  buy  with a  28 price target  roughly 40  above current levels     3  Take Two Interactive  Nasdaq  TTWO  Shares of this video game maker have slumped badly in recent weeks as an expected catalyst disappeared  Investors were disappointed to learn that  Bioshock Infinite   the next title in the popular  Bioshock  series of games  would see its release delayed from late 2012 to early 2013 so the company could tweak a few story lines    Well  2013 also happens to be the year when Take Two s highly popular  Grand Theft Auto  game will see a new release  These two games alone could help Take Two deliver a knockout year  Although Take Two likely lost roughly  0 65 a share in the fiscal year ended March  results haven t been released yet   analysts anticipate the current year to be far different  Thanks to these two games  sales are expected to more than double in fiscal  March  2013 to about  1 8 billion  Earnings per share may approach  3 according to some forecasts  The recent move back below  13 sets the stage for a very low multiple stock  with clear catalysts in place for upside    Risks to Consider  As Take Two shows  catalysts can be hit by delays  Indeed  I m quite bullish on Calgon Carbon s catalyst induced prospects  but am also prepared for speed bumps along the way to full ballast water treatment adoption    Of all of these  AMD appears to be the most timely investment opportunity  followed by Jabil Circuit  Calgon Carbon and Take Two  All four of these stocks are trading on near term results  and investors are seemingly ignoring the good news to come  This is a great chance to snatch up shares before the crowd catches on  BY David

113365,334880,SNE,Lithium Demand Will Spike  Daniela Desormeaux,opinion,Consumer demand for iPads and smart phones is on the rise  and electric vehicle sales could jumpstart in the near future  Pinpointing production spikes is no simple task  but Economist Daniela Desormeaux of market intelligence company signumBox has plotted some important points in lithium s demand timeline  In this exclusive interview with   Desormeaux highlights growth areas in the industry and explains why small cap lithium producers will have room to compete with the big boys    The Energy Report  The fourth annual Lithium Supply   Markets Conference in Argentina took place at the end of January  What was the mood at that time    Daniela Desormeaux  At that time  people were thinking about how the situation in Europe would impact the industry  I think we have more information about that now  but in January we did not  Regardless  the main drivers behind lithium demand are relatively independent of the economic cycle  and what we see is demand continuing to grow at a healthy rate despite the current situation in Europe  People in the industry know that the main driver of lithium demand is batteries  In the short term  the economic cycle obviously affects the lithium industry  but from a long term view I think expectations remain optimistic    TER  We saw some lithium price increases in mid June of 2011 when  and Chemetall  a unit of   said that they were raising prices on both lithium hydroxide  LiOH  and lithium carbonate  Li2Co3   Will prices continue stronger  or will they stabilize    DD  Well  lithium pricing is very interesting to follow because it s not just about the balance between demand and supply  it s determined by what the main lower cost producers decide to do with prices  which then impacts the rest of the industry  That s the pattern we have seen in the past  FMC and Chemetall did raise prices  and I think they had two reasons for doing that  One is that producers are facing higher raw material costs  The other thing is that FMC and Chemetall are both making some investments in the U S   and FMC is making investments in Argentina  They need higher prices to justify financing these investments    Also  it s important to distinguish between nominal prices and real prices  inflation being another source of price pressure  But short term prices may be stronger because of inflation and these new investments  prices should remain stable in the mid  to long term because even as demand is growing  new production is coming into the market  This will help balance the market    TER  When it comes to pricing individual lithium products  are grade and purity the most important factors    DD  Yes  battery grade lithium requires a small particle size  and to reduce particle size producers need more processing and energy  That increases costs  Therefore  battery grade lithium carbonate is more expensive than commercial grade lithium carbonate  Buyers have to pay for more purity    TER  A recent article in Bloomberg Businessweek      was a very positive story  and it moved the market on small cap lithium stocks  Is this a sign that the lithium market is beginning to wake up    DD  I think the industry has already awakened  We have seen a lot of global interest in lithium over the last five years  But my fear is that in some cases there is an overestimation of lithium demand  Lithium is going to be important now and more important in the future because of its use in batteries for electric cars among other things  but it won t replace oil    TER  Could these overly robust demand expectation lead to a supply glut    DD  In the past  the industry has overestimated demand  and that s why we saw something like 90 projects in the works at one point  But it s impossible for all of these projects to be part of the lithium supply because there is not enough demand in this space for everyone  Thus  most of these projects did not reach production    TER  Nonetheless  demand is actually growing  The question is  at what pace    DD  The lithium industry has a very promising future  and we think demand will grow at about 8  per year  But it s also important to have a very realistic perspective about the industry    TER  Daniela  aren t component makers in transition now from nickel metal hydride batteries to lithium ion batteries  How significant is this shift    DD  The replacement in the electronic devices segment is largely already done  That happened in the nineties when Sony Corporation  SNE NYSE  introduced the first lithium ion cell  It took less than 10 years for lithium ion batteries to take 90  of the market  But there is some new demand as well  because of environmental issues  China is prohibiting the use of acid batteries in motor scooters or bikes  so light electric vehicle makers are being forced to change from acid batteries to lithium ion batteries    TER  Are we back to pre recession demand levels for lithium    DD  I think this industry is really very interesting in that regard  Despite the recession  some expect the battery industry to grow 20  this year  By the end of the year I think that total demand will be higher than previous levels    TER  Where are we now on the demand curve for lithium  At the foot  Near the peak    DD  We are getting close to a breaking point  This will occur when electric cars become affordable for many consumers  We have seen this happen in some countries where there have been lots of subsidies  but it s difficult to believe that European governments will continue with these subsidies  given economic conditions  But the numbers could be amazing  For example  the iPhone contains something like 5 grams  5g  of lithium carbonate while a battery for a car can have 30 kilos  30kg  of lithium carbonate in it  The difference in the numbers is huge  I do think we are approaching a change in the growth trend a breaking point    TER  When will we hit that inflection point    DD  That s a very good question  I think it will be after 2015  The situation in Europe will impact the uptake of electric cars  There are also some analysts who believe that China is slowing down as well  We ll have three or four years before we see a massive taking off of the lithium ion battery industry  It may be sooner or later depending on the economic situation  of course  but I think we are approaching it    TER  Can small cap lithium companies compete with the large companies on scale and margin    DD  I think the answer is yes  because so far what we have seen is the big three lower cost producers  Chemetall  FMC and   are giving the space for newcomers to enter the market  Years ago  I did not think they would do that  I thought they would lower prices to where most of these new projects couldn t be profitable  For example  if the big three lowered prices to  say   2 000 per metric ton   2 000 mt   most of these new projects wouldn t be profitable  But they haven t done that  That s a signal that they are giving room to these newcomers to enter into the market because the demand is growing and the supply  so far  has not grown at the same rate  Smallcaps will have a chance  but of course they will have to compete against each other because room for new companies is limited  If too many come into the market  prices will start to go down  and that of course will impact those smaller companies  Ultimately  I think that the market will be balanced and the lowest cost new producers will be part of the supply chain    TER  Lithium equities  performance has been very weak over the past 16 months  even with this recent uptick in lithium prices  With the exception of the  and  merger that is happening now  why aren t we seeing more consolidation    DD  This global economic situation has had an effect on almost all publicly listed companies  The lithium industry is especially sensitive to that  On the other hand  the economic situation is very much related to what has happened with oil prices  and the oil price is very important to the uptake of electric cars  It is very important to know how the industry works and what the main forces are  We see the main trends in the lithium industry pointing to a very promising future  For example  we have seen many new large scale energy storage projects that use huge batteries  This will represent an important source of demand  as will electric bikes in China    TER  You have recently said that demand for lithium hydroxide would grow from 20  of lithium commodity consumption to 30 35  of lithium consumption by 2020  How can investors play this growth in lithium hydroxide demand    DD  That s a very interesting question because the market for lithium hydroxide is mainly for lubricating grease  New batteries are being developed  the lithium ion phosphate battery  for example  that use lithium hydroxide instead of lithium carbonate  So  we expect a higher growth rate for lithium hydroxide than for lithium carbonate in the case of batteries  And this is very interesting for the companies that plan to produce lithium chemicals from spodumene  pegmatites   because the process of producing lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate from lithium concentrate  obtained from spodumene  is very similar in terms of costs  Chinese lithium chemical producers can either produce carbonate or hydroxide directly from the concentrate  This gives them an advantage over brine producers because SQM  Chemetall and FMC have to produce the lithium hydroxide starting from the lithium carbonate    TER  My understanding is that lithium hydroxide is the choice of some manufacturers  including Chinese battery and car manufacturer BYD Company Ltd   BYDDF OTCBB   of which Warren Buffett owns approximately 10     DD  That s correct  BYD is working on the lithium ion phosphate battery  which uses lithium hydroxide in the cathode  and I think this company will be a very important player in the future  Its K9 electric bus is being tested in many cities and if successful it will represent an important step towards the electrification of transportation    TER  Daniela  what do you tell investors who want to invest in lithium    DD  You have to look at the battery industry  because it is going to be crucial  Today it represents 30  of total lithium demand and we estimate that in 10 more years  it will represent about 50  of the demand  So far  there aren t any substitutes for lithium in batteries  But who knows what will happen in the future  In any event  the lithium industry shows a very promising future  and among all of the commodities it represents one of the highest expected rates of growth    TER  Thank you  Daniela

   Sony climbs despite bad reviews for tablet computers
   Steelmakers up on report of lower materials costs

 By Ayai Tomisawa	
 TOKYO  Sept 1  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average rose on
Thursday to clear 9 000 for the first time in two weeks  helped
by expectations of more easing from the Federal Reserve and by
Chinese data but further gains are likely to be limited ahead of
U S  data this week 	
 Chinese manufacturing data released in the morning came in
mostly line with expectations  lifting U S  stock futures and
pushing the Nikkei to its sixth straight day of gains 	
  The China PMI data gave some immediate relief to the
market  but the U S  data  particularly the employment numbers 
are still to come   said Yutaka Shiraki  senior equity
strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities       	
 U S  non manufacturing data from the Institute for Supply
Management and U S  nonfarm payroll data will be released on
Thursday and Friday  respectively  These will provide clues as
to the strength of the U S  economy and the likelihood of more
Fed steps 	
 The benchmark Nikkei climbed 1 2 percent to
9 063 03  The broader Topix index gained 1 1 percent to
778 90 	
 The Nikkei lost 8 9 percent last month as equities markets
worldwide were battered in August by the U S  credit ceiling
saga  worries that the United States was slipping back into
recession and the euro zone debt crisis 	
 Some market participants said that given the extent of those
losses  September was bound to be a better month 	
  There is still a  reality check  that stocks were oversold
in August and we re seeing some rebalancing  At least we are
unlikely to see the kind of hedge fund redemptions we saw in
August   said Koichi Ogawa  chief portfolio manager at Daiwa SB
Investments 	
 Others also said that recent strength in U S  stock markets
indicates that investor risk appetite was on the mend 	
  The fact that the Dow has gained for four straight days is 
a big change   said Eiji Kinouchi  chief technical analysts at
Daiwa Securities Capital Markets 	
 Kinouchi said risk appetite would likely continue
to rise  noting that in the year after the 2008 collapse of Bear
Stearns there were four occasions when the Dow Jones Industrial
Average had gained for four or more consecutive days and
each time  risk appetite had risen 	
  Sony Corp rose 1 9 percent to 1 697 yen  after
dropping 1 8 percent on Wednesday following a brokerage
downgrade  The rise came despite bad reviews for its newly
launched tablet computers as investors bought on dips  helped by
positive sentiment in the overall market  	
 Sony shed 12 percent over the past month  underperforming
the Nikkei 	
 Steelmakers  shares also outperformed after the Nikkei
business daily said the yen s rise and lower resource prices
will likely lessen their raw materials costs 	
 Nippon Steel Corp rose 2 6 percent to 235 yen  JFE
Holdings was up 3 0 percent at 1 820 yen  Sumitomo
Metal Industries gained 3 8 percent to 166 yen and Kobe
Steel added 3 5 percent to 147 yen 	
 Yamada Denki gained 2 5 percent to 5 730
yen after Mizuho Securities raised the discount electronics
store operator s rating to  outperform  from  neutral   saying
the  recovery trend in its earnings will likely continue after
the business year ending next March

Obama  There won t be any magic rebound   said Fumiyuki
Nakanishi  strategist at SMBC Friend Securities 	
  On the other hand  employment is a lagging indicator  not a
leading one  and Japanese stock losses could present a buying
opportunity if U S  markets recover later this week and Japan
follows their lead

 Volume was thin  with 979 million shares changing hands on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange s main board  on track to undershoot

Federal Reserve alone might not be enough to solve the economy s

113375,334890,SNE,FX news and analysis 12th Apr,opinion,USD The dollar fell on Thursday after risk appetite rose on the back of better than expected Chinese data which showed a rise in country s trade surplus and much stronger than expected export figures  The positive print helped dispel overly pessimistic expectations although it was still not as good as previous data and overall China does still appear to be slowing down  The dollar was also pressured from data from home showing that the number of Americans out of work rose in the run up to Easter when it had been expected to decline  Following on from the poor NFPs last Friday the data further weighed on the dollar as QE3 hopes resurfaced  The number of new Jobless in the week ending Apr 7 rose to 380k when a fall to 355k had been estimated   the starting figure was 367k  Meanwhile Continuing Claims actually rose to 3251k when a lesser fall to 3335k had been expected  Other data showed a doveish fall in the Producer Price Index  YoY   Mar  2 8  when a more muted fall to 3 1  had been expected from a previous figure of 3 3   although Ex Food and Energy showed a rise of 1 basis point above the consensus  Finally the U S Trade Balance showed a shrinking deficit after a   46 0bn print in Feb when a   51 7bn print had been expected and previous figure had been  53 5bn  EURThere was a slight rebound in risk appetite on Thursday which helped propel the euro back up to the top of its consolidation range  caused partly by better than expected Chinese data which reassured investors that slow down fears were overdone  China Trade Balance came in at 5 35bn in March vs  3 15bn expected and  31 5bn previous  Exports were also slightly better at 8 9  compared to 7 0  expected and Imports fell to 5 3  from 9 0  expected  The results were still lower than previously and symptomatic of a global shift but not as bad as had been thought  On the home front Italian bond sales showed a continued rise in borrowing costs with 3 yr debt up to 3 89  from 2 76  previously whilst demand was good  Overall the higher yield didn t impact on the euro as the new development may now already be priced in  On the data front German Trade Balance continued to show a widening surplus  which reached 14 7bn vs 12bn expected  The single currency may also have been helped by the rise in German exports by 1 6  vs  1 2  expected and 3 4  previously GBP The pound rose on Thursday as safe haven demand for the currency and a recovery in global risk appetite both contributed to keeping it well bid  The robustness of U K gilts at a time when most E U countries are seeing the risk premium on their debt rise has helped sterling despite economic headwinds and a ball and chain of its own home grown debt  Recent data has further helped the country s safe image as it showed an easing in the fall in house prices and a pep up for retail sales after figures released by the British Retail Consortium  BRC  on Tuesday evening showed them rising  Today s data actually disappointed but such was the faith in the pound  it failed to dent investor enthusiasm  The Trade Deficit increased more than expected to   8 77bn when a   7 65bn had been expected which was slightly higher than the   7 88bn noted in the previous month of February  Trade Balance Non EU showed an even more marked deficit of   5 02bn when   3 83bn had been expected instead  This would have been expected to undermine the pound as it showed a fall in exports to nations outside the E U which the government has been encouraging to reduce the dependency on the crisis prone E U  but the pound shrugged off the negative news and rose nevertheless JPYThe yen weakened overall as risk appetite improved following better than expected data from China and expectations of ECB support for crippled euro zone periphery  Data from the previous evening showed a healthy rise in the Domestic Corporate Goods Index MoM  Mar   which increased to 0 6  from 0 4  expected and 0 2  previous  YoY the same rise of 0 6  was reported  Other data showed a rise in Money Stock  which increased by 3 0  YoY when 2 8  had been expected and M3 increased by 2 6  when 2 5  had been expected in March  The increase in Money Supply would be expected to filter through to growth over coming months  BOJ commentary was particularly doveish which may have weighed on the yen  Particularly poor earnings results by Sony and Sharp on Tuesday may have spurred the BOJ into action as well as the increase euro zone debt jitters of last fortnight  BOJ s Shirakawa reemphasized his commitment to meeting the inflation target of 1  by any means and the expectation is that the BOJ will increase quantitative easing at its next meeting in April  perhaps by as much as 5tr yen ,2012-04-12,Forex4you,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fx-news-and-analysis-12th-apr-119973,119973

suggesting we have a solution to the long term fiscal problem  What we do know is  we don t like yours   This is the essence of failed leadership  Rather than put out a solution to this very clear and present danger to our country s future  the president has decided to wait for the Republicans to offer their solution and then attack it  If you put a budget plan in place that does deal with the drivers of our debt  that will give us an immediate boost of growth today  The bond markets and businesses are looking to see if leadership is getting this situation under control so that they can take risks  so that they know they will have a certain future to be optimistic about  Until you have a plan like this in place  you can t reap that kind of a growth dividend    New York Post VW s sales in China rose 13  in the first quarter  with BMW s up 41   Mercedes Benz reported a 24  sales increase on the mainland But  total vehicle sales in China fell 3 4  from a year earlier for the quarter  down 1 3  for passenger cars   Sales are still expected to rise this year Natural gas traded below  2 for the first time since January 2002  The warm weather in the first quarter kept usage low and in turn has led to record inventories as supplies continue to rise  On the crude front  the International Energy Agency said tightness in the oil market is easing  but it s still largely about Iran The Justice Department announced it was suing five major publishers and Apple on e book price fixing charges  and simultaneously settling with three of them  which is a big boon for Amazon  which then announced it was pushing prices down on e books to as low as  9 99 for some big titles  The publishers and booksellers argue that the ultimate effect of the suit will be to enhance Amazon s perceived monopoly even further  with Amazon already controlling 60  of the e book market The government said the five plus Apple met secretly to set prices and then sought to hide their discussions HarperCollins  Hachette and Simon   Schuster settled  while Penguin  Macmillan and Apple vowed to fight the charges Facebook acquired photo sharing app maker Instagram for  1 billion in cash in a move that  needless to say  had people buzzing  especially since Instagram has been around for about 18 months  and has all of 13 employees and no revenue  while founder Kevin Systrom just made an estimated  400 million  Facebook  with an estimated value of  100 billion  goes public next month  CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised Systrom that Instagram would be able to operate as an independent company  The two have known each other since 2004 Among the many amazing parts to this story is the fact that last Friday  Instagram closed a  50 million funding round led by Sequoia Capital  which valued the company at  500 million  and then on Monday  Facebook acquired it for  1 billion Holman W  Jenkins  Jr    Wall Street Journal Facebook obviously has learned one lesson of the Internet bubble  If you have a  100 billion market cap and no way to make money  find a way to spend it  We re being mean  The  1 billion Mark Zuckerberg spent on Instagram is pocket change and the deal s purpose wasn t handwaving to convince investors he was finding a solution to Facebook s profits challenge  He s still trying to please users  God bless him  especially mobile users  who love Instagram to customize the look of photos they snap with their smartphones  It s nice that Mr  Zuckerberg continues to be mostly interested in the happiness of his users  who number a gross 845 million  But how

especially considering the phone was designed for the American market and launched just days ago with the slogan   An amazingly fast way to connect  Nokia also admitted it lost money on every phone it sold in the first quarter and warned it did not expect an improvement in margins in the second quarter Sony announced it is shedding 10 000 jobs as part of a major reorganization  The cuts will be made over the next 12 months  Earlier  Sony forecast a record annual loss of  6 4 billion for the past financial year  double a previous estimate and due largely to an additional tax expense Sony s television business has lost money for the past eight years  despite selling 20 million sets per annum  so the company is looking to cut costs in the business by 60  by March 2014 A survey by the New

President Gary Cohn are not getting along as well as they have in the past  with Cohn frustrated that he hasn t taken over the top slot yet  One Goldman insider said   Gary thinks it s his time  to lead    Cohn is 51  Blankfein 57  with the latter telling other Wall Street executives he wants to remain CEO for another few years   or as long as it takes to restore the investment bank s reputation So imagine the battle taking place between the two spouses  When is Lloyd going to give up the top spot to Gary   Not any time soon  honey  My Lloyd will step down when he s ready to  Deal with it   Lloyd received a pay cut for 2011 to  12 million  which also didn t please Lady Blankfein  Separately  Goldman agreed to pay  22 million to settle regulatory charges alleging Goldman analysts had weekly  huddles  from 2006 to 2011 where they discussed confidential research on stocks with the firm s traders  The analysts then passed on the ideas to selected clients  before it was published  This is but one example of why some of us despise Goldman  not because of the New York Times op ed by the disgruntled former employee  It was July 2010 that Goldman reached a record  550 million settlement of the SEC s fraud charges it misled buyers of mortgage related investments This is bad  As the Wall Street Journal reports  the spread of white nose syndrome among the bat population to Missouri and Alabama for the first time makes 19 states and four Canadian provinces  killing an estimated 5 5 million  The concern is that bats serve as nature s pest control and it could have a major impact on agriculture and the battle against crop eating insects The federal government reached an agreement with 41 American Indian tribes to settle charges it mishandled money and natural resources managed on their behalf  The dispute is decades old The Interior Department oversees 50 million acres of land for federally recognized tribes and in the process handles leases for oil and gas production and timber harvesting  among other things If you ever wondered where stolen art ends up  try Serbia  A painting by Paul Cezanne  valued in excess of  100 million that had been stolen from a

tickets are sold to repeat customers  and 68  are women  according to music historian Cary Ginell   Phantom  also remains the longest running show in Broadway history  We note the passing of painter Thomas Kinkade  54  the self styled  Painter of Light  who made a fortune on his work  some  53 million alone between 1997 2005  Early in his career  Kinkade was selling his paintings in parking lots and once rode the rails with another artist  sketching landscapes  But he persevered  He was dismissed in some circles for  mass producing kitsch   but I kind of liked some of it  Since his death last

data is hard to come by regarding China does not seem to inhibit many outside observers  In this piece I will look at China through the lens of economic structure  Chinese history and culture concepts which a number of observers often overlook  My general conclusion is that Chinese GDP growth rates are about to undergo a gradual but nevertheless perceptible decline  But I now believe a hard landing crash is unlikely  assuming that Europe does not totally disintegrate  and the US does not roll over into a full scale recession The Minsky Kindleberger bubble model is not generally applicable to China  Outside observers visit China and see empty cities and excesses in capital  infrastructure and real estate investments  They think they see Western style  market bubbles  The Minsky Kindleberger model with its Financial Instability Hypothesis describes an environment where private investors become overenthused about a particular asset and become overleveraged  The ensuing bubble followed by collapse brings about distress and panic for indebted investors and the financial system which has extended them credit  This model describes what happened in the US and other Western countries very well  But it does not describe what is happening in China where the public rather than the private sector is doing the borrowing  You do not hear stories of private mortgagors overborrowing to buy houses as happened in the US  It is a foregone conclusion in China that the government will eventually pick up the tab for bad loans made to local public sector entities and bail out the banks if necessary  The Chinese economy is state  or more precisely Communist Party  directed  not market directed  Minsky Kindleberger style bubbles and collapses are characteristics of Western market economies  not state directed ones where overleveraged private investors are not playing a major role in the process  As long as the state has the financial resources to cover these losses a bubble type collapse can be avoided  At this point in time  the Chinese state has those resources The Chinese economy is overallocating capital to investment  in real estate  capital goods and infrastructure  But the result will not be the burst of a bubble but rather a longer term continuous decline in the marginal productivity of capital  As a result  the torrid GDP growth exhibited by China will gradually slow down  Countries can t waste capital on the scale China apparently has and register torrid GDP growth  The future for China is therefore a protracted slowing as compared to the high growth of the recent past  The cost of empty buildings and overinvestment will not in general be borne by private investors but by the state  But all those empty buildings and overinvestment will produce low or negative returns  State owned companies that specialize in these industries as well as private companies which depend on them would seem to be poor long term investment candidates  Ditto for the state owned banks which play a primary role in this capital misallocation process China has benefited from a massive shift of labor from the countryside to the city  These people moved from low to zero productivity activities to higher productivity activities  But this is a one time event  If it has not come to an end yet  it will soon  China is rapidly becoming an urban country China as a latecomer has benefited from being able to import Western technology Examples abound in this area  Internet search  telecommunications  airlines  medicine the list goes on  Many have argued that stealing Western technology has been a core part of the Chinese development strategy  I believe these charges have a great deal of truth  But some scholars  in China s defense  have argued that the US did exactly the same thing by  stealing  British technology in the 19 th century  Information wants to be free  Stewart Brand famously said  Be that as it may  this phenomenon is also a one time event although it probably has a longer  shelf life  than the urban migration phenomenon China s one child policy and current trends will produce an unfavorable demographic situation in the long run  The Chinese worker retired beneficiary ratio is projected to decline steadily from here on  Actually  attributing this entirely to the government directed one child policy may not be entirely correct  All the Asian Confucian societies Hong Kong  Singapore  Japan  Korea and Taiwan   now exhibit birth rates at close to half the replacement rate of 2 1 children per woman  All face an unfavorable demographic future  Several of these countries   notably Singapore   have tried to encourage its citizens to have more children but to no avail The idea that China is about to disintegrate or be afflicted by serious public disorders is at variance with Chinese history  Yes  there are thousands of local protests each year  Yes  China has its share of dissidents  But take a look at Chinese history  Chinese history has a twenty five hundred year pattern of Disorder  Ascending Dynasty  Increasing Order   Dynastic Peak  Declining Dynasty  Increasing Disorder   Disorder  I would argue that China is in the Ascending Dynasty phase at the moment  I would argue for example that the Bo Xilai incident is basically noise not much different in significance than John Edwards  problem with his mistress Some might argue that the current Communist regime is not a dynasty in its pure feudal sense  But I would argue that the differences between the current Communist  dynasty  and prior dynasties are basically superficial  For example  the country remains centrally controlled   thought is tightly managed  the thousand year old Imperial Examinations have simply been replaced by the Gao Kao college entrance exams  Yes succession is no longer hereditary   Hu Jintao s son is not becoming the new emperor and  alas  the Communist emperor is not permitted at least in public a bevy of concubines  But even in the case of succession the leaders are chosen from a select group where having the right parents counts   The Qing emperors  sartorial choice of resplendent yellow robes puts the current Communist emperors  choice of attire to shame   For the benefit of those unfamiliar with this  I will reproduce a simplified version of Chinese dynastic history  Note that the Qin and Sui Dynasties were short lived but were immediately replaced by another Chinese dynasty  not a period of Disorder  The relatively shorter lived Yuan Dynasty was one imposed on China by a foreign conqueror who did not fully  Sinicize  and was ultimately kicked out and replaced by the Chinese Ming Dynasty  Hard landing  soft landing  civil unrest  dominant economic superpower   the forecasts flow freely

of the American Republic  which began operations under its Constitution in 1789  The current Communist Dynasty is a relative youngster  having been in power for only 63 years  Certainly China s political system will change and evolve but anyone predicting its early demise or disintegration is going against the record of Chinese history  To repeat  China is in the Ascending period of a dynasty in which order increases China as currently structured is not suited to the needs o f a knowledge economy  Restraints on the flow of information is a major characteristic of the current regime  A knowledge society requires complete freedom of information and political freedom in general  One can argue that at lower levels of income and development that democracy is often an obstacle  India and its problems are cited as an example  But at higher levels of income and development  where knowledge plays an important role  the opposite is true  Moreover  Confucian culture with its emphasis on obedience is not necessarily compatible with a knowledge society  One may ask how a Steve Jobs   college dropout  drug user and one time hippie   would have fared growing up in China or even Singapore or Japan  Of course he would have been squashed  And not necessarily by any laws but rather by the culture itself  Apple would still be a fruit  not a company  One might ask why Sony could not maintain a culture of innovation  Is it a basic reverence for authority and stability built into Japan s cultural DNA  Is Apple today a better bet to maintain its culture of innovation than Sony was The work ethic and the obsession with material improvement of the Chinese people are big investment pluses for China  Of course the current economic system in China is a major improvement over the Mao era  But it is still a highly defective protectionist state dominated system that misallocates resources  The work ethic  relatively high level of education and obsession with material improvement of the Chinese people have helped make China a success in spite of the current economic structure Investing in China the Southeast Asian AlternativeEven a slowing China will be an economic powerhouse in Asia  I see the countries southeast Asia as primary beneficiaries of China s  ascent  These countries would include Singapore  Thailand  Philippines  Malaysia  Brunei  Indonesia  Vietnam  Cambodia  Laos and Myanmar  Those are the ASEAN countries  A broader definition would include Hong Kong  Macau and Taiwan  These countries  and territories  are growth centers in their own right  But they are major beneficiaries of burgeoning Chinese  and Indian  tourism  trade and investment  These countries  particularly Singapore  Malaysia  Hong Kong and even the Philippines  do not have China s corporate governance issues  Gambling comes to mind as one area where the Chinese presence will be powerful and growing  Casinos do not exist in China  a puritanical holdover from the Mao early Communist days  The soaring towers of Marina Bay Sands integrated resort and casino have now become Singapore s iconic buildings  Banking is another area  Southeast Asian banks will participate in the region s growth but overall they are not overt instruments of government policy as in China  And the banks and the governments have learned important lessons in the Asian crisis of 1998  Singapore is the region s emerging Switzerland and wealth management center  Hong Kong is becoming the preferred listing for IPOs from China and globally  Many of the companies in this region are small  suggesting the use of ETFs although that would be less true in the case of Singapore and Hong Kong where larger companies are listed American Tech Companies   America s Crown JewelsIn scanning companies around the world  nothing compares with the agglomeration of companies that comprise the American tech sector  Silicon Valley  and California in particular  is one of America s gifts to the world  Freedom of information  a vast network of financing  a world class educational system and a positive attitude toward innovation have created the Apples  the Facebooks  the Googles  etc etc  In this time of economic turbulence  these companies have been a refuge for investors  No other country can equal this record although adjusted for size little Israel is comparable  The major cloud on this horizon is America s and particularly California s budget issues  The starving for funds of the vaunted California higher educational system has now become a major problem  The New York Times just ran an article on how Apple had been able to avoid California s punitive taxes  The question needs to be asked what would have happened  if Apple had not been able to avoid these taxes  Would Apple have moved out of state or out of the US When France under Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685  talented French Protestants Huguenots  moved out of France to more hospitable places like England and Holland  A devastating economic blow was dealt to France by this self destructive act  Similarly  in the late fifteenth century  Jews were driven from Spain and Portugal thus depriving those countries of another valuable and talented group  Will the US  with punitive taxation  deteriorating educational institutions and protectionist campaigns against outsourcing  do the same with its technology sector

   Dollar drops as Moody s puts U S  on review
   Euro bounces back  but debt worries linger
   Asian stocks tread lower as investors cut risk

 By Vikram Subhedar	
 HONG KONG  July 14  Reuters    The dollar fell on Thursday 
sending gold to a record high  after a Moody s warning on the
United States  credit rating but resilience in U S  Treasuries
suggested bond investors expected lawmakers to ultimately raise
the county s debt ceiling in time to avoid default 	
 The weak dollar gave the beleagured euro a slight reprieve
although a looming Italian bond auction kept investors on edge 	
 European stock markets were set for a lower start with
Britain s FTSE 100 seen down 1 2 percent and Germany s
DAX down a percent  	
 Italy will likely have to pay a hefty price to sell up to 5
billion euros of long term bonds in what will be a key test of
market appetite for the country s debt since contagion worries
sparked a sharp sell off in its assets  	
The standoff in the U S  Congress over raising Washington s
debt ceiling while disagreements over a plan to reduce the
ballooning deficit prompted Moody s to place its Aaa rating on
review for a possible downgrade for the first time since 1996 
 	
 For markets  the stalled U S  debt talks have added to
worries that Europe s sovereign debt crisis is worsening 
Meantime  euro zone leaders sought to break an impasse on how
and when to grant Greece urgent aid  	
 The risk of a lower credit rating for the U S  overshadowed
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke s suggestion  in testimony
to Congress  that the central bank could provide more stimulus
if the economy weakens further 	
  It s a very political environment right now and that s
causing all this volatility and you d have to be too brave to
take very big decisions   said Elke Schoeppl Jost  Chief
Investment Officer at BEA Union Investment in Hong Kong 	
  Gold is speaking its own language and I expect its rise
will continue   said Schoeppl Jost   Especially if there is more
money printing from the U S  	
 The potential for another round of asset purchases by the
Fed  known as quantitative easing  and the Moody s warning added
up to a double whammy for the dollar 	
  It slid to a four month low of 78 48 against the yen 
earlier in the day before regaining some ground to hit a session
high of 79 01 on talk that a U S  bank was a buyer of dollars 
  	
 The stronger yen drove demand for Japanese government bonds
with the yield on 10 year JGBs dropping below
1 085 percent to an eight month low and the benchmark Nikkei
 stock index which ended 0 3 percent lower 	
 Exporters were hit by the yen s rise with Sony Corp 
down a percent and Toyota off 0 8 percent 	
 Adding a layer of uncertainty to already jittery markets  a
senior official at Japan s Ministry of Finance said it was
possible Japan could intervene in the market without giving any
advance warning  	
 The White House and Congress must forge a deal to raise
America s debt limit by Aug  2 or the government will run out of
money to pay its bills and default on some obligations  But they
have so far failed due to a sharp divide over taxes 	
 
 
 DOLLAR WOES	
 The U S  currency was on the run in Asia hitting a fresh
record low against the Swiss franc around 0 8082 francs earlier
 while the euro rose to  1 4177 after having fallen
to as low as  1 3984 	
 Against a basket of currencies  the dollar was down 0 2
percent at 75 092   having tumbled for a high of 76 053 	
 The Moody s warning has intensified pressure on U S 
lawmakers to scramble together a deal to avert a debt default 	
  We believe that the most likely scenario is that the
Moody s statement provides motivation for a more serious push to
a political compromise and USD selling on this factor may
unwind   said Steve Englander  head of G10 foreign exchange
strategy at Citigroup 	
 Gold powered to a fresh record on course for a ninth
successive day of gains  matching a similar winning streak in
2006  	
 Elsewhere in Asia  the MSCI Asia ex Japan 
was trading down 0 3 percent lower with Hong Kong s Hang Seng
index down 0 3 percent 	
  From a macro perspective and even a fundamental perspective
Asia is in a much stronger position than the West  but you can t
look at Asia in isolation   said Catherine Yeung  investment
director at Fidelity Investments in Hong Kong 	
  You look at market turnover and it s been incredibly thin 
From a fund flow point of view  the biggest risk for Asia
Pacific markets still remains what s going in the U S  and
Europe   said Yeung  who added that there were buying
opportunites based on valuations for long term investors in
Asia 	
 Thomas Kwan  Head of Asian Debt Investment at Baring Asset
Management  said a U S  technical default  would be troublesome
to the market  even for a very short period of time  Look at
what happened to Italy on Monday   	
  But this will not mean real money accounts will actually
sell heavily into this event as investors will still believe
that the US will at least come up with a plan to service debt
very quickly  if not  it would be disastrous for the global
financial system global and economy

113444,334959,SNE,European shares headed for steep weekly decline,news,"  FTSEurofirst 300 set for biggest weekly drop since March
   Financials retreat ahead of bank stress test results
   Risk appetite falls  technical outlook bearish

 By Atul Prakash	
 LONDON  July 15  Reuters    European shares were headed for
their biggest weekly fall in four months on Friday  with miners
tracking weaker metals and financials coming under pressure
ahead of a bank stress test report expected to show some
second tier lenders have failed 	
 Persistent concerns about debt crises in euro zone and the
United States prompted investors to stay away from riskier
assets  with warnings from credit rating agencies of a possible
U S  downgrade making investors nervous 	
 The Euro STOXX 50 volatility index   one of Europe s 
main barometers of sentiment  rose 6 percent  indicating a drop
in investor desire to buy assets such as equities 	
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares
was down 0 4 percent at 1 084 64 points at 0841 GMT  after
falling 0 9 percent in the previous session  The index is down
2 7 percent this week  the sharpest decline since mid March 	
 European insurers fell 1 2 percent  the Thomson
Reuters Peripheral Eurozone Banks index was
down 0 6 percent  while European banks dropped 0 7
percent  Commerzbank fell 2 6 percent 	
  We have still got a cocktail of uncertainties for
investors   said Keith Bowman  equity analyst at Hargreaves
Lansdown 	
  The situation in Europe is still very difficult to
forecast  We had another warning over the U S  credit position
and on the top of all that we have got the bank stress test
results to come later today  	
 The results of the stress test of 90 lenders were expected
to show around 10 have insufficient capital to withstand a
prolonged recession  No large bank was expected to fall short
and total capital needed could be under 10 billion euros   14
billion   	
  Transparency will be increased and the market will
differentiate more between the stronger banks and the ones which
are more exposed   said Klaus Wiener  chief economist at
Generali Investments  which manages 330 billion euros 	
 European technology shares also suffered a sharp sell off 
The sector index fell 1 4 percent  while Ericsson
 fell 1 3 percent on news Sony Ericsson  owned 50 50
by the Swedish company and Japanese group Sony   swung
to a second quarter loss  	
 Miners fell 1 percent 	
 
 BULL MARKET OVER 	
 The Euro STOXX 50   the euro zone s blue chip 
index fell 0 7 percent to 2 676 11  The index has been
underperforming other leading equity indexes and its latest
weakness has taken the index through March and June lows around
2 717 	
 Bill McNamara  technical analyst at Charles Stanley  said a
test of the November lows at around 2 635 looked like a
realistic possibility 	
  Such price action can hardly be described as bullish and
the break down through the medium term uptrend  which took place
last month  has been followed by further weakness  confirming
that the bull market for the index is over   he said  	
 Analysts said slow progress in U S  budget talks had been
increasing investor anxiety 	
 U S  President Barack Obama suspended negotiations for the
day on Friday to give congressional leaders a chance to come up
with a plan of action to unblock talks meant to cut deficits and
avert a debt default  	
 Markets were concerned Republicans and Democrats were too
far apart to reach a major budget agreement by Aug  2  when the
United States would run out of money unless the cap on
government borrowing is raised 	
  There is no doubt that they need to get their act together 
Even a temporary default will not be advisable   Wiener said 	
  But there is a fundamental difference between what we see
in the United States and what we see in the euro area  In the
U S   we are talking about a debt ceiling which is self imposed 
whereas in the euro zone  the problem in some countries is that
the capital market is not willing to give them any more money  	
 Standard   Poor s said there was a one in two chance it
would cut the United States  AAA rating if a deal on raising the
debt ceiling was not agreed soon  Moody s has also placed the
United States on review for downgrade 	
 Investors kept a close eye on the eruo zone debt crisis  The
lower house of Italy s parliament was expected to give final
approval to an austerity plan worth 48 billion euros which the
country is hoping will help soothe market fears it is being
sucked into the euro zone debt crisis  	
 Among individual movers  SGS fell 5 6 percent
after the world s largest inspection services company said its
2011 operating margin would be hit by higher investments in the
second half after the strong Swiss franc weighed on its
first half results

   Nikkei unlikely to break 9 800 in next few weeks analysts
   Some signs of investors  appetite in large cap shares

 By Hideyuki Sano	
 TOKYO  June 24  Reuters    The Nikkei average rose to a
three week closing high on Friday  helped by news that Greece
has agreed to a five year austerity plan and as a fall in oil
prices eased worries about a slowdown in the U S  economy 	
 There was buying in large cap shares  market players said 
adding that it could be a sign of new long positions although
some doubt the Nikkei can break above 9 800 in the near future 
as gains have been capped around that level since early May 	
  There s a feeling that the impact of negative factors which
 have hurt global shares is petering out  It may take a little
while before U S  data shows improvement but I think the market
has put the worst behind it   said Hisashi Kuroda  general
manager of equity investments at Meiji Yasuda Asset Management 	
 European Union leaders promised more money to help
Greece stave off looming bankruptcy  and although Athens still
faces many hurdles  including a parliamentary vote on the
austerity measures next week  the news did ease investor
nervousness  	
  The market is riding a rebound in global shares after the
Greece news  There appears to be fresh buying from investors
too  Some shares such as Sony have fallen enough to
lure bargain hunting   said Toshiyuki Kanayama  a market analyst
at Monex Securities 	
The benchmark Nikkei rose 0 9 percent to
9 678 71  its highest close since June 1  Strong resistance is
seen at its 200 day moving average of 9 850 	
 The broader Topix index also gained 0 9 percent  to
833 20 	
 The Nikkei s gains were slightly smaller than its peers in
Asia  with the MSCI ex Japan Asia Pacific index 
rising 1 1 percent  But since the beginning of June  the Nikkei
is down 0 2 percent  compared to a fall of 4 7 percent in the
ex Japan index 	
 A fall in oil prices to four month lows after a release of
emergency oil reserves by major economies is expected to help
the U S  economy as high gasoline prices have been hurting
consumers  	
 That slide in oil prices boosted shares of shipping firms
with Mitsui O S K  rising 3 2 percent to 417 yen 	
 Sony Corp gained 2 4 percent  snapping six weeks of
losses for a weekly gain of 4 5 percent  Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
Stanley Securities raised its rating to  outperform  from
 neutral   citing its efforts to cut procurement costs   	
 Electronics conglomerate Toshiba jumped 4 9 percent
after a similar upgrade to  outperform  from  neutral  by
Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley analyst Masahiko Ishino 	
 Mass production of 19 nanometre NAND flash memory  new chip
capacity expansion  and nuclear power and thermal power
operations will drive its earnings  he said 	
 Trade volume was 1 76 billion shares  in line with the
recent daily average  Advancers outnumbered decliners by 1 144
to 406

 SINGAPORE  May 27  Reuters    Gold rose on Friday as
mounting worries about a Greece debt default prompted buying
from investors  while silver gained more than 2 percent after
tumbling from a two week top in the previous session  	
 Gold may revisit a recent three week top before profit
taking kicks in  while silver    which has outpaced gold and is
heading for its best weekly gain since late April at more than 7
percent    will continue seeing volatile price movements 
analysts said  	
 Spot gold added  5 60 to  1 523 70 an ounce by 0517
GMT as Greece fights to avoid a debt restructuring  Gold touched
a record around  1 575 in early May   	
  It s still the expectation that there s a possibility for a
Greece default and greater safe haven buying coming to the
precious metals such as gold and silver   said Ong Yi Ling 
investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore 	
  With gold prices actually close to a three week high  then
perhaps you could also see some profit taking and some closing
of the bullish position later in the day   she said 	
  Silver rose 27 cents to  37 51 an ounce in thin
trade after hitting a high around  38  It had rallied to a
two week high at  38 84 on Thursday before hitting a low around
 36 as speculators booked profits  Silver struck record at
 49 51 an ounce in April 	
  I guess for silver  it s a lot of speculation and a lot of
volatile movements  I would expect that to continue  We re not
seeing the longer term investors really coming back into the
market yet   said Ong of Phillip Futures 	
  It s pretty much speculation and volatility going forward  
 
 
 Holdings on the largest silver backed ETF  New York s
iShares Silver Trust   dropped 0 51 percent earlier this
week and remained unchanged at 9 941 33 tonnes on Thursday 
 	
 Holdings have fallen by nearly 9 million ounces this week
alone  bringing year to date outflow to 8 4 percent  or 42 79
million ounces 	
 The gold silver ratio  used to measure how many ounces of
silver can buy one ounce of gold  was at about 40 after falling
to around 31 in late April  its weakest since early 1980s 	
 Precious metal prices continued to be supported by jitters
over Greece s debt problems that could have a big ripple effect
across other high risk European countries struggling with gaping
fiscal deficits   ID nLDE74O1MZ  	
 The International Monetary Fund could withhold the next
slice of aid to Greece due next month  the head of euro zone
finance ministers said on Thursday  spooking markets with the
possibility of a default   ID nLDE74P1HC 	
 Overall trading was slow in the bullion market ahead of the
U S  Memorial Day holiday weekend  COMEX June gold futures
 rose  3 3 an ounce to  1 526 1 an ounce 	
 The dollar tumbled broadly on Friday after weak U S 
economic data dragged the 10 year Treasury yield down to a
six month low overnight  with the greenback s drop gaining steam
on a flurry of stop loss selling  	
   I think people are cautious about silver after seeing what
happened yesterday  There s only a slight amount of physical
buying  It s a holiday in the U S  next week  so people may
square off positions tonight   said a dealer in Hong Kong 	
  But I think sentiment is still bullish for gold because of
the problems in Greece  	
 
 PLATINUM  PALLADIUM TRACK GOLD HIGHER  	
 Gains in gold lifted platinum around 1 percent to a
high of  1 784 an ounce  but activity in the physical market has
yet to pick up in Japan after the devastating earthquake 
tsunami and nuclear disaster in March 	
 Platinum bars were offered at a discount of  1 5 to the spot
London prices  unchanged from last month  Platinum and palladium
 are mainly used in catalytic converters to cut
climate warming vehicle emissions 	
 Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co saw
their global production slump to around half of year ago levels
in April after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami wreaked havoc
with their supply chains   ID nL3E7GR0GL

 TOKYO  May 27  Reuters    The Nikkei average pared losses to
stand almost flat on Friday  after bank shares gained on a
report that capital requirements for European banks may be
relaxed 	
 The Financial Times reported that banks in the European
Union could avoid part of the tighter Basel III capital
requirements under draft legislation implementing the new
globally agreed standards across the 27 member bloc 
 ID nLDE74Q00T 	
 The report boosted Japanese bank shares  with Mitsubishi UFJ

Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group gaining 1 3 percent to

  Bank shares may recover to the levels before Edano startled
the market two weeks ago   said a trader at a European
brokerage 	
 Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said on May 13 he
expected financial institutions to be asked to cooperate with
helping troubled nuclear operator Tepco fund compensation 	
 The Nikkei was down 0 2 percent at 9 543 74  having
recovered from an early fall to 9 493 44  The broader Topix

 NEW YORK  June 3  Reuters    U S  stock index futures fell
on Friday  with many investors expecting the May payrolls
report to show more weakness in the economy  confirming recent
data signaling the economic recovery is faltering 
 U S  employment gains probably lost steam in May as high
energy prices and the supply chain effects of Japan s
earthquake and tsunami bogged down the economy 
 Nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 150 000 last month 
according to a Reuters survey of economists after advancing by
an 11 month high of 244 000 jobs in April  For details  see
 ID nN02277124 
  Ever since Japan  there has been a flight to safety and
we ve really been topping in here  which tells me we may have
an issue here because it would appear the events of Japan have
had ripples through the rest of the world s economy  which is
exactly what you would have expected   said Paul Mendelsohn 
chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in
Charlotte  Vermont 
  So it is possible that we are going to have a bad number
this morning  which I don t think the market is going to take
well  If the number comes in better than expected  OK  that is
good  but it may just give us a temporary reprieve  
 Recent economic data such as regional manufacturing data
has pointed to a slowing economy  although some analysts
believe the data indicates the recovery has hit a soft patch 
 After closing at its highest level since June 2008 on April
29  the S P 500 has dropped 3 7 percent 
 Other data set for release include May s U S  ISM
non manufacturing index at 10 a m  EDT  1400 GMT   which is
likely to provide further evidence on the pace of recovery in
the world s largest economy  Economists looked for a reading of
54 versus the prior month s 52 8 
 S P 500 futures  fell 3 2 points and were below fair
value  a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates  dividends and time to expiration on the
contract  Dow Jones industrial average futures  dipped 27
points  and Nasdaq 100 futures  lost 7 25 points 
 Newell Rubbermaid Inc  tumbled 6 percent to  15 95

earnings and sales forecast for the year  and said
second quarter results will fall short of estimates

   Buying back of utilities helps trim losses fund manager

 By Antoni Slodkowski and Ayai Tomisawa	
 TOKYO  May 23  Reuters    The Nikkei average fell to a
five week low on Monday after hedge funds unwound positions in
construction machinery makers  spurred by Nomura Securities 
downgrades on sagging China demand  and as a flare up in
euro zone debt worries hurt overall sentiment for risk assets 	
 Hitachi Construction was cut to  reduce  from
 neutral  and slumped 6 1 percent to 1 674 yen and Kawasaki
Heavy   which makes hydraulic equipment  to  neutral 
from  buy   sending the stock down 5 2 percent to 290 yen 	
 These falls triggered heavy selling in other stocks with
high exposure to China such as Komatsu Ltd which slid 6
percent to 2 379 yen and was the heaviest traded stock on the
main board by turnover after Nomura cut its target price by 11
percent  	
  Hedge funds are rushing to take profits on Komatsu and
other construction machinery makers as their outlook on the
Chinese economy and other emerging markets is getting bleaker
due to continuous rate hikes   said Norihiro Fujito  a senior
investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities 	
 Fujito pointed to losses sustained on Friday on similar
worries by Komatsu s biggest rival  Caterpillar Inc   
which shed 0 9 percent and dragged down Wall Street s industrial
sector  and a slump in the stock with the heaviest weighting in
the Nikkei  robot maker Fanuc Ltd   which fell 3 8
percent to 12 330 yen 	
 By midafternoon  the benchmark Nikkei was down 1 6
percent at 9 457 83  having broken recent support around 9 500 	
 The broader Topix shed 1 2 percent to 818 14 	
 Traders said the Nikkei s next immediate support looms at
9 405 19  an intraday low marked on April 19 	
 But Fujito said this may be just the start of a bigger
correction in Japanese equities  citing monetary tightening in
fast growing markets  weak signals from the U S  economy 
expiration of the Federal Reserve s  600 billion bond purchase
programme next month  and domestic political hurdles in handling
reconstruction after Japan s March 11 earthquake 	
  I see the Nikkei sliding much lower and we may even see it
dipping below the 9 000 line towards the end of June   Fujito
said 	
 Tokyo stocks have been hemmed into a range between 9 500 and
9 800  suggesting a lack of direction and keeping the market
vulnerable to events such as the downgrade of Greece by ratings
agency Fitch at the weekend  which prompted investors to move to
safer assets 	
 The euro fell broadly  hurt by ongoing worries about the
potential for debt restructuring by Greece  with market
positioning pointing to chances of a further drop 
 ID nL3E7GM0ED 	
 
 SOLAR STOCKS BUCK THE TREND	
 But solar power equipment makers bucked the trend on a
report by the Nikkei business daily that the Japanese government
may this week announce a plan to make solar panels compulsory on
the roofs of all new buildings by 2030 	
 Among solar panel stocks  Sharp Corp rose 1 percent
to 733 yen  panel equipment maker Ulvac gained 2
percent to 1 932 yen  and Ishii Hyoki   a maker of
silicon wafers for solar cells  surged 7 1 percent to 917 yen 	
  Some of the solar stocks have not fallen since the March
earthquake on hopes that renewable energy will be promoted after
the country was hit the nuclear crisis   said Yumi Nishimura  a
senior market analyst at Daiwa Securities  	
  These stocks may continue to attract buying  	
 While the Nikkei has tumbled about 9 percent since the
quake  Ishii Hyoki has risen about 10 percent  while Ulvac has
only shed 0 5 percent 	
 Also helping trim losses was a rebound in utilities  which
will be called on to contribute to a fund to compensate those
affected by the radiation crisis at Tokyo Electric Power Co s
 stricken Fukushima nuclear plant  and have been further
battered by concerns that power generation and distribution
could be split in a rethink of the nation s energy policy 	
  Utilities just got very cheap  Some of them will still be
able to pay decent dividends  They may trim them a little bit 
but they have just been a bit oversold  so bargain hunters and
value players are targeting them right now   said Fujio Ando 
senior managing director at Chibagin Asset Management 	
 Tohoku Electric Power gained 0 9 percent to 942 yen
and Chubu Electric rose 0 8 percent to 1 232 yen      	
 Sony Financial Holdings   the holding company for
Sony s insurance and banking operations  fell 4 4
percent to 1 364 yen after the company said it expects net
profit to fall 30 percent to 29 billion yen in the year ending
March 2012  due to the absence of bond trading gains booked in
the previous year 	
 The forecast was below Thomson Reuters Starmine s
SmartEstimate of 43 billion yen

 The energy sector was one of the weakest on Monday  when

  The move today is as much of a reaction to yesterday as
anything else   said Peter Tuz  president of Chase Investment
Counsel in Charlottesville  Virginia   It s especially helpful
to have energy higher today  since that was one of the worst

 NEW YORK LONDON  May 24  Reuters    Financial markets
steadied on Tuesday after being battered a day earlier by euro
zone debt concerns  as corporate reports and rising commodity
prices suggested global growth was on track 
 Analysts said the longer term outlook for equities was
positive  with global growth weathering the euro zone crisis 
  The global economy is still doing well  Companies are very
healthy and have a lot of cash in their balance sheets  As long
as they continue to deliver profits  that s going to be helpful
for the market   said Philippe Gijsels  head of research at BNP
Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels 
 Gijsels recommended investors should pare back holdings
somewhat  and raise cash  however 
 Wall Street opened higher after its main indexes lost more
than 1 percent on Monday 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  climbed 25 81
points  or 0 21 percent  to 12 407 07  The Standard   Poor s
500 Index  increased 3 94 points  or 0 30 percent  to
1 321 31 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  rose 4 52
points  or 0 16 percent  to 2 763 42 
 European shares    still in the red for the year    edged
higher and the euro sat above two month lows versus the dollar 
both boosted somewhat by better than expected German business
sentiment  The FTEurofirst 300  rose 0 4 percent 
 U S  crude and Brent futures rose nearly 2 percent after
Goldman Sachs raised its forecast for oil  citing strong fuel
demand growth  U S  light sweet crude oil  rose  1 58 to
 99 28 per barrel  For more details  see  nL3E7GO0EV 
 Copper also rallied  gaining 1 4 percent after Goldman
forecast an increase in Chinese purchases in the coming months 
Gold prices rose 0 4 percent while the U S  dollar index 
fell 0 2 percent 
  Investors are realizing that at the end of the day 
there s more demand for commodities than there is supply  That
means the long term trend is higher   said Oliver Pursche 
president at Gary Goldberg Financial Services in Suffern  New
York   When there s a short term selloff  we would take it as
an entry point  
 U S  listed shares of Sony Corp  6758 T   rose more
than 4 percent to  27 67 after the electronics maker said this
year s operating profit would match last year s  easing worries
about the impact of the March earthquake  Those concerns have
contributed to recent weakness in the stock   nL3E7GO018 
 World stocks as measured by MSCI  gained 0 5
percent  but only after hitting two month lows during Monday s
sell off on concern that a Greek debt default could drag a new
range of countries    including Group of Eight member Italy   
into similar troubles 
 Monday s selloff was triggered by another credit downgrade
of Greece  a ratings outlook warning about Italy and a Spanish
voter revolt against austerity   ID nLDE74M0V7 
 Debt rating company Moody s Investors Service underlined
the issue again on Tuesday  saying that a Greek debt default
would put Portugal and Ireland at risk of multi notch credit
downgrades   ID nLDE74N0AQ 
  A Greek default would be highly destabilising and would
have implications for the creditworthiness of issuers across
Europe   Moody s EMEA chief credit officer Alastair Wilson told
Reuters 
 Euro zone governments and central bankers are at
loggerheads over what is needed to stave off default or
restructuring in Greece  primarily over the unwelcome precedent
it would set for the currency bloc and its other highly
indebted countries 
 The euro hovered above its two month low against the
dollar  with its rise capped by the contagion worries  It was
up 0 3 percent on the day at  1 4097   Against the
Japanese yen  the dollar  rose 0 20 percent to 82 09
  The amount of euro selling in the past few days has been
huge  So I suspect a lot of euro long positions have been
cleared  Some may probably be caught in short positions   said
a trader at a U S  bank 
 German government bonds fell as investors cashed in on the
previous day s rally of core euro zone debt and digested Ifo
business sentiment data suggesting Europe s top economy might
retain its strong growth momentum longer than thought 
 U S  Treasury debt prices also declined ahead of an auction
of new notes and as firmer stocks drew demand away from
safe haven assets  Benchmark 10 year note yields rose 0 02
percentage point to 3 15 percent

 TOKYO  May 2  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei stock average on
Monday closed above the closely watched 10 000 mark for the
first time since the March 11 earthquake on optimism that Wall
Street shares would rally after U S  officials said al Qaeda
leader Osama bin Laden had been killed    	
 Sentiment was also bolstered by better than expected
earnings from construction machinery maker Caterpillar  
with rival Komatsu Ltd making strong gains while Sony
Corp advanced after it said some PlayStation network
services would resume following the theft of personal details on
78 million user accounts   	
 But investors were nervous about building large positions
ahead of with Japan s  Golden Week  holiday from Tuesday to
Thursday and ahead of more corporate earning results and U S 
economic data  including closely watched jobs data on Friday 	
 The market jumped above 10 000 on the bin Laden news 
Overseas shares could rise further on this news  but we didn t
want to take large positions ahead of more holidays here   said
Nagayasu Yamagishi  a stategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities 	
  We cleared 10 000 but we need to see more Japanese
corporate results before deciding whether to push the Nikkei
higher as many companies were unable to provide their
estimates   he said

   Telcos and cable firms seek off site storage services
   M A activity could shift to Europe
   Valuations boosted by recent deals

 By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Nadia Damouni	
 BANGALORE NEW YORK  May 3  Reuters    Surging Internet
traffic  growing demand from business and an explosion in the
number of mobile devices have ramped up demand for online
storage  triggering a race among telecoms firms and equipment
makers to acquire web hosting companies 	
 These managed hosting services providers usually own or
lease space on a server for use by their clients  typically in a
data center    large warehouses lined wall to wall with powerful
computer storage servers   	
 Bankers and analysts cite Equinix   Internap
   Rackspace   InterXion Holding NV and
private firms SoftLayer Technologies Inc and Joyent as potential
targets for bigger technology companies looking to cash in on
growing demand for so called cloud services 	
 Further consolidation is likely in the wake of Verizon
Communications Inc s  1 4 billion bid for Terremark
 ID nN27272578  and phone company CenturyLink Inc s more
recent  2 5 billion acquisition of Savvis  
 ID nL3E7FR29S 	
 
 
 
  Telecom and cable companies are at a point where they need
to join the cloud game  or be left behind  Some are trying to
catch up through acquisitions   Rackspace Chief Technology
Officer John Engates said in an e mailed response to a Reuters
inquiry 	
 Data center services are much in demand  driven by scorching
growth in telecoms and cloud computing    an increasingly
popular technology that allows remote access to computing power
and data over the Internet 	
 Acquisitions are an easy way for telecom companies
to load up on data centers and co location    off site data
storage services 	
  It s reasonable to suggest that whether it s a systems
integrator or a large distributor  they will look at the likes
of a Rackspace and some others out there   said a senior
industry banker  who has worked on similar deals but asked not
to be named 	
 
 VALUATIONS BOOST	
 Recent deals valuing target companies at 10 14 times
forecast EBITDA    earnings before interest  tax  depreciation
and amortization    have boosted valuations  and analysts reckon
companies may see this as a good time to put themselves in the
shop window 	
 Not Rackspace  however 	
  Rackspace is committed to remaining independent  We are not
interested in being acquired   Engates said 	
 While Rackspace may see its independence as a way to forge
service leadership in the cloud  Benchmark Co analyst Clayton
Moran said the company may be missing a trick 	
  There is a risk in any action or inaction   said Moran 
 There s definitely a risk that business trends could slow and
valuations could recede  and therefore Rackspace would have
missed an opportunity  	
 Concerns have grown over the reliability of cloud services
after recent disruptions at Amazon com Inc servers took
down many social networking web sites and hackers stole personal
details of millions of users of Sony Corp s video game
online network   ID nN21283190   ID nL3E7FR05U 	
  Benchmark s Moran noted Internap as the closest publicly
listed company comparable to Savvis  though much smaller  and
said it could be a takeover candidate as telecom companies look
to broaden their services for businesses and enhance growth 	
  We view AT T Inc   CenturyLink and other telecoms and
cable companies as potential consolidators  with Internap as an
easily digested target   he said  Internap provides co location 
managed hosting and some telecom IP services 	
  Given AT T s two largest wireline competitors have done
something  I m sure they re still entertaining how to address
the space   said the industry banker 	
 Internap CEO Eric Cooney declined to comment on any
approaches it may have had  but noted the recent spate of deals
highlights a trend of businesses seeking to outsource their IT
infrastructure services  	
 He said that trend is likely to accelerate 	
 
 EUROPE IN FOCUS 	
 With fewer U S  public companies still up for grabs  the
banker flagged Dutch data center company InterXion as a likely
target  adding he was surprised there had not been more
consolidation in Europe 	
 The last sizeable deal involving a European company was in
2007  when Equinix bought data center operator IXEurope for  482
million 	
 Telecom providers like AT T and Verizon and equipment makers
like Dell Inc   Hewlett Packard and IBM 
are typical buyers  with scale and clout  in the sector 	
  We see a growing fit between the sale of data center
services and traditional telecommunications services   said
Evercore Partners analyst Jonathan Schildkraut   This is even
more pronounced as it applies to providers of managed hosting
and or cloud based services  	
 Second ranked U S  cable television provider Time Warner
Cable s  230 million acquisition of Navisite Inc
 in February highlighted multiple system operators as
potential buyers  too  as cable companies target small  and
mid sized businesses   ID nSGE7110CR  	
 On a smaller scale  there are plenty of competitive U S 
local exchange carriers which could try to move into this
market  said Evercore s Schildkraut  mentioning TW Telecom Inc
   Paetec Holding Corp and EarthLink Inc
 as likely buyers 	
  There s a really natural fit  particularly in the small and
medium business space  to match up a managed hosting  cloud
hosting platform with the sale of Internet access and the
management of e mail boxes  etc   he said

   Smartphone panel shipments to surge
   Q1 net loss T 13 9 bln vs median f cast T 5 77 billion
loss
   Second consecutive quarterly loss

 By Clare Jim	
 TAIPEI  April 27  Reuters    Taiwan s AU Optronics Corp
   the world s No 4 LCD maker  posted a loss in the
first quarter that far exceeded expectations  blaming weak TV
panel prices and a strong Taiwan dollar  but the company offered
a brighter outlook 	
 AU  which supplies major brands such as Hewlett Packard Co
   Dell Inc and Sony Corp   lost T 13 9
billion   481 million  for January March  its second consecutive
quarterly loss after a net loss of T 11 34 billion in the
previous quarter 	
 AU was expected to report a net loss of T 5 77 billion 
according to a consensus forecast of 13 analysts polled by
Thomson Reuters I B E S  In the same period a year earlier AU
had reported a profit of T 7 1 billion 	
  AU s potential growth is limited  but it couldn t get any
worse  We don t see any big changes in terms of fundamentals and
stock price performance in the next one to two months   said J 
J  Lee  chief investment officer at Fubon Financial s fund unit 	
  We expect AU to continue to post losses in the second
quarter  though the loss would not be as big as the one in the
first      	
 The mutual funds at Lee s firm underweight AU shares  	
 The global liquid crystal display  LCD  market is battling
tepid demand since flat screen TVs are already widespread in
developed markets  Some analysts have said the  100 billion LCD
TV industry had peaked last year and would shrink by 3 4 percent
annually 	
 LCDs are also expected to give way to new displays such as
energy efficient active matrix organic light emitting diode
 AMOLED   which is increasingly used in high end smartphones and
tablets and has been touted as a future large sized TV display 	
 Samsung Electronics   the world s top maker of
LCD panels  also said its operating profit during the first
quarter fell to its lowest level in almost two years because of 
tumbling flat screen and TV prices   ID nL3E7F602O 	
 LG Display   the world s No 2 flat screen maker 
posted a worse than expected second consecutive first quarter
loss   ID nL3E7FE02P  But the company said it has started to see
signs of recovery in depressed TV panel prices and forecast a
return to profitability in the current quarter 	
 Hurt by the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan last
month  panel makers  led by Sharp Corp   are reducing
production  but demand from television and computer makers is
too weak to absorb even lowered supplies  sending prices of
large sized LCD panels down more than one third over the past
year 	
  The first quarter is always a low season  LCD prices should
have bottomed in the last quarter and started improving in Q2 
AU should be able to narrow its loss in the second quarter  
said HFT Investment Management analyst Allen Pu     	
 AU said it sees better times ahead  with TV panel prices
starting to bottom out in the second quarter and its capacity
utilisation rate improving 	
 It sees second quarter TV panel shipments up about 10
percent from the first quarter  though average selling prices
will be flat  while IT panel shipments will rise by single digit
percentage points    	
 Smartphone panel shipments are set to rise 60 percent this
year  reflecting booming demand for the devices  while the
company sees strong growth in LED shipments this year 	
 It said it saw only a limited impact from Japan s earthquake
and tsunami  which has disrupted the supply of hi tech
components  though its polysilicon plant in Japan lost some
T 400 500 mln in the quarter due to the disaster 	
 AU shares have fallen about 3 percent this month  versus a
rise of more than 2 percent in the boarder market   They
closed down 0 2 percent at T 24 85 on Wednesday ahead of the
results in a broader market that was up 1 1 percent

113629,335144,SNE,Sony may face global legal scrutiny over breach,news,"  U S  lawyers focused on data breaches eye legal action
   British government watchdog launches investigation
   U S  state attorneys general also discussing incident
 By Tom Hals and Leigh Jones
 WILMINGTON  Del  NEW YORK  April 27  Reuters    Sony Corp
could face legal action across the globe after it belatedly
revealed one of the biggest online data breaches ever 
 One U S  class action lawyer said he was considering filing
a lawsuit on behalf of consumers as soon as this week  after
hackers accessed personal details on 77 million users of the
company s online PlayStation Network gaming service 
 Also  a government watchdog in Britain said it had already
launched an investigation of the incident  which put credit
card information at risk 
 In the United States  the Iowa and Connecticut attorneys
general  who act as consumer advocates for their states  were
discussing the matter with their staff  according to their
offices 
  This is a huge data breach and the clients who have called
are really upset  not just because of the data breach but it
looks like Sony sat on information for as much as five days  
said Jay Edelson  an attorney at law firm Edelson McGuire 
 Edelson s firm specializes in class action lawsuits over
data breaches  He said he would decide in the next 24 hours
whether to sue 
 Sony did not immediately return a call on Wednesday seeking
a comment 
 Sony said on Tuesday that hackers stole names  addresses
and possibly credit card details from users of its PlayStation
Network  For details  see
 While the Japanese electronics company pulled the plug on
the network on April 19  it did not tell the public about the
hackers  attack until Tuesday 
 The disclosure sparked immediate outrage among gamers and
revived criticisms of Japan s corporate culture that plagued
Toyota Motor during its huge automotive recall in 2010 
  Waiting five days and giving misinformation  which we
believe they did  is really going to be problematic for Sony  
Edelson said 
 That could prove to be critical because Sony s customers
were not given the chance to protect themselves  putting the
company on the hook if stolen credit card data was used by the
hackers  he said 
 A Sony spokesman has said that after learning of the breach
it took  several days of forensic investigation  before the
company knew consumers  data had been compromised 
 Sony reported the breach to the FBI s cybercrimes unit in
San Diego  which is investigating  a person familiar with the
probe told Reuters  The person was not authorized to discuss
the matter publicly 
 Britain s Information Commissioner s Office said it had
contacted the company and was investigating whether Sony
violated laws that require it to safeguard personal
information 
 The commissioner s investigation would depend in part on
whether Sony stored user information in Britain 
 Sony may come under the toughest scrutiny from non U S 
regulators  which have stricter consumer privacy laws 
  European countries are going to go crazy and be all over
this   said Dan Burk  a professor at the University of
California  Irvine School of Law   They are absolutely obsessed
about companies holding personal information  
 Burk said subscribers will need to show they suffered
damages as a result of the hacking for a U S  lawsuit to have
legs 
  If it was just hacking for fun  then it s going to be
tough   he said of the prospects for a potential U S  lawsuit 
 However  users would not have to show damage in other
countries  and Burk said Sony could face fines and penalties
from privacy commissions outside the United States 
 The U S  Federal Trade Commission has been known to pursue
companies that failed to safeguard consumer data  It could
investigate if it determines Sony failed to tell its customers
about the company s privacy policies 
 A spokeswoman for the agency declined to comment

113630,335145,SNE,UPDATE 2 Sony shares fall 5 pct as Playstation woes threaten outlook,news,"  Sony may face legal action due to Internet security breach
   Analyst estimates losses to top  1 5 bln
   Gamers threaten to leave Playstation network
   Stock falls 5 pct  biggest drop since mid March

  Adds details  background 	
 By Nathan Layne	
 TOKYO  April 28  Reuters    Shares in Sony Corp 
fell 5 percent on Thursday as a massive leak of data on its
Playstation games console users sparked global legal scrutiny
and threatened to crimp its business 	
 In the United States  several members of Congress seized on
the breach  in which hackers stole names  addresses and possibly
credit card details from users of Sony s PlayStation Network  in
one of the largest Internet security break ins
ever  ID nN27173425 	
 There is concern that loyal PlayStation gamers could ditch
Sony in the wake of the data theft and analysts said the hacking
could steer people looking to buy a video game console toward
Microsoft Corp s Xbox  which has its own popular online
network   ID nN27212451 	
  I am outraged that my personal information may have been
accessed by hackers   said Rich Chiang  a Playstation and Xbox
user based in Shanghai 	
  It is shocking that Sony has been so aggressive in going
after people who have hacked their products and services  yet
was this unprepared for the consequences of angering that
community   said Chiang  an executive with a Chinese gaming
firm 	
  It is also disturbing that Sony took a full week after the
breach to fully announce the details of the incident  	
 Sony s PlayStation Network  a service that produces an
estimated  500 million in annual revenues  provides access to
online games  movies and TV show 	
 By 0320 GMT  Sony shares were down 4 8 percent in a broader
market up 1 3 percent  The shares fell the most since
mid March 	
 Security experts said Sony needs to account for the loss of
that business    as well as damage to its brand    when it
tallies up the cost of dealing with the breach  Other costs
include notifying customers of the attack and bringing in
experts to cleanse its network 	
 Larry Ponemon  chairman and founder of the Ponemon Institute
said the theft could cost Sony more than  1 5 billion  or an
average of  20 for each of the 77 million customers whose data
was potentially compromised  Poneman s firm specializes in
securing information on computer networks 	
 Sony pulled the plug on the network on April 19 after
finding out about the breach  but it did not tell the public
about the hackers  attack until a week later 	
 The delay  which Sony said was needed to conduct a forensic
investigation  may remind its overseas customers of the foot
dragging by Toyota that earned the Japan s leading automaker the
distain of consumers  	
 Sony shares have fallen more than 8 percent this week  with
investors  nervous about the fall out of the data leak episode

   To cut workforce by 35 000 over 3 yrs to March 2013
   May close up to 70 manufacturing bases   president
   Panasonic shares up 2 4 pct  outperform on job cut plans

  Adds comment from company president  number of plants 	
 By Isabel Reynolds and Reiji Murai	
 TOKYO  April 28  Reuters    Japanese consumer electronics
giant Panasonic Corp said it would cut another 17 000
jobs and close up to 70 factories around the world over the next
two years in a bid to pare costs and keep up with Asian rivals 	
 The maker of Viera TVs and Lumix cameras said it was aiming
to trim its workforce of 367 000 at the end of last month to
350 000 by March 2013  The cull comes on top of nearly 18 000
job cuts made in the past business year  for a total of around
35 000 over three years 	
  The figure is huge  but so is the company  and for an
old fashioned one like Panasonic  this is a big move   said Toru
 Hashizume  chief investment officer at Stats Investment  
Management in Tokyo   	
 Panasonic set aside 110 billion yen   1 3 billion  in
restructuring expenses for the current financial year  	
 Company President Fumio Ohtsubo said Panasonic had about 350
manufacturing bases around the world and would look to merge
operations where it could 	
  I can t say for sure  but I think it s possible we will cut
the number of manufacturing bases by 10 or 20 percent   he said 
declining to comment on which countries might see job cuts     
A Panasonic spokesman said the company did not even have a
figure for the number of countries they operate in since
recently taking over some other companies 	
 Once unrivalled  Japan s consumer electronic firms are
facing increasing competition from cheaper Korean and Chinese
producers in particular 	
 Panasonic is seeking to shift its focus to environmental and
energy related businesses such as rechargeable batteries in
order to duck competition from Samsung Electronics  
LG Electronics and others in consumer technology 	
 As part of that strategy  it announced last year it would
pay  9 4 billion to make Panasonic Electric Works and Sanyo
Electric Co wholly owned units   ID nSGE66S08Q  	
 Panasonic absorbed a combined 160 000 workers in that move
and was now seeking to shed staff in overlapping businesses 
particularly abroad  said the Nikkei newspaper  which first
reported the job cuts  	
 The units make a wide range of products including
rechargeable batteries  factory robots  electronic components 
lighting and solar panels 	
 
 QUAKE HITS PROFITS	
 Panasonic started off making electrical sockets in 1917 and
now comprises almost 700 companies spread around the globe  It
employs more than 220 000 people outside of Japan 	
 Shares of the electronics conglomerate closed up 2 4 percent
in Tokyo  outpacing a 1 6 percent gain in the benchmark Nikkei
225 index   	
 Unlike their western counterparts  Japanese companies tend
to avoid dumping large numbers of workers  particularly at home 	
 The latest staff cuts compare with past Panasonic
restructurings including 26 000 workers shed after the
information technology bubble burst  and about 15 000 in the
aftermath of the Lehman shock  Some of the latest job cuts
include headcount lost through the sale of unprofitable units 	
 On top of the stiff competition and a strong yen  which saps
export earnings  Japanese electronics companies have had to deal
with the impact of last month s devastating earthquake and
tsunami  which has hit earnings hard 	
 Panasonic said its operating profit for the fourth quarter
ended March fell by almost a third to 41 billion yen  	
 It did not give a forecast for the current year because of
uncertainties following the quake 	
 Operating profit was 305 3 billion yen   3 7 billion  for
the year just ended  slightly better than a consensus of 297
billion yen  based on Thomson Reuters SmartEstimate  which
places greater weight on recent estimates by highly rated
analysts 	
 The SmartEstimate for the current year to March 2012 is for
a profit fall to 260 billion yen as the company struggles with
production woes and weak domestic demand following the
earthquake  	
 Panasonic said without the impact of the quake  its forecast
for this year would have been for an operating profit of 310
billion yen 	
   1   82 220 Japanese Yen

 SEOUL  April 29  Reuters    Samsung Electronics 
faces a challenging outlook after reporting its third
consecutive fall in quarterly profit as it stuggles to make
ground on Apple Inc and deal with a tepid recovery in
its TV and flat screens business 	
 The world s No 2 handset maker  however  said its mainstay
memory chip business was rebounding after Japan s devastating
earthquake and tsunami in March hobbled production from rivals
including Toshiba Corp  	
  Although the memory chip business is reviving  other
operations such as telecommunications and displays are facing
tough times ahead   said Han Se woong  a fund manager at
AssetPlus Investment Management  which owns Samsung shares 	
  Its race with Apple seems pretty difficult and income in
its display division is in a slump  	
 Samsung s Galaxy model smartphones and tablet computers were
seen among the biggest potential rivals to Apple s iPhone and
iPad but it has been unable to match the U S  company s roaring
sales growth 	
 Sony plans to soon join the fray with the launch of
its first tablets in a market set to quadruple in four years 	
 Samsung is also the world s largest top maker of memory
chips  flat screens and televisions  Shares in the company 
whose  136 billion market value is bigger than Sony  
Nokia   Toshiba Corp and Panasonic Corp
 combined  ended 0 8 percent lower in a broader market
 down 0 7 percent 	
 After hitting life time highs in late January  Samsung
shares have lost 12 percent  as analysts lower expectations for
its telecoms division  which includes smartphones and tablets 	
 
 
 Samsung reported a 2 95 trillion won   2 75 billion 
operating profit for January March compared to the consensus
forecast for a 3 1 trillion won profit by Thomson Reuters
I B E S  That was in line with Samsung s estimate for an
operating profit of between 2 7 trillion won and 3 1 trillion
won   ID nL3E7F602O 	
 
 SMARTPHONES	
 Samsung  which had negligible share of the smartphone market
until early last year  has muscled in with its Galaxy models  It
has since sold 14 million Galaxy S smartphones and launched the
Galaxy Tab tablet in three different sizes 	
 This week  it rolled out a new version of its flagship
Galaxy S smartphone in Korea and expects the model to sell more
than 10 million units as the product makes a global debut from
May through 140 carriers in 120 countries 	
 SK Telecom   South Korea s top mobile carrier 
said on Friday it had received 160 000 preorders for the new
Galaxy smartphone since it started taking orders on Monday and
expects 60 000 customers will get the phone on Friday and
Saturday when it launches service 	
 Apple is seeking to keep Samsung at bay with
lawsuits claiming Samsung s Galaxy line of phones and tablets
 slavishly  copy the iPhone and iPad 	
 Samsung has countersued and on Wednesday  it broadened a
patent dispute against Apple by filing a lawsuit in federal
court in California arguing that Apple s iPhone  iPod and iPad
had infringed 10 mobile technology patents  Samsung made similar
claims in Korea  Japan and Germany last week 	
 Samsung sold around 70 million handsets in the first quarter
including tablets  It did not give breakdowns and analysts
estimate it sold around 1 million tablets  Apple sold 4 7
million units of its iPad last quarter 	
 Soaring demand for tablets and smartphones is likely to fuel
further growth at its semiconductor business  as Samsung counts
Apple as its biggest client  Prices of computer memory chips
have rebounded since last month s earthquake in Japan 	
  I expect Samsung s operating profit to strongly rebound in
the second quarter    Chip profits will be pretty good in the
second quarter because of the rise in average sales prices  
said  Kim Sung in  an analyst at Kiwoom Securities 	
 Samsung s profit is expected to rebound by a third to 4
trillion won in the current quarter  according to StarMine
SmartEstimates  which places more weight on recent forecasts by
top rated analysts 	
 
 CHIPS  TELECOMS GROW	
 Samsung said the chip market would improve slightly in the
current quarter and demand for NAND flash chips would also
sustain growth momentum thanks to solid smartphone and tablet
markets   	
 The first quarter operating  profit  the lowest
since the second quarter of 2009  compared with a 3 0 trillion
won profit in the preceding quarter and 4 4 trillion won a year
earlier 	
 Semiconductor and telecoms were the main profit pillars in
the first quarter  Operating profit from semiconductors
accounted for 56 percent of the group s total profit and the
rest came from the telecoms division 	
 Its television and appliances unit reported an 80 percent
drop in profit to almost breakeven  while the flat screen
division swung to a 230 billion won loss from a 490 billion won
profit a year ago 	
 Sales of flat panel TVs edged up 5 percent from a
year ago but tumbled 31 percent from the previous quarter to 8 8
million units 	
 From Sony to Dutch electronics group Philips   TV
makers are struggling with fierce competition from cheaper
brands and fragile consumer spending   ID nLDE72R03L

 OSAKA  Japan  April 25  Reuters    Nintendo Co Ltd 
said it would launch a successor to its ageing Wii game console
in 2012 as it struggles to win back users from rivals Microsoft
 and Sony and seeks to reverse a slump in
profits 	
 Nintendo said on Monday that it expects profits to remain
almost flat in the current financial year  despite the launch of
its much touted 3D capable handheld games device  whose sales in
Japan have been overshadowed by the devastating March 11
earthquake 	
 The maker of the DS handheld game player  which is also
facing competition from smartphone and tablet makers including
Apple Inc   said on Monday it will demonstrate the Wii s
replacement in Los Angeles on June 7 at the E3 game show 	
 Nintendo is looking to repeat past successes in the gaming
market  The Wii took the industry by storm five years ago by
offering family games such as tennis and bowling that appealed
to a broad audience rather than just  core  gamers 	
 This time around  however  Nintendo will find it harder to
sidestep its competitors and must also contend with a burgeoning
smartphone market that didn t exist in 2006  said Mitsushige
Akino  Chief Fund Manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management 	
  Core users and game lovers will certainly buy it  but I
think it will be hard to capture buyers outside of that group  
he said 	
 On Monday  the company revealed quarterly profit of just 12
billion yen  down from 59 9 billion yen a year earlier  as it
slashed prices and the strong yen hurt the value of its sales
abroad  Having sold 86 million units of the Wii since its launch
in 2006  sales last business year slipped by a quarter to 15
million 	
  We believe that the share price will come under pressure as
the market digests the weak Q4 results and company projection
for the year to March 2012   analyst Jay Defibaugh of MF Global
said in a research note 	
 Nintendo sees first half profit for the current
financial year down more than 63 percent on the previous year 
with a bounce back in the second half 	
 
 Nintendo declined to provide further details on the Wii
successor 	
  As for the details of exactly what it will be  we have
decided that it is best to let people experience it for
themselves at E3   Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata  told a news
conference 	
  So I won t talk about specific details today  but it will
offer a new way of playing games within the home   said Iwata  a
former game designer 	
 In another transition to new generation hardware  Nintendo
this year launched a glasses free 3D capable handheld games
device  the 3DS  to fend off growing competition from other
games companies  as well as makers of smartphones and tablets 	
 It must also contend with Microsoft and Sony which have
brought new products to the market since the Wii s debut 	
 In March  Microsoft said it had sold more than 10 million
Kinect motion sensing game system units worldwide in just over
four months  making it the fastest selling consumer device on
record  The infrared camera add on for the Xbox game console
tracks body gestures for video games  Sony s rival motion
sensing device is dubbed Move 	
 
 DECLINING SALES	
 In the business year just ended  Wii console sales fell to
15 1 million units from 20 1 million a year earlier  It expects

 By Miyoung Kim	
 SEOUL  April 27  Reuters    LG Electronics Inc 
posted its first profit in three quarters and the world s No 3
handset maker said it saw better earnings ahead as it halted
slipping margins in the competitive mobile phone market 	
 LG s phone division is expected to swing to a profit in the
current quarter  boosted by new products such as Optimus 2X and
Optimus Black in the high end segment 	
 It still faces an uphill battle against heavyweights such as
Apple Inc   which overtook Nokia last quarter
as the world s biggest handset maker by revenue on strong iPhone
shipments 	
  I expect LG s handset division to turn around in the second
quarter  as LG is expanding its smartphone line up to the
high end  improving product mix    said Soh Hyun cheol  an
analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp 	
  Along with the seasonality of home appliances such as air
conditioners  LG Electronics is expected to achieve more than
300 billion won in operating profit even from a conservative
point of view  	
 
 LG  also the world s No 2 TV maker  reported a January March
operating profit of 131 billion won   121 million   missing 
 consensus forecast of a 149 billion won profit by Thomson
Reuters I B E S 	
 Its profit fell to less than a third of the 481 billion won
posted a year ago as the South Korean firm was hit by weak
television sales and its handset business stayed in the red due
to a lack of new smartphones  However  it made an improvement
from a record 246 billion won loss in the previous quarter 	
 LG s beaten down shares rose 1 percent by 0541 GMT versus a
0 3 percent rise in the wider market 	
 Shares of the company  which trails Nokia and Samsung
Electronics in handsets and competes with Sony Corp
 and Panasonic Corp in flat screen TVs  have
fallen 10 percent so far this year  lagging the wider market
   which has risen 8 percent to life time highs 	
 
 SLOW RECOVERY IN PHONES  TVS	
 Operating losses from handset sales narrowed to 101 billion
won from a 262 billion won loss in the fourth quarter and its TV
division swung to a profit of 82 billion won from the
fourth quarter s 65 billion won loss 	
 LG is betting on its two premium models of Optimus Black and
Optimus 2X  which uses powerful dual core processor to improve
gaming and browsing speed  to help the firm pull out of the loss
but it is facing stiff competition 	
 Samsung unveils a new version of its flagship Galaxy S this
week and Apple is making record iPhone sales with 18 65 million
shipments in the last quarter 	
  They  LG  are still behind Samsung Electronics and Apple 
but compared to its previous smartphone lineups  latest premium
lineups appear to have more competitive edges   said S R  Kwon 
an analyst at Dongbu Securities 	
 LG  one of the world s leading home appliances makers  saw
profit from the division halved to 103 billion won  as a
stronger won and rising raw material costs more than offset a 13
percent rise in sales 	
 The division s profit margin more than halved to 3 8
percent  although it was still the most profitable among LG s
five major businesses

  Writes through  adds background and details 
 By Ray Colitt
 BEIJING  April 12  Reuters    iPhone maker Foxconn
Technology Group is considering investing  12 billion in Brazil
to assemble monitors  Brazil s president said on Tuesday  in a
sign the company may be ready to accelerate its move away from
its main China manufacturing base 
 The Brazilian government is studying Foxconn s investment
plan  President Dilma Rousseff told reporters during a visit to
Beijing  where she is meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao 
  You ve got an ample range of investments that go from  300
to  400 million to  12 billion over 5 to 6 years in the case of
Foxconn   Rousseff said  speaking of discussions Brazil s
government is having with various technology companies 
  They re proposing a partnership  They came to us and said
we want to invest in Brazil  
 A  12 billion investment would be the latest in a string of
moves by Foxconn to establish operations away from its main
manufacturing hub in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen 
where rising labour costs have forced many companies to set up
operations in cheaper parts of China 
 The company has traditionally manufactured most of Apple s
 products at its Shenzhen factories 
  We ve been talking to them for three months   said Aloizio
Mercadente  Brazil s science and technology minister  
 The Brazilian government and Foxconn are negotiating a range
of details  including the location of any new facilities 
financing  taxes  broadband infrastructure and logistics 
including roads  
  The negotiations are far from complete but I m confident  
said Mercadente 
 Calls to Foxconn s spokesman went unanswered  
 Separately  Mercadente also told reporters that Foxconn is
planning to begin assembling Apple s iPad tablet PC at its
plants in the South American country by end November 
 Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou has been ramping up the company s
capabilities in the LCD sector in recent years  setting up its
own flat panel display unit and buying Sony s LCD TV
manufacturing plant in Slovakia  The company s LCD unit is
Chimei Innolux 
 Foxconn  which counts Hon Hai and Foxconn International
Holdings as its subsidiaries  is a key supplier to top
technology brands such as Apple and Hewlett Packard  These
brands typically do their own research and design work in house
and outsource manufacturing to Foxconn and rivals such as
Flextronics 
 Besides Foxconn  other Taiwanese companies that operate
factories in Brazil include Compal  the world s No  2 contract
laptop PC maker 
 Foxconn s last major investment outside of Shenzhen was in
October  when it announced a  2 billion plant in Chengdu  in
China s Sichuan province  The company has roughly 1 million
workers in China  and is the country s largest private sector
employer

 By Blaise Robinson
 PARIS  April 14  Reuters    European stocks dipped early on
Thursday  as worries over Chinese inflation and doubts about the
earnings season kept investors on edge  but losses were limited
as a main index managed to stay above a key support level 
 Tech shares featured among the top losers  with Ericsson
 down 2 7 percent  on lingering concerns over the
impact from Japan s crisis on the sector s supply chain 
 Sony Corp  6758 T  said it is mulling a two week summer
shutdown of some company premises to save energy as Tokyo and
Japan s northern regions face the peak period with significantly
reduced power generation capacity following last month s
devastating quake   ID nL3E7FE08T 
 At 0833 GMT  the FTSEurofirst 300  index of top
European shares was down 0 2 percent at 1 132 88 points  It fell
to as low as 1 129 90  just above a key support level at
1 129 09 points  which represents the 50 percent retracement of
the index s drop from a February peak to a March low 
 Despite Thursday s retreat  investors  risk appetite was on
the rise  with the Euro STOXX 50 volatility index 
falling 2 5 percent 
 Hong Kong s Phoenix TV  citing an unnamed source  said
China s annual rate of inflation in March was likely to be
5 3 5 4 percent  a 32 month high   ID nL3E7FE0EO 
  Inflation in emerging economies has become a serious issue 
as the impact from high commodity prices is stronger for those
countries   said Arnaud Scarpaci  fund manager at Paris based
Agilis Gestion  which has 80 million euros under management 
 Resource related shares fell  with Rio Tinto  down
1 2 percent and BHP Billiton  down 1 5 percent as metal
prices retreated 
 Losses in the sector  however  were limited by news of
Glencore s plans to raise up to  12 1 billion in an initial
offering 
  The fact they are going ahead during this slight softness
means they are very confident that prices will remain quite

   Banks fall on euro zone peripheral debt worries
 By Joanne Frearson
 LONDON  April 14  Reuters    European shares fell on
Thursday on worries about higher global inflation as well as a
weakening U S  jobs market  while concerns about Greek debt hit
banking stocks 
 Investors were also positioned cautiously ahead of Google
 results  which are scheduled to be released after the markets
close  with traders suggesting this could impact technology and
media stocks 
 The pan European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares closed
down 0 6 percent at 1 128 84 points after paring  bigger losses 
Volume was 106 3 percent of its 90 day average 
 Investor sentiment was knocked after U S  claims for
unemployment benefits bounced back above the key 400 000 level 
while March U S  core producer prices data rose slightly faster
than expected 
  There is a little bit of a setback in the market  with the
U S  jobless claims and U S  PPI figures data  The key from here
is to stick with companies that have pricing power   Veronika
Pechlaner  a manager on the 100 million euro   144 million 
Ashburton European equity fund said 
 Banks featured among the worst performers on market concerns
that Greece would be forced to restructure its public debt  with
the cost of insuring against a Greek sovereign default also
rising to a record high 
 The STOXX Europe 600 Banks index fell 1 5 percent  while
Greek bank shares dropped 5 percent 
 Banca Popolare di Milano lost 2 7 percent on media reports
that the Bank of Italy has asked it to raise fresh capital above
what was previously expected 
  Peripheries still have to contend with lower unemployment
and a sluggish consumer  We do not really see upgrades coming
through for the peripheries   Pechlaner said 
 Stock markets in the peripheries fell  with Spain s IBEX 35
 down 1 5 percent  Portugal s PSI 20 losing 1 6 percent and
Italy s benchmark 1 2 percent lower 
 Earlier  the market traded lower after Hong Kong media
reported that China would post March inflation figures above
analysts expectations on Friday  raising fears of further
monetary tightening      Inflation in emerging economies has
become a serious issue  as the impact from high commodity prices
is stronger for those countries   said Arnaud Scarpaci  fund
manager at Paris based Agilis Gestion  which has 80 million
euros under management 
 
 TECH STOCKS PRESSURED
 Elsewhere  technology stocks were under pressure on
continued worries about Japan s March 11 earthquake and tsuanami
on supply chains after Sony Corp said it is mulling a  two week
summer shutdown to save energy 
 Ericsson  which has shut down factories  fell 3 2 percent 
while ASML continued its falls from the previous session  down
2 9 percent  when the Dutch chip equipment maker said it saw an
impact from Japan on customers 
 British consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser dropped 7 5
percent after its chief executive officer Bart Becht said he is
to retire 
 Across Europe  the FTSE 100 index was down 0 8 percent

 SAN FRANCISCO SEOUL  April 19  Reuters   Apple Inc sued Samsung
Electronics claiming the South Korean firm s Galaxy line of mobile
phones and tablets  slavishly  copies the iPhone and iPad  according to court
papers  a move analysts say is aimed at keeping its close rivals at bay 	
 Apple is one participant in a web of litigation among phone makers and
software firms over who owns the patents used in smartphones  as rivals
aggressively rush into the smartphone and tablet market which the U S  firm
jumpstarted with iPhone and iPad 	
 Nokia and Apple have sued each other in numerous courts and as
recently as last month Nokia filed a complaint with the U S  trade panel
alleging that Apple infringes its patents in iPhones  iPads and other products 
 ID nLDE72S0YX 	
 Samsung is one of the fastest growing smartphone makers and has
emerged as Apple s strongest competitor in the booming tablet market with models
in three sizes but it remains a distant second in the space 	
  If Apple fails to fend off Android  it will within a year or two find
itself in a situation like Research in Motion  even if at a higher level
 initially    said Florian Mueller  a technology specialist and blogger on
patent battles 	
  Apple has realised this already as its new lawsuit against Samsung shows 
but given what s at stake  I think Apple would have to do much more than this 
It would have to sue more Android device makers and over more patents  	
Samsung s Galaxy products use Google s Android operating system 
which directly competes with Apple s mobile software  However  Apple s claims
against Samsung focus on Galaxy s design features  such as the look of its
screen icons  the lawsuit said 	
 
The lawsuit  filed on Friday  alleges Samsung violated Apple s patents and
trademarks 	
 This kind of blatant copying is wrong   Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet
said in a statement 	
 Apple is bringing 16 claims against Samsung  including unjust
enrichment  trademark infringement and 10 patent claims 	
     Samsung has made its Galaxy phones and computer tablet work and look
like Apple s products through widespread patent and trade dress infringement   
By this action  Apple seeks to put a stop to Samsung s illegal conduct and
obtain compensation for the violations that have occurred thus far   Apple said
in the court document 	
 Samsung s shares closed up 0 9 percent after slipping to their lowest level
in one month in a broader market down 0 7 percent 	
 Samsung said it would respond to the legal action  through
appropriate legal measures to protect our intellectual property  	
  Samsung s development of core technologies and strengthening our
intellectual property portfolio are keys to our continued success   it said in a
statement 	
 Samsung faces the challenge of moving beyond being a hardware company 
clever at copying ideas  to becoming more creative  better adept at software  at
a time when consumer gadgets are getting smarter all the time  	
 It has yet to come up with the kind of original  iconic  market leading
products that powered brands such as Apple s i series or Sony Corp s 
Walkman  Nor has it taken the kind of initiatives in software that Google and
Apple did to thwart Microsoft  	
 
 FORMIDABLE RIVAL	
 Apple CEO Steve Jobs has criticised Samsung and other rivals in
presentations of new products or technology debates  Analysts say Samsung s
response to this has been muted  partly because Apple was Samsung s
second biggest customer last year after Sony 	
 Apple brought in around 6 2 trillion won   5 7 billion  of sales to Samsung
in 2010 mainly by purchasing semiconductors  according to Samsung s annual
report 	
 John Jackson  an analyst with CCS Insight  said Samsung is
essentially Apple s only real tablet competitor at this stage   It s clear that
they do not intend to let Apple run away with the category   Jackson said 	
  This is more like a symbolic move by Apple that it is quite serious about
rivals advancing and it is trying to hold back its close competitors   said John
Park  an analyst at Daishin Securities in Seoul     	
  Samsung is unlikely to respond aggressively given that Apple is its core
client in the component business   Park said 	
 To better compete with Apple  Samsung redesigned within weeks its new
10 1 inch tablet  first introduced in February  to make it the thinnest in the
category after Apple set the trend with its iPad 2 	
 The global smartphone market is expected to grow 58 percent this year and
Android is set account for 39 percent of the market  while the tablet market is
likely to quadruple to 70 million units  according to research firm Gartner 
 ID nLDE73A0MK 	
 Apple s iPad will still dominate  controlling more than half of
the tablet market for the next three years  but its share is seen gradually
declining to 47 percent in 2015 from 69 percent this year  giving way to Android
devices  ID nLDE73A0MK

revealed

  Adds details  background 	
 TOKYO  April 19  Reuters    Sony Corp has delayed a
decision on whether to raise its stake in Sharp Corp s 
state of the art Sakai TV panel factory  in a fresh blow to
Sharp  which has already halted production at the plant for at
least a month 	
 Sony will not raise its stake in the liquid crystal display
 LCD  production joint venture for at least a year  a Sony
source told Reuters  During that time  the two companies will
continue to discuss the possible investment  said the source 
who is involved in the negotiations 	
 The source spoke on condition of anonymity because the move
has not been made public 	
 Speculation has been swirling for months that Sony would
abandon the plan to raise its stake in Sharp s factory in favour
of boosting procurement from cheaper makers in other parts of
Asia 	
 The electronics giant  which competes with Samsung
 and LG Electronics in televisions  needs
to slash costs as it heads for a seventh straight year of losses
in its TV business 	
 Rivals are also struggling  with Philips of the Netherlands
 announcing on Monday it would hive off its own
loss making TV business   ID nLDE73H03T 	
 Sony had initially planned to invest up to 68 billion yen
  822 million  in Sharp s western Japan plant by the end of
April this year  raising its stake in the venture to 34 percent
from the current 7 percent 	
 Sharp has been forced to suspend operations at the 10th
generation LCD plant  the most advanced in the world  and
another TV panel factory for at least a month due to plunging
domestic demand and a shortage of a gas used in the production
process following the March 11 earthquake   ID nL3E7FB012 	
 In a sign of over supply in the market  rival panel maker LG
Display posted a second straight quarterly loss on
Monday  blaming tumbling LCD prices  but said it expected the
sector to recover later in the year   ID nS6E7F100D 	
 Sharp s TV sales are focused on the domestic market  where
demand is expected to slump this year  after many households
already replaced their sets in 2010  prompted by government
incentives and the switch to digital terrestrial TV in July
2011 	
 Sony spokeswoman Yuki Shima said that abandoning plans for
raising its stake to 34 percent from 7 percent was one option
being considered by the consumer electronics giant  but that
talks would continue until the end of the month before a
decision was made 	
 Sharp has forecast operating profit of 90 billion yen for
the year to March  compared with a mean estimate of 83 5 billion
yen in a poll of 22 analysts  eight of whom have revised their
estimates since the quake and tsunami that has left about 28 000
people dead or missing 	
 Sharp will announce its full year results on April 27  while
Sony has yet to set a date for its earnings announcement

Thursday
   Profit seen at 3 2 trln won  Starmine SmartEstimates
suggests 10 pct downside surprise
   Earnings to bottom out in Q1 with solid recovery in chips
   Expectations for tablets lowered after iPad 2 launch
   Shares down 9 pct from record highs in Jan vs KOSPI s 1

 By Miyoung Kim	
 SEOUL  April 7  Reuters    Samsung Electronics  
the world s top maker of memory chips and flat screens  is set
to report a third consecutive quarterly drop in earnings for
January March in its first update since the devastating
earthquake in Japan last month 	
 The South Korean firm is the first major global technology
firm to release quarterly earnings estimates after the
earthquake and tsunami in Japan on March 11 raised uncertainty
about the longer term effects of the disaster on a broad range
of manufacturers   ID nL3E7EE05V 	
 Tumbling prices of flat screens and weak demand for
televisions are seen hurting the company s first quarter
earnings  but it is likely to show a strong profit recovery from
the current quarter as memory chip prices rebound following the
quake in Japan 	
 Globally  Japan supplies more than one third of NAND type
flash memory chips  used in tablets and smartphones  and 14
percent of computer memory chips 	
 Disruptions to the global supply chain threaten to create
bottlenecks in some key components for Japanese factories and
analysts believe South Korean firms such as Samsung may benefit
as customers look for new suppliers  The company also looks set
to benefit from a recovery in the memory chip market 	
 For Samsung  which counts Sony Corp as its biggest
customer  raking in nearly 7 trillion won   6 4 billion  of
sales annually  a protracted suspension of flat screen TV
production in Japan results in lost revenue  but it also
benefits from a tightening supply of chips  for which it
competes with the likes of Japan s Toshiba Corp  	
 
 Samsung  Asia s most valuable technology firm with a market
value of around  142 billion  is likely to report 3 17 trillion
won in January March operating profit on revenue of 38 trillion
won  according to a consensus of 29 analysts surveyed by Thomson
Reuters I B E S 	
 But according to StarMine s SmartEstimates  which places
more weight on recent forecasts by top rated analysts  Samsung s
operating profit may come in at 2 9 trillion won  about 10
percent below the consensus 	
 That would be its lowest profit since the second quarter of
2009  and down 42 percent from a year ago and 4 percent from the
preceding quarter 	
 Earnings at Samsung  which controls nearly 40 percent of
global dynamic random access memory  DRAM  and NAND flash memory
market  will improve from the current quarter on stable panel
prices and a rebound in the battered memory chip market 
analysts said 	
 Contract prices of DRAM chips have risen 3 percent since the
quake and NAND chips have risen 15 percent 	
 Samsung  which is also the world s No 2 handset maker after
Nokia   is facing a tough trading outlook in its
telecoms division due to growing pricing pressure since Apple
 introduced the iPad 2 with an aggressive pricing plan
last month  Samsung s Galaxy S smartphone and Galaxy Tab tablet
compete with Apple s iPhone and wildly popular iPad  	
 Apple is estimated to have sold about 1 million units of its
iPad 2 in the first weekend of its U S  launch early last month 
By comparison  Samsung may have sold a similar number of Galaxy
Tabs in the past three months and sales growth will remain weak 
Follow up models will be on the market in June at the earliest 	
 Shares in Samsung have fallen 9 percent from a record high
in late January  lagging a 1 percent rise in the wider market
 during the period

as next year s elections approach 
 The government plans to sell its stake in 28 companies
through strategic partnerships or share issues to raise money to
finance a growing budget deficit projected at 152 6 billion
shillings   1 83 billion  in the 2011 2012 budget 
 
 Following are details of the firms to be privatised 
   KENYA ELECTRICITY GENERATING COMPANY  KenGen    Kenya s
biggest power producer with over 80 percent of output  The
government has said it will offload 19 percent after it sold a
30 percent stake in 2006  That initial public offering  IPO  was
oversubscribed by more than 200 percent  KenGen reported an 11
percent rise in pretax profits to 1 28 billion shillings for the
first half to December 
   KENYA PIPELINE COMPANY  KPC    Operates the only oil
pipeline linking the port of Mombasa to the capital  Nairobi  It
plans to double the capacity to 880 000 litres per hour  The
company also contracted China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering
Corp at a cost of 13 4 billion shillings to extend the pipe by
325 kms  200 miles  to the western town of Eldoret by June 
   KENYA PORTS AUTHORITY   Overseas operations at Mombasa
port  the main gateway into countries such as Uganda  Burundi 
Rwanda  southern Sudan  eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and
Somalia  The port operates 24 hours a day which users say has
eased delays  The government said it would seek private sector
participation in the construction of a container terminal in
Eldoret  outsourcing stevedoring services in Mombasa and the
development of four new berths 
   SUGAR FACTORIES   The government plans to privatise five
sugar factories    Chemilil  Sony  Nzoia  Miwani and Muhoroni   
to cut inefficiency and boost competitiveness ahead of the end
of trade safeguards in March 2012  which limit imports from the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa  COMESA  
 The government would sell a 51 percent stake in the five
sugar companies to strategic investors and reserve another 30
percent for farmers  Sugar output in 2010 was 523 522 tonnes
down from 548 207 tonnes in 2009  Kenya has an annual sugar
deficit of about 200 000 tonnes  which it plugs through imports
from partner countries in the COMESA bloc 
   KENYA TOURISM DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION  KTDC    Finances
projects through loans or equity financing and owns some hotels 
Tourism is one of the leading hard currency earners along with
tea and horticulture  in a country famed for its wildlife and

Media reports said the government was planning to sell a portion
of its stake through an IPO that would raise 5 billion shilling 
   DEVELOPMENT BANK OF KENYA   Is majority held by Centum
Investment and Transcentury  a private equity firm  holding 10 7
percent  The bank made 160 5 million shillings in the three
quarters to September compared with 116 million shillings in a
similar period in 2009

majority owned by the government 
   EAST AFRICAN PORTLAND CEMENT COMPANY   Is Kenya s
second largest cement maker  The government has a 25 percent
stake in the company while France s Lafarge  the National Social

 By Chikafumi Hodo and Antoni Slodkowski	
 TOKYO  April 4  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average advanced
on Monday but struggled to extend gains as uncertainty over the
country s economic outlook and a prolonged nuclear safety crisis
curbed enthusiasm over a weaker yen and a rise in U S  shares
after strong payrolls data 	
 The Nikkei peaked at a session high of 9 808 60 
lifted by export related shares  but shied away from a two week
peak of 9 822 06 reached on Friday and its 200 day moving
average also seen near Friday s high 	
  The Nikkei is up mainly because of gains in global shares 
but if you look at domestic factors  there are still plenty of
uncertainties   said Nagayuki Yamagishi  a strategist at
Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities 	
  The fact that the Nikkei can t hold above 9 800 shows
investor caution towards the outlook for the Japanese economy  
Yamagishi said 	
 The benchmark Nikkei ended the morning session up 
0 7 percent  or 69 89 points  at 9 778 28 	
 The broader Topix advanced 0 3 percent  or 2 52
points  to 865 14 	
 On Friday  the Dow Jones industrial average hit
12 419 71    its highest intraday level going back to June 2008
   before closing up 56 99 points  or 0 46 percent  at 12 376 72
after solid jobs figures  	
 U S  employment grew solidly for a second month in March and
the jobless rate hit a two year low of 8 8 percent 
 ID nNOAT00477 	
  Firmness in U S  shares and the weakness of the yen 
especially against the euro  encouraged buying in export related
sectors   said Mitsushige Akino  chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi
Investment Management 	
 The euro reached an 11 month high of around 120 yen
 on Monday 	
 But Japanese export led stocks may not have benefited fully
from the yen s recent weakness on views some manufacturers may
face trouble restoring production to full capacity due to
possible disruption to domestic supply chains as well the impact
of potential power shortages  analysts said 	
 The market showed little reaction to data on post earthquake
business sentiment among Japanese manufacturers in the Bank of
Japan s latest tankan survey 	
 Big Japanese manufacturers expect business conditions to
worsen in the next three months  responses to a BOJ survey
collected after the devastating March 11 earthquake showed  as
rolling power blackouts and a nuclear safety crisis threaten to
delay the country s return to a moderate economic recovery 
 ID nL3E7F4006 	
  I don t think the market reacted too much to the tankan
data as it s too early to examine the real impact  We need to
wait a little more to get a better picture   Akino said 	
 Shares in Japanese electronics companies showed mixed
reactions to ratings actions by brokerages 	
 Sharp Corp stocks added 1 8 percent to 840 yen
after Goldman Sachs upgraded the firm to  neutral  from  sell  
saying its shares have already fully priced in the risk of LCD
panel earnings deteriorating 	
 Sony slipped 0 5 percent to 2 658 yen after Goldman
downgraded the electronics maker to  neutral  from  buy  citing
weakening demand for plasma TVs and over dependence on external
suppliers for chipsets and lenses used in its TVs and digital
cameras 	
 Elsewhere  shares of electric machinery maker IHI Corp
 jumped 5 0 percent to 212 yen in heavy trade after the
Nikkei business daily said IHI and Sweden s Atlas Copco
 will soon sign a memorandum of understanding to
partner on the marketing of industrial use compressors 	
 Iwatani   a trading company specialising in gases
for industrial and household use  surged 10 2 percent to 303 yen
after the Nikkei business daily said it was running production
lines for portable gas cooking stoves and gas canisters at full
capacity to meet a post earthquake surge in demand 	
 Shares in Tokyo Electric Power dropped 1 3 percent

its crippled Daiichi Fukushima nuclear power plant

 By Rie Ishiguro and Kaori Kaneko	
 TOKYO  April 4  Reuters    Japan s government expects last
month s earthquake and tsunami to cost up to  300 billion in
material damage  but the ultimate cost will be far higher 	
 Tokyo Electric Power Co  TEPCO    operator of the
crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant  could leave the
government with additional costs in excess of  200 billion
covering nationalisation of the company and compensation claims 	
 Then there is the hit to GDP 	
 The March 11 quake and tsunami knocked out more than 20
percent of Tokyo Electric s power generation capacity and the
shortages will reduce industrial output and could fuel recession
in the world s third biggest economy 	
 Under a scenario in which Japan s economy shrinks in both
the first and second quarters  close to  160 billion in economic
activity would be wiped out  a Reuters calculation shows 	
  A crucial difference for previous earthquakes is the
large scale power outages and supply chain disruptions caused by
the crippled power plant   said Naohiko Baba  chief economist at
Goldman Sachs in Tokyo 	
  We assume that power outages will depress production
throughout 2011  	
 
 The 9 0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami that followed dealt
a crushing blow to Japan and will require the country s biggest
reconstruction effort since World War II  More than 12 000
people are confirmed dead and over 15 000 are missing 	
 Most importantly for the economy  the natural disaster
damaged power plants  leaving shortages  Specifically  it left
engineers scrambling to control radiation leaks and avert a
meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant run by Tokyo Electric 	
 
 DAMAGE	
 The government estimated that the disaster damage would cost
at least  190 billion and at most over  300 billion 	
 By either count that would make it the world s costliest
disaster  surpassing both Hurricane Katrina that levelled much
of New Orleans in 2005 and Japan s Kobe earthquake in 1995 	
 Even before Tokyo issued the assessment on March 30  most
private sector analysts had forecast the damage alone would cost
 200 billion to  250 billion in repairs 	
 Close to 170 000 homes in the north of the country that took
the brunt of the disaster are without power and 200 000 have no
running water  About 46 000 buildings were destroyed or burnt
down  and 155 000 others are damaged  More than 2 000 roads  56
bridges and 26 railways were either damaged or destroyed 	
 Economic growth will benefit longer term once reconstruction
gets into full swing  But analysts expect the economy to take a
hit until TEPCO and Tohoku Electric Power Co Inc   which
supplies northern Japan  can bring back enough power supply to
meet demand 	
 Nomura estimates the Japanese corporations on its Nomura 400
companies index  which includes all Japan s blue chips such as
Toyota Motor Corp and Sony Corp   to chalk up
 17 billion in lost profits owing to diminished power supply in
the financial year that began on Friday 	
  We see a growing risk of prolonged problems with
electricity supply at companies covered by Tokyo Electric Power
and Tohoku Electric Power   Nomura said 	
 The areas served by these companies produce half of Japan s
economic activity  Nomura estimates 	
 Analysts forecast the economy will either shrink by 1 4
percent in the first quarter from the fourth quarter  or expand
around 0 6 percent  GDP fell 0 3 percent in the fourth quarter 	
 However  a Reuters GDP poll for the second quarter of the
year produced a median forecast that the economy would contract
by 1 4 percent 	
 In the worst case scenario  where the economy shrinks by 1 4
percent for two consecutive quarters   158 6 billion would be
wiped off the economy  according to Reuters calculations 	
 Assuming growth in the first quarter of 0 6 percent followed
by a quarterly contraction of 1 4 percent  a much smaller  46
billion would be lost in GDP 	
 Japan s economy pretty much sailed through the Kobe
earthquake in January 1995  expanding for the first three
quarters of the year before experiencing a slight pull back in
the fourth quarter 	
 
 OTHER COSTS	
 Other costs are adding up 	
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan said the crippled nuclear plant
needed to be decommissioned  a process experts said could take
more than a decade and cost up to  19 billion 	
 The world s top insurers have so far said the disaster will
cost them  5 billion  although risk modelling agencies suggest
the overall cost to insurers would be as much as  30 billion 	
 The government  though  could face a much higher bill from
the disaster than first thought as confidence in TEPCO plunges 	
 The firm s shares have dropped as much as 81 percent 
 since March 11 and analysts said the firm faces huge
compensation claims  factors driving speculation the government
will be left with little choice but to nationalise the company 	
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimated compensation claims
could add up to  133 billion  How quickly TEPCO can resolve the
crisis will be critical to the ultimate bill  analysts said 	
  If TEPCO can stabilise their nuclear plant quickly 
compensation claims will likely be less than 1 trillion yen   12
billion  with payments limited to reimbursing farmers for lost
crops   said Nomura analyst Shigeki Matsumoto  	
  However  if it remains unstable  meaning long term or
permanent evacuation  then the cost will balloon beyond TEPCO s
means  In that case the government will have to pick up the
portion of compensation costs that TEPCO can t pay  
 ID nL3E7EV46V 	
 It could take months to stem radiation leaks  one official
warned  and even longer to regain control of the power station 	
 Under law  TEPCO could be exempt from compensation for
nuclear accidents caused by natural disasters  But in this case 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said in March that  it is
impossible that Tokyo Electric would easily be exempted from
liability for this accident  	
 More than 70 000 people have been evacuated from a 20 km  12
mile  evacuation zone around the Fukushima Daiichi plant 
Another 130 000 people  who live in a 10 km  6 mile  band beyond
the evacuation zone have been advised to leave or stay indoors 	
 If the government stepped in to rescue TEPCO  it could also
be assuming considerable debt 	
 Before the disaster  the company had  91 billion in debt on
its books  Since the catastrophe  it has signed a  24 billion
bank loan  which Chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata warned might not
be enough to keep the company going 	
 Added to which  Nomura estimates that TEPCO is paying more
than  1 billion a month for oil and gas to make up for lost
nuclear power generation capacity

 By Miyoung Kim	
 SEOUL  April 5 Reuters    Samsung Electronics   the world s top
maker of memory chips and flat screens  is likely to report a third consecutive
quarterly drop in earnings for the January March period  hit by tumbling prices
of flat screens and TVs 	
 Samsung is the first major global technology firm updating the market since
the devastating earthquake and tsunami hit Japan on March 11  raising
uncertainty about the longer term effects of the disaster on a broad range of
manufacturers   ID nL3E7EE05V 	
 Disruptions to the global supply chain threaten to create bottlenecks in
some key components for Japanese factories and analysts believe South Korean
firms such as Samsung may benefit as customers look for new suppliers  The
company also looks set to benefit from a recovery in the memory chip market 	
 For Samsung  which counts Sony Corp as its biggest customer 
bringing in nearly 7 trillion won   6 4 billion  of sales annually  a protracted
suspension of flat screen TV production in Japan results in lost revenue  but it
also benefits from a tightening supply of chips  for which it competes with the
likes of Japan s Toshiba Corp  	
 Samsung  Asia s most valuable technology firm with a market value of around
 142 billion  is due to report January March guidance on Thursday before it
announces detailed quarterly results in late April 	
 It is likely to report 3 17 trillion won in January March operating profit
on revenue of 38 trillion won  according to a consensus of 29 analysts surveyed
by Thomson Reuters I B E S 	
 According to StarMine SmartEstimates  which places more weight on recent
forecasts by top rated analysts  Samsung s operating profit may show a downside
surprise of 10 percent to 2 9 trillion won 	
 That would be its lowest profit since the second quarter of 2009  and down
42 percent from a year ago and 4 percent from the preceding quarter 	
 
 
 
 On a global basis  Japan supplies more than one third of NAND type flash
memory chips  used in tablets and smartphones  and 14 percent of computer memory
chips 	
  This will be the low point for the year  Sequential earnings growth can be
expected for the next three quarters as memory and LCD margins expand and the
strong season gets under way   Matt Evans  a CLSA analyst  said in a note 	
 Most LCD flat screen makers are widely expected to have suffered losses in
the January March quarter due to weak demand from TV makers  From Sony to Dutch
electronics group Philips   TV makers are struggling  hit by fierce
competition from ever cheaper TV brands and fragile consumer spending  Many
firms are warning of another unprofitable quarter 	
 
 SOLID MEMORY CHIPS  WEAKENING TABLETS	
 Earnings at Samsung  which controls nearly 40 percent of global dynamic
random access memory  DRAM  and NAND flash memory market  will improve from the
current quarter on stable panel prices and a rebound in the battered memory chip
market  Contract prices of DRAM chips have risen 3 percent since the quake and
NAND chips have risen 15 percent 	
  Memory chips will lead Samsung s profit recovery as major electronics firms
are placing more orders to Korean firms following the Japan quake and demand is
also expanding thanks to growing smartphones and tablet markets   said Kim
Young chan  an analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp 	
 Earnings growth from the telecoms division at Samsung  the world s No 2
handset maker after Nokia   may have slowed due to weakening sales
growth of its tablets and growing pricing pressure since Apple 
introduced the iPad 2 with aggressive pricing plan last month  analysts said 	
  Much of the initial market hype that Samsung s tablet will sell over 10
million units this year is now fizzling out because sales momentum has weakened
and telecoms operators are also getting concerned about inventory buildups  
said Seo Won suk  an analyst at NH Investment   Securities 	
 Apple is estimated to have sold about one million units of the iPad 2 in the
first weekend of its U S  launch early last month  By comparison  Samsung may
have sold a similar number of Galaxy Tabs in the past three months and sales
growth will remain weak  Follow up models will be on the market in June at the
earliest 	
 In the booming global tablet market  which is likely to grow to around 55
million units this year  Apple is seen as taking the lion s share and Samsung 
the most aggressive contender to Apple with three different sizes of tablets  is
still playing catch up 	
 Samsung is widely known as one of the fastest followers in the fickle
electronics industry  To better compete with Apple  Samsung redesigned its new
10 1 inch tablet  first introduced in February  in just several weeks to make it
the thinnest in the category after Apple set the trend with the slimmer iPad 2 	
  Expectations for tablets have driven Samsung shares since November  but it
has so far failed to live up to that expectation  Whether Samsung s share can
rise again will largely depend on how strongly its follow up tablet models do in
the market   said Lee Seung woo  an analyst at Shinyoung Securities 	
 Shares in Samsung have dropped 7 percent from a record high hit in late
January  lagging a steady performance in the KOSPI during the same
period

113938,335453,SNE,Sharp ekes out first half profit  outlook unchanged,news,"TOKYO  Oct 29  Reuters    Japan s Sharp Corp eked out a
first half profit as a recent recovery in TV and panel demand
cancelled out sluggish sales earlier this year  and the company
kept its annual outlook above market expectations 
 Operating profit at Sharp  the world s No 4 LCD TV maker
behind such rivals as Samsung Electronics Co and Sony Corp 
totalled 1 57 billion yen   17 4 million  in April September 
down from a 50 76 billion yen profit a year earlier 
 Sharp s flat TV and panel operations have made steady
progress towards profitability from the depths of the global
downturn at the start of the year as consumers start loosening
purse strings  but fierce global competition and the yen s
strength continued to weigh on its earnings 
 Sharp on Thursday stuck to its operating profit forecast of
50 billion yen for the year to March  up from a 55 48 billion
yen loss a year earlier and above the consensus of a 30 6
billion yen profit in a poll of 21 analysts by Thomson Reuters
I B E S 
 Shares in Sharp gained 54 percent since the start of the

 By Tarmo Virki  European technology correspondent
 HELSINKI  Oct 15  Reuters    Nokia Oyj lost ground on the
smartphone market to Apple s iPhone and RIM in the third
quarter  the Finnish firm said on Thursday  pushing its shares
lower 
 The world s top cellphone maker reported its worst ever
result as it also booked a major writedown in July September
quarter at its struggling networks unit 
 Nokia said its smartphones market share fell to 35 percent
in July through September from 41 percent the previous quarter 
  The scale of the smartphone market share loss must give the
markets pause for thought over the coming days  Dropping six
points in three months is pretty stunning   said MKM Partners
analyst Tero Kuittinen 
 Nokia s Chief Financial Officer Rick Simonson told Reuters
the trend should reverse in the fourth quarter as the group
rolls out new high end models like the N97 mini  updating its
hit model N97  and a Linux software based N900 
  We are going to see improvements there as we are going to
see new  fresh models replace older models   Simonson said 
 Nokia s smartphones pack more features than Apple s iPhone
or RIM s Blackberry  but lack the design and brand allure of its
North American rivals  analysts say 
  Smartphones are about wow factor  There s different wow for
different people  The N900 is probably that for many people  
Simonson said 
 The company booked a 908 million euros   1 4 billion  hit
from its Nokia Siemens Networks  NSN  joint venture  citing
challenging market conditions and dragging the group to a
reported loss per share of 0 15 euros 
 This was weakest ever quarter for the firm since it started
quarterly reporting in mid 1990s 
 Analysts expected a 0 09 euros per share profit  according
to a Reuters poll of 37 analysts 
 Shares in Nokia slumped 10 9 percent to 9 18 euros on the
Helsinki bourse  and its U S  shares were among the top five
traded stocks on NYSE  falling 10 7 percent to  13 74 by 1732
GMT 
 Shares in smaller vendor Motorola fell 5 2 percent 
 Motorola s close rival Sony Ericsson is the next handset
vendor to report on Oct  16

 SOME LIGHT IN HANDSET BUSINESS
 Nokia s key handset unit performed slightly better than
expected in the third quarter as consumer demand for mobile
devices started to improve in many markets 
  We have actually seen a bit of pickup in consumer demand
and looking forward we expect this to continue   said Simonson 
 CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber said   Consumer demand may
be showing early signs of improvement but these results show
sustained pressure on smartphone margins  Apple s iPhone is
defying gravity in the high tier  
 Apple is expected to report growing iPhone sales when its
report September quarter earnings on Oct  19 
 Industry sales of more advanced models  so called
smartphones  rose 15 percent from the previous quarter  Nokia
said  but falling smartphone prices are hurting top vendors 
  Nokia is launching plenty of new high end smartphone models
such as the N900 and N97 mini  But as yet there is no iPhone
killer to drive a major revival in its smartphone volumes   said
Neil Mawston at Strategy Analytics 
 HTC  the world s No  4 smartphone brand  reported worse than
expected results last week  underscoring intensifying
competition and declining prices 
 RIM  the second largest smartphone maker after Nokia  said
on Sept  24 its profit dropped 3 5 percent in the August quarter
and its outlook fell short of forecasts 
 Nokia reported a group level net loss of 913 million euros
compared with a 1 06 billion profit the previous year 
Third quarter sales fell 20 percent to 9 81 billion 
  Profit margins are under pressure     Nokia needs to do
some serious cost cutting to adjust to weaker demand   said

 By Susan Fenton
 HONG KONG  Sept 24  Reuters    Asian shares outside Japan
fell on Thursday  mirroring investor caution in the United
States  while the dollar was steady after the Fed reiterated
interest rates would stay low for a long period 
 Japan s benchmark Nikkei index jumped 1 7 percent after a
three day holiday break  but the rise reflected gains made in
the rest of the region at the start of the week 
 A 0 8 percent slide in the Dow Jones on Wednesday  however 
weighed on the rest of Asia s markets and the MSCI index of
Asia Pacific stocks traded outside Japan was down 1 2 percent 
 Shares in Korea fell more than 1 percent with some concern
that a strengthening Korean won could hurt export
competitiveness 
 In Hong Kong  the Hang Seng Index shed 2 percent and new
listing Metallurgical Corp of China  a Chinese engineering
company and the market s biggest IPO so far this year  skidded
nearly 15 percent below its issue price  Analysts said its
price had been too high given an expected slowdown in
investment in China s steel industry 
 The dollar was up 0 4 percent against a basket of
currencies  reflecting reasonably calm reaction after the Fed
upgraded its view of the U S  economy and indicated it was
closer to pulling back on extraordinary stimulus measures while
also reiterating a pledge to keep rates very low for a long
period 
 However  traders said its commitment to loose monetary
policy means the dollar could come under renewed pressure soon
as it is used to fund carry trades 
  As things stand  the Fed is in absolutely no hurry to even
think about normalising policy   said Stephen Stanley  chief
economist at RBS in Greenwich  Connecticut   This remains a
very dovish Fed  
 SONY SURGES  JAL PLUNGES
 Japan outperformed otherwise weak Asian share markets 
although data showing a slump in Japanese exports last month
was a further indication that economic recovery will be shaky 
 Electronics maker Sony Corp surged 3 3 percent after the
company said sales of the PlayStation 3 video game console
jumped after a price cut last month  but Japan Airlines plunged
11 1 percent after sources said the struggling carrier might be
broken up and public broadcaster NHK reported the airline may
seek a public bail out 
 Markets will be eying a two day G20 summit in Pittsburgh
starting on Thursday for further clues on the health of the
global economy and when governments might start rolling back
support measures for economic growth 
 Japanese and Korean government bonds followed U S 
Treasuries higher on the Fed s dovish stance although gains in
Japanese treasuries were capped by a rising equity market 
 December 10 year Japanese government bond futures rose 0 13
point to 138 68 
 Gold bounced back to around  1 010 an ounce  after sliding
to a New York close at  1 007 05  It has been supported by
underlying weakness in the U S  dollar and is now about 1
percent off an 18 month high reached last Thursday at
 1 023 85 
 Oil prices remained weak though  sliding 0 5 percent to
 68 61 after shedding nearly 4 percent on Wednesday after a
jump in stockpiles raised concerns about the strength of
demand

year  slid 13 percent below its issue price  as investors
fretted about the outlook for China s steel industry

currencies but lost ground against the higher yielding
Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar after the Fed
reiterated a pledge to keep interest rates very low for a long
period  The Fed also said that U S  economic activity was
picking up but did not surprise investors 
  The Fed didn t make much of a change to factors
surrounding the dollar  That means the overall dollar trend
stays downwards   said Jun Kato  senior chief analyst at

114004,335519,SNE,UPDATE 2 Nippon Sheet Glass chief Chambers steps down,news," Adds detail  background  comment 
 By Taiga Uranaka and Nathan Layne
 TOKYO  Aug 26  Reuters    Stuart Chambers is to step down as
chief executive of Nippon Sheet Glass Co Ltd to spend more time
with his family  after a stint of a little more than a year as
one of the few foreigners to head a Japanese company 
 Nippon Sheet Glass  which makes glass used in cars 
construction and for the production of electronics  said on
Wednesday Chairman Katsuji Fujimoto would assume the CEO post
from Oct  1 while the company searches for a permanent
replacement 
 Chambers  a 53 year old British national who was head of
British glass maker Pilkington when Nippon Sheet bought it in
2006 for about 2 billion pounds   3 3 billion   said he wanted
to devote more time to his family living in the UK 
  I have decided to put family first and company second  
Chambers told a news conference  a decision he acknowledged
might go against social norms in Japan where it is common for
salarymen to put their company above all else 
  In that process I have learned I am not Japanese   he
added 
 Chambers took the helm at Nippon Sheet Glass in June 2008 
joining Nissan Motor Co s Carlos Ghosn and Sony Corp s Howard
Stringer as one of the few non Japanese to lead a Japanese
company 
 He was immediately faced with a global economic downturn
that is set to send the company to its second straight annual
loss and has forced it to slash capacity and cut jobs 
 Asked how institutional investors might react to his
departure  he said it was conceivable that one or two might view
the situation as  not ideal  
 A Tokyo based analyst said some investors may worry about 
management s ability to effectively control overseas operations
which generate three quarters of group revenue following the
Pilkington acquisition 
 But overall the reaction should not be overly negative  the
analyst said  asking not to be named 
  Chambers did a good job in a very tough environment  He
accomplished a certain degree of restructuring and since he has
established the company s direction his departure should not
immediately be seen as a negative for the company   the analyst
said

   Seeks market share boost  confident of profit turnaround
   Outgoing CEO Dick Komiyama to retire at year end
   Sony CEO Howard Stringer new board chair effective Oct 15

  Adds more analyst comment  updates shares 
 By Tarmo Virki  European technology correspondent
 HELSINKI  Aug 17  Reuters    Sony Ericsson on Monday
entrusted the head of Ericsson s U S  technology division with
the task of leading the struggling cellphone maker back to
profit and reversing a sharp decline in market share 
 The 50 50 venture said it had named Bert Nordberg as chief
executive to replace Dick Komiyama  who retires at the end of
the year 
 Sony Ericsson has reported steep losses in past quarters and
seen its market share slip to below 5 percent  sparking market
speculation of a possible breakup 
  I would go for increased market share and restoring
profitability   Nordberg told Reuters when asked where he hoped
to see the company in one to two years  He said he would pursue
ongoing restructuring and step up efforts to develop  smash hit 
products 
 Nordberg  53  currently Executive Vice President at Ericsson
and head of the firm s Silicon Valley business  said he was
extremely confident in the support from both parent companies
and that turning to profit  can t be too far away  
 The firm also said Sony CEO Howard Stringer would become new
board chairman on Oct  15  replacing Ericsson head Carl Henric
Svanberg  who will become chairman of BP Plc in January 
  The management changes seem to signal that Sony and
Ericsson are prepared to continue working together  That will be
reassuring news for Sony Ericsson s staff and customers   said
Neil Mawston from Strategy Analytics 
 Of the top five cellphone vendors  Sony Ericsson saw the
sharpest drop in sales from the first quarter 
 The firm has missed such mobile phone trends as full
keyboards  Internet browsing and navigation  and research firm
Gartner said last week that Sony Ericsson s market share fell to
just 4 7 percent globally 
 
  BIG DECISIONS TO MAKE 
  Nordberg has some big decisions to make from day one   said
Ben Wood  head of research at CCS Insight 
  Sony Ericsson needs to streamline its mobile software
strategy and further reduce its dependence on mid tier feature
phones while working to restore profitability in the toughest
economic climate the mobile phone industry has ever seen  
 Sony Ericsson is known for its phones focusing on music and
imaging  but so far it has lacked a strong offering of
smartphones 
 Nordberg said he would look for a strategic revamp of the
firm s product portfolio 
  In this industry you need smash hit products   he said 
 Nordberg has been with Ericsson since 1996  prior to which
he worked with companies including Data General Corp  and
Digital Equipment Corp 
 In July  Sony Ericsson posted a pretax loss of 283 million
euros   400 million   and said the rest of the year would be
difficult  with the overall market to shrink at least 10
percent 
  I think it is an effect of them needing a bit of a fresh
start  some new blood  In addition to the fact that Sony
Ericsson has not performed particularly well during the last
year and a half   said Greger Johansson from Redeye 
 Shares in Ericsson were 0 5 percent lower at 66 90 crowns by
1214 GMT  outperforming a DJ Stoxx European technology index
down 1 7 percent

 TOKYO  Aug 3  Reuters    Japan s Panasonic Corp  6752 T 
 reported a smaller than expected quarterly loss and
sharply lifted its half year outlook as it cuts costs to cope
with a firmer yen and steep price falls in flat TVs 
 Panasonic reiterated its annual forecast for its net loss
to halve  saying it was too early to call a full fledged
recovery 
 Rival Sony Corp  6758 T  also beat market expectations with
its second quarter earnings last week and  though keeping its
official forecast for a full year loss  said it was aiming to
break even   ID nT306436 
 Panasonic  the world s No 1 plasma TV maker  saw sales of
its electronics gadgets slow as the global downturn forced
consumers to tighten their purse strings  while sluggish
corporate capital spending hit demand for its factory
automation equipment 
 The maker of Viera TVs and Lumix digital cameras is
shutting 40 manufacturing sites and shedding 15 000 jobs to
counter the headwind and better compete with Sony  Samsung

 Panasonic  which vies with Sony for the title of the
world s largest consumer electronics maker  kept its net loss
forecast of 195 billion yen   2 06 billion  for the year to
next March  but halved its net loss forecast for the six months
to September to 100 billion yen 
 The company s U S  listed shares rose more than 4 percent

  The guidance suggests Panasonic will regain an operating
profit in Q2  and I think we will see signs of improvement in

 Sluggish consumer sentiment in the U S  and in Europe could
continue to weigh on prices of flat TVs  even as the year end

 Representatives for Sony and Sharp said nothing has been

 The deal is aimed at allowing Sony to secure enough panels
for the growing LCD TV market while giving Sharp a partner to
help shoulder the cost of the plant 
 Sharp has said that it planned to start operations at the LCD

   JV to run for 5 years
   KKR to invest 50 mln euros for near term  200 mln later
 
 FRANKFURT  July 8  Reuters    Media group Bertelsmann plans
to speed growth of its music rights management business by
forming a joint venture with the private equity firm Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts   Co 
 Bertelsmann will contribute its BMG Rights Management music
rights unit  whose catalogue includes the work of Kylie Minogue
and Roy Orbison  and own 49 percent in the joint venture  which
is set to run for five years  the two companies said on
Wednesday 
 KKR will invest 50 million euros   69 6 million  to finance
near term growth and would commit to invest an additional 200
million euros over the coming years to finance possible
acquisitions  a spokeswoman said 
  With access to meaningful investment capital  we expect the
partnership with KKR to contribute significantly to accelerating
the development of the business   Bertelsmann Chief Financial
Officer Thomas Rabe said in a statement 
  This way we will be able to actively participate in the
expected market consolidation   added Rabe  who is also chairman
of the joint venture 
 Bertelsmann would also be willing to contribute capital to
help grow the business  whose staff will grow to around 100 in
the mid term from 30 at first 
 Reports of the deal in the German press had speculated that
such a venture could look for acquisition targets such as EMI
Group s music publishing assets  EMI is owned by British private
equity firm Terra Firma 
 A person familiar with the thinking at both companies told
Reuters   That will definitely be looked at  
 Both Bertelsmann and KKR said interest focused on small
rights catalogues 
 The deal could be a more efficient way of managing rights
under one roof  and would mark a more aggressive push into the
music business for the privately held German media conglomerate 
which has largely exited the industry 
 Bertelsmann pulled out of a recorded music joint venture
with Sony Corp in August 2008 and sold its music publishing
business in 2006 to Universal for 1 63 billion euros  At the
time  KKR had been one of the bidders for the business 
 However  in October it announced plans to build a new music
rights business called BMG Rights Management 
 It launched that business with a selection of European music
catalogues retained from the venture with Sony  which included
about 200 artists such as the Scorpions and Terence Trent
D Arby  the company has previously said 
 It has since added around 100 artists 
 Bertelsmann s Hartwig Masuch  an old hand in the music
industry and head of BMG Rights Management  will continue as
chief executive of the new company 
 The deal marks the latest in a string of investments made by
pension funds and private equity firms into high profile music
assets 
 Investors are attracted by catalogues of published songs
that provide steady  recurring cash flows as CD sales rapidly
decline and music piracy hits profits in the music industry 
 Dutch fund ABP  the world s third largest state pension
fund  earlier this year bought the legendary Rodgers  
Hammerstein catalogue of songs  ABP also owns music catalogues
that include rights to some songs by Michael Jackson    and
demand for music by the  King of Pop  has rocketed since his
death 
 A separate deal saw private equity firm Pegasus Capital pay
an estimated  55 million for Spirit Music Group  a song
publisher with rights to some of the works of artists ranging
from Frank Sinatra to Madonna

   Cars are most popular category
   Creator hopes to charge commission in future 
 
 By Khalid al Ansary
 BAGHDAD  June 19  Reuters    An Iraqi IT expert has set up
the country s first e shopping website for trading anything from
cars to game consoles  hoping to build a business that may one
day cater for locals and foreign investors alike 
 Named after an ancient and teeming Baghdad market  Harej 
which means  commotion  in Arabic  the site connects buyers and
sellers for free    although few goods are on offer so far 
 Its creator  Mehdi al Ajwadi  said the idea would take time
to catch on in the almost entirely cash based economy of a
country ravaged by years of conflict  and where only a tiny
proportion of the population has access to the Internet 
  There is still a long way to go before it s accepted by the
people   Ajwadi told Reuters 
  In future  when credit cards become more common and widely
used here  we will take a percentage on each trade  
 Hosted on a British server   runs in Arabic and
Kurdish and offers new and used goods in categories including
real estate  electronics  books  furniture and vehicles 
 By far the most popular section is cars  with 16 offered
including a BMW X5  Mercedes C300 and GMC Yukon XL  Elsewhere 
sellers are flogging a Nokia mobile phone handset  a Sony
Playstation 3  and a modest four bedroom home costing  65 000 
 Eventually  Ajwadi hopes to develop a delivery service to
get goods to buyers  as well as one day to tap the global
market 
  In the future we aim to be able to direct foreign investors
to investment areas in different provinces of Iraq   he said

114224,335739,SNE,UPDATE 3 Japan exports  imports dive as demand shrivels,news,"  Japan exports  imports log record annual drops
   Trade suffers from weak demand at home and abroad
   Japan posts 1st trade surplus in five months
 By Tetsushi Kajimoto
 TOKYO  March 25  Reuters    Japan s exports posted another
record drop in February as global demand for Japanese cars and
electronics evaporate amid a deepening global financial crisis 
but analysts see little sign of recovery in coming months 
 A record fall in imports helped Japan s trade balance swing
into surplus for the first time in five months but the data
provided little comfort as it showed both domestic and overseas
demand crumbling under the weight of the global slowdown 
 Analysts expressed hopes that the Chinese government s 4
trillion yuan   586 billion  stimulus spending package would
eventually ease the downturn  which has hammered Asian economies
that are heavily reliant on exports for growth 
 Exports halved from a year earlier  with shipments to the
United States and Europe falling at record rates  dragged down by
plunging demand for cars and auto parts 
  Large declines in exports will probably continue for March
and April  because global trade is a proxy for the global
economy   said Kyohei Morita  chief economist at Barclays
Capital 
  After that  stimulus in the Chinese economy will probably
help this negative margin shrink  so a lot is riding on China  
 Exports dived a record 49 4 percent in February from a year
earlier while imports slid 43 0 percent  showing the effects of a
global decline in trade from the global crisis 
 Analysts said sagging consumption in Japan was weighing on
imports  with lower oil prices and a stronger yen than a year
earlier also depressing the value of goods arriving in Japan 
 Separate data from the Bank of Japan showed Japan s exports
in real terms fell 5 5 percent in February from January to their
lowest since April 2002  and real imports dropped 15 9 percent to
their lowest since February 2000  helping the real trade balance
swing into a surplus 
 The Nikkei average slipped 0 1 percent on Wednesday as Sony
Corp and other exporters fell after a sharp rally  sparked the
previous day by a U S  plan to buy toxic assets from its banks 
 CHINA HOPES
 The pace of falls in exports to China narrowed for the first
time in seven months  sliding 39 7 percent from a year earlier
compared with an 45 2 percent fall in January data  although the
Lunar New Year may have been a factor  The major holiday in China
fell in February last year and January this year 
 Nevertheless  some analysts said there were signs the slide
in exports may bottom out soon  with semiconductor exports to
China rising from January 
 The race to the bottom by both imports and exports resulted
in a trade surplus of 82 4 billion yen   841 6 million  in
February but analysts saw no joy for the economy from this 
  The decline in imports suggest weakening demand in Japan  
said Takeshi Minami  chief economist at Norinchukin Research
Institute 
 Waning domestic consumption and overseas demand underlines
the pessimism of companies in the world s second largest economy
as they lay off workers and slash capital expenditure 
  Exports to the United States continued to fall sharply  As
it will be difficult to know whether the U S  government s
stimulus measures would show positive results in the economy
until this summer  I do not see a silver lining for exports to
the U S  for now  
Japanese exports to the U S  fell a record 58 4 percent in
February from a year earlier  while shipments to the European
Union fell 54 7 percent    also a record

114225,335740,SNE,Labels bet on flexibility with iTunes new pricing,news,"  iTunes Music to launch three tier pricing on Tuesday
   Majority of songs will still be 99 cents   sources
 By Yinka Adegoke
 NEW YORK  April 6  Reuters    Apple Inc  and major
music labels are betting that the launch of three tier pricing
at the iTunes Music Store will boost music sales with a new mix
of song based packages and give consumers more options 
 Apple will announce its new three tier price points at 69
cents  99 cents and  1 29 on Tuesday  according to several
people familiar with its plans  Since opening in 2003 all songs
in the iTunes store have been priced at 99 cents 
 The previous  one price fits all  strategy has long caused
friction between Apple and the music labels  who argued that
songs should be priced differently to reflect their perceived
value by consumers 
 The labels will finally get their wish 
 While the majority of songs will still be sold at 99 cents 
a certain number of new hit songs will now be raised to  1 29 
Many older catalog songs will now go for 69 cents 
 Perhaps anticipating a consumer backlash against price
increases executives  who spoke to Reuters on background ahead
of the launch  pointed out that for every one song they raise
to  1 29 they will be reducing 10 songs to 69 cents 
 But these executives said the biggest advantage of the new
pricing would be flexibility to create new digital products
beyond the album 
  We re thinking outside of the disc to reach a new
generation of consumers who are able to consume music on any
device  it s not just the track any more   said one music label
executive  who was involved with the talks  but did not want
the label identified ahead of the launch 
 For instance  a label could sell a brand new song and its
music video for  1 29 or package it with a ringtone  The lower
pricing could eventually mean that iTunes can sell albums at
more competitive prices though early indications are that album
prices will not change right way 
 Major label owners like Vivendi s  Universal Music
Group  Sony Music  6758 T   Warner Music Group  and EMI
Music say they can make money with more flexible prices and
possibly help make music retail a profitable enterprise again 
  If we can gain traction with  1 29 that will be good for
greater margin   said another label executive  also involved in
discussions  but who did want to identify the record label 
 Music sales have plunged as traditional retail outlets for
CDs have shuttered and the growth in digital sales have slowed
in 2008  Data from Nielsen SoundScan show album sales  once the
profit engine of the music business  fell by 14 percent in the
U S 
 Industry estimates show that 10 to 15 percent of albums
account for 90 percent of all sales  according to Digonex  a
dynamic pricing software company which has worked with major
music companies including Warner Music 
  This is an opportunity for the labels to get the maximum
they can for the music   said Michael Wanchic  vice president
of digital media at Digonex   The beauty of variable pricing is
that if the prices are too high customers simply won t buy  
 APPLE S ROLE
 According to NPD Group  87 percent of digital music buyers
in the U S  used iTunes to download music in 2008 versus just
16 percent who used Amazon com s  digital music store 
 Apple has already been experimenting with new packages at
different prices  In February it partnered with EMI Music to
announce the first iTunes Pass with Depeche Mode  offering fans
the album  exclusive singles  remixes  video and other content
for  18 99 
 All parties are also betting that the new lower 69 cent
song offering will boost sales of catalog music    described as
older songs and albums released about 18 months or more
earlier 
 According to one of the label sources  35 to 40 percent of
iTunes music sales are of catalog songs and albums  and that
share is growing as labels digitize more of their older songs 
  Apple has such a dominant position  frankly another 30
cents won t make much of a difference to most people   said
Russ Crupnick  analyst at NPD Group   There may be more gold in
the discount on the catalog  Americans love a bargain

 Staff at French plants run by Sony  3M and Caterpillar have
held managers inside the factories overnight  in three separate
incidents  to demand better layoff terms    a new form of labour
action dubbed  bossnapping  by the media

but 45 percent thought they were acceptable 
  They are not in the majority     but 45 percent is an
enormous percentage and it demonstrates the extent of

retail group who were angry about layoffs  Riot police
intervened to free him 
 Le Parisien found that 56 percent of blue collar workers
polled approved of bossnappings while 41 percent disapproved 
Among white collar workers  59 percent were against the practice
while 40 percent thought it was acceptable 
  These hostage takings  we know how it starts but no one
knows how far it can go   said Xavier Bertrand  a former labour

114227,335742,SNE,UPDATE 1 Taiwan March export orders hint downturn is moderating,news," Adds details on orders from key markets  analyst quotes 
 By Jeanny Kao
 TAIPEI  April 23  Reuters    Taiwan s export orders fell
24 29 percent in March  their sixth straight month of declines 
but the drop was not as severe as analysts expected  suggesting a
deep slump in global consumer demand may be moderating 
 The decline was also less than a 33 percent drop in the first
two months of the year  in another tentative sign that the ailing
world economy may be slowly turning around 
 A global recovery hinges largely on when the world s
consumers will begin spending again 
 Taiwan s March export orders  seen as a key barometer of
global demand for tech products  fell to  23 94 billion from
 31 62 billion a year ago  government data showed on Thursday 
 But the drop was not as bad as the 27 5 percent decline that
analysts polled by Reuters had expected 
  The order figure far exceeded market expectations  Solid
demand from China helped  but it was mainly due to stronger
demand in the U S  and European markets   said analyst Anita Hsu
at Masterlink Securities 
  We are expecting the slide of export orders to continue to
narrow in the second quarter  as U S  buyers re stock their
inventories ahead of the peak  shopping  season in the fourth
quarter  We recently raised our forecast for Taiwan s Q2 GDP to a
6 percent fall from the previous 8 percent slide  
 March export orders from China and Hong Kong  Taiwan s biggest
market  fell 29 38 percent from year ago levels  while orders
from the United States  the island s No 2 market  fell 23 43
percent  Orders from the EU fell 22 9 percent 
 Electronics orders fell 16 6 percent  moderating from
February 
 Taiwan s AU Optronics  2409 TW   the world s No 3 maker of
LCD panels used in flat screen TVs  on Thursday raised its
capital expenditure forecast by up to 20 percent  igniting hopes
that the worst of the tech downturn could be over 
 AU supplies top brands such as Dell Inc  
Hewlett Packard Co  and Sony Corp  6758 T  
 Industrial output data  which was released at the same time
as the export orders report  also provided some encouraging
signs  though the road to recovery is likely to be a long one 
 March industrial output fell 26 03 percent from a year
earlier  its seventh straight month of declines  but the rate of
decline was not as severe as the 31 9 percent analysts had
expected  and was an improvement from the 27 23 percent drop in
February 
 Taiwan s export orders have been slumping since October as
recession hit consumers and companies in key export markets like
the United States and Europe cut back on their discretionary
spending 
 The island s orders typically offer some hints to where
Asia s exports are headed in coming weeks  although its heavy
reliance on the cyclical tech sector has made Taiwan even more
vulnerable to the global downturn than its neighbours such as
South Korea  which has a more diversified economy 
  You can be optimistic that the first quarter figures give us
some idea as to how bad the downturn is going to be  but if we re
talking about any possible recovery  that s possibly a story for
2010 or even 2011   said economist Joseph Lau at Credit Suisse

halve this year s losses  but the electronics to entertainment
giant s better than expected outlook offered little solace to
markets vexed by glum U S  retail sales 
 A drop in U S  retail sales and a slump in euro zone output
reminded investors of the rocky road to recovery  triggering a
sell off in stocks that had rallied in the past two months on
hopes the world s worst recession in decades was drawing to an
end 
 Sony  which competes with Panasonic for the title of the
world s top consumer electronics maker  braced for another year
in the red  after booking a  3 1 billion loss in January March 
But the maker of PlayStation games  Cyber shot digital cameras
and Vaio PCs predicted a smaller operating loss for this
financial year than markets had expected 
 The news coincided with results from Britain s BT Group 
which reported a 1 28 billion pound   1 94 billion 
fourth quarter loss  and said it would cut its dividend and
another 15 000 jobs 
 Such a patchwork of good and bad news made many investors
cash in profits and others wonder if they may have been too
quick in moving funds from the safety of cash into riskier
assets such as shares  commodities and high yielding
currencies 
  The retail sales data indicated that views of a rebound
for the U S  economy could be wide of the mark   said Yasutoshi
Naga  chief economist at Daiwa Securities SMBC 
 Sony s outlook fell into the promising news category  but
analysts were guarded in their reactions 
  The projected loss isn t as bad as expected  It s still
too early to know if this is realistic  and we will be paying
attention to how Sony means to push through its restructuring  
said Koichi Ogawa  chief portfolio manager at Daiwa SB
Investments 
 The news came after the Tokyo market closed 2 6 percent
down and stocks elsewhere in Asia Pacific were down 3 5
percent  heading for their biggest fall in six weeks 
 The market brushed off signs that government and central
bank officials were becoming more optimistic about the
prospects for the world s second largest economy  now mired in
its worst recession since World War Two 
 Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said on Wednesday
the economy showed some signs of life  while a Japanese
newspaper reported on Thursday that the government was about to
upgrade its economic assessment in May for the first time in
over three years 
 Despite the setback in U S  April retail sales  which fell
0 4 percent  defying expectations of a stable reading  there
were also some encouraging signals from Washington 
 Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said the U S  financial
system was starting to recover and lending is starting to
improve 
  We have already seen a substantial amount of adjustment in
our financial system   Geithner told an audience of community
bankers   The more vulnerable parts of the non bank financial
system no longer exist  
 The U S  administration also moved to tighten the reins on
the vast  loosely regulated over the counter trade in
derivatives  largely blamed for excessive risk taking that
nearly wrecked U S  banks and set off the global financial
crisis 
 The plan  sketched out by Geithner and top regulators 
proposes tighter supervision and monitoring of derivatives
dealers to get a better grip on the market that exploded in
size in recent years and is estimated at about  450 trillion
globally 
 But there was enough disappointing news to keep investors
on edge 
 Euro zone industrial output plummeted by more than 20
percent in March  and the Bank of England warned that the
world s fifth largest economy would need more time to recover
than earlier thought 
 Reuters polls of more than 200 economists across Europe 
Japan and the United States showed they think the world s
richest nations will put recession behind them this year but 
when growth returns  it will be sluggish

114263,335778,SNE,INTERVIEW Yen not deviating from fundamentals Japan ex finmin,news," Adds comments  details 
 By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Sumio Ito
 TOKYO  Feb 5  Reuters    Rapid rises in the yen may hurt
Japanese exporters  but the currency s level against the dollar
now is not out of line with economic fundamentals  former Finance
Minister Sadakazu Tanigaki told Reuters 
 Tanigaki  who served as finance minister for the three years
to 2006  also said he hoped the financial heads of the Group of
Seven would speak out against protectionism even though the
deepening global slowdown is tempting governments to shelter
domestic industries 
  The yen has risen all of sudden  and Japanese exporters have
had a hard time coping with it   Tanigaki said in an interview on
Thursday 
  At its current level around 90 yen  versus the dollar  it
has risen rapidly from a while ago  but when I think about if
it s far apart from the actual state  of the Japanese economy  
it may not be   he said 
  The problem is the rapid move  
 The yen rally has hammered exports and pushed the world s
No 2 economy deeper into recession  with big exporters such as
Toyota Motor Corp and Sony Corp slashing jobs and cutting output
to cope with a global slump in demand 
 The currency has gained about 20 percent against the dollar
over the last year  The dollar was trading around 89 70 yen on
Thursday  up from a 13 1 2 year low of 87 10 yen hit last month 
 Tokyo has let off verbal volleys against sharp yen rises in
the past few months  but so far Japanese officials have stopped
short of saying they will intervene in currency markets  and many
market players don t believe they will 
 The G7 finance ministers and central bankers are expected to
discuss the plight of sterling  which has lost 20 percent in
value versus the euro over the past year and even more against
both the dollar and yen  when they meet in Rome on Feb  13 14 
 Tanigaki  now a deputy tax panel chief of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party  said it was important for the G7 to join forces
to eliminate any move that would lead to trade protectionism 
 The U S  Senate voted on Wednesday to soften a  Buy American 
plan in its  900 billion stimulus bill after President Barack
Obama expressed concern that the original language could trigger
a trade war 
  At times like this  a protectionism movement is likely to
emerge   Tanigaki said  referring to a requirement in the bill
that all public works projects funded by the stimulus package use
only U S  made iron  steel and manufactured goods 
 If trade protectionism were not dealt with  the world economy
could face a recurrence of the Great Depression seen in the
1930s  he warned 
 Under Tanigaki  Japan s Ministry of Finance intervened
heavily in the currency market  selling more than 20 trillion yen
on his watch to prevent yen strength from snuffing out an
economic recovery 
 It has not stepped into the currency market since March 2004
when it ended that 15 month spree  in which it sold 35 trillion
yen in total

   What  Amazon press conference
   When  Feb  9
   Industry watchers expect launch of new Kindle e reader  
 By Alexandria Sage
 SAN FRANCISCO  Feb 5  Reuters    A new Kindle electronic
reader from Amazon com Inc  could attract more fans
with design improvements and a lower price  but hype over the
device may be overblown    with mainstream popularity hardly
guaranteed 
 The digital book reader expected to be unveiled next week
would be the second version of the device launched in November
2007 hailed as revolutionary by the Seattle based company 
 Amazon has been mum on the topic of a new Kindle  but the
company has scheduled a press conference at New York s Morgan
Library for Monday  Feb  9  which could portend news of a
version two  analysts and Kindle fans said 
 The Kindle helped spark consumer interest in portable
readers beyond Sony Corp s  6758 T  Sony Reader  A glowing
review last fall from television host Oprah Winfrey added to
the Kindle s buzz  spurring backlogs during the holidays 
  The Kindle is huge   said technology forecaster Paul Saffo
 The Kindle is to reading is what the iPod was to music   only
bigger  
 Kindle users can read books and newspapers on the wireless
device that weighs less than a paperback  Amazon sells most
best sellers for  9 99 and the retailer uses its close ties
with publishers to make a wide array of books available  Over
200 titles  which are delivered wirelessly  can be stored on
the current Kindle 
 Rumors of a new Kindle reader began surfacing last fall
after one blog    posted photos it
identified as the Kindle 2 that had some design improvements
and a joystick instead of a scroll wheel 
 That might be welcome news for some users  who have written
on blogs that  The Kindle isn t the sexiest kid in school  and
complained about the placement of its buttons  lack of
backlighting  slow page turns and high price 
 Others have said they would like the Kindle to be able to
annotate books  and to display charts and graphs better 
 The Kindle is a tiny part of Amazon s web retail business 
but it attracts a disproportionate amount of interest 
 Mark Mahaney of Citigroup estimated that Amazon sold half a
million Kindles last year  about a third more than the number
of iPods sold by Apple Inc  in its first year  Kindle
revenue could surpass  1 2 billion by 2010  he estimated  or
more than 4 percent of total projected revenue that year 
 Others see the Kindle differently   It s kind of cool and
it has a huge  gee whiz  factor and like a lot of things Amazon
does  it has a great halo affect on the stock  But that s it  
said Bernstein Research s Jeffrey Lindsay 
 Amazon shares are down 12 pct since a year ago  compared to
a 31 percent drop on the Nasdaq 100  
 HIGH END CONSUMERS LOVE THEM
 No one knows how popular the Kindle is  because Amazon does
not release sales data  But the device  currently priced at
 359 on Amazon s website  was out of stock most of the fourth
quarter  Amazon s Chief Executive Jeff Bezos has said he was
surprised by  unusually strong demand  for the Kindle during
the holidays 
 Lindsay said backlogs were likely due to Amazon s desire to
control Kindle s deployment  adding that Flextronics
International Ltd  which many believe manufactures the
Kindle for Amazon  could produce them faster and cheaper 
 Keeping the Kindle scarce keeps the level of excitement
high  and keeps people talking about Amazon  Lindsay added 
 Amazon s desire to preserve its success with physical book
sales is why it will not sharply lower Kindle s price  he said 
 We think Kindle will be an interesting product which the
high end consumers love  particularly investment bankers
traveling in from Connecticut   he said   We don t think it
will be a large penetration object any time soon  
  Consumers waiting for backordered Kindles are likely to be
offered the new version by Amazon  said Stifel Nicolaus analyst
Scott Devitt 
   Hopefully  they ll have production in line   Forrester
Research analyst Patti Freeman Evans said   It s always
difficult with the beta version of something to judge demand
well  
 Some analysts think Amazon intends to make the Kindle the
most sophisticated book reader on the market for a niche
clientele  but that it will not try to broaden its appeal by
adding major functions in the future  That would invite
competition from device manufacturers  Lindsay said 
 Users of Apple s iPhone  which offers web browsing  e mail
and other downloadable applications  can already read public
domain books from Google Books  
  If Amazon were to take it down to  99 and try to penetrate
it like an iPod  we would be the first to look at how much
damage they d do to their own business   Lindsay said 
 One area of opportunity for Kindle may be students trying
to limit the textbooks they carry  said Devitt 
  Outside the heavy reader and heavy traveler  market   that
is the most eye opening opportunity they have   Devitt said

   Bezos says Kindle focus is for reading

   Bezos says  can t make this device less expensive 
 By Franklin Paul
 NEW YORK  Feb 9  Reuters    With its slim profile  wireless
technology  built in speakers and a massive online marketplace
one click away  Amazon com Inc s Kindle 2 might be seen as a
super gadget  and perhaps an iPod killer 
 Not so  Amazon  chief executive Jeff Bezos says 
Kindle is about the printed word  and that s it 
  We are really focused on making the best purpose built
reading device   for books  magazines and newspapers  blogs  
Bezos told Reuters in an interview   
 The newest version of the device  priced at  359  was
introduced on Monday at the Morgan Library in New York 
 In the weeks before the debut of the new version there was
speculation about whether Amazon would add additional
multimedia features  or cut its price 
 The new Kindle does allow users to surf the web wirelessly
and play some digital music  and its black and white display
can show some photos  ID nN09518566  But Apple Inc  
home of the multimedia iPod  need not worry  Bezos seems to be
saying 
  That s not the focus of the device  That s not the
emphasis of the device  The real focus is reading   he said 
 It s a device for reading  
 Kindle is a tiny part of Amazon s web retail business  but
its attracts a great deal of interest from every quarter   
from investors to tech web sites  The new Kindle is  thinner 
faster  crisper  with longer battery life and can hold up to
1 500 books  the company said 
 First introduced by the Seattle based company in November
2007  the Kindle has been sold out often since its debut  which
Bezos called  a high quality problem  
  We had way more demand than we ever expected or even hoped
for  which meant that we were sold out during two holiday
seasons    which is not a good idea   he said  punctuating his
comment with his signature hearty laugh 
 The device is about one third of an inch thick and the size
of a small magazine  with a 6 inch viewing screen 
 Much has been made of its price tag  which is about  40
lower than its primary rival  the Sony Reader  6758 T   But the
Kindle still costs over  100 more than smartphones that carry
digital books  such as Apple s iPhone or HTC Corp s  2498 TW 
G1  based on Google Inc s  Android technology 
 Its price  which is the same as the original Kindle model 
also is not far from that of many netbooks    new low cost PC s
that carry only limited memory and software  but can surf
newspaper websites and blogs and might be able to host digital
books 
 Kindle features are the reason for its price  Bezos said 
although he declined to comment specifically on profitability 
  We can t make this device less expensive   he said   It
has this sophisticated EV DO wireless radio  has the most
sophisticated electronic paper display   and  a very fast
processor  It s just not possible to make this device less
expensive  
 Bezos said that so far customers are willing to pay that
price  citing the fact that Kindle was sold out as the
recession gripped other retailers during the fourth quarter 
  So even in the midst of the worst macro economic
environment probably since the Great Depression  people were
buying Kindles   he said 
 That good fortune has not spurred Bezos to start building
other electronic devices at Amazon  whose online shop sells
everything from fingernail sized memory cards to big screen
televisions  
  We are totally focused on reading   Bezos said   We have
no plans or thoughts about making any other kinds of devices 
We are really focused on this

114266,335781,SNE,Ad industry confronts grim research on spending,news,"  Recession to have lasting impact on advertising patterns
   Global ad spend predicted to be down 15 pct in 2009
   Advertising recovery not seen until mid 2010
  Repeats without change to headline or text 
 By Paul Thomasch
 NEW YORK  March 9  Reuters    An advertising industry that
has witnessed consumers abandon vacations  quit shopping and
drop cable TV subscription should be prepared for such dramatic
shifts in spending to stick around for awhile    even after
worldwide economies recover 
 So cautions Nick Brien  a senior executive of advertising
giant Interpublic Group   who predicted the sharp
pullback in consumer spending would force companies to adjust
by cutting global advertising expenditures by 10 to 15 percent
this year 
 U S  ad budgets could be down 20 percent  although spending
on marketing  like special promotions or public relations 
should hold up better  he said in an interview 
  If this economy is changing the game for consumers  it
then changes it for marketers and ad agencies   Brien said 
citing a new research project by IPG s Mediabrands   The
consequences are far reaching  
 Brien will present an advertising conference in Sydney on
Tuesday with the latest research  which suggests behavioral
changes seen by consumers in the United States  China and
Australia are here to stay  That  he says  means marketers will
have to rethink how they sell their products and services 
  I started in 1982 and I ve never experienced anything like
this  where it s a global phenomenon  where the anxiety level
is so very serious   said Brien  chief executive of
Mediabrands  which has responsibility for Interpublic s media
agencies Universal McCann  Initiative  Magna  J3 and a handful
of others 
 Brien  previously worldwide chief executive of Universal
McCann  took over his role at Mediabrands in July  giving him
management responsibility over agencies that handle billions of
dollars in spending for marketers such as Johnson   Johnson
  Microsoft   Home Depot  and Sony
 6758 T  
 Based on 90 minute interviews with consumers  Brien is
using the new research to help advise clients on how to spend
during the recession    and once economies start to recover 
 For instance  the research found that consumers are willing
to sacrifice traditional cable TV and landline telephone
accounts if they are feeling the recession s pinch  But they
will not easily give up their Internet and mobile phone
accounts 
 In other words  if companies are cutting advertising
budgets  they would be well advised to take money out of
traditional TV commercials  while maintaining funding for Web
search ads  or they should abandon a newspaper campaign  but
keep spending to zip targeted text ads to cellphones 
  That means the challenge for traditional media cannot be
underestimated   Brien said   We re telling clients that while
budgets may be cut  don t cut innovation or your commitment to
emerging technologies  Because this is where you ll find
consumers  
 Brien said both clients and consumers appear  shocked by
the speed of economic collapse  and now he does not believe
that the advertising market will recover before the middle of
2010 
  I can t see anything in 2009 that gives me any confidence
there will be a bounce   he said   I feel like we ll hit a
bottom by the middle of 2009  but I don t think ad budgets will
come back right away  
 Indeed  Brien said the research shows that consumers do not
see themselves returning to pre meltdown spending even after
their jobs  homes and savings are more secure 
 While they may start taking vacations again  the trips will
be shorter or less luxurious  they may remodel their kitchen 
but are likely to save for it rather than finance a new
dishwasher  refrigerator and cabinets with credit  according to
the study 
  If consumers change how they shop  the advertising
approach has to change  to be more promotional based 
value based   said Brien   I don t think you ll see the
advertising going back to its traditional mix anytime soon

No 2 economy to slide back into deflation for two years 
 The BOJ left interest rates on hold at 0 1 percent but warned
the economy was worsening sharply  as new figures showed exports
plunging at a record pace while the yen hits 13 year highs 
 The central bank delivered a similarly bleak warning about
deteriorating access to credit  saying it would take on new
credit risks to try to limit the economic damage from the global
financial crunch that has dried up corporate financing 
  Shirakawa frankly seemed quite worried about the uncertainty
over the economic outlook   said Hideo Kumano  chief economist at
Dai Ichi Life Research Institute 
  His stance appears to be that if there are any more steps
that are deemed effective  the Bank of Japan will implement them
without preconception  
 The Bank of Japan s moves are the latest by Japanese policy
makers scrambling to shield the economy from the global financial
storm that has pushed the economy into a deep recession 
 Like the U S  Federal Reserve  the central bank s interest
rates have been cut close to zero and it has offered various
measures debt measures to get cash into the financial system to
revive lending 
 On Thursday  the BOJ said it would buy corporate bonds and
accept real estate investment trust  REIT  debt as collateral  on
top of previous plans to buy commercial paper  as it expands the
credit risks it is willing to stomach to help firms raise cash in
the face of gummed up financial markets 
  Commercial paper is the last resort for  companies  to raise
funds  and the functioning of that market has deteriorated   BOJ
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa told reporters   So now we are trying
to help the market  and I think that means a lot  
 The bleak economic outlook boosted short term Japanese
government bond futures  while the REIT move boosted property
shares and helped the Nikkei share average climb 1 9 percent 
  The fact that the BOJ is going to take on credit risk is
significant  It is a serious announcement   said Jun Miyata  a
senior fund manager at T D Asset Management Co  adding that the
central bank should buy a wider range of bonds 
 Still  the BOJ s efforts would not provide much support for
smaller firms worst hit by the recession and in greatest need of
funds  said Yasuhide Yajima  an analyst at NLI Research
Institute 
  Looking at the way exports are falling  the economy is
worsening on an unprecedented scale  It s true many of the steps
the BOJ is taking are unconventional  but they are simply not
enough   he said 
 Yen interbank rates    key reference rates for credit markets
   have inched down  but only slowly in an economy where distrust
of longer term lending runs high 
 Three month yen TIBOR was at 0 72 percent on Thursday  having
come off peaks of 0 91 a month ago but still significantly higher
than overnight cash rates near 0 1 percent 
 DEFLATION COMING BACK
 The BOJ warned Japan faced its second bout of deflation this
decade  It forecast core consumer prices would fall 1 1 percent
in the year to March 2010 and 0 4 percent the following year 
although Shirakawa himself carefully avoided saying the word
deflation 
 It is the first time the BOJ has forecast a return to
broad based price declines  which can be debilitating for an
economy because consumers hold back purchases to wait for yet
lower prices 
 For a graphic of the forecasts  click 
 
 The central bank said it saw the economy turning up by early
next year but warned that uncertainty was high  and analysts said
this was pretty optimistic 
 Exports  a key driver of Japanese growth in the past  show no
sign of recovery  They plunged in December a record 35 percent
from a year earlier as Asian consumers buckled under the global
financial crisis and the U S  recession crushed demand for
electronics and autos 
 The collapse in exports pushed Japan deeper into recession in
the fourth quarter  analysts said  and with the global economy
crumbling and the yen at 13 year highs against the dollar  there
was no light at the end of the tunnel 
 The central bank was similarly grim in its outlook 
  Exports are falling sharply on slowing overseas economic
growth  Domestic demand is also weakening as corporate revenues
as well as household s job and income environment worsens   the
BOJ said in a statement 
  Japan s economy is worsening sharply and is expected to
continue worsening in the near term  
 Underlining the collapse in exports  electronics maker Sony
Corp said on Thursday it faced a  2 9 billion operating loss this
financial year  with the yen strength adding to woes from sliding
demand 
 Rising risk aversion and fears about the stability of the
U S  and European banking sectors pushed the yen to a 13 year
high of 87 1 per dollar on Wednesday 
 Finance Minister Shoichi Nakagawa fired a shot across the
bows of currency markets  saying rapid moves in the yen were not
good  but analysts played down the risk of intervention 
 With exports collapsing and the yen surging  the mood among
Japanese manufacturers  hit a new low  the Reuters Tankan survey
showed

114298,335813,SNE,UPDATE 1 Japan s Nakagawa steps up warning on markets,news,"TOKYO  Jan 23  Reuters    Japan s Finance Minister stepped up
his warnings about volatility in financial markets on Friday 
saying the government would act promptly if necessary  though he
stopped short of saying Tokyo would intervene in currency
markets 
 The yen soared to a 13 1 2 year high of 87 10 to the dollar
earlier this week  hurting Japanese exporters  profit outlooks
and bringing down their share prices 
  We are watching financial markets very carefully and with a
high sense of alert  and if necessary we must take prompt action
in a broad sense   Finance Minister Shoichi Nakagawa told a news
conference 
 Nakagawa said the Japanese government must take appropriate
steps to bolster the economy  a day after the country s central
bank forecast that the economy would plunge into its deepest
economic contraction in modern times 
 Japan s exports and industrial production have been tumbling
at an unprecedented pace in the last few months as global demand
evaporated 
  This is not a problem for Japan alone like in the 1990s  The
economic malaise in the United States and Europe is affecting the
Japanese economy  I think that s also playing a big role in
currency markets and share prices   Nakagawa said 
  So I hope that the U S  and European authorities will take
measures to deal with it  And Japan will also do what it must
do   he added 
 The Nikkei share average fell to a two month low after a
massive loss warning from Sony Corp exacerbated concerns about
corporate earnings and data showed further deterioration in the
U S  economy 
 Nakagawa also said he hoped Japanese regional banks would
apply for public funds to boost their capital so that they can
expand lending 
 Two regional lenders have showed an interest in asking for
capital injections from the government

114326,335841,SNE,UPDATE 4 Japan bank lending grows at record pace amid crisis,news," Adds extra budget bills  S P rating 
 By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO  Jan 13  Reuters    Japanese bank lending grew at a
record pace in December from a year earlier as companies  shut
out from raising funds in markets  grabbed cash from their
bankers amid a global recession 
 The plunge in overseas demand and subsequent collapse in
Japanese industrial production are paralysing the country s
export oriented economy  with Japan s current account surplus
shrinking for a ninth straight month 
 With much of the rich world in recession and growth slowing
in China and other big emerging markets  many economists expect
corporate anxiety over fund raising to persist and even
strengthen should the economy deteriorate further 
  Corporate executives are very worried because their cashflow
is clearly dwindling   said Hideo Kumano  chief economist at
Dai ichi Life Research Institute 
  Corporate managers have recently been gossiping a lot about
things like  Such and such a company that s had no debt went to
the bank just in case   That kind of talk is fuelling their
worries  
 Japan s lower house of parliament passed on Tuesday an extra
budget worth 4 79 trillion yen   53 58 billion  aimed at keeping
the world s second biggest economy from sliding deeper into
recession 
 But the budget and related bills    including a plan for 2
trillion yen in payouts to households that opposition parties say
would do little to shore up the economy    could face a delay in
clearing the opposition controlled upper chamber 
 Despite deteriorating economic conditions  Standard   Poor s
Ratings Services affirmed Japan s sovereign debt ratings  citing
its robust net external asset position and relatively sound
financial system  Still  such strengths were moderated by factors
such as large fiscal deficits and outstanding debt  it added 
 SQUEEZED
 Lending by Japanese banks rose 3 7 percent in December from a
year earlier  the largest increase since the Bank of Japan
started publishing the data in 2000 and faster than 3 2 percent
in November 
 The country s biggest banks  for which the BOJ has data going
back further  increased their lending by 4 2 percent  the largest
rise since December 1991 
 Borrowers have been turning to banks as rates on new
commercial paper  CP  have jumped and issuing corporate bonds has
become difficult for firms with low credit ratings  while
companies are feeling the pinch from the economic slump 
 Outstanding commercial paper issued in Japan fell 15 percent
in December from a year earlier  the biggest fall in nearly two
years 
 For graphics on bank lending and outstanding CP  click on   

  I d say half of the increase in lending is due to the fall
in CP  The other half is due to cash hoarding   said Dai ichi
Life s Kumano 
 Economists said the loans were likely going to bigger firms
seen as better risks  rather than to struggling small ones 
  The sharp drop in outstanding CP shows that corporate
financing continues to shift towards bank lending  It leads to
the concern that small and midsize firms could be squeezed out  
said Junko Nishioka  chief economist at RBS Securities 
 The BOJ decided last month to temporarily buy commercial
paper outright to try to stem the credit crunch  while Japanese
companies are bracing for tighter credit conditions as the end of
the business year approaches on March 31 
 The BOJ is widely expected to keep rates unchanged at its
policy meeting on Jan  21 22  but it may examine expanding the
types of assets it accepts in addition to CP to help corporate
financing 
 EXPORT GLOOM
 The Nikkei share average slid nearly 5 percent on Tuesday 
hit by a stronger yen that nailed exporters and fears of losses
that reinforced worries about the global economy 
 Sony Corp shares sank nearly 9 percent as a source with
knowledge of the matter said the company may post its first
annual operating loss in 14 years 
 Japan s current account surplus shrank for the nine month in
a row as exports slowed and high oil and raw materials costs
earlier in the year inflated the country s import bills 
 It was the longest slide in the current account surplus since
16 months of contraction in 1995 1996 when a rising yen sent
exports sliding 
 Adding to trouble from weakening exports  a government survey
showed Japan s service sector sentiment fell for the the ninth
straight month to mark a record low in December 
 A separate survey by a government affiliated body pointed to
further pessimism  with 36 economists polled saying the economy
likely shrank an annualised 5 14 percent in October December 
against a 1 8 percent contraction forecast a month ago 
  The current account balance is still in the black  but the
trade and service balance is running a huge deficit  Much depends
on how much income surplus Japan can earn ahead   said Takeshi
Minami  chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute 
  Exports to China and other emerging economies are weakening 
so the outlook for Japanese exports is grim   he added  saying
they may not hit a bottom until the third quarter of this year

 LAS VEGAS  Jan 7  Reuters    TVs  TVs everywhere but not a
150 inch in sight 
 With much of the world grappling with recession  technology
giants at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas
eschewed the one upmanship that had characterised past
gatherings and focused instead on unveiling slimmer 
energy saving televisions with Internet bells and whistles 
 Sony  Samsung  LG  Panasonic  Toshiba and others trotted
out high definition TV screens on Wednesday designed to pull
videos  photos and other content off the Web and into the
living room 
  Even though we have a recession now  like everybody  we do
not want to reduce our marketing spending and we want to invest
more money on R D and customer service and eco friendly and
environmental issues   LG Electronics North America President
and Chief Executive Michael Ahn told Reuters 
  It is a hard decision   he said in an interview   But we
want to invest for our future  
 Many stressed the eco friendly  power saving abilities of
their latest TVs    a key selling point at a time when
households are tightening their belts  Unlike in past years 
not one company tried to outshine the competition with the
physically biggest screen 
 The new TVs can siphon content off Internet sites such as
Google s videosharing site YouTube  movie rental chain Netflix
O    and allow messaging of friends on social networks like
MySpace or Twitter 
 Yahoo unveiled a big push to marry the Internet and
television    something no company has successfully pulled off
thus far    through deals with the main Asian TV makers 
 Since the dawn of the Internet age  companies have been
promising  convergence  of online and TV universes    but
failed to connect with consumers 
  In a lot of ways these are two different worlds  but we
believe that users are increasingly looking for more out of
their media platforms   said Patrick Barry  vice president of
connected TV at Yahoo 
 Wrapping up Wednesday s event  Microsoft announced it will
let consumers begin testing the next iteration of its leading
computer operating system  Windows 7  from Friday  which
experts hope will sweep away most of the cobwebs from the
controversial Vista
 Microsoft also won a deal from Verizon to provide mobile
Internet search services  in a setback for Google and Yahoo s
wireless ambitions
 WIDGETS WHA 
 The new TVs  which use Intel s CE1000 chip  will offer up
an array of Widgets    small Internet applications    that run
alongside TV content  but not over it 
 Gone were the 150 inch TV behemoths that once lorded over
the show floor and attracted hoards of curious 
 Instead  executives sang a different tune  preaching
smaller and sleeker is better  as Samsung did with its one inch
thick TVs that use light emitting diodes  LEDs  rather than
cold cathode fluorescent lamps as their primary light source
 Sony estimated that such screens use 40 percent less power
than traditional LCDs 
 Away from the tube  Sony also made a play to enter the
market for ultra portable laptops  announcing what it called
the world s lightest notebook with an 8 inch screen  costing a
whopping  900 despite its pocket dimensions 
 A recurring theme on Wednesday was one of caution 
 Amid the worst global credit crisis since the 1930s 
executives warned of difficult times ahead but vowed to
continue rolling out innovative products  positioning
themselves for an inevitable rebound 
 The chief executive of Sony Ericsson  a venture of Sony and
Ericsson  sees a tough cell phone market through the end of
2009  with unit sales down by about 5 6 percent as consumer
demand slows in the weak global economy
 LG appeared the boldest publicly  pledging to raise
spending on research and development    now about 4 percent of
their revenue    and suggesting a slightly enlarged market
share in 2009 as it sustains its North American push
  The economy is going through a reset   Robbie Bach 
president of entertainment   devices for Microsoft  told
Reuters in an interview 
  In the short term  that means that every business is
having some impact  We are going to manage through that and
come out the other end of that reset a much stronger company

dominated the high end electronics marketplace  is hoping a
swathe of new products will spur spending and lift its consumer
division out of a business malaise 
 On Thursday  Chief Executive Howard Stringer demonstrated a
range of new devices at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las
Vegas  including a flexible OLED  organic light emitting diode 
screen playing a video of singer Beyonce 
 Sony in 2007 launched the world s first OLED TV  which is
slimmer  more energy efficient  and offers crispier pictures
than liquid crystal display  LCD  TVs  The bendable OLED
screen  which is still in the development stage  would offer
flexibility in design  making possible such applications as
wearable displays 
 Stringer and Oscar winning actor Tom Hanks also
demonstrated prototype eyeglasses with built in video screens
that can show full length movies 
 Besides Hanks  other celebrities who cameo ed at Stringer s
keynote speech included R B singer Usher and baseball Hall of
Famer Reggie Jackson  underscoring a unique business structure
that combines the world s leading electronics conglomerate and
entertainment group under one roof 
 Sony said on Wednesday sales of some of its best selling
products exceeded expectations during the U S  holiday season 
  No drop in the economy can change the fact that this is
still one of the most innovative industries on the face of the
planet   Stringer said during the day s first event 
  If we keep our sails spread high  history tells us the
wind will pick up again and it will carry us to places we could
barely imagine three years ago  
 The maker of Bravia flat TVs  PlayStation 3 video game
consoles and Cyber shot cameras is hoping to breathe life into
a struggling consumer electronics division  On Wednesday  it
trotted out a new line of environmentally friendly  ultra slim
TVs and the world s lightest 8 inch laptop 
 Sony also called the Wi Fi camera the first of its kind in
the world  allowing users to upload videos and photos to Web
sites without going through a personal computer 
 DIFFICULT TIMES
 But the plethora of new devices are arriving in a difficult
market 
 U S  consumer electronics spending is expected to slide 0 6
percent in 2009  a dramatic reversal from 5 4 percent growth in
2008  according to the U S  Consumer Electronics Association 
which organizes CES  But the industry group predicted the
sector will recover in 2010 
 Sony itself is going through a painful restructuring that
will shed 16 000 jobs and curb investment to try to save  1
billion  Analysts and media speculate more painful measures are
in the works 
 Since taking the helm in 2005  Stringer has worked hard to
break down the barriers among various business groups within
the company  which include movies  music  games  consumer
electronics  insurance and banking 
 The effort  carried out under the  Sony United  slogan  led
partly to its victory in the high definition optical disc
format war with Toshiba Corp  when its game  movie and
electronics divisions threw their full weight behind Blu ray
technology 
 Sony is now also trying to develop an online network built
on its popular PlayStation gaming consoles  a similar effort to
Microsoft Corp s Xbox Live service 
 On Thursday  it said it enlisted video game publisher
Electronic Arts for its fledgling online PlayStation service 
and signed up Viacom Inc s MTV Networks to provide more than
2 000 hours of video programming 
 Kaz Hirai  head of Sony computer entertainment  said the
company had signed up 2 1 million new users for the online
network in the most recent month ",2009-01-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/ces-update-2-sony-unveils-new-gadgets-in-celebrity-revue-18948,18948
114348,335863,SNE,UPDATE 2 Panasonic cuts spending  restructures as crisis bites,news," Recasts with official announcement 
 By Sachi Izumi
 TOKYO  Jan 9  Reuters    Japanese electronics maker Panasonic
Corp will cut its investment in two new flat screen TV plants by
about  1 5 billion and exit unprofitable businesses as the global
economic slump slices into its profits 
 Weakening economies around the world have been slowing demand
for flat TVs  digital cameras and other electronics products  and
prices are plummeting as makers try to clear piling inventories 
 Panasonic  the world s largest plasma TV maker  had said in
November it would need to restructure to cope with a downturn
that has already forced Sony Corp and other rivals to shutter
plants and cut jobs 
 The company  which changed its name from Matsushita Electric
last year  said it would cut investment through 2012 on two flat
TV plants under construction in Hyogo prefecture  near Osaka  by
135 billion yen   1 5 billion  or 23 percent to 445 billion yen 
 The factory in Amagasaki city is expected to start producing
plasma panels from May this year  while a plant in Himeji city is
scheduled to begin making liquid crystal display  LCDs  panels 
from January 2010 
 Panasonic also said it may withdraw from businesses that have
lost money since the financial year ended March 2007  including
operations of Sanyo Electric  a smaller rival it is set to
acquire this year for up to  9 billion 
 In November  Panasonic cut its annual net profit forecast by
90 percent and said it would book 130 billion yen in additional
restructuring costs for the year to March 
 Research firm DisplaySearch has forecast the LCD TV market to
grow 17 percent in 2009 in unit terms  slowing from a 29 percent
increase in 2008 
 Plasma TV growth is expected to suffer an even sharper
slowdown  with total market size seen growing only 5 percent in
2009 compared with a 24 percent rise in 2008  DisplaySearch said 
 Shares in Panasonic fell 1 3 percent to 1 204 yen ahead of
the announcement  The Nikkei average dipped 0 5 percent

   Falling stocks supports yen as safe haven
 By Satomi Noguchi
 TOKYO  Jan 13  Reuters    The euro dropped against the dollar
on Tuesday  under pressure near a one month low hit the previous
day as expectations mounted the European Central Bank will cut
interest rates this week 
 The euro also looked fragile against the yen near a one month
trough touched the previous day as a potential downgrade of
Spain s top  AAA  rating by Standard and Poor s heightened
worries about the euro zone s economic outlook 
  The driver of the market right now is the euro   said a
trader at a Japanese bank 
 A falling U S  stock market is a worry for the dollar  but
the market  in the near term  is likely to focus on the
deteriorating economic outlook in the euro zone   the trader
said 
 Markets expect the ECB to cut key interest rates by 50 basis
points to 2 percent on Thursday  a Reuters poll showed  Money
market futures on Monday showed investors see a 75 basis point
cut  and some were bracing for a full percentage point move 
 The euro dropped 0 4 percent from late New York trade to
 1 3308  erasing an earlier recovery and falling towards a
one month low of  1 3289 struck the previous day on trading
platform EBS 
 Against the yen  the euro bounced around 119 20 yen  within
reach of a one month low of 118 66 yen hit on Monday on EBS 
 The dollar edged up 0 3 percent against the yen to 89 45 yen 
but stayed near a three week low of 88 89 yen hit the previous
day and not far off December s 13 1 2 year trough just above 87
yen 
 Traders said falling global stock markets revived investor
risk aversion and drops in Asian shares could further prompt
investors to move away from higher yielding currencies like the
Australian dollar to the perceived low risk of the yen 
 Tokyo shares fell more than 4 percent with Sony Corp tumbling
on a report of operating loss and after concerns about massive
credit losses at Citigroup knocked U S  shares down the previous
day

 The dollar traded 0 6 percent higher against a basket of

 Yen strength pushed the euro down 1 0 percent to 119 00 yen
  The higher yielding Australian and New Zealand dollars were

currency 
 Sterling also dropped 1 1 percent against the yen as
investors continued to unwind carry trades  where the yen was
used to fund investments in higher yielding currencies 
 
 JAPAN SLIDE
 Share prices rallied on Monday on a plan announced at the
weekend by U S  President elect Barack Obama for massive
infrastructure spending to boost the economy  and anticipation
of a bailout plan for ailing U S  automakers 
 But weak Japanese growth data reinforced fears that the
world s second largest economy is facing its longest contraction
ever  forcing Sony  one of the nation s biggest electronics
makers  to cut 5 percent of its workforce as part of its
restructuring efforts 
  The harsh reality of global weakness is still coming
through in markets   said Stephen Koukoulas  strategist at TD
Securities in London 
 Investors were also wary of taking on risk as they awaited a
U S  emergency loan package for its top three automakers  while
figures late last week showed that the U S  lost more than half
a million jobs in November alone 
 Rapidly deteriorating economies have prompted central banks
to slash rates aggressively 
 The Bank of Canada is expected to cut rates by 50 basis
points from 2 25 percent later in the day  according to a

possibility of an every bigger cut

 By Nathan Layne and Kentaro Hamada
 TOKYO  Dec 9  Reuters    Japan s Sony Corp said it will cut
16 000 jobs  curb investment and pull out of businesses to save
 1 1 billion a year as the financial crisis ravages demand for
its electronics products 
 The job cuts are the biggest announced by an Asian company
so far in the crisis and underscore the challenges facing Sony 
which has fallen behind Apple Inc s iPod in portable music and
is losing money on flat TVs 
 Sony said it would cut 8 000 regular workers  or roughly 4
percent of its workforce of 185 800  and an equal number or
more temporary and contract staff 
 But analysts warned the measures may not be bold enough to
streamline a sprawling empire that ranges from semiconductors
to movies and insurance  The cuts are also risky because they
mean Sony will be investing less in future growth 
  The number sounds big  but this staff reduction won t be
enough  Sony doesn t have any core businesses that generate
stable profits   said Katsuhiko Mori  a fund manager at Daiwa
SB Investments 
  After the workforce reduction  the next thing we want to
see is what is going to be the business that will drive the
company  
 Sony is not the only one suffering  Japanese rival
Panasonic lowered its earnings forecasts last month while South
Korea s Samsung Electronics Co said on Monday it would cut
capital investment and warned of tough times 
 Sony s U S  shares  which have fallen more than 60 percent
this year  rose 2 percent to  20 45 in early trading in New
York  In Frankfurt  its shares rose 4 83 percent to 16 07
euros 
 Sony flagged the need for restructuring in October when it
more than halved its annual profit forecast  blaming slowing
demand for its Bravia liquid crystal display TVs and Cyber shot
digital cameras and a firmer yen 
 The restructuring is a setback for Chief Executive Howard
Stringer  who had implemented a major make over after taking
the helm in 2005  and until recently seemed to have put the
company on a recovery track 
 It also underlines the grim outlook for Sony and its rivals
during the year end shopping season and into next year as the
financial crisis grows into a recession that has already
engulfed the United States  parts of Europe and Japan 
  The outlook for the global economy suggests that things
would become tougher for Sony next year  and it cannot expect a
recovery without these restructuring measures   said Fujio
Ando  senior managing director at Chibagin Asset Management 
 CURRENCY IMPACT
 Sony  along with other Japanese exporters  has also been
hit hard by a surging yen against the dollar and euro  which
cuts into the value of its profits and makes its products less
competitive in overseas markets 
 Sony said it would raise prices on some electronics
products in Europe in response to the weak euro 
 South Korean competitors Samsung and LG Electronics have
found some relief in the weaker won 
 Both companies have adjusted production to cope with
falling orders and say they do not plan to cut staff  but
analysts are not so sure 
  Japanese electronics makers suffer more than their rivals
in South Korea because of the stronger yen   said Lee Min hee 
an analyst at Dongbu Securities in Seoul   But going forward 
Korean manufacturers could consider more drastic measures  
 Sony said it would delay boosting output for LCD TVs in
Slovakia and outsource production of image sensor chips  as it
aims to cut electronics investment 30 percent in the next
business year compared with a prior plan 
 It also unveiled plans to reduce its network of 57
manufacturing sites by five or six through outsourcing and by
shifting and consolidating factories to low cost areas  Earlier
this week it announced the closure of a videotape plant in
France 
 Sony said it would detail the effect of the restructuring
on earnings in its third quarter results in January  It has
already warned that it may need to revise down its profit
forecasts further due to yen strength 
 Other technology and auto manufacturers could follow suit
in the coming weeks with their own restructuring plans  raising
the prospect for industry realignment 
  Sony s restructuring might be followed by other Japanese
manufacturers  With the stronger yen  a lot more companies will
probably need to do similar reductions  There will be more
mergers  sales of units and restructuring in Japan   Daiwa SB s

 By Sachi Izumi
 TOKYO  Dec 10  Reuters    Sony Corp s  1 1 billion savings
plan for its electronics division is not enough and further
restructuring is needed  analysts said  even as its shares edged
up 1 1 percent in a broad rally of Japanese stocks 
The maker of Bravia flat TVs and PlayStation 3 video game
consoles said on Tuesday it will cut 16 000 jobs  curb investment
and pull out of some businesses to slash  1 1 billion in annual
costs as a spreading global recession ravages demand for its
electronics products 
 But analysts said further steps were needed for a sprawling
Sony empire that ranges from semiconductors to movies and
insurance and has fallen behind Apple Inc s iPod in portable
music and is losing money on flat TVs 
  My impression was that Sony would need more restructuring
steps  and yesterday s announcement was the minimum requirement  
Deutsche Securities analyst Yasuo Nakane said   The plan is still
fuzzy on details  
 Sony shares dropped more than 3 percent in their first
trading in Tokyo after the restructuring announcement but turned
around as a tentative deal to rescue U S  automakers boosted
Asian stocks 
 But Sony s rise lagged a 4 percent gain for electronics rival
Sharp Corp and a 3 2 percent gain for Tokyo s benchmark Nikkei
share average 
 Shares in Sony have plunged nearly 70 percent this year 
underperforming a 43 percent fall for the Nikkei  a slide that
has forced Sony to seek funds to repay debt convertible bonds
that will mature this month 
 Sony plans to raise more than 50 billion yen   541 million 
in bonds  an unnamed company official said  because its shares
have fallen well below the conversion price 
 The company sold 250 billion yen of convertible bonds in 2003
and set the conversion price at 5 605 yen  nearly three times
Wednesday s close of 1 917 yen 
 Investors may be more cautious to buy Sony s bonds  however 
after Moody s Investors Services changed its outlook on Sony s
debt to  stable  from  positive  on Wednesday 
 GRIM EARNINGS OUTLOOK
 Sony s fluctuating shares  after gains in New York and
Frankfurt  underlined fears for the firm s earnings in the face
of a surging yen and slowing economies around the world that are
hurting sales in the critical year end shopping season 
 The yen  which hit 13 year highs in October cuts into the
value of profits for Japanese firms such as Sony and Panasonic
Corp and makes their products less competitive in overseas
markets 
  There are many uncertainties for Sony s short term earnings 
and we could not picture Sony s earnings recovery from
yesterday s announcement   said JPMorgan analyst Yoshiharu Izumi 
  Sony will have to address plans one more time that cover all
of its operations  including the finance and game divisions  
 He said investors were disappointed that Sony s plans did not
specifically focus on its struggling TV operations 
 The restructuring is a setback for Chief Executive Howard
Stringer  who implemented a major restructuring after taking the
helm in 2005 and until recently seemed to have put the company on
a recovery track 
 The planned cut in investment could hurt Sony when the
economy and demand for electronics recover  some said 
  The restructuring symbolises a typical U S  management style
that focuses on a short term profit  and Sony could come up with
that quickly because it has a foreign president   said a fund
manager  who declined to be named 
  I would not say all of Japanese style managements are good 
but I don t see an appeal in those companies that cannot take
steps to tackle the current downturn as well as future recovery
in demand  
 Sony flagged the need for restructuring in October when it
more than halved its annual profit forecast  blaming slowing
demand for its Bravia liquid crystal display TVs and Cyber shot
digital cameras and a firmer yen 
 It now sees an operating profit of 200 billion yen   2 2
billion  in the year to March  but Reuters Estimates show the
average forecast from 14 analysts is for a one third lower profit
of 121 billion yen 
 For the business year starting next April  13 analysts see
Sony s operating profit of 161 billion yen 
 Sony said it aims to cut costs by 100 billion yen by the end
of March 2010 by slashing 8 000 regular workers  or roughly 4
percent of its work force of 185 800  and at least an equal
number of temporary and contract staff 
 It also aims to cut electronics investment by 30 percent next
business year by delaying an output hike and outsource
production  while it will also cut some manufacturing sites 
   1 92 38 Yen

 By Tony Munroe
 HONG KONG  Dec 10  Reuters    The White House and Democrats
reached tentative agreement on a rescue for the battered U S 
car industry  while global miner Rio Tinto joined a growing
list of companies slashing jobs and costs to survive the worst
global downturn in decades 
 Japanese companies slashed machinery investment in October
in another ominous sign for the world s second largest economy
and China s once scorching economy showed further signs of
cooling  with factory gate inflation collapsing in November to
2 percent  prompting fears that deflation may lie ahead 
 Rio Tinto responded to collapsing demand by saying it will
cut 14 000 jobs and reduce capital expenditure by  4 billion in
2009 as it looks to lop  10 billion off its net debt of  39
billion 
 The company said it acted in response to  the unprecedented
rapidity and severity of the global economic downturn  
 News of the auto deal  which still must be finalised and
faces sceptical Senate Republicans  sent stocks higher  with
the MSCI index of Asian stocks outside Japan up 3 4 percent and
Tokyo s Nikkei index ending 3 15 percent higher  U S  stock
futures also rose 
 The economic backdrop  however  remains grim  The plunge in
China s wholesale inflation rate further dented hopes that the
resilience there would ease the pain of recession elsewhere 
 The World Bank predicted on Wednesday that China s economy
would grow 7 5 percent next year and 8 5 percent in 2010    far
below the expected 9 4 percent for the current year and the
11 9 percent clocked in 2007 
  The situation is quite severe  We are slipping into a
deflationary recession risk pretty fast   said Isaac Meng  an
economist with BNP Paribas in Beijing 
 In a rare bit of good economic news amid a torrent of
gloom  a survey in Australia showed a surprise jump in consumer
confidence  a sign that falling interest rates and fuel prices 
combined with fiscal stimulus  are having their desired affect 
 Interest rate cuts and stimulus packages  including huge
spending plans in the United States  China and Japan  have also
given stock investors a measure confidence in recent sessions 
Asian shares traded near a month high on Wednesday 
  What we are seeing right now may be a gradual turnaround
in global stocks as liquidity in financial markets is seen
slowly improving  helped by the latest moves by governments  
said Jun Ji won  analyst at Kiwoom Com Securities in Seoul 
 In Washington  Democrats planned to bring the  15 billion
auto package to a U S  House of Representatives vote as a early
as Wednesday and send it to the Senate for consideration 
  Bipartisan hard work has paid off   said Democratic Sen 
Carl Levin of Michigan  the home state of  Big Three  car
makers General Motors Corp  Ford Motor Co and Chrysler LLC 
 The bailout is designed to allow GM and Chrysler to avert
threatened bankruptcy through March with short term loans  Ford
is not requesting immediate help but would like a line of
credit in case its finances worsen 
 RECESSION SQUEEZES JAPAN
 Japan reported that machinery orders fell 4 4 percent in
October  worse than median forecasts  while annual wholesale
price inflation slowed further in November as the price of oil
and other commodities fell 
 The latest grim economic data from Tokyo came a day after
Japan revealed that it sank deeper into recession during the
third quarter than earlier thought  adding to fears that the
country is on track for its longest ever contraction 
 Evaporating demand from overseas is battering Japan and its
exporters  On Tuesday  electronics giant Sony Corp said it
planned cut  1 1 billion in costs  including the elimination of
16 000 jobs  joining a phalanx of big companies around the
world to cut back spending 
  A recovery in the U S  housing market and private
consumption is essential for machinery orders to recover   said
Tetsuro Sawano  senior fixed income strategist with Mitsubishi
UFJ Securities in Tokyo 
 With the United States  Western Europe and Japan all in
recession  the emerging and developing economies were set to
suffer a sharp slowdown  the World Bank warned on Tuesday 
 Even though a recession in most developing countries was
unlikely  below potential growth of some 4 5 percent will feel
like one with job losses and factory closures  the lender said 
 In Australia  a survey of 1 200 consumers by Westpac
Banking Corp and the Melbourne Institute showed a 7 5 percent
jump in consumer confidence  The report suggested monetary and
fiscal stimulus was finally working  in contrast to many big
economies where confidence was at or near record lows 
  While there are enormous challenges    notably an
impending rise in unemployment    300 basis points of rate cuts
with more to come will see Australia fare better than many
other countries   said Su Lin Ong  a senior economist at RBC

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON  Dec 9  Reuters    World stocks slipped from the
previous day s three week high on Tuesday after dire corporate
news and economic data prompted investors to shift their focus
back to the worsening state of the global economy 
 Stocks and other risky assets got a fillip on Monday after
U S  President elect Barack Obama outlined plans at the weekend
for the largest infrastructure investment since the 1950s and
hopes grew for a rescue plan for U S  automakers 
 But news of job cuts at Sony  revenue forecast downgrades
from Texas Instruments and National Semiconductor Corp  and weak
economy data from Japan fanned concerns about the already
deteriorating global economy 
 On Monday  U S  stocks hit their highest level in a month 
pushing the S P index into positive territory for the month 
  Wall Street shares rose on expectations  but things haven t
gotten any better  In fact  the indicators are so bad they could
hardly be worse   said Yutaka Miura  senior technical analyst at
Shinko Securities in Tokyo 
  Certainly we do have economic policies  but we still don t
know exactly what this will result in  and the situation of the
U S  carmakers has yet to be resolved  This uncertainty is
hitting the dollar and then stocks  
MSCI world equity index fell half a percent while the
FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 1 4 percent on the day 
 Emerging stocks fell 0 3 percent 
 U S  crude oil fell 0 75 percent to  43 39 a barrel after
rallying 7 percent the previous day

  Bond yields could drop in the near future if central banks

Henderson Global Investors said in a note to clients 
  Except in the worst scenarios  bonds are not good value on

second half of next year  
 The dollar rose half a percent against a basket of major

 LONDON  Dec 9  Reuters    The yen rose broadly on Tuesday 
even against an otherwise buoyant dollar  recovering from losses
suffered the previous day as investors refocused on evidence of
global economic weakness 
 Demand for risk was low after figures earlier on Tuesday
showed the Japanese economy contracted 0 5 percent in
July September  far more than an initial reading of a 0 1
percent decrease  Japanese technology company Sony Corp also
announced major layoffs 
 The yen rallied nonetheless  as risk aversion prompted
investors to continue dumping currencies perceived as being
higher risk in favour of the low yielding Japanese unit 
 The risk averse theme rippled through stock markets  with
European shares falling 0 8 percent in early trade 
  The harsh reality of global weakness is still coming
through in markets   said Stephen Koukoulas  strategist at TD
Securities in London 
 The euro fell 0 6 percent to  1 2860 by 0900 GMT  pulling
back from  1 2968 hit on Monday  according to electronic trading
platform EBS  its strongest level since late November 
 The dollar traded half a percent higher against a basket of
currencies at 86 120  but it fell 0 6 percent to 92 34 yen 
 The yen rallied across the board  pushing the euro down 1 5
percent to 118 50 yen  The high yielding Australian and New
Zealand dollars fell nearly 3 percent against the yen 
 Sterling dropped 1 5 percent against the yen as investors
continued to unwind carry trades  where the yen was used to fund
investments in higher yielding currencies 
 Analysts said the market was awaiting a reading of German
business sentiment at 1000 GMT  The German ZEW index is forecast
to fall to  55 0 in December from  53 5 in November 
 
 JAPAN SLIDE
 Share prices slumped after rallying on Monday on a plan
announced at the weekend by U S  President elect Barack Obama
for massive infrastructure spending to boost the economy  and
anticipation of a bailout plan for ailing U S  automakers 
 But weak Japanese growth data reinforced fears that the
world s second largest economy is facing its longest contraction
ever  forcing Sony  one of the nation s biggest electronics
makers  to cut 5 percent of its workforce as part of its
restructuring efforts 
 Investors were also wary of taking on risk as they awaited a
U S  emergency loan package for its top three automakers  while
figures late last week showed that the U S  lost more than half
a million jobs in November alone 
 Rapidly deteriorating economies have prompted central banks
to slash rates aggressively 
 The Bank of Canada is expected to cut rates by 50 basis
points from 2 25 percent later in the day  according to a
Reuters poll  although some in the market are bracing the
possibility of an every bigger cut

114471,335986,SNE,UPDATE 5 Circuit City files for bankruptcy protection,news," Adds court approval of financing 
 By Karen Jacobs
 ATLANTA  Nov 10  Reuters    Circuit City Stores Inc  the
No  2 U S  consumer electronics retailer  filed for bankruptcy
on Monday just weeks before the start of the holiday shopping
season  becoming the largest retailer to file for Chapter 11
since Kmart in 2002 
 Circuit City fell victim to tighter credit terms from
vendors  a dwindling cash position and decreased consumer
spending amid a deepening economic crisis 
 The filing comes one week after the 59 year old retailer
said it would close 155 U S  stores  or more than one fifth of
its retail base  and cut 17 percent of its U S  work force 
 The retailer and 17 affiliates filed for protection from
creditors in U S  bankruptcy court in Richmond  Virginia  where
it is based  Its Canadian operations also filed for creditor
protection in an Ontario court 
 Analysts said there was now a possibility the company would
close more U S  stores as it negotiates to exit costly leases
in Chapter 11 
  Don t rule anything out yet   said Jefferies   Co analyst
Dan Binder   You could go away  you could restructure to
something smaller  maybe somebody buys the brand and a couple
hundred stores and maybe it ends up a regional player  
 The company could face an uphill struggle to reorganize and
emerge from bankruptcy since credit is tight and consumer
spending has plummeted 
  It has a lot to do with the macroeconomic crisis in the
world right now   said Aravindh Vanchesan  program manager for
the retail systems group at consulting firm Frost   Sullivan 
 Right now  customers are cutting back on spending  
 U S  home goods retailer Linens  n Things tried to maintain
operations by closing a portion of its stores after its May
Chapter 11 filing  but finally liquidated altogether  Last
week  smaller electronics chain Tweeter filed Chapter 11 and
said it was holding store closing sales 
 RECENT LAYOFFS
 Circuit City received court approval for a  1 1 billion
debtor in possession revolving credit facility that would
provide critical liquidity while it reorganizes 
 The financing is provided by the lenders of Circuit City s
current asset based credit facility and enables it to pay
vendors and other business partners in the ordinary course for
goods and services received after the filing 
  These approvals will help position us for a more
successful holiday selling season and allow us to operate our
business and serve our valued guests without interruption  said
James Marcum  vice chairman  acting president and chief
executive officer of Circuit City  in a statement 
 Circuit City expressed hope it would be able to emerge from
Chapter 11 in the first half of 2009 
 In a filing  the company said 1 300 workers were laid off
on Nov  7  That day  the Richmond newspaper reported that
hundreds of workers had been let go from company headquarters 
 The Chapter 11 filing caps a tough two years for the
company  which posted losses for five of the past six quarters
and faced a proxy contest from a major shareholder this year 
Movie rental firm Blockbuster Inc withdrew a takeover bid for
Circuit City in July 
 The company s stock has plunged 99 percent since January

 SUPPLIER SQUEEZE
 In recent weeks  suppliers pinched by the global credit
crunch have tightened terms  sometimes requiring upfront
payment from Circuit City before shipping goods 
 Industry leader Best Buy Co  discounter Wal Mart Stores and
regional retailers such as hhgregg are expected to benefit from
electronics store closures in the longer term  analysts have
said 
 But the flood of discounted merchandise from liquidating
Circuit City stores could hurt Best Buy this holiday shopping
season  which is expected to be one of the bleakest in recent
years as consumers grapple with rising unemployment and the
soft economy 
  Longer term  you ve got Best Buy  who s dominant in the
sector  taking share  But in the short run it could feel the
pain of the liquidation activity   Binder said

assets and  2 32 billion of debt as of Aug  31  and more than
100 000 creditors
