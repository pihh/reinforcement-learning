199893,421409,OXY,Has Occidental Petroleum Suffered Enough ,news,"Occidental Petroleum  NYSE OXY  entered 2019 with loads of upside potential  The energy giant was coming off a transitional year during which it completed its cash flow breakeven plan  As a result  it only needed oil to average  40 a barrel to support its operations and its high yielding dividend  With crude starting the year well above that level  Occidental appeared poised to generate lots of excess cash  Indeed  it looked to me like the top oil stock to buy heading into 2019 
However  instead of sitting back and watching the cash flow in as oil prices rose during the year  Occidental went on the offensive and paid a pretty penny to wrestle rival Anadarko Petroleum away from Chevron  NYSE CVX   It was a move that infuriated shareholders as it added a substantial amount of debt to Occidental s balance sheet  That weight caused the stock to tumble 33  on the year 
In the wake of that slump  the question now is whether Occidental has suffered enough  or if further declines could still be ahead 

Why the worst could be over
Occidental Petroleum laid out a whopping  55 billion for Anadarko  outbidding Chevron by  5 billion  However  in a relatively unusual move for a megamerger  Occidental didn t issue a lot of stock to finance the deal  To do that would have required a shareholder vote that it likely would have lost  Instead  it funded the majority of the transaction with cash     31 8 billion overall    which meant taking on a substantial amount of debt  
Occidental aims to pay down that debt burden by selling between  10 billion and  15 billion in assets  and it has made significant progress on that front   We are highly confident that the actions we already have in progress will allow us to exceed the upper end of our original  10  billion  to  15 billion divestiture goal by the middle of 2020   said CEO Vicki Hollob in a mid November update  If everything goes according to plan  Occidental will significantly reduce its balance sheet issues  which should help lift the main weight holding down its stock  
In addition to that  oil prices have risen considerably over the past year  Crude ended 2019 up more than 35   with U S  benchmark WTI closing above  61 per barrel  If crude oil remains in its current neighborhood  the company should generate significantly more cash flow in the coming year  which it can use to support its dividend as well as further pay off debt  
Finally  the main reason Occidental bought Anadarko is that it believed that there were significant synergies to be found in combining the two companies  operations  Management expects to be able to cut out  3 5 billion of annual expenses by 2021  Progress toward that goal would help prove to skeptical investors that it made the right move  

Why rough seas could still be ahead
While Occidental Petroleum still asserts that it can hit the high end of its asset sales target  the process has proved more complicated than initially expected  One major piece of the puzzle is the planned sale of Anadarko s African assets to French energy giant Total  NYSE TOT   While the companies completed one part of the transaction  Occidental ran into a roadblock with the deal for Anadarko s Algerian assets  that country s national oil company is trying to block the transaction  
In addition to that  Occidental wanted to monetize some of its stake in Anadarko s former midstream arm  Western Midstream  NYSE WES   However  a slump in Western s valuation forced Occidental to put the process on hold  While Western Midstream s valuation has bounced back a bit  it s still down 29  over the past year  This leaves Occidental with a dilemma    either sell Western shares at a fire sale price  or fail to hit its assets sales target  If it s the second option  investors  concerns over Occidental s financial profile would likely intensify  which could lead to a further slide in its share price  
Also  Occidental s fortunes naturally are tied to the price of oil  While crude was red hot last year  it could give back some of its gains in 2020 as new supply enters the market  
Either headwind would be bad for this energy company  But if both occur  it might need to slash its 7 7  yielding dividend to shore up its finances  Add it all up  and more suffering could be ahead for Occidental s shareholders ",2020-01-03,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pd5s9,2051986

199895,421411,OXY,Occidental to cut Western Midstream stake to reduce debt,news,"By Shariq Khan and Arunima Kumar
 Reuters    Occidental Petroleum Corp  N OXY  said on Monday it would cut its majority stake in pipeline operator Western Midstream Partners LP  N WES  to less than 50  in 2020  to reduce its debt that grew significantly with the Anadarko Petroleum Corp  NYSE APC  deal 
Occidental s shares rose about 4  on the news  having lost over 30  in value since the  38 billion offer for Anadarko was made public on April 24  2019 
Occidental is working to pare  40 billion of debt it took on with the Anadarko deal  and changes to ownership would ease a sale or spin off of Western Midstream 
The restructuring would also allow Occidental to no longer show the gas pipeline and processing business s debt as its own 
The net long term debt for Occidental was  47 6 billion as of Sept  31  2019 
The deal  which has been called  hugely overpriced  by activist investor Carl Icahn  continues to weigh on Occidental s shares  which still trade at levels it touched during the financial downturn of 2008 
Inherited as part of the Anadarko takeover  the sale of the Western Midstream stake is a key part of Occidental s target to raise a total of  15 billion from asset sales by mid 2020 
Occidental has raised about  10 5 billion through sales of properties  including a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique and oil production elsewhere in Africa 
Western Midstream currently trades at a market value of over  9 billion 
The restructuring of the Western Midstream agreements will put Occidental back on track to hive off the business  something it tried to do unsuccessfully last year 
 I don t view the plans to reduce its ownership level to below 50  in 2020 as surprising  It s likely just a first step towards monetizing more of its ownership position over time   said Jennifer Rowland  an analyst with Edward Jones 
Occidental on Sunday gave up over 9 million shares  or a 2  stake in Western Midstream s general partner  and allowed limited partners to remove Occidental and appoint a new general partner  Occidental fully owns the general partner stake  which effectively controls Western Midstream  a master limited partnership  and around 55  of the pipeline operator s limited partner units

HOUSTON NEW YORK  Reuters    Jefferies Financial Group has laid off 15 people in its energy investment banking team  as the bank reacts to a slowdown of mergers and acquisitions activity among oil and gas companies  sources familiar with the matter said on Friday 
The job cuts were concentrated within the group that focuses on sales of acreage and smaller assets  known in the industry as the Acquisitions and Divestitures  A D  team  and were predominantly junior staff helping with technical roles  according to three of the sources

Dealflow involving oil and gas exploration and production companies has slumped this year to its lowest level in a decade  excluding the large acquisition by Occidental Petroleum Corp  NYSE OXY  of Anadarko Petroleum Corp  NYSE APC  
The slowdown comes as shareholders  unhappy with years of substandard returns from their investments in oil and gas  have pushed companies to eschew growth and focus on developing existing positions  and cost cutting   all aimed at boosting the amount of cash given back to investors

199939,421455,OXY,These 3 Stocks Can Bounce Back in 2020  Say Analysts,opinion,The oft repeated mantra of  buy low  sell high  makes perfect sense  but the execution of said instruction is a lot harder than it suggests  We humans are naturally inclined to latch on to a winning horse  rather than back those languishing behind However  as anyone with knowledge of the investing game will tell you  going against the grain is often the way to maximize returns  In the ever changing marketplace  some stocks have fallen on hard times for a variety of reasons like disappointing earnings  removal of a CEO and macro trends  all of which can impact investors  confidence in a company s ability to deliver  But often  the cycle will turn  and a recovery will occur  so long as the fundamentals remain strong enough With these thoughts as a starting point  we used TipRanks  Stock Screener to find 3 tickers the Street thinks are about to execute a turnaround in 2020 after falling on hard times over the last year  Let s take a closer look at what we uncovered Schlumberger Limited  SLB A big player in oilfield services  Schlumberger has endured a roller coaster 12 months  gaining and losing its share price intermittently  Ultimately  though  over the last year  SLB stock has lost 24   the bulk of which it recently shed in January Companies in the oil industry are heavily subjected to the impact of macrotrends  The energy sector was recently affected by the outbreak of the coronavirus in China  The virus has restricted people s movement  which in turn causes a decrease in the amount of fuel purchased  This  naturally  exerts downward pressure on energy stocks Schulmberger s recent earnings report was a mixed affair  too  Despite reporting Q4 revenue that exceeded expectations  the company posted a  10 1 billion loss in 2019  Driven mostly by land market weaknesses  North American revenues fell 10  year over year to  10 8 billion  SLB s Q4 revenue dropped quarter over quarter by 4   too Nevertheless  following a recent meeting with the company s CEO  RBC s Kurt Hallead came away impressed  The analyst believes the company has  a compelling case for margin improvement and free cash flow generation   Acceleration in global energy expenditures  rebound in high margin offshore drilling activity and a greater than expected increase in international exploration  completion and production activity are potential catalysts according to Hallead Additionally  Hallead highlights SLB s commitment to the dividend  the company pays a  2 annual dividend with a yield of 5 97    more than double the average of S P 500 companies  The analyst concluded   We continue to see SLB as a through cycle core holding for large cap energy investors  Given our outlook for an improving international market dynamic  we believe SLB is fundamentally well positioned to outperform during 2020  Taking all of this into consideration  Hallead reiterated an Outperform on the energy giant  At his  40 price target  a 19  twelve month gain could be in the cards   To watch Hallead s track record  click here And what about the rest of the Street  It sees SLB drilling for more gains  too  9 Buys and 2 Holds add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating  The average price target outstrips Hallead s and comes in at  43 55  implying upside potential of 31  over the coming months   See Schlumberger stock analysis on TipRanks Halliburton Company  HAL Staying in the same  oil  field  we drill deeper into one of the world s largest oil field service companies  Halliburton  Closely mirroring Schlumberger s performance  over the last 12 months  HAL s share price has lost 30   The downtrend stretches back three years now  a period in which HAL stock has declined by over 60   According to RBC s Hallead  who covers HAL  too   2020 will see a reverse of the trend Like SLB  Halliburton has been affected by recent macrotrends and similarly  the company s latest earnings report exhibited a decline in North American revenues  The outlook confirms business in the region won t get any stronger in 2020  but drilling activity will continue to rise in the international markets and should positively impact Halliburton s earnings Hallead thinks so  too  The analyst argues that increased activity  pricing power and HAL s ability to compete for high margin services  should lead to international margin expansion in 2020   The highest growth is expected in the Asia Pacific region followed by Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States  Middle East and Latin America  All of these will lead to  similar margin progression as 2019  The analyst said   We are increasing our 2020E 21E EPS to  1 29  1 63 from  1 17   1 47  The primary driver is adjustments to C P  completion and production  revenue and margin progression  We continue to see HAL as a through cycle core holding for large cap energy investors given improving international markets and a better than group average return profile  So  what s the bottom line  Hallead sided with the bulls  keeping his Outperform rating as is  He also bumped up the price target from  23 to  25  representing potential gains of 16  in the year ahead The Street agrees  HAL s Strong Buy consensus rating breaks down into 8 Buys and 2 Holds  Should the average price target of  27 33 be met over the next 12 months  investors stand to take home gains in the shape of 26    See Halliburton stock analysis on TipRanks Occidental Petroleum  OXY Lastly  we come across another big player in the energy sector  Occidental Petroleum

and Chile The past 12 months also haven t been kind to OXY  In fact  OXY s share price over the last year exhibits the worst performance of all three   a downturn in the shape of 40   The nadir was reached in December  when the share price hit  37 25  the lowest it has been since 2005  The market has been unforgiving to OXY due to the company s high debt load  investors were unhappy in 2019

199942,421458,OXY,How Total s CEO pounced on Anadarko s African energy assets,news,"By Bate Felix PARIS  Reuters    It took Total s chief executive and a small group of advisers just days to line up the French energy major s biggest acquisition in almost two decades when it agreed to buy the African assets of U S  firm Anadarko  Patrick Pouyanne pounced after Occidental  NYSE OXY  Corp trumped Chevron s  33 billion bid for Anadarko in April with an offer that includes raising financing by selling some of Anadarko s operations worth up to  15 billion  By keeping those in the know to a minimum  the French CEO was able to stay flexible in negotiations  take a swift decision and ensure there were no leaks until the binding deal worth  8 8 billion was announced on Sunday  a Total source said   Pouyanne proceeded in the same way he did with previous deals  a restricted task force  no bankers and no external counsel   another source  close to the deal  told Reuters  Throwing out the rulebook that expects CEOs to be surrounded by investment bankers and other advisers when dealmaking has become a trademark for the 55 year old CEO and chairman of Total  who took the helm of the French energy major in 2014  He has surprised investors with his acquisitions  such as buying Maersk s oil and gas business in 2017 and Engie s upstream LNG operations in 2018  setting one deal in motion after an unsolicited phone call with the controlling shareholder  His strategy  which one analyst has called  opportunistic   has rapidly lifted Total s growth outlook  Total has made acquisitions worth almost  20 billion in the past five years  under Pouyanne s leadership  But the buying spree has increased debt and left its shares lagging rivals  such as Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  and  BP   LON BP   His manner can also come across as brash  and industry sources say it was one reason a deal to buy a Libyan oilfield stake has now run into a roadblock  Oil Majors  share performance   HEAVENLY MATCH Pouyanne s move to buy Anadarko s assets  the French firm s biggest acquisition since taking over Elf almost two decades ago  will add 5 percent to Total s output by 2025  said Bernstein analysts  who rate Total s shares  outperform   The assets stretching from Algeria to South Africa bolster his effort to refocus Total on operations in Africa  the North Sea  deep offshore and liquefied natural gas  LNG   The deal depends on Occidental  Oxy  completing the Anadarko merger   Pouyanne quickly understood that it could be a match made in heaven because Oxy was mainly focused on Anadarko s Permian assets  And Pouyanne has repeatedly said he was not interested in Permian   a source close to the deal said  referring to the Permian Basin where the U S  shale oil industry is concentrated  Total has built up a strong balance sheet under Pouyanne since the 2014 oil price crash  giving him the firepower to swoop on Anadarko s assets  But Total was also able to act swiftly because it has long had its eye on those African operations   Total was already familiar with Anadarko s portfolio  At some point  they took a closer look at Anadarko s assets  particularly in Africa  There were some discussions  but they did not go any further   an industry source said  Another source said Anadarko had been looking for a partner for its Mozambique LNG project to tap an estimated 75 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas  Two days after Occidental announced its bid for Anadarko on April 24  Oxy s corporate jet was on the tarmac in Paris  UNDER WRAPS Both firms declined to comment on the reason for the jet s flight to Paris  although an industry source told Reuters the jet was flown in for a meeting with Total  Another source familiar with the matter said Occidental Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub had flown in with another executive  without telling anybody  to discuss Anadarko s African assets with Total   Of course they  Total  had already thought about it  And I think they reached out to her and said  Hey Vicki  if you happen to win this  we would really be interested    the second source said   She did not let the phone get cold  She left and flew to Paris overnight  met with them and heard their deal   Occidental did not comment on the account  A banking source said this deal was not the first time Total had held talks without bankers in the room  The source said it made sense in this case because Total did not need financing and wanted to make a quick decision  The deal is also not the first to take investors by surprise  Pouyanne first made a splash in 2017 with the purchase of Maersk s energy business for  7 5 billion after an unsolicited bid made in a phone call to Ane Maersk Mc Kinney Uggla  chairwoman of the A P  Moller Foundation  which has a controlling stake  a corporate source said   The deal was unplanned but it was a good fit  A banker gave Patrick the idea and he made it happen   the source said  Maersk could not immediately be reached for comment  But Pouyanne s manner does not always win over partners  When he boasted to a U S  energy conference about the benefits to Total of his deal to buy a  450 million stake in a Libyan field from  Marathon Oil   NYSE MRO  last year  Libya s state owned National Oil Corporation sought to re negotiate terms  concerned it was too much of a bargain  industry sources said  
Total has said it was in talks with Libyan authorities to resolve financial issues over the deal  NOC could not immediately be reached for comment ",2019-05-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/how-totals-ceo-pounced-on-anadarkos-african-energy-assets-1862574,1862574
199948,421464,OXY,Occidental seen as a rare victory for hedge funds tracking corporate jets,news,"By Carl O Donnell  Reuters    Hedge funds paying upward of  100 000 per year to track the flights of corporate jets were vindicated when Occidental Petroleum Corp  NYSE OXY  announced two deals last week that matched locations the U S  oil and gas company s private plane had recently visited  Yet Occidental s example may represent the exception rather than the rule  Tracking corporate jets often fuels speculation that makes predicting where a company s next deal may come from harder rather than easier  according to several hedge fund analysts interviewed by Reuters    Historically  flight tracking services have not been that useful   said one hedge fund analyst who asked not to be named because he was not permitted to speak with the media   But they hit two home runs back to back on Occidental  which makes them look pretty good right now   Research firm Gordon Haskett Research Advisors wrote a note on April 29 speculating that Warren Buffet s investment firm  Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  Inc may be preparing to invest in Occidental  citing data from Quandl  which tracks corporate jet flights and identified Occidental s plane as visiting Buffett s hometown of Omaha   The following day  Berkshire announced a  10 billion cash infusion into Occidental to back its  38 billion cash and stock offer for Anadarko Petroleum Corp  NYSE APC   Last week  a flight by Occidental s jet to Paris preceded an announcement that Occidental planned to sell  8 8 billion worth of Anadarko s assets in Africa to  Total  SA  PA TOTF   Occidental did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the correlation between the deals and the routes of its corporate jets  Flight tracking services have been gaining prominence  partly because they helped some hedge funds foresee Johnson   Johnson s  30 billion acquisition of drugmaker Actelion in 2017  but their track record before and after this success has been somewhat spotty  Corporations can evade monitoring by hedge funds by scheduling deal related meetings in locations where neither the target or acquirer are headquartered or by using jet leasing services like NetJets Inc   the luxury plane unit of Buffett s Berkshire   rather than flying their own private planes  And even when hedge funds do dredge up usable data  there is no guarantee that a corporate flight out to a particular city means that the company intends to do a deal there

199949,421465,OXY,Oil   Gas US Integrated Industry Outlook Upbeat On Upstream,opinion,The Zacks  industry comprises companies that are mostly involved in upstream and midstream energy businesses  The upstream operations entail oil and natural gas exploration and production in the prolific shale plays of the United States The integrated energy companies are also engaged in midstream businesses through their gathering and processing facilities along with transportation pipeline networks and storage sites Overall  the upstream business is positively correlated to oil and natural gas prices  The produced commodity volumes are then transported through midstream assets  leading to stable fee based revenues Here are the industry s three major themes West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude has recovered significantly and is now trading above the  60 a barrel mark  In fact  more upside awaits oil prices in 2020 as its demand outlook is improving  since tensions between the United States and China are easing and global supply is shrinking  with OPEC agreeing to deepen oil production cut  The positive crude pricing scenario is highly favorable for oil exploration and production businesses  Rising demand for cleaner energy has been backing export volumes of natural gas from the United States  Notably  since it will take time to replace oil by alternative sources of energy  export volumes of the commodity are likely to rise steadily in the coming years  Thus  natural gas explorers and producers are well positioned to capitalize on domestic and global clean energy needs  Moreover  for the first time since government monthly records began in 1949  the United States has established itself as a net petroleum exporter  This is because in September  America s exported volumes of oil and petroleum products were more than imported  per data provided by U S  Energy Information Administration  Thus  to support growing oil and gas production in the U S  shale plays  there is heightened demand for the companies  fresh midstream infrastructure to gather  store  process and transport the commodities Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Encouraging ProspectsThe Zacks Oil   Gas US Integrated industry is an eight stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  56  which places it in the top 22  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group

Industry Lags Sector and S P 500The Zacks Oil   Gas US Integrated industry has lagged the broader Zacks Oil   Energy sector as well as the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past year The industry has lost 12 7  over this period against the S P 500 s rally of 28 4  and the broader sector s increase of 2 7  in the same timeframe One Year Price PerformanceIndustry s Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt laden  it makes sense to value them based on the EV EBITDA  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  ratio  This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt On the basis of the trailing 12 month enterprise value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  ratio  the industry is currently trading at 5 75X  lower than the S P 500 s 11 93X  It is  however  above the sector s trailing 12 month EV EBITDA of 5 01X Over the past two years  the industry has traded as high as 10 53X  as low as 3 55X  with a median of 5 56X Trailing 12 Month Enterprise Value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  RatioBottom LineTo sum up  the upstream business seams lucrative since the commodity pricing environment is expected to remain favorable The midstream business front looks attractive as well  backing the bullish outlook for the industry  Notably  Permian  which is the most prolific basin in the United States  is still facing a pipeline bottleneck problem  To solve the shortage in transportation capacities  major energy players have  fresh pipeline networks online  Thus  integrated energy firms are poised to gain from the existing

The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Marathon Oil has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Occidental Petroleum has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that MRO has an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
MRO currently has a forward P E ratio of 19 36  while OXY has a forward P E of 23 33  We also note that MRO has a PEG ratio of 2 49  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  OXY currently has a PEG ratio of 4 67 
Another notable valuation metric for MRO is its P B ratio of 0 89  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  OXY has a P B of 1 18

199968,421484,OXY,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Kinder Morgan s 2020 Plans  Chesapeake s Debt Financing   More,opinion,"It was a week where oil futures rose sharply as OPEC and its allies promised deeper production cuts next month  Natural gas also got a slight nudge higher 
On the news front  midstream operator Kinder Morgan Inc    NYSE KMI   set its investment budget for 2020 at  2 4 billion  down 23  from its projected spending this year  Meanwhile  shares of Chesapeake Energy Corp    NYSE CHK   surged after the energy explorer came up with debt financing deals to boost its financial flexibility     
Overall  it was a good week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures climbed 7 3  to close at  59 20 per barrel  while natural gas prices rose 2 3  for the week to finish at 2 334 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   
The U S  crude benchmark marked the highest settlement since September after the OPEC  group announced cutting output by as much as 500 000 barrels per day from Jan 1 for three months  This is in addition to the existing production curbs of 1 2 million barrels per day by OPEC  Russia and other non member oil producers  A data report showing a much bigger than expected drawdown in domestic oil inventories  ending several consecutive weeks of builds  also helped oil prices 
Meanwhile  natural gas prices were boosted by expectations of colder weather over the Midwest and east during the next few days that could buoy power sector demand for the heating fuel 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories
1  Kinder Morgan recently provided a glimpse of its financial expectations for 2020  The midstream energy player projects distributable cash flow  DCF  for 2020 at  5 1 billion  roughly 3  higher than its 2019 DCF forecast  The company expects higher contributions from existing projects  expansion developments  increased tariffs and lower interest rates to back growth in DCF   a key metric for any midstream infrastructure provider 
Kinder Morgan also reaffirmed its plan to raise annual dividend for 2020 to  1 25 per share  suggesting a year over year increment of 25   The company added that it will be able to fully finance the dividend payments with internally generated cashflow 
Moreover  the company announced its 2020 capital budget for growth projects and joint venture contributions  Kinder Morgan is planning to spend  2 4 billion in 2020  suggesting a decline from  3 1 billion budget in 2019   Read more  
2    Chesapeake Energy surged more than 16  on Dec 4  after the struggling upstream energy player announced the securement of debt financing to boost its financial flexibility 
Last month  the company warned investors in its 10 Q statement that it doubts its ability to continue as a going concern  Chesapeake added in the statement that it could be difficult to conform to the leverage ratio covenant in the coming 12 months if the pricing scenario of crude oil and natural gas continues to be unfavorable 
Investors cheered Chesapeake s recent debt financing initiatives owing to which the stock jumped roughly 32  from the 25 year low closing price of 56 cents on Nov 19  Chesapeake announced the engagement of several banks  including JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   for arranging a  1 5 billion term loan facility  Notably  the term of the secured first lien loan is 4 5 years   Read more  
3    BP plc  LON BP    NYSE BP   announced its decision to raise its stake in Lightsource BP  With a 7  additional stake  the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  British integrated energy giant has boosted its ownership interest in the European solar developer to 50  from the prior 43  
You can see  
Notably  Lightsource was rebranded to Lightsource BP after BP had taken over a 43  stake in December 2017  Thus  with the purchase of the business  newly issued equity  BP has become a joint venture partner  However  no financial details relating to the transaction have been provided by either company 
The recent move reflects BP s intention of boosting capital spending on renewable power business as most oil companies in Europe have decided to combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas and carbon emissions and focusing on clean energy   Read more  
4    Suncor Energy   NYSE SU   recently released its capital budget along with production guidance for 2020  For next year  it will concentrate more on investing in projects with higher yields that are immune to volatile commodity prices and pipeline constraints  It will emphasize to a greater extent on value than volume  Further  the company s capital expenditure program is set to primarily focus on projects that will drive its  2 billion incremental free funds flow target by 2023 
Suncor expects its overall net production for 2020 in the range of 800 000 840 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  Boe d   This indicates a 5  increase from the mid point of the company s 2019 guided range for overall net production 
For 2020  this Alberta based integrated player s total capex is envisioned in the range of C 5 4 C 6 billion  It estimates to disburse in the range of C 4 55 C 4 95 billion for the upstream segment  Moreover  the company has plans to spend C 700 C 800 million on its downstream operations in 2019 while the corporate spending is assumed in the C 150 C 250 million bracket   Read more  
5    In a bid to bounce back from the controlled spending by oil and gas producers due to weak prices  Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL   is slashing headcount by nearly 800 at its El Reno operation in Oklahoma  Further  it is set to close its office in the suburbs of the same city  Haliburton also plans to lay off nearly 70 workers from its Bakersfield plant in California  attributable to the slowdown in oil and gas drilling activity 
These strategic moves come within two months of the company s announcement of retrenching 650 employees across four states  namely New Mexico  Wyoming  North Dakota and Colorado  This Houston based oilfield service provider realized that in order to enhance its operating efficiency despite challenging market conditions  it has to lower costs substantially 
Halliburton previously noted that for operators in North America where oil production hit record levels  it s more about returns now and not growth  The volatility in commodity price convinced explorers and producers to adopt a relatively conservative approach to capital expenditure programs  This shift in customer strategy is likely to induce subdued demand for oilfield services and equipment  putting much pressure on the pricing  Read more

199979,421495,OXY,Earnings Preview  Occidental Petroleum  OXY  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Occidental Petroleum  OXY  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 4  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas exploration and production company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 40 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  77 4  
Revenues are expected to be  5 29 billion  down 14 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 48 67  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Occidental 
For Occidental  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Occidental will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Occidental would post earnings of  0 91 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 97  delivering a surprise of  6 59  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Occidental doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-occidental-petroleum-oxy-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200479043,200479043

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  73 17   A quarter ago  it was expected that this oil and gas exploration and production company would post earnings of  0 91 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 97  delivering a surprise of 6 59  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Occidental  which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Integrated   United States industry  posted revenues of  5 87 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 18   This compares to year ago revenues of  6 18 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Occidental shares have lost about 34  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 21 2  
What s Next for Occidental 
While Occidental has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Occidental was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 25 on  6 46 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  2 41 on  20 67 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

199993,421509,OXY,Should Value Investors Consider Occidental Petroleum  OXY  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Occidental Petroleum Corporation   NYSE OXY   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE Ratio A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Occidental Petroleum has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 55  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 01  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Occidental Petroleum s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Oil   Energy sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 12 97  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that Occidental Petroleum has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 86  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Occidental Petroleum has a P S ratio of about 1 69  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 18 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  OXY is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Occidental Petroleum currently has a Zacks Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Occidental Petroleum a solid choice for value investors    What About the Stock Overall    Though Occidental Petroleum might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of D  This gives OXY a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores    Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen seven estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction while the current year estimate has seen nine downward revision compared to no upward in the same time period      This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 25 9  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has declined by 13 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Occidental Petroleum Corporation Price and Consensus    Despite the bearish analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  Occidental Petroleum is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front However  with a sluggish industry rank  among bottom 29  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Oil and Gas   Integrated   United States industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report

199995,421511,OXY,Cracks Appear in Record U S  Oil Growth as Shale Slows for Now,news," Bloomberg     Cracks are emerging in the U S  oil machine 
Shale oil s relentless production growth is easing  with growth next month set to be the weakest since May  according to the Energy Information Administration  Increases in the Permian Basin  the largest area  will also be the slowest in nine months 
That would be a boon for OPEC  which is trying to boost crude prices but faces an immense challenge from companies pumping unprecedented amounts of oil in the U S  Drilling activity in America has also been slowing  with the oil rig count plunging the most in almost three years last week  as the effects of the price slump at the end of 2018 linger 
The price crash  hurt many of those companies and now is having consequences for expectations of U S  shale oil output   said Phil Flynn  senior market analyst at Price Futures Group Inc 
There are other signs of a slowdown  The amount of crude produced by new wells in three of the biggest shale plays has been declining for at least a year 
The Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico    among the fastest growing shale plays    will produce 555 barrels a day of crude per rig in February  according to the EIA s latest drilling report  That s the same as in January  which was the lowest since August 2017 and compares with a record high 758 barrels a day in 2016  The Bakken and Eagle Ford plays have experienced similar slowdowns 
Shale remains a spectacular success story  and has often beaten pessimistic predictions  It has taken the U S  close to energy independence    unthinkable even 15 years ago    and turned the oil world upside down  Total American output could even exceed Russia and Saudi Arabia combined by 2025  according to consultant Rystad Energy AS 
Still  crude s steepest fourth quarter decline since 2014 and pipeline bottlenecks are having an impact  The number of shale wells that are being started but not completed is rising  and will likely continue to increase until oil rises further or infrastructure constraints ease 
Much of whether shale will continue to top forecasts or finally take a breather will ultimately depend on oil prices  Crude s volatility has unnerved investors  who are  much more cautious now  than they were previously  Occidental Petroleum Corp  NYSE OXY   Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub said in Davos  Switzerland on Wednesday 
 Not as much money is going to be pouring into the Permian basin   she said   There s going to be more discipline around how the Permian reacts to pricing  ",2019-01-24,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/cracks-appear-in-record-us-oil-growth-as-shale-slows-for-now-1756200,1756200

What s Next for Occidental

OXY will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release  which is expected to be July 31  2019  On that day  OXY is projected to report earnings of  1 07 per share  which would represent a year over year decline of 2 73   Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of  4 46 billion  up 9 33  from the year ago period 
For the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of  3 74 per share and revenue of  16 96 billion  which would represent changes of  25 35  and  10 19   respectively  from the prior year 
Any recent changes to analyst estimates for OXY should also be noted by investors  These revisions help to show the ever changing nature of near term business trends  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability 
Based on our research  we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near team stock moves  Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank  This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple  actionable rating system 
The Zacks Rank system  which ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  Over the past month  the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 3 21  lower  OXY is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
In terms of valuation  OXY is currently trading at a Forward P E ratio of 13 67  Its industry sports an average Forward P E of 13 67  so we one might conclude that OXY is trading at a no noticeable deviation comparatively 
We can also see that OXY currently has a PEG ratio of 2 73  The PEG ratio is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but this metric also takes the company s expected earnings growth rate into account  Oil and Gas   Integrated   United States stocks are  on average  holding a PEG ratio of 1 53 based on yesterday s closing prices

200032,421548,OXY,Earnings Preview  Occidental Petroleum  OXY  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Occidental Petroleum  OXY  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 31  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas exploration and production company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 96 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  12 7  
Revenues are expected to be  4 39 billion  up 7 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 11 53  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Occidental 
For Occidental  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 68  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Occidental will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Occidental would post earnings of  0 72 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 84  delivering a surprise of  16 67  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Occidental doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-occidental-petroleum-oxy-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200443970,200443970

200034,421550,OXY,Texas flood  U S  oil exports pour into markets worldwide,news,"By Catherine Ngai  Libby George and Florence Tan NEW YORK LONDON SINGAPORE  Reuters    In the two years since Washington lifted a 40 year ban on oil exports  tankers filled with U S  crude have landed in more than 30 countries  ranging from massive economies like China and India to tiny Togo  The repeal has unleashed a flood of U S  shale oil  undercutting global crude prices  eroding the clout of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  and seizing market share from many of its member countries  In 2005  before the shale revolution  the United States had net imports of 12 5 million barrels per day  bpd  of crude and fuels   compared to just 4 million bpd today  U S  producers are making new customers out of some of the world s biggest oil importing nations in Asia and Europe  posing a serious competitive threat to the only other countries that produce as much crude  Saudi Arabia and Russia  At home  the export boom has filled pipelines and sparked a surge of investment in new shipping infrastructure on the Gulf Coast   For an interactive graphic detailing the global impacts of the U S  shale revolution  see    U S  producers now export between 1 5 million and 2 million barrels of crude a day  which could rise to about 4 million by 2022  The nation s output is expected to account for more than 80 percent of global supply growth in the next decade  according to Paris based International Energy Agency  Much of the increased flow will go to China  the world s top importer and  since November  the largest buyer of U S  crude other than Canada  Chen Bo  president of Unipec   China s largest buyer of U S  crude   told Reuters that the firm expects to double U S  imports this year to 300 000 bpd as it seeks to expand sales in Asia and find new customers for U S  exports in other regions  including Europe  Unipec   the trading arm of Asia s largest refiner  state owned Sinopec   is also considering long term crude supply deals with U S  pipeline and terminal operators  The firm may also partner with such firms to expand and improve U S  export infrastructure  Chen said in an interview   U S  crude flowing to Asia is a major trend in global oil trading   Chen told Reuters  Separately  China s state owned chemical and oil conglomerate Sinochem Group plans to open a trading office in Houston later this year to source U S  crude for China s independent refineries  five sources familiar with the plans told Reuters  Between 2010 and 2017  U S  oil production rose from 5 5 million barrels a day to 10 million bpd   approaching a record set in 1970   as shale fields in west Texas and North Dakota lured massive new drilling investments  That brings national production in line with Saudi Arabia and close to top producer Russia s 10 9 million barrels a day  Saudi Arabia cut output last year as part of OPEC s 2016 deal to reduce supply   after losing a price war with U S  shale producers that created a global glut   Most forecasts show U S  crude output growing about 500 000 to 600 000 barrels per day through the end of 2018  said David Fyfe  chief economist at global commodity trading firm Gunvor Group in Geneva  Switzerland  The U S  Energy Department is even more optimistic  now expecting growth to rise by 1 2 million bpd   hitting 11 million bpd by year end    The bulk of that growth will likely be exported   Fyfe said  U S  producers are also displacing foreign oil at home  Total U S  crude imports have dropped to 7 6 million barrels a day from a peak of 10 6 million bpd in 2006  OPEC s share has declined from more than half of U S  imports to about 37 percent as the United States relies more on domestic production and neighboring Canada  OPEC members Saudi Arabia  Nigeria and Angola have been among the hardest hit  In the second half of 2017  U S  imports from Saudi Arabia averaged 709 000 bpd  lowest since 1987 and down from a peak of 1 73 million bpd in 2003   BIG BUYERS IN INDIA  EUROPE U S  producers have also broken into the market in India   the world s third largest oil importer and home to the world s largest refining complex  operated by Reliance Industries  Seeking to diversify its foreign supplies  India first imported U S  crude in October and bought a total of 8 million barrels of U S  oil last year  according to Thomson Reuters ship tracking data and shipping data provided by sources  In Europe  as of November  the United States had become the fifth largest oil supplier to France  according to customs data  exceeding Nigeria  Libya  Iran or the North Sea  In November 2016  the U S  didn t even make the top ten  China stopped importing Nigerian crude in the fourth quarter  according to Chinese customs figures  and while China s overall imports rose by 12 percent in 2017  imports from Saudi Arabia rose just 2 3 percent   They re taking market share really from OPEC nations   said Olivier Jakob  managing director of PetroMatrix  GULF COAST SHIPPING BOOM Surging U S  exports are rippling through the rest of the domestic energy economy  Shipping terminals Texas and around the Gulf Coast are building out infrastructure to handle larger tankers   If we didn t have the option to send that crude to export markets  I think crude oil production would have been much more distressed   said Jarl Pedersen  chief commercial officer at Port Corpus Christi in south Texas  referring to 2016  when oil prices were still in the 40s   Pipeline and logistics firms are among the big beneficiaries  as booming crude demand means steadier profits for companies sending oil to the Gulf and storing it for export   Enterprise Products Partners  N EPD    which operates more than 5 000 miles of crude oil pipelines and 38 million barrels of crude storage   reported record profits in 2017  boosted by record volumes for its pipelines and marine terminals  Magellan Midstream Partners  N MMP   which operates key pipelines from Texas s Permian Basin to the Gulf  expects to spend more than  1 7 billion in the next two years on construction projects  Among those are new docks  storage and marine terminals in the Houston area to meet growing demand  Terminal operators and shippers in the U S  Gulf are ramping up investment to guard against supply bottlenecks as more barrels leave the U S  It can take 18 to 24 months to build an export dock  Gulf Coast terminals handle three quarters of U S  crude exports  but only one   the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port  LOOP  terminal   can handle supertankers that can carry up to 2 million barrels of oil   Most shipping channels are too shallow  Last year  Occidental Petroleum Corp s  N OXY  Ingleside terminal at Corpus Christi test loaded a supertanker   but that channel is currently not deep enough to fully load such a vessel   In late January  the CEO of the Corpus Christi port forwarded a letter from six energy executives pressing the Trump Administration for  60 million in federal funding for ship channel improvements as part of a  320 million project to widen and deepen the port s ship channel   Lifting the crude export ban allowed for  50 billion in industrial projects in south Texas alone  the executives wrote

200043,421559,OXY,Fed Statement Keeps Rally Alive,opinion,"Stocks rose for a third straight session on Wednesday as the Fed statement was considered dovish enough to keep the major indices marching toward new highs 
	As expected  the Committee kept rates unchanged  Its official stance moving forward is that a rate cut in 2019 is unlikely 
	However  these things are all about language and reading in between the lines  Investors think the Fed left itself with more than enough leeway to cut rates much sooner than 2020  perhaps even in July  In fact  eight members of the committee expect a cut in 2019 
	After a sluggish morning  stocks didn t exactly soar once the news was released  Maybe it wasn t adequately dovish  or perhaps it was so expected that its effectiveness was limited  Either way  it was rather anticlimactic after the buildup over the past few days 
	Nevertheless  stocks did advance and kept the rally moving 
	The S P  which crossed above 2900 yesterday and is within 1  of its all time high  added another 0 30  on Wednesday to end at 2926 46  The Dow increased 0 15   or about 38 points  to 26 504 
	The NASDAQ was again the percentage leader with an increase of 0 42  to 7987 32 
	The major indices are going for a third straight week in the green to continue adding onto June s gains following a rough May

200044,421560,OXY,ETRN Or OXY  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Oil and Gas   Integrated   United States sector have probably already heard of Equitrans Midstream Corporation  ETRN  and Occidental Petroleum  OXY   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Equitrans Midstream Corporation has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Occidental Petroleum has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  This means that ETRN s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
ETRN currently has a forward P E ratio of 10 88  while OXY has a forward P E of 13 36  We also note that ETRN has a PEG ratio of 1 55  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  OXY currently has a PEG ratio of 2 67 
Another notable valuation metric for ETRN is its P B ratio of 1 09  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  OXY has a P B of 1 78 
Based on these metrics and many more  ETRN holds a Value grade of B  while OXY has a Value grade of C 
ETRN has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than OXY  so it seems like value investors will conclude that ETRN is the superior option right now ",2019-06-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/etrn-or-oxy-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200435254,200435254

Coming into today  shares of the oil and gas exploration and production company had lost 3 04  in the past month  In that same time  the Oils Energy sector gained 3 31   while the S P 500 gained 3 19  
Investors will be hoping for strength from OXY as it approaches its next earnings release  The company is expected to report EPS of  1 08  down 1 82  from the prior year quarter  Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of  4 50 billion  up 10 14  from the year ago period 
Looking at the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of  3 77 per share and revenue of  17 19 billion  These totals would mark changes of  24 75  and  8 96   respectively  from last year 
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for OXY  These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short term business trends  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability 
Based on our research  we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near team stock moves  To benefit from this  we have developed the Zacks Rank  a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system 
Ranging from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   the Zacks Rank system has a proven  outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks returning an average of  25  annually since 1988  The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 4 71  lower within the past month  OXY is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  
Investors should also note OXY s current valuation metrics  including its Forward P E ratio of 13 36  Its industry sports an average Forward P E of 14 11  so we one might conclude that OXY is trading at a discount comparatively 
Meanwhile  OXY s PEG ratio is currently 2 67  The PEG ratio is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but this metric also takes the company s expected earnings growth rate into account  OXY s industry had an average PEG ratio of 1 56 as of yesterday s close

The attack took place in rural El Carmen municipality in Norte de Santander  MC SAN  province  near the border with Venezuela  the sources said  The bombing caused a crude spillage into a nearby river 
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because an official announcement has not yet been made 
Production at the Cano Limon oilfield  operated by U S  based Occidental Petroleum Corp  NYSE OXY   and exports have not been affected  the sources said 
Ecopetrol officials said a team from the company was in the area to carry out clean up operations  Repairs are expected to take several days  they said 
Attacks against the pipeline have left 751 victims over the last 17 years  including 167 deaths  Since 1986 the pipeline has been out of service 3 800 days  or 10 4 years  30 percent of its life  Some 66 million gallons of crude have been spilled since 2000  according to Ecopetrol figures

200054,421570,OXY,Sustainability Of Occidental Petroleum s Common Dividend Put To The Test,opinion,"The methods and findings of this analysis are presented in a Raymond James report 
In a May 22 research note  Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov reported that Occidental Petroleum Corp  s  NYSE OXY  current  lofty  dividend yield could be the market signaling uncertainty about the sustainability of the common dividend  Accordingly  the stress tested it to determine the minimum oil price required for the dividend to remain sustainable 
Occidental s dividend yield widened to  a stunning 5 8    Molchanov noted  after the company s  highly leveraged  acquisition of Anadarko  That level puts Occidental among the  Top 20 highest yielders in the S P 500  
Molchanov s stress test showed that accounting for the post acquisition increase in interest expense and the preferred dividend  Occidental s common dividend  can be comfortably sustained  as long as the West Texas Intermediate  WTI  oil price stays over  45 a barrel  According to Raymond James  long term WTI price forecast   75 a barrel  the dividend should be safe 
Molchanov provided the factors of the stress test  One is Occidental s financing burden  which is rising with the Anadarko transaction 
Raymond James estimates that Occidental s interest expense  which is tax deductible  will increase about five times from an annualized run rate jumping to  2 billion from  400 million due to the company having to borrow to pay three quarters of the purchase price of Anadarko in cash and assume that firm s debt  Also  Occidental will start paying  800 million annually in preferred dividends  not tax deductible  on the  10 billion of preferred stock Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  is buying  Finally   the  relatively modest  common equity portion of the purchase price will increase the common dividend payout in absolute terms   added Molchanov 
The second factor considered in the stress test  the analyst indicated  is Occidental s significant ability to generate cash  which  among other large cap oil gas explorers and developers  is at the higher end of the range  This is thanks to the company s heavy liquids weighting  and liquids will comprise 74  of the production mix from the combined assets  Raymond James  forecasted  It is also due to Occidental s OxyChem  a  longstanding cash cow   Molchanov wrote  Further  Occidental s adherence to a capital disciplined business model helps with cash flow generation 
Molchanov conducted a sensitivity analysis of the dividend coverage  plugging in operating cash flow  capital spending and free cash amounts for various oil prices  both WTI and Brent  The analysis showed  the threshold of all in cash flow neutrality capital spending plus the full dividend comes approximately at the midpoint between  40 and  50   he explained   With WTI in the mid  60s  which is slightly higher than where the futures strip is currently  dividend coverage rises to 2x  
In other words  the dividend is safe and shareholders should not be concerned about it unless they believe the WTI oil price will drop to and stay at  45 per barrel   To be crystal clear  a short term dip to those levels would not cause a dividend cut   clarified Molchanov 
Raymond James has a Strong Buy on Occidental  The company s current stock price is  53 52 per share

There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits

Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years

Another notable valuation metric for ETRN is its P B ratio of 1 07  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  OXY has a P B of 1 69 
Based on these metrics and many more  ETRN holds a Value grade of B  while OXY has a Value grade of C 
ETRN has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than OXY  so it seems like value investors will conclude that ETRN is the superior option right now ",2019-06-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/etrn-vs-oxy-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200430506,200430506

200073,421589,OXY,Occidental Petroleum  OXY  Dips More Than Broader Markets  What You Should Know,opinion,"In the latest trading session  Occidental Petroleum  OXY  closed at  57 35  marking a  0 23  move from the previous day  This change lagged the S P 500 s 0 21  loss on the day  At the same time  the Dow lost 0 46   and the tech heavy Nasdaq lost 0 16  
Heading into today  shares of the oil and gas exploration and production company had lost 12 99  over the past month  lagging the Oils Energy sector s loss of 3 04  and the S P 500 s gain of 2 07  in that time 
Investors will be hoping for strength from OXY as it approaches its next earnings release  which is expected to be May 6  2019  In that report  analysts expect OXY to post earnings of  0 72 per share  This would mark a year over year decline of 21 74   Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of  3 96 billion  up 3 45  from the year ago period 
Looking at the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of  3 64 per share and revenue of  16 95 billion  These totals would mark changes of  27 35  and  10 25   respectively  from last year 
Any recent changes to analyst estimates for OXY should also be noted by investors  These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short term business trends  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook 
Based on our research  we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near team stock moves  Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank  This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple  actionable rating system 
The Zacks Rank system  which ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 8 31  higher within the past month  OXY currently has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  
Digging into valuation  OXY currently has a Forward P E ratio of 15 81  For comparison  its industry has an average Forward P E of 14 99  which means OXY is trading at a premium to the group 
Investors should also note that OXY has a PEG ratio of 1 09 right now  The PEG ratio is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but this metric also takes the company s expected earnings growth rate into account  The Oil and Gas   Integrated   United States industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1 58 as of yesterday s close 
The Oil and Gas   Integrated   United States industry is part of the Oils Energy sector  This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 38  putting it in the top 15  of all 250  industries 
The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups  Our research shows that the top 50  rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1

Review  Is It Time to Lever Up on Momentum 
Our previous Stock Exchange asked the question  Is It Time To Lever Up On Market Momentum  We noted the market has been very strong this year  but asked if now is the time to get aggressive with your trades  And despite some concerns over a yield curve that has recently flashed inversion  there are reasons to believe this current bull market rally can go higher still 
This Week  What Is Your Trading Timeframe Now 
Perhaps your trading timeframe is based on your personal strategy and goals  and it almost never changes  Or perhaps it changes often based on current market conditions  Regardless  one of the biggest sources of trading errors  risks and confusion is based on understanding and communicating your trading timeframe  Even though there seems to be an ever growing supply of investment and trading information  who is it targeted towards  Specifically  what trading timeframe 
Trading Psychologist  Dr  Brett Steenbarger  does an excellent job summarizing this dilemma in his recent post titled  A Formula for Trading and Investing Disaster   as follows 

Many problems of trading and investing have a simple source  People follow the markets on a different time scale from their intended holding period  Typically this means becoming psychologically attached to shorter term movements up and down and not holding positions as initially intended  The general rule is that  as pattern recognizing beings  we will find patterns in whatever time frame we follow  When our egos become attached to the patterns we perceive  we act on what we see at the moment and fail to maximize our trades and investments 

And sticking with the topic of  disasters  for a moment  Logan Kane asks  Is Your Portfolio a Timebomb   where he insightfully explains 

Most  portfolio  meltdowns come from some combination of leverage  concentration of risk  and illiquidity 

And if you get the time horizon wrong  the meltdown sources can be even more painful 
Importantly  different timeframes often make for a sharp contrast between investors and traders  with the former often focused on longer term horizons  and the latter focused on shorter term horizons 
Our own trading models  which we will review later in this report  have varying timeframes for their trades  ranging from a few weeks up to approximately 12 months or more  We ll review examples of their recent trading activity later in this report  whereby we ll highlight the different types of information that can be important to shorter term traders  but practically irrelevant to long term investors  and vice versa 
Model Performance 
Our trading programs were nudging us to move to almost entirely cash last December which worked out well in terms of actual client account performance  However  the models and trading programs have moved back to normal trading and cash levels  and they ve been performing well recently  thereby magnifying our stronger performance relative to the weaker performance when the programs held higher cash balances  And we are sharing the performance of our proprietary trading models  as our readers have requested 

Controlling Risk 
We find that blending a trend following   momentum model  Athena  with a mean reversion   dip buying model  Holmes  provides two strategies  effective in their own right  that are not correlated with each other or with the overall market  By combining the two  we can get more diversity  lower risk  and a smoother string of returns 
And since many clients combine the trading models with our long term fundamental methods  they have additional diversity of methods without the need for short term timing

Expert Picks From The Models 
Note  This week s Stock Exchange report is being moderated by Blue Harbinger  a source for independent investment ideas 
Holmes  This week I bought shares of WellCare Health Plans  WCG   It provides government sponsored managed care services  And for your information  I basically bought it on the dip  as you can see in the following chart 

Blue Harbinger  Hey Holmes  Healthcare has been the worst performing sector this year  so you not only bought the shorter term dip over the last week  but the sector relative performance dip so far this year 
Holmes  Thanks for that perspective  And as you know  I am a technical trading program  not a human  and my strategy usually involves a holding perioid of about 6 weeks 
BH  So you re telling me that you don t care too much for long term  multi year  data  such as the following FastGraph 

Holmes  I care  it s just not my main focus  I m a trader  not so much an investor  It s about timeframe 
BH  Thanks for sharing  Holmes  And how about you  Road Runner any trades to share with us this week 
Road Runner  As you know  I am a momentum trader  and I like to buy stocks in the lower end of a rising channel  And as you can see in the following chart  I bought shares of Paycome  PAYC  this week  Ever heard of it 

BH  Yes  I ve heard of it  They provide cloud based human capital management   HCM   software service for small to mid sized companies  And that s basically the same thing as a company I ve owned for the last few years  called Paylocity  PCTY   It s an attractive business model because there s a secular movement towards the cloud  a large total addressable market  and lots of room for growth  These companies are more focused on sales growth  acquiring new customers  than they are with profitability right now  And that s fine because once they land a new customer  they tend to almost never lose them 

RR  That s great information  but not all that valuable to me because my timeframe is different  I typically hold my positions for 4 weeks  and then I m out 
Athena  While you two argue over which cloud based HR and payroll processing company is better  I bought an energy stock this week  California Resources  CRC  

BH  If I am remembering correctly  that s an Occidental Petroleum  NYSE OXY  spin off  and they serve the state of California exclusively  I liked the bonds a couple years ago when they were trading at a huge discount  but I suppose the stock is interesting now with energy prices going up  Aren t they almost exclusively Brent in California  Here is the Fast Graph 

Athena  Thanks for running through your vague memories from two years ago  but I like this stock now  and I typically hold my positions for around 17 weeks  It s all about the timeframe  BH 
Felix  In addition to my usually ranking  I ranked my top 20 from the Nasdaq 100 in the following table   I actually have a trade for you this week 

BH  Thanks for the list  I enjoy your rankings  but what s your trade 
Felix  I bought share of Macquarie Infrastructure  MIC  

BH  Why  Are you chasing that big 9 9  dividend yield  Here is a look at the Fast Graph  by the way 

Felix  No  I am not chasing the dividend yield  Although I do typically hold long enough to receive a few quarterly dividend payments  Besides  there are better strategies for income  For example  you should check out Jeff s enhanced yield program 
Oscar  I have some ETF rankings to share this week  As our resident sector ETF rotation model  this week I ran our   High Liquidity ETFs with price volume multiple over 100 million per day  through my model  and the top 20 are ranked in the following list  For example  the oil ETF  USO  NYSE USO   is near the top of the list  That could bode well for Athena s CRC trade 

Conclusion 
Different market participants have different trading and investing timeframes  And if you focus too much on information that isn t geared towards your trading horizon it could influence you too make trades that aren t consistent with your goals  Screening out information that isn t relevant to your time horizon can be very difficult  but also very helpful  What is your trading time horizon

200080,421596,OXY,Analysts Estimate Occidental Petroleum  OXY  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Occidental Petroleum  OXY  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 6  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas exploration and production company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 72 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  21 7  
Revenues are expected to be  3 96 billion  up 3 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 22 63  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Occidental 
For Occidental  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Occidental will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Occidental would post earnings of  1 12 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 22  delivering a surprise of  8 93  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Occidental doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-occidental-petroleum-oxy-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200412402,200412402

 Reuters    Pipeline operator Williams Cos Inc said on Monday it added two new directors  prompting activist investor Corvex Management LP to withdraw plans to replace the company s entire board 
The company named Stephen Chazen  former chief executive of Occidental Petroleum Corp  NYSE OXY   and Peter Ragauss  former chief financial officer of Baker Hughes Inc  to its board 
Williams said it expects to name two new independent directors by the annual shareholders  meeting and that three directors  who served prior to 2016  will not stand for re election 
Corvex  which is run by Keith Meister  said it welcomed the changes to Williams  board and withdrew its plan to unseat the board  The New York hedge fund is Williams  fourth largest shareholder 
Williams appointed three new directors on Sept  15  and has promised to add two more  meaning that seven of the company s 11 board members will eventually be new 
 Though the stock could still use some help  this looks like a successful outcome for Keith Meister s hedge fund   said Don Bilson  head of event driven research at Gordon Haskett 
Just before Williams  board nomination deadline for its Nov  23 meeting  Meister proposed 10 of his employees as nominees to serve as directors  Meister promised to replace the employees with experienced industry professionals  in a rare proxy fight tactic known as a placeholder slate 
Meister  previously a Williams director  resigned in June  along with five others  after failing to oust Williams CEO Alan Armstrong 
The resignations came a day after Energy Transfer Equity walked away from its more than  20 billion deal to buy Williams ",2016-09-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/corvex-drops-williams-proxy-fight-after-more-directors-named-428477,428477

200086,421602,OXY,Will Occidental  OXY  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Occidental Petroleum  OXY   which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Integrated   United States industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this oil and gas exploration and production company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 13 07   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Occidental was expected to post earnings of  1 12 per share  but it reported  1 22 per share instead  representing a surprise of 8 93   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 51 per share  while it actually produced  1 77 per share  a surprise of 17 22  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Occidental lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Occidental currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 11   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on May 6  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

Coming into today  shares of the oil and gas exploration and production company had gained 9 05  in the past month  In that same time  the Oils Energy sector gained 11 26   while the S P 500 gained 7 92  
OXY will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release  which is expected to be February 12  2019  In that report  analysts expect OXY to post earnings of  1 12 per share  This would mark year over year growth of 173 17   Meanwhile  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of  4 51 billion  up 25 77  from the year ago period 
Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for OXY  These revisions typically reflect the latest short term business trends  which can change frequently  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability 
Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near term stock prices  Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank  This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple  actionable rating system 
Ranging from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   the Zacks Rank system has a proven  outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks returning an average of  25  annually since 1988  Over the past month  the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 25 47  lower  OXY is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  5  Strong Sell  
Looking at its valuation  OXY is holding a Forward P E ratio of 18 08  This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry s average Forward P E of 19 6 
We can also see that OXY currently has a PEG ratio of 3 01  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  The Oil and Gas   Integrated   United States was holding an average PEG ratio of 1 81 at yesterday s closing price

200100,421616,OXY,Why Occidental  OXY  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Occidental Petroleum  OXY   which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Integrated   United States industry 
This oil and gas exploration and production company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 2 61  
For the most recent quarter  Occidental was expected to post earnings of  1 51 per share  but it reported  1 77 per share instead  representing a surprise of 17 22   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 25 per share  while it actually produced  1 10 per share  a surprise of 12  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Occidental  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Occidental currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 61   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 12  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-02-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-occidental-oxy-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200383285,200383285
200101,421617,OXY,Occidental Petroleum  OXY  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Occidental Petroleum  OXY  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 12  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas exploration and production company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 12 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  173 2  
Revenues are expected to be  4 51 billion  up 25 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 26 25  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Occidental 
For Occidental  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 61  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Occidental will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Occidental would post earnings of  1 51 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 77  delivering a surprise of  17 22  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

200103,421619,OXY,3 Shale Oil Stocks To Consider As Crude Hovers Around  55,opinion,"Since October  global oil prices have crashed  losing roughly a quarter of their value  The stumble has become one of the biggest declines for the commodity since a price collapse in 2014 
On Monday  West Texas Intermediate crude  the US benchmark  was holding just above the  55 level  not far from the one year low of  54 75 touched on November 13  WTI prices have suffered weekly losses in each of the past six weeks  falling by around 26  over that period from levels above  75 per barrel 

Increasing worries over soaring US output has been cited as the culprit for the breathtaking price plunge  Domestic oil production driven by shale extraction reached another record last week  hitting 11 7 million barrels per day  bpd   according to the Energy Information Administration  EIA   Most analysts expect US output to climb above 12 million bpd within the first half of 2019  making the US the world s biggest oil producer  ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia 
The US oil rig count  an early indicator of future output  is currently at its highest in over three years  suggesting that crude production from shale basins is expected to continue powering ahead  Indeed  the EIA projected that US crude oil output from its seven major shale basins will hit a record high of 7 94 million bpd in December 
The surge in US oil output  combined with worries over slowing global demand  will likely lead the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  to slash production starting next month  OPEC s de facto leader  Saudi Arabia  wants the cartel to cut output by about 1 4 million bpd to tighten supply and prop up prices 
Taking all this into consideration  now is an ideal time for investors to go shopping for shares of shale oil drillers  Below we consider three stocks poised to outperform in the months ahead 
In order to weed out the thousands of publicly traded  energy related names  we ll only touch on companies in the sector that are US based and currently have a market capitalization of  2 billion or more 
1  Anadarko Petroleum
Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC  is one of the world s largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies  Its asset portfolio includes positions in onshore resource plays in the Appalachian basin  the southern US and the Rocky Mountains region 

The Woodlands  Texas based company reported mixed results for the third quarter on October 30  as earnings fell short of analyst estimates  Despite the slight miss  Anadarko s quarter was much stronger than the headline number indicated  Revenue topped forecasts in the July to September period  as onshore oil sales hit a record and per barrel margins improved 
Onshore oil sales volumes averaged a record 175 000 bpd during the quarter  up 37  from a year ago  Fueling Anadarko s production surge was its position in the Delaware Basin  which extends from West Texas to parts of New Mexico  where output jumped to 70 000 bpd  up 83  from the year ago period 
The surge in onshore oil production  along with lower costs thanks to improved infrastructure access  helped boost Anadarko s margins to  33 68 per barrel  58  higher from a year earlier  That makes Anadarko a compelling buy opportunity in the months ahead 
While the stock is down almost 18  since the start of October  shares  which closed yesterday at  55 61  are still up nearly 4  in 2018  In comparison  the broader industry represented by the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLE  has declined by around 7  this year 
2  Whiting Petroleum
So far  2018 has been a fantastic year for Whiting Petroleum  NYSE WLL   which is the leader in oil production in the Bakken Shale Deposit in North Dakota 

The Denver based company reported earnings and revenue on October 30  that easily topped analysts  third quarter forecasts  as higher domestic oil prices and production growth boosted results 
Whiting s third quarter production averaged 128 680 barrels of oil equivalent per day  up 13  from a year ago  The company expects its production to increase 5  in the fourth quarter  according to Chief Executive Bradley Holly 
The oil   gas exploration company is up around 20  so far this year  making it one of the best performers in the sector  despite shares  which yesterday closed at  31 57  having fallen sharply over the past six weeks  Whiting s stock has lost about 40  since the beginning of October  mirroring the rout in oil prices 
Looking ahead  Whiting s share price is expected to benefit from healthy production growth from the Bakken  where the company completed 45 wells during the three months ended September 30  With more than 1 000 top tier drilling locations remaining in the Bakken  the oil driller has plenty of room to continue growing at a fast pace in the years to come 
3  Occidental Petroleum
Occidental Petroleum  NYSE OXY   is the largest oil and gas producer in the Permian basin  making it a major player in the US energy sector  US shale oil production from the Permian has nearly doubled in the past three years 

The Houston based integrated oil and gas producer reported better than expected  third quarter earnings on November 5  thanks to a surge in production from the Permian Basin  The company said output from its Permian Resources unit jumped more than 60  from a year earlier  to 225 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  boe d  
CEO Vicki Hollub recently noted that the Permian is the epicenter of Occidental s business  and it will continue to be the company s focal point for years to come  Shares of Occidental  known as Oxy  which ended yesterday at  73 36  are down 10 7  since the start of October  For the year  the stock is roughly flat 
The company looks set to benefit from its stellar Permian operations  where it is the region s largest landholder  Oxy has taken steps to mitigate potential risks related to supply constraints due to the pipeline bottlenecks in the region  This makes it well positioned to continue increasing its output  while taking advantage of stronger oil prices  which will help fuel future earnings growth ",2018-11-20,Jesse Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-shale-oil-stocks-worth-considering-with-wti-crude-prices-around-55-200360861,200360861

200112,421628,OXY,The Energy Report 7 25 18,opinion,"Trade War and Farm Aid  Farm Aid Farm Aid
You can talk about trade wars  Iranian tensions or the biggest farm aid package since Willie Nelson started the Farm Aid concert for farmers at Champaign  Illinois back in the 1980 s but what really is driving oil higher today is just good old fashion supply and demand 
The American Petroleum Institute  API  is putting oil back on an upward trajectory as it reported that US crude oil supplies fell by 3 16 million barrels  The drawdown was probably inspired by strong product demand and by refiners who are ramping up output to meet that demand 
The API reported a whopping 4 87 million barrel weekly drop in gasoline supply that really shows how strong the economy is and how strong the consumer is  Gasoline exports have also been running near record highs and the sharp drop should help support the soon to be expiring August RBOB futures as rack buyers may have to deal with a tight cash market  I won t call it a squeeze but it might start to feel a bit like that as we head into the Friday RBOB expiration  Cushing Oklahoma also saw an 808 000 barrel drop  Distillates also saw a 1 32 million barrel drop in crude supply driving distillates further below the average range for this time of year 
Farmers looking ahead to harvest should get hedged even though President Trump will use a Great Depression era program to pay up to  12 billion to help U S  farmers through the trade war talks  Maybe Willie Nelson should come play at the Trade talks with President Trump and President of the European Commission  Jean Claude Juncker  Any sign that Trump and Juncker can lay the groundwork for a trade deal could set oil  distillate  grains and metals on a tear 
The petroleum outlook short term is tight  and many are wondering why the shale oil producers are not making up for rising demand  Well  they are doing the best that they can t keep up  as logistical issues and pipeline constraints are still hampering progress  The Houston Chronicle reported that  Oil pipeline constraints out of the most prolific oil and gas field in the U S  may continue through early 2020  according to a new analysis by Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC    The report  which analyzes infrastructure needs at eight petroleum and gas regions and commodity hubs  said the update is due to rapidly increasing production and delays in pipeline projects  The report  which analyzes infrastructure needs at eight petroleum and gas regions and commodity hubs  said the update is due to rapidly increasing production and delays in pipeline projects 
Pipeline constraints in the Permian Basin  which produces 3 3 million barrels of oil a day and has seen production grow 37 6 percent in the last year  are now expected to hamper the region into the first quarter of 2020  according to the Wells Fargo analysts 
Reuters is reporting that Occidental Petroleum Corp  NYSE OXY  is exploring a sale of its pipeline assets  hoping to fetch more than  5 billion and free up capital to invest in exploration and production as oil prices rebound  people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday  Occidental s decision to shed the assets is the latest example of an oil company balking at the capital expenditure required to maintain U S  pipelines  which have been plagued by bottlenecks and require construction of new networks 
Hess Corp  NYSE HES  and Oasis Petroleum Inc  NYSE OAS  are among the companies that have sold or spun off pipelines in the past year  looking to take advantage of high valuations for these assets  which have been buoyed by the capacity constraints  Fill up you gas tank before prices rise again and make sure you stay tuned to the Fox Business Network the only place where you get the Power to Prosper  Call to get my daily trade updates at 888 264 5665  Call to see how we are positioning with futures and options ",2018-07-25,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-72518-200333035,200333035

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Occidental shares have lost about 7 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 9  
What s Next for Occidental 
While Occidental has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

200118,421634,OXY,Diamondback Riding On Permian Focus Amid Pipeline Constraint ,opinion,Diamondback Energy Inc  s   NASDAQ FANG   strong foothold in the prolific Permian Basin has been quite a boon to the company s performance for a while  Notably  the shares of this Texas based upstream player have increased 30  over a year  outperforming the industry s growth of 13 5  On the flip side  infrastructural bottlenecks in the shale play still remain a concern  That said  let s do a close introspection of the company s performance and see if it can add more laurels to its growth story The Permian AdvantageDiamondback s strategic acreage position in the low cost Permian Basin bodes well  The low operating cost stems from the region s extensive pipeline infrastructure  plentiful labor and supplies  and relatively warm winters that make year round work possible  The Permian pure play company holds around 207 000 net acres in the region  including 188 000 net acres in the Midland and Delaware Basins  Its activities are concentrated in the Wolfcamp  Spraberry  Clearfork  Bone Spring and Cline formations Diamondback recently delivered its 12th consecutive earnings outperformance  driven by its phenomenal production growth  Owing to its significant resource potential and prime acreage holdings  the company s first quarter output recorded a year over year and sequential increase of 66 5  and 10 5   respectively Driven by the robust results  the company raised the lower end of its 2018 production guidance from 108 116 Mboe d to 110 116 Mboe d  For 2018  it is now targeting an annual output growth of 40  within cash flow Effective Growth StrategiesA deep inventory of horizontal development opportunities in both the Midland and Delaware sides of the Permian Basin bodes well  The company s strategy of horizontal drilling and increased well density maximizes its productivity  Notably  the lateral length of its wells that was less than 4 000 feet in 2012 is likely to jump to around 9 300 feet by this year  owing to the technological advancements  Diamondback targets around 170 190 horizontal completions in 2018  which will boost its production prospects as the wells become operational  The company also plans to add two more rigs in 2018  increasing its operational rigs by 20  from the last year Diamondback is also making continual efforts to convert its undeveloped reserves to developed ones  which is aiding its cash flows further  In 2017  the company s proved reserves increased around 63  to stand at 335 352 thousand barrels of oil equivalent  MBoe   In fact  it achieved a remarkable 52  CAGR in its total reserves since 2013 The energy explorer also has an impressive record in purchasing leasehold position  which further spurs its organic growth and bolsters Permian foothold The low cost development strategy is another positive for the company  It has been gaining from the economies of scale and operational efficiencies  thereby maximizing its earnings growth  In the last reported quarter  its cash operating costs were down 10  on a year over year basis to stand at  8 42 per barrels of oil equivalent  Diamondback also improved its cost outlook by lowering the lease operating expenses guidance for 2018 by 13  to reflect increased efficiencies   Cash Flow Generation Bodes WellDiamondback Energy s cost efficiencies  disciplined capital management and employing more equity financing than debt boosted the financials of the company  Notably  the company generated free cash flow of  21 million in the last reported quarter  while generating 13  annualized return on the capital employed  As a show of confidence in its cash flow generating ability  it also initiated its dividend payout program in the first quarter Its return on equity for the trailing 12 months is 10 53   higher than the industry s figure of 6 07   Finally  Diamondback s manageable debt to capital ratio of 22 9  is lower than most of its peers  providing it with enough financial flexibility to tap the strategic growth opportunities Signs of ConcernWhile production in the Permian is soaring  the takeaway capacity is not increasing in proportion  Due to pipeline capacity constraints  Diamondback Energy and other producers have to sell their products at a discounted rate  Though the company is entering into agreements to improve pricing exposure  the impact of the same is unlikely to be immediate  While Diamondback inked a deal to secure 50 thousand barrels per day of capacity for the Gray Oak pipeline  the project is not expected to become operational till late 2019  providing no immediate respite from the concerns Also  while the company s financials are otherwise strong  there is one area of concern in the balance sheet with respect to its cash position  Notably  cash and cash equivalents of the company decreased 35 5  in the last reported quarter  As it is  Diamondback s current ratio of 0 53 compares with 1 06 for its broader industry  which is low both in absolute and relative terms  This may lead to difficulties in meeting its current obligations Bottom LineDespite the above mentioned hurdles  we believe that the company s top tier acreage in the Permian  cost containment and growth initiatives  healthy cash flow generation  along with a rebounding energy landscape will enable Diamondback to counter the limitations

200234,421750,OXY,The Oil Industry s Day Of Reckoning,opinion,"Squeezed for cash and sweating   
That is the state of oil and gas exploration and production  E P  companies as they enter October 
Our chart above shows just how overleveraged the industry has become in relation to other sectors  On average  E Ps have 20 times as much debt compared to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  brought in over the last 12 months 
And things could get worse from here 
Because this October  in particular  has the potential to send certain companies scrambling for help  And it all has to do with one word  redetermination 
This is when a lender reevaluates a company s credit line 
For lenders  this is a common and crucial practice  When companies borrow money against their assets  it is important to reevaluate things from time to time  Especially if their asset value is shrinking 
So what does the oil industry borrow against  Its balance sheet s most prized possession   its estimated natural gas and oil reserves  And with oil trading at its lowest level in six years  reserve values are shrinking faster than Hillary Clinton s approval rating 
Cash strapped E Ps are about to get a rude awakening from lenders 
This next chart shows just how fast the situation has developed   

Today  the oil and gas industry s total debt to EBITDA ratio sits at a whopping 19 96  This time last year it was at 2 38  So we have a 738  increase in 12 months  And it doesn t look like it will stop anytime soon 
This fall s redetermination season will have already cash strapped E Ps begging for more loans at whatever rate they can get  It has become a situation of survive today  pay for it tomorrow 
So what should you do as an investor  Two things   
One  protect your portfolio from overleveraged oil plays  Two  profit from the situation 
Using total debt to EBITDA   coupled with other key metrics   Dave has identified 17 companies on the verge of total collapse   Editor s Note  We actually just updated the report title from 19 to 17 because two of the companies Dave originally singled out have already croaked  
One specific stock on the list has a debt load over 2 000 times its earnings  If you currently hold any of these stocks  you need to act now and get out 
Next is the opportunity to profit 
As troubled E Ps frantically search for buyout deals  M A partners or just more cash  they will seek help from investment banks  We are going to see a flood of activity in this market  Many E Ps have only three to six months of solvency remaining  It will be now or never 
My favorite play for the coming deal making boom is Evercore Partners  NYSE EVR  
It s a top energy industry advisor  The company has a strong and seasoned management team  with decades of experience in the oil industry 
Big deals it helped broker in the past included major spin offs with Occidental Petroleum  NYSE OXY     plus Kinder Morgan s  NYSE KMI   38 billion buyout of El Paso Pipeline Partners  Today it is working on deals with Antero Midstream  NYSE AM   Niska Gas Storage Partners  NYSE NKA  and Midstates Petroleum  NYSE MPO  
Last year alone  energy sector deals made up more than a quarter of its  821 million investment banking revenue  In the last four quarters  it has seen double digit sales growth  year over year  And with the help of more oil industry deals coming down the pipe  it s projecting a 41  increase in earnings and 27  sales growth for 2015 
Any E P looking for a lifeline will turn to a company like Evercore for help  If not  they should start preparing for judgement day ",2015-10-04,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-oil-industry’s-day-of-reckoning-266985,266985
200235,421751,OXY,Can Occidental Petroleum  OXY  Beat On Earnings In Q1 ,opinion,"We expect integrated oil   gas company  Occidental Petroleum Corporation   NYSE OXY   to beat expectations when it reports first quarter 2016 results on May 5  before the market opens  Last quarter  the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 21 43  Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model shows that Occidental Petroleum is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  to be able to beat estimates and Occidental Petroleum has the right mix Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate of loss of 39 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 41 cents  is  4 88   This is meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise Zacks Rank  Occidental Petroleum currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with the company s positive ESP  makes us fairly confident of an earnings beat Conversely  we caution against Sell rated stocks   4 or  5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Surprise History
The above chart indicates that Occidental Petroleum was able to generate positive earnings surprises in two out of the last four quarters  The average positive surprise was 82 14  What is Driving Better than Expected Earnings Given the current commodity price environment  Occidental Petroleum is pursuing strategies to reduce activities in non core operations in the Middle East and North Africa  while shifting focus toward opportunities to generate higher financial returns Meanwhile  the company s focus on its core oil and gas operations has resulted in strong growth in the Permian Basin  The company expects the region to reach production capacity of 123 000 barrels of oil equivalents  BOE  per day in the first half of 2016  reflecting an 8  year over year increase  On the other hand  it projects full year production growth in the range of 570 000 585 000 BOE per day  up from the 2015 level of 560 000 BOE  with core areas contributing 2 4  Due to the ongoing softness in commodity prices  the company projects 2016 capital expenditure in the range of  2 8  3 billion  down nearly 50   We consider the planned reduction in expenditure to be a prudent move in this scenario as it will boost company s financial flexibility  Occidental Petroleum also expects to slash general   administrative costs by  100 million in 2016 to counter the weak commodity price environment Other Stocks to ConsiderOccidental Petroleum is not the only company looking up this earnings season  We see likely earnings beat coming from these companies in the oil   energy space as well Linn Energy  LLC   NASDAQ LINE   has an Earnings ESP of  500 00  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is expected to report first quarter 2016 results on May 4 Bill Barrett Corp    NYSE BBG   has an Earnings ESP of  9 09  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is expected to report first quarter 2016 results on May 5  after the market closes Chesapeake Energy Corporation   NYSE CHK   has an Earnings ESP of  9 09  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is expected to report first quarter 2016 results on May 5  before the market opens ",2016-05-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-occidental-petroleum-(oxy)-beat-on-earnings-in-q1-200127228,200127228
