3975,225490,ACHC,Should Value Investors Pick Acadia Healthcare  ACHC  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Acadia Healthcare Company  Inc    NASDAQ ACHC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Acadia Healthcare has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 3  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 6  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Acadia Healthcare s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 21 3 over the past five years  with the number remaining nearly stable over the past few months  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Medical Care sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Acadia Healthcare has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 4  which is tad higher than the current level  So  it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Acadia Healthcare has a P S ratio of about 0 9  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  Acadia Healthcare is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Acadia Healthcare currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Acadia Healthcare a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Acadia Healthcare might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of D  This gives ACHC a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging  The current quarter has seen five estimates go down in the past sixty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction  For the full year  the estimate has seen eight downward revisions over the same time period with no upward movement This has had a dismal impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has slumped 28 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has declined 8 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Acadia Healthcare Company  Inc  Price and Consensus   Despite the bearish analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAcadia Healthcare is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 38  of more than 250 industries  boosts our confidence However  over the past two years  the Zacks Medical   Hospitals industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Top 10 Stocks for 2019In addition to the stocks discussed above  wouldn t you like to know about our 10 finest buy and holds for the year From more than 4 000 companies covered by the Zacks Rank  these 10 were picked by a process that consistently beats the market  Even during 2018 while the market dropped  5 2   our Top 10s were up well into double digits

3976,225491,ACHC,Acadia Healthcare Up 32  YTD  What s Driving The Rally ,opinion,"Acadia Healthcare Company  Inc    NASDAQ ACHC   has been in investors  good books  given its strong presence in the United States and U K   a solid balance sheet and continued inorganic growth 
Year to date  the stock has gained 32  compared with the industry s growth of 4   It has witnessed an upward revision in 2019 earnings estimates over the past 30 days 

 
Factors Favoring the Stock 
Leading platform in healthcare industry  The company is a leading behavioral healthcare platform in an industry that is undergoing consolidation in an effort to reduce costs and expand programs to better serve the growing need for inpatient behavioral healthcare services 
Management expects to take advantage of strategies that are more accessible as a result of the company s increased size and geographic scale  These strategies include a national marketing strategy to attract new patients and referral sources  increase its volume of out of state referrals and provide a broader range of services to new and existing patients and clients  and selectively pursue opportunities to expand its facility and bed count in the United States and U K 
Strong free cash flow generation  The company generates strong free cash flow by profitably operating its business and by actively managing its working capital  Moreover  as the behavioral healthcare business does not typically require the procurement and replacement of expensive medical equipment  the maintenance of capital expenditure requirements are generally less than that of other facility based healthcare providers  For the year ended Dec 31  2018  the company s maintenance capital expenditures amounted to approximately 2 5  of its revenue

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is earnings of 57 cents per share on revenues of  3 1 billion The aftermarket auto parts distributor came up with better than expected results in the last reported quarter on the back of higher than anticipated profits from the North American segment  As far as earnings surprises are concerned  the company managed to surpass estimates in two of the trailing four quarters  with the average positive surprise being 0 34  LKQ Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Investors are expecting LKQ Corp to top earnings estimates this season as well  However  our model does not indicate an earnings beat for the company for the to be reported quarter Which Way are Top and Bottom Line Estimates Headed The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter earnings per share has been downwardly revised by a penny to 57 cents in the past seven days  The estimated figure indicates a marginal increase from the year ago reported earnings of 56 cents per share  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  3 119 million  suggesting a nominal decrease from the prior year reported figure of  3 122 million Factors Setting the ToneChallenging macroeconomic environment in Europe and uncertainty over Brexit are likely to have negatively impacted its overall consumer demand in the United Kingdom  With Europe being a major market for LKQ Corp  lower vehicle sales amid weakening consumer demand and soft economic conditions are expected to have hampered the firm s top line  Evidently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter s revenues is pegged at  1 448  suggesting a sequential and year over year decline of 4 2  and 1 1   respectively  Resultantly  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the European segment s EBITDA stands at  115 million  implying a decline from  129 million and  116 million recorded in the second quarter and year ago period  respectively Despite softness in Canada amid weak economy and lower dealer retail sales  healthy demand for light trucks and SUVs is expected to have positively contributed to the Specialty segment s revenues  Favorable dynamics for the recreational vehicles  RV  business and RV replacement parts offerings are likely to have bolstered the company  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Specialty segment s revenues is pegged at  396 million  pointing to growth from  389 million in third quarter 2018  However  operational inefficiency is likely to have clipped its profit margins for the quarter to be reported  Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EBITDA from the Specialty unit stands at  42 88 million  indicating fall from  42 94 million and  52 million in the year ago quarter and last reported quarter  respectively Meanwhile  with growth in the U S  used car vehicle markets and increase in the average number of automobiles  the company is likely to have benefited from revenue growth in North America  The Zacks consensus Estimate for revenues and EBITDA from the North American segment is pegged at  1 133 million and  165 million  suggesting year over year rise of 2 1  and 7 1   respectively All in all  while the North American market is likely to have buoyed the firm  weakness in European markets and high operating expenses are expected to have dented its overall margins in the quarter to be reported What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for LKQ Corp in the quarter to be reported  This is because it doesn t have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a

prior to this announcement Which Way Are Q1 Estimates Headed The Zacks Consensus Estimate for McKesson s fiscal first quarter earnings is pegged at  3 05  indicating an improvement of 5 2  from the year ago quarter  The same for revenues stands at  54 billion  suggesting growth of 2 7  from the year ago reported figure McKesson Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Core Business Unit to Drive Q1 ResultsMcKesson s U S  Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment is likely to act as a key catalyst in bolstering the company s fiscal first quarter results  Notably  the segment is likely to gain momentum on the back of its branded  generic and over the counter pharmaceuticals The Zacks Consensus Estimate for U S  Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions  fiscal first quarter revenues is pegged at  42 21 billion  indicating an improvement of nearly 3  from the year ago quarter This apart  the business line is likely to be a major top line contributor in the to be reported quarter  primarily driven by market growth  which might include better than expected performance in specialty business and acquisitions Other Factors at PlayEuropean Pharmaceutical SolutionsThe company is likely report higher European Pharmaceutical revenues in the fiscal first quarter possibly driven by market growth  For fiscal 2020  the company projects revenues to grow in low to mid single digits with no incremental UK cuts planned in its fiscal 2020 outlook  Consequently  we can expect the company to witness similar trend to follow in the to be reported quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate

the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment s sales stands at  1 98 billion  suggesting an improvement of nearly 16  from the prior year quarter Other SegmentThis segment  which includes McKesson Canada  McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions and Change Healthcare  is likely to witness better than expected performance in the fiscal first quarter  The company s Canadian retail presence and mitigation actions in Canada are likely to have driven the anticipated improvement However  the company might witness an increase in adjusted operating expenses mainly owing to acquisitions  a probable rise in opioid related litigation costs and investments made to support growth Further  McKesson entered fiscal 2020 with an assumption of branded inflation in the mid single digits  This in turn might adversely affect the company s overall performance Nonetheless  the company might have witnessed higher consolidated revenues in the to be reported quarter  owing to better than expected performance in U S  Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment  acquisitions and anticipated organic growth in Medical Surgical segment For the quarter to be reported  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at  54 billion  suggesting an improvement of 2 7  from the prior year quarter What Our Quantitative Model SuggestsOur proven model clearly indicates that a stock needs to have both

almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Meanwhile  the top line was up 4  year over year  aided by higher premium rates and the return of the health insurance tax in 2018 along with Medicare

34915,256430,ACHC,Acadia Healthcare  2017 Was No Good  Will 2018 Be Better ,opinion,"The year gone by was a dull one for Franklin  TN based Acadia Healthcare Company Inc    NASDAQ ACHC   that provides behavioral health care services in the United States and the United Kingdom 
What Were the Drags in 2017 
This behavioral healthcare company is faced with anemic U K  operations  which is suffering from low census and a tightening labor market for nurses and other clinical staff  These factors caused a 9 5  and 21  decline in the segment s revenues and EBIDTA  respectively  for the first nine months of 2017      
In the face of continued volume challenges and high operating costs  the reduction in guidance was disappointing  For 2017  it now expects revenues between  2 82 billion and  2 83 billion  versus  2 85 billion and  2 87 billion   and EPS in the range of  2 23 to  2 25  versus  2 42 to  2 47  Another concern is its high leverage  The company s long term debt has increased consistently for the past many years  leading to an increase in interest expense  At the end of 2016  long term debt increased 48  year over year to  3 25 billion  Though it moderated slightly to  3 23 as of Sep 30  2017  it remains at high levels  Its debt to capital ratio remains to the south of 55   Such high debt levels may limit the company s expansion plans and aggravate risks  Higher interest expense on debt is also expected to impact profits 
These headwinds have weighed on its stock which lost 0 8  in 2017  underperforming the  s growth of 6 4   Its performance pales all the more  relative to other players in the same space like HCA Healthcare Inc    NYSE HCA   and UnitedHealth Services Inc    NYSE UHS    which gained 18 7  and 6 6   respectively 

Will 2018 be Better 
We do not expect any improvement in the company s U K  operations in the near term  Management anticipates pressure in the labor market to continue due to uncertainty around Brexit which is discouraging healthcare workers from coming to the country  consequently forcing the company to rely more on agency labor to fill its open positions 
Also  the low admissions witnessed in the third quarter did not show up in October  making  management to expect soft volumes in the fourth quarter

34919,256434,ACHC,Is Acadia Healthcare  ACHC  A Great Stock For Value Investors Right Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Acadia Healthcare Company  Inc    NASDAQ ACHC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Acadia Healthcare has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 3  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Acadia Healthcare s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months However  the stock s PE compares unfavorably with the Zacks Medical   Hospitals industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 16 5  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Acadia Healthcare has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 16 8  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Acadia Healthcare stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Acadia Healthcare has a P S ratio of about 1 3  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  ACHC is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Acadia Healthcare currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Acadia Healthcare a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Acadia Healthcare might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of D  This gives ACHC a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen six up and four down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up by 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Acadia Healthcare Company  Inc  Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAcadia Healthcare is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover   a solid industry rank  Top 12  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  United Therapeutics sold a mere 1 billion

34921,256436,ACHC,Healthcare Q1 Earnings Due On May 1  AET  HCA  WCG  ACHC,opinion,The first quarter earnings season has crossed the half way mark and has showcased strong results with earnings and revenue growth on track to reach the highest level in seven years Per the latest   total earnings for the 267 S P 500 members that have reported results already are up 25 1  from the same period last year on 10  higher revenues  The beat ratio is impressive with 76 8  companies surpassing bottom line expectations and 73 8  outperforming on the top line The Medical sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  is expected to deliver 12 9  earnings growth on 7  higher revenues in the first quarter  This is  however  shy of the projected 22 6  and 8 4  revenue and earnings growth  respectively  for the S P 500 index Healthcare is part of the broader medical sector  which includes diversified industries like health maintenance organizations  HMOs  popularly known as health insurers  clinical  laboratories and diagnostics research  medical equipment  hospitals   nursing homes  telehealth services and more  The sector is so diverse that a single factor influencing one industry positively can be a negative for another  For example flu  which causes an increase in medical services utilization  is an earnings driver for the hospital space  while a negative for insurers as it causes a spike in claims cost To put it into perspective  the January March 2018 period was an unexpectedly brutal flu season  which led to a spike in medical cost for insurers  But because of UnitedHealth s superior medical cost management  the flu season did not have any adverse impact on the company s results  UnitedHealth is considered a bellwether for the other companies and its results provide a broad picture of the industry that despite increased flu  the first quarter will be profitable Health insurers are likely to have witnessed an increase in premium and enrollment from the government businesses   Medicare  Medicare Advantage and Medicaid  A surge in the baby boomer population has led to higher demand for these policies  Earnings should also see an upside from ancillary and health service businesses  which health insurers have been investing in for the past many years to diversify revenue base  These businesses which focus on data management  management of clinical records  analytics  clinical care  pharmacy care and more have been a nice contributor to the group s earnings in recent years and the trend is expected to continue However  this severe flu season should be a shot in the arm for care providers and other companies all along the pharmaceutical supply chain  as it would lead to higher revenues from increasing hospital visits and drug sales  Companies in the hospital sector should see increased patient revenues and admissions as more patients seek medical help  which in turn should drive their top line growth Nevertheless  the hospital companies should continue to feel the heat  from walk in clinics and other outpatient treatment options that have been eating into their admissions volumes for past many quarters Let s find out where the following healthcare stocks stand ahead of their first quarter releases on May 1 Aetna Inc    NYSE AET    is expected to gain from the projected increase in net income and adjusted earnings resulting from lower taxes  strong growth in individual Medicare Advantage products and group Medicare Advantage products  as well as lesser losses from the exiting Individual Commercial products in 2018 A decline in tax

earnings upside from favorable exchange rates However  the company s first quarter results are expected to suffer from industry wide softness in volumes  Factors like payor initiatives to move volumes away from hospitals  rising deductibles and the prevalence of high deductible health plans  and an increased proportion of hospital care to be paid by consumers are likely to lower volumes The Zacks

34922,256437,ACHC,4 Healthy Stocks From An Ailing Hospital Industry,opinion,"The U S hospital industry of late has been suffering from weak patient admissions  soaring costs  high bad debts  regulatory hurdles  etc 
Headwinds Faced by the Industry 
The  is suffering from low admissions as patients are increasingly choosing to stay away from hospitals due to high out of pocket  which shift the initial costs to patients  costs  Though the industry gained from a decline in uninsured rates from the Affordable Care Act  ACA   the current scenario remains gloomy 
Also  a pullback of insurers from public exchanges has increased the uninsured rate which  in turn  is hurting the players  Given the continued uncertainty about the future of ACA  the present scenario is likely to continue in the quarters ahead which will drain business volumes for the players 
Major companies like Tenet Healthcare Corp    NYSE THC    Acadia Healthcare  Inc    NASDAQ ACHC    Community Health Systems  Inc    NYSE CYH   have been witnessing gradual decline in their top line in the recent quarters 
Rising trend in medical costs also continues to hurt the companies  Hospitals are consolidating to reduce costs and improve negotiating power with suppliers and payers 
Noise Over ACA Repeal Replace
President Donald Trump intended to repeal and replace the ACA as part of regulatory reform  However  the U S Senate has rejected the bill resulting in uncertainty regarding the future of the deal  This is expected to affect the uninsured rates and weak patient volume in the United States 
Industry Rank and Price Performance 
The hospital industry is currently ranked  204  which represents the bottom 23  of the Zacks Industry Rank 
The weakness in the industry is also evident from the year to date return of 5 9  compared with 10 7  gain registered by the S P 500 market 

Growth Prospects
Despite these headwinds  from an investment standpoint  the U S  hospital industry is likely to be transformed over the coming decades after the nullification of these short term issues  New companies have started using technologically updated methods in treating patients  The regulatory reform is likely to settle down  going forward 
Moreover  as the industry moves to a payment model that incentivizes consumer value  consumer becomes a more powerful decision maker  In addition  innovative medical devices are entering the market and making surgeries and diagnostics more efficient  removing costs from the system

34925,256440,ACHC,Obamacare Replacement Bill Revised  Hospital Stocks In Focus,opinion,"Senate Republican leaders released a revised plan for President Donald Trump s health care reform  on Jul 13  The release was based on the The Republican administration s vow to  repeal and replace  the 2010 Affordable Care Act  popularly known as Obamacare 
Earlier  Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders had to suffer setbacks with the healthcare bill for the replacement of Obamacare after failing to garner enough votes to pass the bill   A key concern with the new health care act is that a large number of Americans would lose coverage 
The concern was further justified by a report issued by the Congressional Budget Office  According to the report  if the new act were to go through  14 million people would be uninsured in 2018  The number is expected to increase to 21 million in 2020 and 24 million in 2026 
For Republicans it is now a race against time as the scheduled summer recess is knocking at the door  However  plans have already been chalked to delay the process and pass the bill through Senate   
The GOP s new plan proposes major changes versus its original proposal to replace Obamacare  These changes include allowing insurers to offer cheaper services  no frills policies  taxing the wealthy and extra funding for opioid  The revision was made in an effort to garner more conservative support  However GOP S internal misgivings about the plan alongside steep democratic opposition have put a question mark on the fate of the revised bill 
Effect on Hospital Stocks
The question that arises now is whether hospital stocks stand to gain or lose on Capitol Hill  The market remained jittery for a major part of the week due to the uncertainty surrounding the future of the healthcare act  Hospital stocks  which were suffering after election results were announced on Nov 8  2016  were lukewarm over the proposed changes  These stocks benefited significantly under Obamacare  given the rise in the number of people with health insurance coverage 
Supporters for the Republican alternative argue that if the proposed changes are implemented  the sector would get paid for several services that earlier were free of charge  Opponents point out that the customer base would shrink as a significant chunk of the population would lose their healthcare coverage 
We believe that major hospital stocks like Universal Health Services  Inc    NYSE UHS    HCA Holdings  Inc    NYSE HCA    LifePoint Health Inc    NASDAQ LPNT    Tenet Healthcare Corp    NYSE THC   and Community Health Systems  Inc    NYSE CYH   will suffer immensely  The stocks will be affected because the no frills insurance policy would be akin to an increase in the uninsured rate  With bare bone insurance policies  patients will have less insurance coverage and must shell out from their pockets to avail of medical services  This would lead to an increase in bad debts Medical   Hospital Industry 5YR   Return
The market perception can be gauged from the fact that only Acadia Healthcare Company  Inc    NASDAQ ACHC   currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see   Overall the Zacks classified Medical Hospitals sub industry posted a meager gain of only 0 7  over the past three months  Also  the current level compares unfavorably with the S P 500 s return of 4 2  over the same time frame

34929,256444,ACHC,Why Diligence Matters  Don t Buy Acadia Healthcare s Roll Up,opinion,"We put behavioral healthcare provider Acadia Healthcare Company  NASDAQ ACHC    just over a year ago  and the stock has been on a wild ride since  The stock plummeted nearly 40  in the second half of 2016 on the back of disappointing earnings and regulatory concerns over its acquisition of Priory Group  Most of that decline has been reversed in 2017 due  in large part  to political developments 

Overall  the stock is down roughly 4  since our original report against a 14  gain for the S P 500  Despite the company touting its impressive non GAAP numbers  the stock is just as dangerous as ever 

Non GAAP Numbers Mislead Investors

Acadia and other companies that pursue a roll up strategy often benefit from the confusion and opacity surrounding their financial statements  Acquisitions create unusual  non recurring expenses that distort GAAP net income  which companies like to use as justification for touting their own non GAAP metrics instead 

For Acadia   Adjusted EBITDA  is the non GAAP number to which they point investors  Here s a helpful hint  if a company talks about Adjusted EBITDA  run  The metric is a favorite of roll up schemes such as Verint Systems Inc  NASDAQ VRNT  and   NYSE VRX  as well as highly unprofitable companies like Snap  NYSE SNAP  and Pandora  NYSE P  

Adjusted EBITDA lets companies ignore all the capital costs involved in acquisitions  for which they often over pay  and throw out real operating costs such as stock compensation while they re at it  Figure 1 shows just how much Acadia s Adjusted EBITDA diverges from GAAP earnings and economic earnings over the past few years 

Figure 1  Acadia s Adjusted EBITDA Dramatically Overstates Profits



Source  New Constructs  LLC  and company filings

Exec Comp Plan Rewards Value Destruction

2016 saw Acadia report record profits on a non GAAP basis even as the company destroyed record amounts of shareholder value with the  2 2 billion Priory Group acquisition 

As a result  executive compensation soared to new heights even as cash flows plummeted  CEO Joey Jacobs earned  9 4 million in 2016  his highest annual compensation on record  despite Acadia posting its worst ever economic earnings and the stock falling by 47   As long as Acadia ties executive compensation to Adjusted EBITDA  its executives are incentivized to carry out expensive acquisitions that destroy shareholder value 

Roll Up Strategy Still Isn t Working

Acadia operates in the Behavioral Healthcare field  which focuses on treating people with mental illness and addiction  The industry is fairly fragmented  and the bull case for Acadia has rested on the idea that it can reap efficiency gains through consolidation 

As Figure 1 shows  the consolidation theory has not borne out  As Acadia has poured more money into acquisitions  it has failed to earn enough of a return on invested capital    to generate positive economic earnings 

It should not be surprising that these acquisitions have failed to generate shareholder value  Behavioral healthcare is a highly localized field  so the typical acquisition benefits of pricing power and economies of scale are largely absent  Acadia s theory has been that it can create excess value at the facilities it acquires by improving patient care and expanding referral networks  but this strategy is not working 

In fact  Acadia continues to rank near the bottom of its peer group in terms of ROIC  per Figure 2  Longer term Acadia s ROIC has fallen from 9  in 2012 to the current bottom quintile 4  TTM 

Figure 2  Acadia s ROIC Lags The Competition



Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 

Despite the poor track record  the company continues to pursue its acquisition based strategy  On the latest earnings call  CEO Joey Jacobs told analysts   We are continuing to actively evaluate additional acquisitions  

Repeating Our Warning

All the negatives on ACHC that we articulated last July have only worsened  Management is doubling down on the failed strategy and misleading accounting practices that landed ACHC in the Danger Zone in the first place  The company s non GAAP Adjusted EBITDA has become even more misleading  its acquisition strategy more destructive  and its liabilities larger  Investors who heeded our first warning avoided a year of highly volatile underperformance  We recommend investors continue to avoid this stock  Anyone who owns it should take the gains from the past few months before they reverse 

Bull Case Dependent on Uncertain Political Situation

Much of ACHC s gain so far in 2017 has been due to political developments  Investors breathed a sigh of relief after the Obamacare repeal bills that would have cut Medicaid   which makes up 25  of Acadia s revenues    died in the Senate 

Meanwhile  the company has seen a spike in government support due to increased political attention to the opioid crisis  The company recently received  4 million in government funding through the   and many expect to see more money flowing to addiction treatment facilities in the near future 

While these are certainly welcome developments to ACHC investors  the market seems to have overreacted  Medicaid could still face cuts  and it s unclear how much more money the government is willing to commit to combat opioid addiction  In addition  a good portion of the government money out there will likely be allocated to the large general hospital operators such as HCA 

Any company whose outlook depends heavily on government actions faces a high degree of risk  especially in a political climate as uncertain as ours 

ACHC is Overvalued Compared To Peers

Government regulatory risk might be worth taking if ACHC were cheaply valued  but it is not  The stock approached a reasonable valuation when it bottomed in early January  but today it is  again  highly overvalued 

Figure 3 shows ACHC and its peers compared on the basis of ROIC and  divided by   a cleaner version of price to book   As you can see  ROIC explains 92  of the difference in enterprise value divided by invested capital for these stocks 

Figure 3  ROIC Vs  Enterprise Value Per Invested Capital For Behavioral Healthcare Stocks



Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings

ACHC stands out as the major outlier in Figure 3  trading at a significant premium to its peers  The stock s valuation implies that the market expects its ROIC to increase from the current 3 9  to 6 3   Immediately achieving a 6 3  ROIC on current revenue and invested capital equates to an increase in NOPAT margin from 10   TTM  to 16   The average NOPAT margin for healthcare facilities operators in Figure 3 is 7   As such  ACHC achieving the operational efficiency necessary to reach 16  NOPAT margin seems highly unlikely 

Our discounted cash flow model tells a similar story  In order to justify its current valuation of   51 share  ACHC would need to grow operating profit    at  at an average ROIC of nearly 6   This expectation seems optimistic given ACHC s history of shareholder value destruction 

Even if we assume ACHC could achieve 2016 NOPAT margins  10   and   the stock is worth only  34 share today   a 33  downside  This scenario also assumes the company is able to grow revenue and NOPAT without increasing working capital or investing in fixed assets  This assumption is unlikely given the firm s acquisition history but allows us to create a very optimistic scenario  For reference  ACHC s invested capital has grown on average  1 3 billion  47  of revenue  each year for the past five years 

Is ACHC Worth Acquiring 

The largest risk to our bear thesis is what we call  stupid money risk   which means an acquirer comes in and pays a premium price despite ACHC stock being overvalued  Investors may hope that ACHC can avoid having to meet the lofty expectations embedded in its stock price by getting acquired by a larger competitor  but that outcome appears unlikely  We discussed the challenges facing any potential acquirer in our original Danger Zone report on ACHC  and those challenges have only grown 

In particular  the Priory acquisition added over  1 billion in debt to Acadia  bringing its debt total to  3 9 billion  87  of market cap   which includes  635 million  14  of market cap  in off balance sheet debt  These liabilities could make a deal prohibitively expensive for any potential acquirer 

Insider Selling and High Short Interest Raises Red Flags

Some of Acadia s directors seem to agree that the stock is overvalued  On July 31  just three days after executives touted the company s Adjusted EBITDA growth on the 2Q earnings call  two members of the Board of Directors sold 3 6 million shares worth   190 million 

Over the past 12 months  ACHC insiders have sold 11 7 million shares and purchased 230 thousand  for a net impact of 11 5 million shares sold  These sales represent 13  of shares outstanding 

Additionally  there are 24 1 million shares sold short  or just over 27  of shares outstanding  Short interest at this level indicates we are far from alone in our assessment of ACHC 

Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic Accounting

Our Robo Analyst technology enables us to perform forensic accounting with scale and provide the research needed to fulfill fiduciary duties  In order to derive the true recurring cash flows  an accurate invested capital  and a real shareholder value  we made the following adjustments to Acadia s 2016 10 K 

Income Statement  we made  604 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing  285 million in non operating expenses  10  of revenue   We removed  445 million related to non operating expenses and  160 million related to non operating income  See all adjustments made to ACHC s income statement  

Balance Sheet  we made  1 7 billion of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net increase of  1 billion  The most notable adjustment was the  635 million in off balance sheet debt referenced above  See all adjustments to ACHC s balance sheet  

Valuation  we made  4 billion of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by  4 billion   3 9 billion  85  of market cap  of the decrease in value came from the removal of ACHC s total debt  which includes the operating leases noted above

34931,256446,ACHC,Can Acadia Be A Solid Choice For Value Investors ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Acadia Healthcare Company  Inc    NASDAQ ACHC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Acadia has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 18  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 30  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Acadia s current PE level puts it significantly lower than its midpoint over the past three years  with the number remaining somewhat stable over the past year However  the stock s PE also compares unfavorably with the Zacks classified Medical   Hospital sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 90  This indicates that the stock is overvalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Acadia has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 18 54  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Acadia stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Acadia has a P S ratio of about 1 37  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15 right now Acadia is actually trading at historically low levels in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Acadia currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Acadia a good choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too Additionally  the PEG ratio for Acadia is just 1 06  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 53  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate What About the Stock Overall Though Acadia might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  B   This gives Acadia a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been unfavorable  The current quarter has seen five estimates going down in the past sixty days compared to two movements in the opposite direction  while the full year estimate has seen four down in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 1 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has dropped 0 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Acadia Healthcare Company  Inc  Price and Consensus
     Notably  the stock has a long term expected earnings growth of 17 6  and holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   These mixed expectations indicate that while the stock s growth story might be good over the long term  analysts have some apprehensions about the stock in the immediate future  Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAcadiais an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among the Bottom 19  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Medical Hospital s industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ",2017-06-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-acadia-be-a-solid-choice-for-value-investors-200196060,200196060

35010,256525,ACHC,Trump Amending AHCA  Is The Medical Device Space Anxious ,opinion,"The buzz over the final shape over Obamacare  or the Affordable Care Act  ACA   is continuing in Capitol Hill  Last month  the lukewarm response to its replacement  The American Health Care Act  AHCA   has forced Republicans to seek new avenues In a bid to save its face  the Trump administration is attempting to keep the American Health Care Act  AHCA  viable by proposing a new amendment to the bill  Such an action comes as no surprise since President Trump has always been an outspoken critic of the ACA Proposed AmendmentThe proposed amendment submitted to the House of Ways and Means Committee consists of the creation of a risk sharing program as part of the AHCA s Patient and State Stability Fund  PSSF   The aim is to set aside funds to be used in covering a portion of costs alongside insurers  This would invariably result in bringing down premium costs while accommodating more people under the healthcare umbrella  Earlier  a projection by the Congressional Budget Office  CBO  estimated that in a decade from now  approximately 24 million Americans would lose insurance coverage if AHCA was passed in its original form Per the proposed amendment  the government would set aside  15 billion within the PSSF  The Health Department would then carry out the risk sharing program by providing payments to health insurers for individual claims  The sharing of the burden by the government would result in lower premiums allowing the insurance umbrella to cast a wider net  If the amendment is enacted it would be effective from Jan 1  2018  However  on the flip side  the risk sharing program does not affect the major provisions of the bill that cut spending and funding for federal healthcare programs BackdropIn place of Obamacare  the Republican proposal called The American Healthcare Act  AHA  meant to bring about far reaching changes  The alternative proposes radical changes like eliminating taxes mandated under Obamacare  The most controversial topic in the new Republican health draft is the phasing out of the Affordable Care Act s Medicaid expansion The Republican proposal seeks to change the mandatory requirement to purchase insurance with a system of penalties to be imposed by insurers  It also aims to replace subsidies with tax credits that are refundable  Also  the burden will be put more on the state level  Finally  all the taxes levied under Obamacare would be abolished Effect on Medical Device SpaceThe foremost question that arises now is whether Medical Device stocks stand to gain or lose on the developments at Capitol Hill  Supporters for the Republican alternative argue that if the proposed amendment is implemented  more people would be covered as a portion of the cost would be borne by the government 
Earlier  the market was abuzz with concerns that AHCA bill would strip healthcare coverage for millions of poor Americans and non American inhabitants  Needless to mention  this would have led to shrinking customer base for the MedTech companies post the enactment of ACHA On the other hand  the medical device fraternity was happy with the original Trump action plan which had promised cancellation of major healthcare taxes including the two signature taxes of Obamacare  the unpopular Cadillac tax  40  excise tax on high cost healthcare plans  and the controversial 2 3  MedTech tax In such a mixed space  we would advise investors to steer clear of Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Medical Device stocks like Acadia Healthcare Company Inc    NASDAQ ACHC    Tenet Healthcare Corp    NYSE THC    West Pharmaceutical Services Inc    NYSE WST    and Irhythm Technologies Inc    NASDAQ IRTC     
On the other hand  investors ready to profit from Zacks wisdom in the near term could start accumulating Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and 2  Buy  stocks like athenahealth  Inc    NASDAQ ATHN    Becton Dickinson and Company   NYSE BDX   and Inogen Inc    NASDAQ INGN   within this space  You can see  Each of these stocks show a strong pricing figure and has been able to surpass the Zacks categorized  industry year to date  While the broader industry has increased almost 8 0  during the aforesaid period  shares of athenahealth  Becton Dickinson and Inogen have gained 9 3   11 0  and 14 3   respectively End NoteRegardless of which path you choose  the final version of healthcare legislation to be approved can make or break fortunes  It all boils down to how confident you are over the Medical Devices space over the short term  If Obamacare continues then going long is probably right for you  Then again  if Republicans continue with their face saving gestures the space may not be your ideal option right now

front The sector has been in limelight since the change of power at the White House  President Donald Trump  who is keen to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Act more popularly called the Obamacare  has injected a fresh dose of uncertainty in the industry  His version of the policy called the American Health Care Act  AHCA  received a lukewarm response  and called for further amendments to the proposed bill  The proposed amendment calls for setting aside funds to be used in covering a portion of costs alongside insurers  This would invariably result in bringing down premium costs while accommodating more people under the healthcare umbrella Had the AHCA been passed in its original form  without the proposed amendment   around 6 10 million Americans may have lost coverage  This would invariably have resulted in shrinkage in the customer base for hospital companies as a chunk of the population would lose their healthcare coverage  If the amendment is enacted  it would be effective from Jan 1  2018 The ultimate impact on the fortunes of hospital stocks will depend on the face of the law that still remains to take its final shape In the mean time  let s take

35024,256539,ACHC,Sector Detector  Neutral  But A Few Bullish Catalysts On Horizon,opinion,"Stocks are hitting new highs across the board  even though earnings reports have been somewhat disappointing  Actually  to be more precise  Q4 results have been pretty good  but it is forward guidance that has been cautious and or cloudy as sales into overseas markets are expected to suffer due to strength in the US dollar  Healthcare and Telecom have put in the best results overall  while of course Energy has been the weakling  Still  overall year over year earnings growth for the S P 500 during 2015 is expected to be about  8  

In this weekly update  I give my view of the current market environment  offer a technical analysis of the S P 500 chart  review our weekly fundamentals based SectorCast rankings of the ten U S  business sectors  and then offer up some actionable trading ideas  including a sector rotation strategy using ETFs and an enhanced version using top ranked stocks from the top ranked sectors 

Market overview 

Despite cautious earnings guidance and a steady stream of doom and gloom in the news from all corners of the globe  the Dow Jones Industrials closed last week above 18 000  while the S P 500 is pushing for a close above 2100 and the NASDAQ is gunning for 4900  For the week  the Dow gained  1 1   the S P 500  2 0   and the NASDAQ  3 2   Furthermore  the SPDR S P 400 Mid Cap Growth  NYSE MDYG   the Russell 2000 small caps  and the Wilshire 5000 have all achieved new highs  as well  Evidently  U S  equities remain a relative safe haven for cautious but hungry global investors who have cheap money in their clutches  thanks to global liquidity and currency wars 

Craig Lazzara of S P Dow Jones Indices  earlier in the month in which he observed that while the S P 500 total return was  3  in January  the strengthening dollar versus euro exchange rate allowed European investors to earn  4  by holding dollar denominated U S  equities  as the euro fell  7  against the dollar 
So  assuming the dollar continues to generally strengthen against other currencies  the U S  stands to benefit from global capital flows  even as earnings among multinational U S  firms encounter headwinds from the same strong dollar  This suggests the potential for near term expansion in valuation multiples  which is not necessarily desirable  The forward P E for the S P 500 is now about 16 5x 

But that is about the only near term bullish catalyst  Instead  news events and the threat of a sudden Black Swan remain in the forefront of investors  minds  new highs in stocks notwithstanding  Not the least of which is the steadily metastasizing cancer of radical Islam    most prominently ISIS  with its Nazi esque mass brainwashing and barbaric ethnic cleansings 
This  along with ongoing issues in places like Greece  Ukraine  China  and Africa  including severe weather here in the U S    all contribute to the overall cautious sentiment displayed by investors and analysts alike  High quality companies with solid business models and conservative accounting practices will reap the benefits 

Although bond yields remain quite low  further supporting the case for equities  U S  yields have turned upwards  Just this month alone  the 10 Year Treasury yield has leapt from a low of 1 67  to 2 04  on Friday  and 2 15  on Monday   The UK s 10 Year closed Friday at 1 71   the German bund is at 0 36  Japan  is at 0 39   and Switzerland is yielding a lowly 0 05   Some are speculating that the time is ripe to begin scaling into floating rate asset classes 

Last week s strength in the equity markets led the  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  to close Friday at 14 69  which is its first close below 15 this year  reflecting some temporary investor complacency 

SPY chart review 

The SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY  closed Friday at 209 78 and is making new highs    albeit just barely and without a resounding  confidence inducing breakout  SPY price remains above both its 20 day and 50 day simple moving averages  It is in a minor uptrend  as shown in the chart  as it has broken out of the neutral sideways channel that I said last week was still more likely to resolve as a continuation pattern  i e   bullish  
Oscillators RSI and MACD are still pointing up bullishly  but Slow Stochastic remains overbought and needs a consolidation or a slight pullback  Although the chart certainly looks bullish  I still think it is likely that we will get a longer period of consolidation  and perhaps some retesting of support levels  before there is enough conviction to go much higher  Important support levels reside at the 50 day SMA approaching 205  the 100 day SMA and the lower uptrend line  which are both approaching 202  and then the critical 200 day SMA near 198 



Latest sector rankings  

Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multi factor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 

In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 

Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used 
We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  NYSE IYF   Technology  NYSE IYW   Industrial  NYSE IYJ   Healthcare  NYSE IYH   Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK   Consumer Services  NYSE IYC   Energy  NYSE IYE   Basic Materials  NYSE IYM   Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ   and Utilities  NYSE IDU   Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contains stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 

 Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 

1  The parade of downward revisions to forward earnings estimates from the sell side analyst community continues  Energy continues to take the brunt of it  but all sectors are soundly negative  The three tier rankings are still in place  but it is notable that Utilities has moved from the second tier to the top tier  joining Healthcare  Financial  and Technology 
Healthcare has moved to first place with an Outlook score of 84  It displays the best sentiment among both analysts and insiders  solid return ratios  and a good forward long term growth rate  Financial takes second place with a score of 79 on the strength of its low forward P E  despite downward earnings revisions   reasonably good forward long term growth rate  and strong insider sentiment  buying activity  
Technology still displays the best return ratios  a solid forward long term growth rate  and solid insider sentiment  The Outlook score for Utilities strengthened mainly because of the price underperformance relative to the other sectors  The next tier includes defensive sector Telecom  Consumer Services Discretionary  and Industrial  whose scores are all bunched around 50  And at the bottom we still see Consumer Goods Staples  Basic Materials  and Energy 

2  It is no surprise that Energy continues to hold the bottom spot given the persistent weakness in oil prices and the ongoing downward earnings revisions  Energy also shows the worst forward long term growth rate  the highest  worst  forward P E  and the worst insider sentiment  Joining Energy in the bottom two again is Basic Materials  Of course  the strength of the dollar is also impacting both sectors 

3  Looking at the Bull scores  Energy displays the top score of 61  followed by Materials and Technology at 59  Utilities scores the lowest at 48  The top bottom spread is 13 points  which is still somewhat on the low side but better than the tight spreads we were seeing a few weeks ago  It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold 

4  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities displays the highest score of 54 this week  which means that stocks within this sector have been the preferred safe havens on weak market days  although not so clearly preferred as in the past when the Bear score was above 70  Financial has the lowest score of 41  followed closely by Energy  The top bottom spread is 13 points  which like the Bull scores is somewhat on the low side  Ideally  certain sectors will hold up relatively well while others are selling off  Again  it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations and a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 

5  Healthcare displays the best all around combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  while Energy is the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Healthcare is also the strongest  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   while Financial is the worst 

6  Overall  this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings look even more neutral in my view    and perhaps even a bit defensive    as market sentiment continues to grow more cautionary  All weather sector Healthcare has risen to the top  and the sectors with the strongest Bull scores  Energy and Materials  are at the bottom of the Outlook rankings  while two of the top five sectors are defensive  Utilities and Telecom  with the highest Bear scores  Keep in mind  the Outlook Rank does not include timing or momentum factors  but rather is a reflection of the fundamental expectations of individual stocks aggregated by sector 

Stock and ETF Ideas 

Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or defensive   retains its bullish bias  and the model suggests holding Technology  Financial  and Healthcare  in that order   Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be bullish from a rules based trend following standpoint when SPY is above both its 50 day and 200 day simple moving averages  

Other highly ranked ETFs from the Technology  Financial  and Healthcare sectors include First Trust NASDAQ CEA Smartphone Index Fund  NASDAQ FONE   PowerShares KBW Insurance Portfolio  NYSE KBWI   and iShares US Healthcare Providers  NYSE IHF  

For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists some top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within the top ranked sectors  some long ideas from Technology  Financial  and Healthcare sectors include Marvell Technology Group  NASDAQ MRVL   Avago Technologies  NASDAQ AVGO   The Blackstone Group  NYSE BX   Ameriprise Financial  NYSE AMP   Acadia Healthcare  NASDAQ ACHC   and MEDNAX NYSE MD   All are highly ranked in the Sabrient Ratings Algorithm 

However  if you prefer to maintain a neutral bias  the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Healthcare  Financial  and Technology  in that order  And if you prefer a defensive stance on the market  the model suggests holding Utilities  Healthcare  and Telecommunications  in that order

35025,256540,ACHC,Europe And Asia Fall Amid Global Growth Concerns,opinion,"The U S  stock markets rang in the New Year with solid losses  with another series of disappointing Chinese manufacturing data and escalating tensions in the Middle East as a backdrop to resurfacing global concerns  Treasuries were higher amid the downtrodden sentiment  with mixed reads on U S  manufacturing output adding fuel to the negativity  In the meantime  crude oil prices were lower  while gold and the U S  dollar were higher 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  tumbled 276 points  1 6   to 17 149  the S P 500 Index dropped 31 points  1 5   to 2 013 and the Nasdaq Composite plunged 104 points  1 2   to 4 903  In heavy volume  1 1 billion shares were traded on the NYSE and 2 2 billion shares changed hands on the Nasdaq  WTI crude oil fell  0 28 to  36 76 per barrel  but wholesale gasoline gained  0 02 to  1 27 per gallon  while the Bloomberg gold spot price increased  13 81 to  1 074 91 per ounce  Elsewhere  the dollar index a comparison of the U S  dollar to six major world currencies was 0 2  higher at 98 84 
Bloomberg is reporting that Dublin based Shire PLC  O SHPG   SHPG  198  is in advanced talks to acquire Illinois based drugmaker Baxalta Inc  N BXLT   BXLT  41  for about  32 0 billion in cash and stock in a deal that could be announced as soon as this week  per people familiar with the matter  According to the report  the final details of the transaction are still being negotiated and the timing and structure of any offer may change  Neither company has commented on the report  BXLT finished higher  while SHPG was solidly lower 
Acadia Healthcare Company Inc  O ACHC    ACHC  64  announced that it has reached an agreement to acquire U K  behavioral healthcare services company Priory Group for about  1 9 billion in cash and stock  Shares of ACHC were higher 
Manufacturing activity mixed  kicking off the year and heavy week of data
The Institute for Supply Management  ISM  Manufacturing Index in December unexpectedly fell further into a level depicting contraction  below 50   declining to 48 2 from November s 48 6 level  and compared to the Bloomberg forecast calling for a modest rise to 49 0  This was the second straight month of contraction  with employment falling below 50 and the contraction in prices accelerating  while new orders rose modestly but remained in contraction territory at 49 2 
The final Markit U S  Manufacturing PMI Index was revised slightly lower to 51 2 from the 51 3 preliminary level for December  and versus expectations of a slight downward revision to 51 1  The index was down from the 52 8 level posted in November  though a reading above 50 denotes expansion  The release is independent and differs from ISM s manufacturing report  as it has less historic value and Markit weights its index components differently 
As noted in the recent   while manufacturing is important and shouldn t be ignored  it represents only 12  of U S  economic activity  while the export market is a relatively small part of overall gross domestic product  GDP   The services side of the economy  representing 88  of U S  activity   in contrast  remained healthy throughout 2015 and looks to continue that performance entering 2016  Additionally  the U S  consumer looks to be in good shape heading into the New Year 
Construction spending unexpectedly declined by 0 4  month over month  m m  in November  versus projections of a 0 6  advance  and following the downwardly revised 0 3  increase seen in October  Residential spending rose 0 2   while non residential spending declined 0 8  m m 
Treasuries finished higher  as the yields on the 2 Year and 10 Year notes  as well as the 30 Year bond all declined 3 basis points  bps  to 1 02   2 22  and 2 98   respectively 
Tomorrow s economic calendar will be very light  with the only item of note being the release of domestic auto sales throughout the day 
Europe and Asia fall amid global growth concerns
European equities traded broadly lower  with global growth concerns being amplified by another round of lackluster Chinese manufacturing data  Also  global sentiment was hamstrung by heightened geopolitical concerns with tensions escalating in the Middle East as Saudi Arabia severed diplomatic ties with Iran over the weekend  The euro was lower versus the U S  dollar and bond yields in the region lost ground  In economic news in the region  Markit s final Eurozone Manufacturing PMI Index for December was revised slightly higher to 53 2 from the preliminary level of 53  where economists had expected it to remain  and compared to November s 52 8 figure  A reading above 50 denotes expansion  Moreover  preliminary German consumer price inflation unexpectedly dipped in December  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index posted the worst start to the year ever  per Bloomberg  led by basic materials issues 
Stocks in Asia sold off broadly  led by a 6 9  tumble for the Shanghai Composite Index following a triggered trading halt during the session  A couple of lackluster Chinese manufacturing reports caused a flare up in global economic growth concerns  while escalated tensions in the Middle East exacerbated sentiment  China s official Manufacturing PMI Index ticked higher to 49 7 in December  from 49 6 in November  and compared to the rise to 49 8 that was expected  Also  the Caixin Markit China PMI Manufacturing Index declined to 48 2 last month  from the prior month s 48 6 figure  and versus the projected improvement to 48 9  Readings below 50 for both indexes denote contraction  Stocks in Hong Kong also lost ground  while a rally in the yen on the Chinese data pressured Japanese equities  Australian securities declined  but losses were limited by oil and gas issues  which gained ground on a rebound in oil prices on the Middle East tensions  while listings in India and South Korea also fell 
The international economic calendar will also be fairly quiet  as items slated for release include employment data from Germany  and CPI figures from Italy and the eurozone

Most Attractive Stock Feature for July  Syntel Inc   SYNT   47 share 
Syntel Inc   NASDAQ SYNT   information technology and knowledge process outsourcing provider  is one of the additions to our Most Attractive stocks for July 
Syntel has built a highly profitable business by providing outsourced IT services and knowledge process outsourcing to companies across the globe  Over the past decade  Syntel has grown after tax profit  NOPAT  by an impressive 21  compounded annually to  221 million  NOPAT has increased to  233 million over the last twelve months  per Figure 1 

Figure 1  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Every year since 1998  Syntel has earned a return on invested capital  ROIC  above 30  and currently earns a top quintile 42  ROIC  Additionally  Syntel s NOPAT margin has improved from 14  in 2005 to 24  over the last twelve months 
Impacts of Footnotes Adjustments And Forensic Accounting
In order to derive the true recurring cash flows  an accurate invested capital  and an accurate shareholder value  we made the following adjustments to Syntel s 2015 10 K 
Income Statement  we made  55 million of adjustments  with a net effect of removing  31 million in non operating income  3  of revenue   We removed  31 million in non operating income and  12 million in non operating expenses 
Balance Sheet  we made  1 5 billion of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of  683 million  One of the largest adjustments was  236 million due to other comprehensive income  This adjustment represented 20  of reported net assets  You can see all the adjustments made to SYNT s balance sheet here 
Valuation  we made  1 2 billion of adjustments with a net effect of increasing shareholder value by  900 million  The largest adjustment was the inclusion of  1 1 billion in excess cash  This adjustment represents 27  of Syntel s market cap 
Current Valuation Implies No Profit Growth
SYNT has marginally outpaced the broader market and is up 5  year to date  compared to 4 5  S P 500   However  at its current valuation  SYNT is significantly undervalued and currently has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 1 0  This ratio means that the market expects SYNT s NOPAT to never meaningfully increase from its current levels  This expectation seems rather pessimistic given the past decade of profit growth  If Syntel can grow NOPAT by just 6  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth  65 share today   a 38  upside 
Most Dangerous Stock Feature  Acadia Healthcare  ACHC   54 share 
Acadia Healthcare  ACHC   rehabilitation center provider  is one of the additions to our Most Dangerous stocks for July 
Acadia  NASDAQ ACHC  has grown revenue by an astonishing 69  compounded annually from 2011 2015  Over this time  Acadia s economic earnings  the true cash flows of the business have declined from   13 million to   153 million  Over the last twelve months  economic earnings have fallen even further to   221 million  per Figure 2 

Figure 2  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
In addition to increasing losses  Acadia s ROIC has been persistently low  and the company currently earns a bottom quintile 5  ROIC as of the last twelve months  Further compounding the poor fundamentals  the company has burned through a cumulative   3 4 billion in free cash flow since 2012 
Forensic Accounting Reveals Overstated EPS
In order to derive the true recurring cash flows  an accurate invested capital  and a real shareholder value  we made the following adjustments to Acadia Healthcare s 2015 10 K 
Income Statement  we made  225 million of adjustments with a net impact of removing  104 million in non operating expenses  6  of revenue   We removed  165 million in non operating expenses and  60 million in non operating income 
Balance Sheet  we made  1 2 billion of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of  36 million  The largest adjustment was  579 million related to midyear adjustments  This adjustment represented 15  of reported net assets 
Valuation  we made  3 8 billion of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by  3 8 billion  There were no adjustments that increased shareholder value  The largest adjustment was the removal of  3 8 billion in total debt  which includes  123 million in off balance sheet debt  This adjustment represents 80  of Acadia s market cap 
Overly Optimistic Expectations Baked Into Valuation
Despite the clear breakdown in fundamentals  ACHC is priced for significant profit growth in the future  To justify it s current price of  54 share  ACHC must grow NOPAT  and free cash flow  by 14  compounded annually for the next 12 years  In this scenario  we conservatively assume ACHC can grow NOPAT without any spending on working capital or fixed assets  which is unlikely  but allows us to create a best case scenario  For reference  ACHC s invested capital has grown on average  968 million  54  of 2015 revenue  each year since 2012 
On the other hand  even if ACHC can grow NOPAT by 12  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth only  30 share today   a 44  downside

35029,256544,ACHC,Danger Zone  Acadia Healthcare,opinion,"The high low fallacy makes certain investments appear much more attractive on the surface  When one peers below the surface  the fundamentals of the business are often revealed to be in much worse shape  This week s Danger Zone pick has a history of executing a traditional roll up strategy to great success   if you only care about revenue growth  For those that care about profits  the increasing losses and declining ROIC earn Acadia Healthcare  NASDAQ ACHC  a spot on July s Most Dangerous Stocks list and the Danger Zone this week 
GAAP Growth Masks Cash Costs of Acquisitions
Acadia s economic earnings  the true cash flows of the business  have declined from   13 million in 2012 to   223 million over the trailing twelve months  These losses come despite GAAP net income growing from   35 million in 2011 to  124 million over the last twelve months  See Figure 1 
Figure 1  Disconnect Between Revenue and Economic Earnings

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
The acquisition approach to growth accounts for the large discrepancy between the accounting earnings and economic earnings of ACHC  Since 2011  ACHC has undergone over 25 separate acquisitions  which have cost upwards of  5 3 billion  While these acquisitions are  accretive  to EPS  they are highly dilutive to cash flows and ACHC s balance sheet  From 2011 2015  Acadia s debt grew 66  compounded annually to  2 3 billion  Over the last twelve months  debt has ballooned to nearly  3 8 billion  or 77  of the current market cap 
Smart acquisitions improve ROIC  ACHC s acquisitions have not been smart  Since earning a 9  return on invested capital  ROIC  in 2012  the company s ROIC has declined to a bottom quintile 5  over the last twelve months  Similarly  ACHC has burned through cumulative   3 4 billion in free cash flow from 2011 2015  and over the last twelve months  FCF sits at   2 8 billion  No matter which way you slice it  ACHC s acquisitions have drastically deteriorated the economics of the business 
Misaligned Executive Incentives Mean More Value Destruction To Come
Apart from base salaries  executives at Acadia receive annual cash bonuses and long term stock based awards  The cash bonuses are paid out for meeting adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS goals  As seen in Figure 2  these two metrics paint a much rosier picture than the economics of the business and have significant costs of business removed  Additionally  stock based awards are given based upon meeting adjusted EPS goals and also have a time based vesting requirement  At the end of the day  the metrics chosen to incent executives do very little to create true shareholder value  By removing costs such as compensation expense or acquisition costs  executives can grow the top line and adjusted metrics with little or no attention paid to the economics of their actions  The best way to create shareholder value  and align executives with the best interest of shareholders  is to tie performance bonuses to ROIC because there is a clear correlation between ROIC and shareholder value 
Misleading Adjusted EBITDA Rises While Profits Decline
While the decline in economic earnings is clear  investors following non GAAP metrics would have a vastly different view of the firm  Companies routinely remove normal operating costs to create a more positive picture of business operations and ACHC is a poster child for the dangers of non GAAP earnings  Here are expenses ACHC has removed when calculating its non GAAP metrics  including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS 

Equity based compensation expense
Transaction expenses related to acquisition
Sponsor management fees
Debt extinguishment costs
Loss gain on foreign currency derivatives purchased in relation to acquisitions

These costs can be significant  particularly equity based compensation expense and transaction expenses  In 2015  ACHC removed  20 million  18  of GAAP net income  in equity based compensation expense and  36 million in transaction costs  32  of GAAP net income  to calculate its adjusted EBITDA  By removing these costs  along with the others  ACHC is able to report non GAAP results that are much improved from economic earnings  Adjusted EBITDA grew from  215 million in 2014 to  405 million in 2015  88  year over year  YoY   GAAP net income grew  only  36  YoY while economic earnings declined from   52 million to   153 million  or  194  YoY  This discrepancy  dating back to 2011  can be seen in Figure 2

Lower Profitability Than Main Competitor  Acquisitions Not Adding Competitive Advantage
The behavioral healthcare industry is a specialized subset of the larger healthcare industry  and therefore has fewer true competitors  Acadia Healthcare competes primarily with Universal Health Services  NYSE UHS  and also hospitals and that may offer mental health services  By comparing ROIC  we can get a true measure across these specialized sectors to identify which firms are allocating their capital most efficiently  Per Figure 3  ACHC s ROIC ranks below UHS and general hospital operators such as HCA Holdings Inc  NYSE HCA  
When comparing margins its more apt to compare between UHS s behavioral health segment alone  rather than hospitals in general where margins are impacted due to traditional hospital services  UHS s behavioral health operating margin has topped 20  each year since 2011  and was 23  in 2015  Meanwhile  ACHC s operating margin maxed out at 13  in 2014  and was 9  in 2015  Either way  ACHC has lower margins and ROIC than its direct competitor  which gives it less operational flexibility and pricing power 
Figure 3  ACHC s Profitability Hardly Matches Competition

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
Bull Hopes Rest On Roll Up Continuing
The bull case with all roll up strategies revolves around the company continually finding new acquisition targets  purchasing them  and growing revenue and non GAAP metrics 
With this in mind  ACHC has executed this strategy to perfection  However  the bull case unravels with each acquisition  as the ability to  move the needle  shrinks  An acquisition when a firm generates  200 million in revenue is much more impactful than when the firm generates  2 billion in revenue  Without revenue growth  roll up strategies lose momentum  and the underlying economics of business are revealed for what they truly are 
Additionally  the current bull case would imply that the past acquisitions have been a quality use of capital  which as shown above  is simply not true  The market ultimately rewards firms that generate the highest return for each dollar of capital invested  In the short term  ACHC can report non GAAP metrics that stoke investor interest  but long term  the economics of the business are trending in the wrong direction 
The largest risk to the bear case is simply time  As we know  the market can stay irrational longer than investors can stay solvent  There is no specific timeframe for roll up strategies to slow down and the market wake up to the growing economic losses  In the meantime  another risk is that a hospital or other healthcare provider acquires ACHC  However  as we ll show below  only in the event a firm is willing to destroy shareholder value is ACHC worth more than its current share price 
Roll Up Scheme Worth Acquiring  Not If One Cares About Capital Allocation
The biggest risk to our thesis would be if a competitor were to acquire ACHC at a value at or above today s price  With the low to no growth environment in which many firms find themselves  large companies will overpay to create good optics or superficial EPS growth  regardless of the true economics of the deals  Unfortunately for those hoping for a buyout  we ll show below that Acadia Healthcare is not an attractive acquisition target because unless a competitor is willing to destroy shareholder value  an acquisition at current prices would be unwise 
To begin  ACHC has liabilities that investors may not be aware of that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers suggest 

 123 million in off balance sheet operating leases  3  of market cap 
 53 million in net deferred tax liabilities  1  of market cap 
 12 million in outstanding employee stock options   1  of market cap 

After adjusting for these liabilities we can model multiple purchase price scenarios  Even in the most optimistic of scenarios ACHC is worth less than the current share price 
Figure 4 shows what we think United Health Services  UHS  should pay for ACHC  given different growth scenarios that account for the capital outlay required to achieve such a scenario  UHS acquiring ACHC would increase its existing behavioral health segment while providing additional cross treatment opportunities between its hospital care segment  However  there are limits on how much UHS would pay for ACHC given the cash flows being acquired 
Each implied price is based on a DCF scenario  linked below  assuming different levels of future revenue growth 

Scenario 1  62  in  estimated  year one  14  in  estimated  year two  and 11  in  estimated  year 3 and beyond 
Scenario 2  62  in  estimated  year one  14  in  estimated  year two  and 14  in  estimated  year 3 and beyond 
Scenario 3  62  in  estimated  year one  14  in  estimated  year two  and 18  in  estimated  year 3 and beyond

In each scenario  the estimated revenue growth rates in year one and two are equal to the consensus estimates for 2016  62   and 2017  14    For the subsequent years  we use 11  in scenario one because it represents the 5 year average revenue growth rate at UHS  We use 14  in scenario two because it represents a continuation of 2017 expectations  We use 18  in scenario three because it represents the average 2017 expected revenue growth rate of all mid to large cap health care firms under coverage 
Additionally  in each scenario  we assume ACHC s invested capital increases  2 37 billion in year 1  which is equivalent to the change in fixed assets after the acquisition of Priory  This acquisition accounts for much of the revenue growth expected in 2016  We  then  conservatively assume that UHS can grow ACHC s revenue and NOPAT free cash flow without any incremental capital outlays after year 1  an unlikely assumption  but nonetheless  We also assume ACHC achieves a 14  NOPAT free cash flow margin  This margin is above UHS s NOPAT margin  9    which is dragged down by its hospital care segment and above ACHC s current NOPAT margin of 12  
The resulting implied values for ACHC in each scenario represent the maximum amount UHS should pay for ACHC  given the expected cash flows and the costs to achieve those cash flows 
Figure 4  Implied Acquisition Prices For UHS To Not Overpay For ACHC

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings    values in millions except per share amounts    value destroyed equals the difference between implied price and acquisition at current market price plus net assets liabilities  
Figure 4 shows that even If Acadia Healthcare can grow revenue 25  compounded annually  achieve 14  NOPAT margins  and require no excess capital spending  beyond year 1  for the next five years  the most UHS should pay for the firm is  31 share   a 43  downside from current price  Note in even the most optimistic scenario that the average ROIC over five years only equals 9   which is slightly below UHS s 10  ROIC  In order to achieve an ROIC equal to its current ROIC  UHS would either need to pay below  31 share  or grow ACHC s revenue greater than 25  compounded annually while spending  0 in incremental invested capital 
Without Acquisition  Shares Remain Overvalued
Without acquisition hopes  the expectations baked into the current stock price remain unrealistically high  Specifically  to justify the current price of  55 share  ACHC must grow NOPAT  and free cash flow  by 14  compounded annually for the next 12 years  In this scenario  ACHC would be generating over  9 billion in revenue 12 years from now  which is greater than UHS s 2015 revenue and nearly double LPNT s 2015 revenue 
Even if we assume ACHC can grow NOPAT  and free cash flow  by 12  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is only worth  30 share today   a 45  downside  Each of these scenarios also assumes the company is able to grow revenue and NOPAT without spending on working capital or fixed assets  an assumption that is unlikely  even if the firm ceased destructive acquisitions  However  this assumption allows us to create a very optimistic scenario  For reference  ACHC s invested capital has grown on average  968 million  54  of 2015 revenue  each year since 2012 
Catalyst  Acquisitions Run Out Coupled With Regulation Roadblocks
While roll up strategies can carry on for quite sometime but the downside when they run out has been well documented  We ve previously analyzed firms engaging in a roll up strategy  such as InnerWorkings  NASDAQ INWK   which fell 50  at its worst  and Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX   which still trades down 65  from when we originally published these reports  The roll up strategy either runs out of acquisition targets  or is no longer able to keep up the illusion of non GAAP profits  As we saw with Valeant  non GAAP earnings do not pay cash costs  and with ACHC s climbing debt  it could only be a matter of time before the roll up runs out of steam  In this case  investors would be forced to measure the firm on its fundamental merits  which as shown above  do not warrant a valuation anywhere near the current price 
Secondly  as with all acquisitions  each must be approved and upheld by the regulating body  whether in the U S  or abroad  On July 14  2016 it was announced that the U K  s Competition and Markets Authority referred Acadia s  2 2 billion acquisition of Priory Group for investigation  as it could lower competition within the market  This acquisition is expected to more than triple ACHC s bed count in the U K  and a finding that it stifles competition and cannot be completed could bring shares back to a more realistic valuation 
Lastly  the upcoming presidential election could provide a large negative catalyst for ACHC and many other healthcare providers  Under the current Affordable Care Act  mental health and substance abuse saw one of the largest coverage expansions  However  Republicans have made repeated  while unsuccessful  attempts to revoke much of the Affordable Care Act  Depending upon the winner of the 2016 election  these attempts could see a large increase  In 2015  41  of U S  revenue came from Medicaid  which Republicans have repeatedly proposed reduced funding  and 29  from commercial insurers  Changes to the ACA that in any way lower the coverage of mental health and substance abuse could have a material negative effect on ACHC s business 
Insider Are Selling While and Short Interest Grows
Over the past 12 months 12 6 million shares have been sold and 355 thousand have been purchased for a net effect of  12 2 million insider shares sold  These purchases represent 14  of shares outstanding  As ACHC has fallen  selling has declined too  signaling insiders cashing in while ACHC s price was on the downturn  Additionally  there are 9 6 million shares sold short  or just over 11  of shares outstanding 
Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic Accounting
In order to derive the true recurring cash flows  an accurate invested capital  and a real shareholder value  we made the following adjustments to Acadia s 2015 10 K 
Income Statement  we made  225 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing  105 million in non operating expenses  6  of revenue   We removed  165 million related to non operating expenses and  60 million related to non operating income 
Balance Sheet  we made  1 2 billion of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of  36 million  The most notable adjustment was  579 million  15  of net assets  related to midyear acquisitions 
Valuation  we made  3 8 billion of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by  3 8 billion  There were no adjustments that increased shareholder value  One of the largest adjustments was the removal of  3 7 billion  77  of market cap  due to total debt  which includes  123 million in off balance sheet debt

35031,256546,ACHC,3 Growing Hospitals For A Crazy Market,opinion,"Markets have been rocky lately  with the S P 500 index making a roughly 200 point round trip over the last three months   Worries about international growth in the wake of soft headlines out of Germany and elsewhere in Europe and never ending concerns about China s outlook have been the key drivers  But there has been no shortage of headwinds lately  ranging from international military conflicts to Ebola fears  The market has recouped most of its recent losses and many expect the post midterm elections period to be a good one for stocks  But as the recent downturn shows  investor sentiment could shift very quickly 
Looking for Growth and Defense During this time of uncertainty  with the markets shifting almost on a daily basis  I wanted to see if there was any area that was semi immune to these market swings  and that also showed a growth story   My models showed that the Medical Hospital Segment  currently ranked  7 out of 258 total segments has been able to withstand the recent market fluctuations  and show solid positive earnings over the past few quarters Why Medical Hospital Sector The Medical Hospital sector has seen significant growth since the passage of the ACA  Affordable Care Act    According to Department of Health and Human Services   Among hospitals in stats that expanded Medicaid  the number of uninsured patients admitted declined between 48  and 72  between Q2 2013 and Q2 2014   This has caused hospital s margins to significantly grow during this time frame   Further  the added savings are being utilized by several Medical Hospital companies to acquire more hospitals  and care centers   This leads to increased growth for these hospitals  My models came back with three very strong Medical Hospitals  that have posted solid earnings  and that have been very active in the acquisition arena   All three of these stocks carry either a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   or a Zacks Rank  2  Buy    Who to ConsiderAcadia Healthcare  NASDAQ ACHC  a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  provides inpatient behavioral health care services   It provides psychiatric and chemical dependency services  including inpatient psychiatric hospitals  residential treatment centers  outpatient clinics  and therapeutic school based programs    Acadia  just reported Q314 Earnings and Revenues  and beat on both sides   This was the second consecutive earnings and revenue beat by this company  and has posted a 4 quarter average positive surprise of 48 31    Further  due to the strong earnings  the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate for Q4 14  FY 14  Q1 15  and FY 15 have all increased within the past week   Q4 Earnings Estimates have risen from  0 44 to  0 46  FY 14 increased from  1 46 to  1 53  Q1 15 jumped from  0 45 to  0 50  and FY 15 rose from  1 97 to  2 19  The main factor behind the increased guidance due to the recent acquisition of CRC Health Group  which is to be finalized in Q1 2015 at a cost of  1 175 billion   The acquisition will add 30 inpatient  and 16 outpatient facilities along with 58 treatment centers located across 21 states    The chart below shows the Price and Consensus Estimate for Acadia   You will notice the high expectations for this company over the near future    
HCA Holdings  NYSE HCA  a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  is a non governmental hospital in the U S  providing healthcare and related services   The company operates a network of acute care hospitals  outpatient facilities  clinics and other patient care delivery settings    HCA just reported Q3 earnings and revenues which both came in above expectations  but that was not the only positive news to come out of the recent earnings announcement   HCA Holdings announced the acquisition of CareNow  a Dallas Fort Worth company that owns a chain of 24 urgent care centers  and the board s approval of a  1 billion share repurchase program   The acquisition of CareNow adds to the 11 hospitals currently under HCA s umbrella of operations in Texas    This positive news has caused the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimates for Q4 14  Q1 15  FY 2014  and FY 2015 over the past 30 days   Q4 estimates have risen from  1 10 to  1 17  Q1 15 increased from  1 11 to  1 18  FY 14 rose from  4 22 to  4 54  and FY 15 increased from  4 75 to  5 04    The chart below shows the Price and Consensus Estimate for HCA   Like Acadia  you will notice strong upticks in expectations over the next several quarters
