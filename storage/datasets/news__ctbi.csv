While building a growth and income portfolio for retirement  many investors have properly addressed steps 1  2  and 3 in the list below  As we will demonstrate via step 4  portfolios consisting of a diversified basket of blue chip dividend payers may leave investors exposed to higher than anticipated risks in a bear market  Therefore  adding step 5 to your prudent dividend approach can improve your odds of protecting and growing your retirement nest egg in both bull and bear markets 
Due Diligence Steps
Secure income using Dividend Champions screen 
Diversify across all major S P 500 sectors to reduce volatility and risk 
Check valuations and fundamentals 
Check portfolio s performance in bear market 
Develop a specific exit strategy risk management plan 
A Well Constructed Portfolio
Since our firm focuses on all asset classes and market sectors  we will let the retirement experts help us build a prudent growth and income portfolio to use as a basis for this risk management exercise  Since the benefits of dividends are well documented and many retirees need income  we started with an excellent list  the   The vast majority  88   of the stocks in our hypothetical portfolio  see below  are current Dividend Champions  We also used Chuck Carnevale s excellent fundamental screens to help us with the security selection process  The vast majority  83   of our portfolio below passed one of Mr  Carnevale s relatively recent screens  which can found in these articles 



In the table below  if the column Pass Recent Value Screen  has a  yes   the stock appeared and passed screens in one of the three articles above  We added a few stocks outside the screens for diversification purposes  We wanted to have at least two stocks from each major S P 500 sector  Since financial stocks tend to perform well on valuation and income screens  we added a couple of extra consumer staples stocks to offset the added risk of over weighting financials  The portfolio consists of Target Corporation  NYSE TGT   Genuine Parts Company  NYSE GPC   Altria Group  NYSE MO   Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG   Wal Mart Stores Inc  NYSE WMT   Archer Daniels Midland Company  NYSE ADM   Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX   Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM   Aflac Incorporated  NYSE AFL   Franklin Resources Inc  NYSE BEN   Community Trust Bancorp Inc   NASDAQ CTBI   Eaton Vance Corporation  NYSE EV   Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   Medtronic Inc  NYSE MDT   Stanley Black   Decker Inc  NYSE SWK   3M Company  NYSE MMM   H B Fuller Company  NYSE FUL   PPG Industries Inc   NYSE PPG   Automatic Data Processing Inc   NASDAQ ADP   International Business Machines  NYSE IBM   AT T Inc   NYSE T   Verizon Communications Inc   NYSE VZ   Consolidated Edison Inc  NYSE ED  and Southern Company  NYSE SO  

STEP 4  Test Portfolio In Bear Market
In the minds of many investors  one of the objectives of investing in established blue chip stocks is to reduce risk in next inevitable bear market  The table below shows the performance of each stock during the last bear market 

STEP 5  Building A Risk Management Plan
The excellent list of Dividend Champions and fundamental screens are value add steps in the due diligence process  However  the next logical question is 

How does an investor manage the portfolio when the next bear market arrives 

One possible answer is via a buy and hold strategy  which sounds good on paper  but is much  much harder to implement in the real world where you have to sleep at night 
Do You Have The Stomach For Buy And Hold 
How difficult and stressful would buy and hold have been day by day in the 2007 2009 bear market  To answer that question  we collected the daily adjusted closing prices  accounts for dividends  for each stock in our sample portfolio  The graph below assumes we had  500 000 allocated in equal amounts of  20 833 33 to each of the 24 stocks in the retirement portfolio  The maximum drawdown on the  500 000 portfolio during the last bear market was roughly 40   which means what once was a  500 000 portfolio dropped to a low of roughly  300 000 in March 2009 

The purpose of the article is not to say buy and hold is not a relevant option for all investors  but rather to educate blue chip investors on the potential downside risks of a buy and hold approach  It is stressful to see your  500 000 drop to  300 000  Many investors approaching retirement or in retirement have no desire to ride out a 40  drop  If you consider yourself in that group  then building a risk management bear market contingency plan is a logical next step 
2008  There Was Nothing You Could Do  Right 
Just because you have been told there was nothing you could have done in 2008  that does not mean it is true  Markets are difficult  Investing is difficult  However  as outlined in this   paying attention to observable evidence could have improved an investor s odds of mitigating  not eliminating  risk in the last bear market 
2003 2008  An Example With A Blue Chip Stock
Just as the 2008 video referenced above covers concepts and does not represent a complete portfolio management system  the same remarks apply to the hypothetical risk management example that follows  Our real world risk management system answers thousands of questions about the market  but we can explain the conceptual use of observable evidence as a risk management tool by answering three questions about Target   In our simplified system  we can only buy Target when all three answers to the questions are  yes   We can only sell Target when the answers to all three questions are  no  
Is the price of Target above the 200 day  in red below  
Is the slope of Target s 200 day positive 
Is Target s 50 day  in blue  above the 200 day 
The first time the answer to all three questions was  yes  in the chart below came when Target was trading at  28 80 in 2003  Assume we bought Target at  28 80  Now  we can only sell Target when all three questions are  no   Notice during the entire move from  28 80 to  46 46  a 61  gain   we never get a sell signal  Yes  price dropped below the red 200 day in 2004 and 2005  but the answer to the other two questions were still  yes   We can only sell when all three answers are negative 

Simple Example Of Risk Reduction
The observable evidence  no predictions needed  hit  sell mode  in November 2007  see below   After the sell signal Target fell from  45 66 to  22 72  Even this very simple system would have avoided holding Target during a 50  loss 

The chart below zooms in on 2008  showing the observable evidence clearly said  you cannot buy Target  when most investors were not sleeping very well  Yes  price went over the red 200 day in August 2008  but the answers to the other two questions were still  no   meaning our rules would not have allowed us to repurchase Target in 2008 

Are The 50 Day And 200 Day Perfect 
No  in fact  no moving average  indicator  or ratio represents the holy grail of risk management  Since the 50 day and 200 day can produce whipsaws from time to time  we do not recommend building a system based on these inputs only  However  the moving averages shown here do add value and can be used in conjunction with other  this can improve our odds of success  tools to build a diversified risk management system  This  is an example of using multiple hard and unbiased inputs on numerous time frames in a diversified manner

Investment Implications   A Few More Due Diligence Steps
To recap  many investors have checked most of the right boxes below 

Many investors have not completed the last two steps in the table above  The objective here is not to fear monger  but rather to encourage risk management reviews while the bull market sun is still shining  Once risk management plans are in place  the odds of sustaining hard to recover from losses will be reduced  not eliminated  All investing involves risk and uncertainty  but there are ways to reduce risk and uncertainty

It should be noted  we do not own any of the 24 stocks included in the hypothetical retirement portfolio  and do not have any plans to buy them  nor are we recommending them as possible investments  They are presented here for illustrative purposes  Numerous studies have found that roughly 90  of the investment battle is based on allocations    stocks vs    bonds  and only roughly 10  is based on picking individual stocks or companies  Said another way  it is very difficult to stock pick your way out of a bear market since most stocks drop  The results above align with these studies  23 of the 24 stocks lost money in the 2007 2009 bear market  ",2014-07-16,Chris Ciovacco,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-exposed-to-false-diversification-risk-219644,219644

6496,228011,CTBI,Many Of My Dividend Growth Stocks Have Become Overvalued  What Do I Do,opinion,IntroductionTo me  there s almost nothing better than finding a great company that I truly want to own at a fair valuation  or better yet  undervalued  In the long run  it has been my experience that this usually leads to outsized future returns  especially if you buy stocks when they are undervalued at the time  But there is quite often a side effect that can prove very disconcerting  Once an undervalued stock starts moving to the upside  momentum will often carry it above what prudent fair valuation would dictate As a result of the recent run up in the market  many of my holdings have  by the strictest of definitions  become overvalued  This begs the general question  what do I do now  Moreover  additional questions pop up such as  If I do sell  should I sell a part of my position  or all of it  When should I pull the trigger  or put another way  how much overvaluation  risk  should I accept before I sell  Since the market is overheated  should I go to cash or look for alternative investments at better valuations to invest in  Answering these and other important questions correctly could have a major impact on my financial future  Therefore  prudence dictates that I must take great care to think things through to their logical conclusions  However  experience has taught me that there is no general  or one size fits all  answer to any of these important questions  The only way to truly get these questions right  is to analyze each specific company  stock  that I own one at a time  basing my decision on the individual merits of each On the other hand  there are general principles that should always be kept at the forefront of your mind when attempting to make sound and proper decisions about overvaluation  or any investing decisions for that matter  A few of the more important ones can be gleaned from following or adhering to the lessons of master investors like Warren Buffett or Charlie Munger  For example  these legends of investing have shared the following principles that they believe in  and that apply to sound investing  and I believe are appropriate to this article s subject matter  Inactivity strikes us as intelligent behavior   Warren Buffett  1996 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report  Investing in a market where people believe in efficiency is like playing bridge with someone who has been told it doesn t do any good to look at the cards   Warren Buffett  If you aren t willing to own a stock for ten years don t even think about owning it for ten minutes  Warren Buffett  1996 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report  Investment students need only two well taught courses    How to Value a Business  and   How to think about market prices  Warren Buffett  1996 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report Consequently  I suggest that it is wise counsel to keep the principles underpinning the above quotes in mind when contemplating buy  sell or hold decisions based on overvaluation  Additionally  I believe these principles provide wise counsel no matter what type of investing decision is being contemplated  Moreover  there are several challenges making it difficult to correctly answer the question cited above  First and foremost  you must  within a reasonable degree of accuracy  accomplish the task of correctly ascertaining fair valuation  How could you expect to know if your stock is overvalued if you do not know what fair value is  Common sense and a historical precedent can be of great value in computing fair valuation  But  most importantly  an accurate as possible forecast of the future will be your best gauge  There is also the dilemma created by a market whose nature is often one of temporarily behaving irrationally  In other words  a stock can become overvalued  stay there for a long time  and often continue advancing far beyond what any rational computation would justify  Therefore  at the end of the day  all one can do is run the numbers out to their logical conclusions  and make their best judgments based on those calculations  The point being  investors should understand that there is no perfect answer to any of these questions  only reasonable ones  However  it has been my experience that reasonable answers generally pan out in the long run  but they do not always provide instant gratification over the short run How I Plan To Specifically Deal With The Many Faces Of Overvaluation In My PortfolioThe great recession of 2008  in addition to the pain and suffering it caused  also brought a great opportunity  In perhaps the greatest self help book ever written  Think and Grow Rich  author Napoleon Hill offered up an extremely important piece of general wisdom as follows   in every adversity lies the seed of a greater or equivalent benefit   The great recession of 2008 was no exception to Napoleon Hill s axiom  As a result of the massive selloff in stock prices  good and bad stocks alike saw their valuations decimated  When this occurred  I continued to avoid what I considered the bad stocks as I always had  but rejoiced in the opportunity to purchase good stocks on sale However  as I alluded to earlier  a side effect of buying stocks on sale usually leads to the necessity of dealing with future overvaluation  This side effect has currently manifested itself in my portfolio at present time  Therefore  in lieu of offering generalizations about what to do with overvaluation  I would like to share my own deliberations of what I might do on several currently overvalued holdings  The key here is that my decisions will be based on the specific situations regarding each holding  However  and as a reminder to the reader  the underlying principles based on the lessons of the masters referenced above will remain at the forefront of my mind at all times As usual  I will utilize the fundamentals analyzer software tool F A S T  Graphs  to articulate my thinking regarding each example I will present  I have marked each graph with a green dot illustrating when the stock was purchased  and the yellow line indicates cost basis  For new readers  the orange line represents a calculated earnings justified fair valuation  The black line on the graph represents monthly closing stock prices  The light blue shaded area illustrates dividends paid out of earnings  and the dark blue line illustrates the normal price earnings ratio that the market has historically applied What Do I Do With My Two Utilities With Moderate Overvaluation My first two examples will examine two utilities  SCANA Corp   SCG   and Nextera Energy Inc  NEE   formerly Florida Power   Light   In both cases  these were purchased because they offered a current yield at time of purchase of more than 4   In my mind  I saw these as quasi bond alternatives  In other words  my objective for owning them was their high yield  and low betas  approximately  5 for each   and not because I expected any significant capital appreciation  Consequently  since both were purchased for their income  I have no intention of selling either as long as their dividends remain intact Based on the earnings and price correlated graphs on each  both were purchased when they were undervalued  and both are currently modestly overvalued  However  I do not believe the downside potential from overvaluation on either sample warrants a sell  On the other hand  I should also add that I do not believe that either company is a sound purchase at today s overvalued levels Essentially  this decision is based on the fact that finding a suitable replacement trading at fair value or below  low betas and with a similar yield and quality  is not readily available in today s marketplace  Furthermore  these are typical low growth utilities  and my low cost basis provides me a margin of safety that would be hard to replicate  In these cases  I take the lead of Warren Buffett where inactivity strikes me as intelligent behavior Nextera Energy Inc SCANA Corp When The Sell Decision Is Made For MeAs a general statement  there are usually only two reasons why I will ever sell a common stock when I am in control of the decision  The first and most common reason is dangerous overvaluation  I define overvaluation as dangerous when it is at a level that would take years for me to recover my current profits if the stock were to move into fair value range  It s important to add here that it needs to be understood that a precise calculation of fair value is nebulous at best  Consequently  I am reticent to act unless overvaluation is so high as to be too obvious to ignore My second reason would be a permanent deterioration in the fundamentals of the company  It s important to emphasize here that a few bad quarters  or even a down year or two  may not indicate a permanent fundamental deterioration  Nor would a modest change in the company s growth rate indicate permanent deterioration  especially if it was considered temporary However  there is a third reason that is out of my control  My next example  Heinz Co  HNZ  represents a stock that Warren Buffett and a consortium have purchased outright  Consequently  this decision is easy  I will simply either wait until I receive the cash as follows   At the closing of the transaction  Heinz shareholders will receive  72 50 in cash for each share of common stock they own  in a transaction valued at  28 billion  including the assumption of Heinz s outstanding debt   Heinz Co Perhaps in sympathy with the Heinz transaction  Campbell Soup Co  CPB  has experienced a similar spike in valuation  Consequently  I have added Campbell Soup to my candidates for sell list  Thanks to the great recession  I was fortunate to have the opportunity to acquire this blue chip at a discount to its fair value  However  at its current quotation I believe the stock s valuation has become extended  Campbell Soup Co Potential Replacements for Heinz and Campbell SoupPersonally  I like to have a replacement in mind before I sell out of a holding  Since the Heinz transaction is outside of my control  I have begun researching prospective replacements  One company that has currently caught my eye is Emerson Electric  EMR   Although I m not yet finished with my due diligence  replacing Heinz with Emerson Electric makes sense on several counts First of all  the current dividend yield on Emerson Electric is slightly higher than Heinz  Therefore  I will take no hit on the income generation of the portfolio by replacing Heinz with Emerson Electric  Moreover  I feel that Emerson Electric is fairly valued and possesses the potential for more rapid growth in both earnings and dividends over the long run  I also like the fact that the debt to capital ratio on Emerson is approximately half of what it is on Heinz Currently my biggest dilemma is do I wait to get the Heinz cash  or bite the bullet and pay the commission to sell it in the open market  The risk of waiting for the cash would be that Emerson runs up in value before I get the cash  thereby moving out of fair valuation range  Consequently  although the decision to sell Heinz is more or less etched in stone  like the old Fram oil filter commercial  I have to decide whether I should  pay me now or pay me later  Emerson Electric  EMR As a potential replacement for Campbell Soup  I have begun researching Deere   Company  DE   The current yield on Deere   Company is about the same  each company s debt to capital ratio is similar  but I also see more growth potential with Deere   Company  At this point it s important to state that I am only utilizing Deere as an example of a potential replacement  because there are other companies I am also currently exploring that are at fair value with similar yields Deere   CompanyFour Blue Chip Holdings with Premium Historic ValuationsThese next four examples present a real conundrum regarding what fair valuation might actually be  Each of these next four companies are recognized blue chips  and as such  each has a legacy where the market has historically been willing to apply a premium valuation to their shares  the dark blue line on the graphs   Personally  I accept that fact as revealed by the respective normal P E ratios on the earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs  for each company Although the premium valuation normally applied by the market is undeniable  it s up to the individual investor to decide whether they are willing to pay that premium or not  In my case  although I have long admired each of these companies  I patiently waited until the great recession afforded me the opportunity to purchase them at fair valuations  I do not like paying more for a company than I believe its fundamentals justify  However  now that I hold each at such a low cost basis  what should I do as each company is clearly moving back into their normal premium valuation ranges Do I consider them now overvalued  or do I acknowledge that they are trading at justified premiums due to the quality of each of these blue chip stalwarts  In each of these four cases  I must accept that finding them at my strict definition of fair value is a very rare occurrence  But now that I have  do I count my blessings and hold on to them  or take my profits and run  I am not sure there is a right answer to this last question  In other words  the facts are what they are  leaving it up to each individual investor s own judgment as to what to do  In my case  I m holding on for now  but I am not willing to add new money at these levels either  but I would if they move back to fair value again McDonalds Corp  MCD Coca Cola Co  KO Procter   Gamble Co  PG Johnson   Johnson  JNJ Two Great Companies Approaching Dangerous OvervaluationKimberly Clark Corp  KMB  and Genuine Parts Company  GPC  are two examples of companies that have moved into moderate overvaluation territory  Consequently  both are currently on my candidates for sell list  However  once a company apparently becomes overvalued  I only flag it for sell  and then continuously monitor the position  In other words  I am not fond of reacting  or you could say overreacting  to every little wiggle in stock price  As I will illustrate later  there are many levels of overvaluation  and numerous outcomes that can happen after it occurs Kimberly Clark Corp Genuine Parts Co The Yield is Too High to SellOmega Healthcare  OHI  presents a real dilemma regarding its current valuation  Due to the company s high yield  which was my primary attraction to investing in this Healthcare REIT  I am reticent to sell it at its current moderate overvaluation  Instead  I am willing to accept some volatility in order to continue to be able to harvest its above average and growing yield  For an additional point of clarification  look closely at the graph and the fair valuation metrics  note that when evaluating REITs  FFO is used in lieu of earnings   If Omega Healthcare s price was to fall to its income justified valuation line  the pink line  by year end  it would still be above my current cost basis  the yellow line  Consequently  the current moderate overvaluation does not justify an outright sell  in my opinion  However  I would not be willing to make new purchases at these levels either  Some would argue that if a stock is not a buy  then it should be an outright sell  I disagree on the principle that a portfolio is like a bar soap  the more you handle it the smaller it gets  Later I will present examples of the potential pitfalls of acting too hastily regarding buy or sell decisions Omega HealthcareExamples of Potential Undervalued or Fairly Valued ReplacementsEven though the market has gone on such an incredible run recently  not all stocks have moved into overvaluation territory  The following is a representative list  not a complete list  of several companies that appear undervalued based on fundamentals that might be worthy of a more comprehensive due diligence effort  To be clear  I m not representing these as buys  rather I am representing them as candidates for closer scrutiny  My point in showing them is to illustrate that even in this  what many believe to be an overheated market  there s plenty of fair value to be found if you look closely enough Coach Inc  COH Lockheed Martin Corp  LMT Community Trust Bancorp Inc  CTBI Aflac Inc  AFL Air Products   Chemicals Inc  APD Lessons Learned  Maybe  From Past BehaviorOne of the great advantages of possessing a powerful research tool like F A S T  Graphs  is the opportunity it provides to revisit past behaviors and actions  The premium version allows the user to mark past buy and sell decisions  and review them years later  the green and red dots on the graphs   In my own experience  I find it very useful to review past decisions with the objective of learning from my past  Although I ve made many investing mistakes in the past  I regret none of them because I always did my homework and applied my best judgments given what I knew at the time EMC Corp  EMC Although not a dividend growth stock  I present EMC Corp as an example of dangerous overvaluation to the extreme  and as a classic picture of a true bubble valuation  Notice that I purchased the stock in August 1995  the green dot  when price was aligned with fair value  touching the orange line   Approximately 2 and three quarter years later  I sold what amounted to 1 5 of my position  which generated all of my original investment  plus a reasonable profit  Nevertheless  as it turned out  I was leaving more money than I thought possible on the table  even though the decision was sound long term  note that by 2002 the price had fallen below my first sell  At this point  I was playing with proverbial house money and I sold another 1 5 of my original position at a substantial profit  This second sell alone generated a pure profit which was almost 4 times my original investment  Now I was convinced that the stock had peaked and was poised to liquidate my remaining shares  However  the appetite for tech remained at a fevered pitch  and I held on  only to watch the stock almost triple from my last sell  My third sell alone netted more than 10 times my original investment  and my fourth sell a similar number  My fifth and final sell culminated in total profits that were almost 35 times my original investment  and proved to be a very fortuitous decision as EMC s stock price finally reverted to the mean and collapsed The important lessons to be learned here are that there is no telling how irrational the market can get  In my opinion  each and every one of my five unwindings of this position were done at what I believed were obvious and dangerous overvaluation levels  Interestingly  in the long run I was correct in each and every case  But the reader should understand that this was an extremely rare and unusual situation Furthermore  the only reason I was willing to hold on was because I was playing with house money after my initial sell  Although I consider every one of my decisions good ones  they were all far from perfect  Ascertaining overvaluation correctly is easier said than done to perfection  but it can  and should be done  when reason dictates Fiserv Inc  FISV My next example  Fiserv  is another non dividend paying stock that I wanted to share because it tells a quintessential story where valuation works perfectly  I originally invested in this company in November 2004 when it was fairly valued  and subsequently sold out at the end of May 2007 at a tidy profit  I tend to be quicker to pull the trigger when there s no dividend involved  I then repurchase the company in April 2010 again at fair value  and again I m currently enjoying a nice profit  I do consider the stock only modestly overvalued  and I m happy to continue holding it based on its impeccable long term operating record Nike Inc  NKE  My Nike example tells two important stories about buying and selling based on overvaluation  My original purchase was sound and my first two sells where appropriate  but not complete  Some 14 months later  Nike was trading substantially lower than I partially sold it for  However  I still had half of my original position  which I was now holding at a loss  Then coming out of the recession Nike once again moved to a similar overvaluation level at which I sold my original half position  Learning my lesson  at least I thought I did  I was happy to liquidate my remaining shares  Approximately two years later Nike is trading at a significant premium to my final liquidating price  Since my final outcome was a substantial profit on all shares  I really can t complain  However  Mr  Market has taught me that he is a very unreliable partner  Nevertheless  I consider Nike one of my favorite companies  but I continue to believe it is significantly overvalued Wal Mart Stores Inc   WMT My final example  Wal Mart Stores  teaches another important iteration of the dangers of overvaluation  I originally bought Wal Mart at a fair valuation in October 1995  Two years later I sold half my position  convinced that the stock can become overvalued  Approximately seven months later I liquidated the holding completely as I was then absolutely convinced that the price had risen as high as it possibly could  Of course  I was wrong as the stock advanced for approximately another 18 months before it hit a wall Then for approximately the next eight years Wal Mart s stock price  now completely disconnected from its earnings justified valuation  had nowhere to go but sideways  then down  Consequently  even though the company generated strong and consistent earnings growth  shareholders actually experienced losses due to the headwinds of extreme overvaluation  Wal Mart did not fall quickly like EMC did  instead it went into a torturous decline spanning many years Summary and ConclusionsThere is no doubt that the recent run up in stock prices has created overvaluation in many stocks  On the other hand  there are still many stocks that are reasonably valued  and even some that are undervalued  So the important point that I am suggesting is to make your valuation decisions one company at a time If you do hold overvalued positions  I also suggest that you remember the principles that were cited by Warren Buffett earlier in the article  If you are buying businesses  then the ultimate strategy is to hold as long as the business remains strong  and valuations fluctuate within a reasonable range  I only recommend liquidating a position if the risk of owning it is too great to hold any longer  or if you come across a compelling alternative that improves your overall portfolio position With this article I attempted to illustrate that valuation comes in many sizes  shapes and flavors  and each will dictate the appropriate behavior and actions required or necessary to deal with it  Sometimes the best course of action is to simply hold tight  At other times it might make sense to partially liquidate a holding if the momentum is strong  This can be especially beneficial if you can de risk your portfolio by taking all of your original cost or more out with a partial liquidation  In other times outright total sells makes the most sense Yet  at the end of the day  I believe investment decisions are best made once you have run all the numbers out to their logical conclusions  To be a successful long term investor  you have to be willing to withstand a certain amount of volatility  However  if the risk gets too large  then taking appropriate action may be the best course  But the truth is  there is no perfect one answer that fits all occasions In each and every situation  the best answers to the questions raised in this article are the ones that make the most sense to the individual asking them   Finally  the goal is not to be perfectly right  because that is a virtual impossibility   Instead  the more rational objective is to make sound decisions that both protect your portfolio while simultaneously allowing it to continue to perform according to your long term objectives  This is especially important for the dividend growth investor already in retirement   For more color on dealing with stock price volatility  you might want to  to my previous article Disclosure   Long NEE  SCG  HNZ  KMB  KO  PG  CPB  JNJ  GPC  MCD  OHI  COH  LMT  BBL  AFL  DE  EMR  FISV  NKE at the time of writing  Disclaimer

6498,228013,CTBI,Is Community Trust Bancorp A Great Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Community Trust Bancorp  Inc    NASDAQ CTBI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Community Trust Bancorp has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 3  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Community Trust Bancorp s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Community Trust Bancorp has a forward PE  ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 17 1  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Community Trust Bancorp stock in the near term too  P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Community Trust Bancorp has a P S ratio of about 4 2  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is a bit below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Community Trust Bancorp currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Community Trust Bancorp a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too What About the Stock Overall Though Community Trust Bancorp might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of C  This gives CTBI a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been favorable  Both the current year and next year have seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no lower This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has risen by 2 9  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has increased 3 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Community Trust Bancorp  Inc  Price and Consensus    This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment  and its Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term Bottom LineCommunity Trust Bancorp is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 23  of more than 250 industries   it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  So  value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks Editor in Chief Goes   All In   on This Stock Full disclosure  Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other

6636,228151,CTBI,Digitization And Fintech To Boost U S  Banks  5 Picks ,opinion,Banks in the United States have gained significantly from a rising rate environment  growth in loans and President Trump s tax cuts  However  use of fintech  particularly in transaction and payments  has been pivotal in reducing costs for the banks in America and improving banks  return on equity Furthermore  digitization has also driven inorganic growth as well as bottom line results for the broader banking industry  Moreover  U S  banks stand to benefit the most from the race toward digitization The banking industry s return to shareholders has easily outperformed the broader market since November 2016  In other words  the S P Banks Select Industry Index  SPSIBK  has returned upward of 33  since November 2016  easily surpassing the S P 500 s rally over the same period  Under such circumstances  betting on bank stocks seems prudent Digitization Will Lead to Economies of ScaleBanking  as we always knew it  has undergone significant transformation in the recent past  As a rule of thumb in banking  more the number of branches  higher the share of deposits  The business model was fairly simple However  this status quo has been challenged by digital branding  Banks now make excessive use of advanced analytics as well as machine learning to improve the customer experience  revenues and cost efficiency  To put things into perspective  five of the biggest banks in the United States have captured more than 40  share of the total domestic deposits since 2014  on the back of digitization alone Meanwhile  regional banks had a stupendous run in 2018 because they could capitalize on their digitization efforts to boost economies of scale which led to significant decline in costs  Per Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  efforts to digitize boosted commercial and savings banks  net income to  62 billion in the third quarter of 2018 alone Fintech to Revolutionize Payment Processing in 2019The growing influence of fintech has helped boost net interest margin  NIM  and loan growth for banks across the globe  As a matter of fact  global banking industry s NIM grew to more than 3 5  by the end of 2018 Financial transaction service providers such as PayPal   NASDAQ PYPL    Apple s   NASDAQ AAPL   Apple Pay platform and Amazon s   NASDAQ AMZN   Amazon GO have been posing threats to retail bankers by consistently innovating and attracting more active users by improving customer experience  To adopt to changing circumstances and catch up to the fintech race  incumbents have been switching to fintech to reshape their payment methods Some of the biggest banks in America have invested generously in creating their own online lending platforms  JPMorgan Chase s   NYSE JPM   Finn being an example In an age where more than 70  of transactions are taking place online  traditional payment processing methods will prove to be disruptive to the banking businesses across the world It goes without saying that cashless and easy payment options not only increase the transactional frequency  but also the customer base of regional players to international audience 5 Best ChoicesWhile Trump s tax cuts have benefited America s banks immensely  it is the race to digitization which has made banking a cost effective business recently  Moreover  banks are increasingly moving in to the fintech space either by establishing stand alone digital banks or partnering with service providers  Currently  36  of all the personal loans in the United States have resulted from the use of fintech In this context  we have selected five bank stocks that are expected to gain from these factors  These stocks carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   For each of these stocks
