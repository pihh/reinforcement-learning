20976,242491,BMTC,Dig Into Driehaus Strategy With These 5 Momentum Stocks ,opinion,Driehaus strategy is an investment approach developed by Richard Herman Driehaus using the  buy high and sell higher  principle  This strategy can be used by investors with high risk appetite by investing mainly in momentum stocks  The success of this investment approach helped Driehaus secure a name in Barron s All Century Team Portfolios such as that of The American Association of Individual Investors   AAII   proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns  AAII s portfolio  which was developed following the strategy  returned 13 5  and 18 1  in the five and 10  year time frames  respectively  compared with  1 1  and 4 2  returns for the S P 500  Thus  investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy A Look at Driehaus  StrategyAfter a detailed study of the Driehaus  strategy  AAII concluded that it mainly focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive prospects to pick potential outperformers  While this strategy was made to provide better returns over the longer haul  companies with a strong history of beating estimates were also given importance  I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around   Driehaus had said in an interview Screening ParametersThe percentage 50 day moving average is one of the key criteria in this strategy  A positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend  It is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included in this strategy  In order to make the strategy more profitable  we have only considered those stocks that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  as well as a momentum score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a  of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential   Zacks Rank equal to  1 Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see     Last 5 year average EPS growth rates above 2  Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business    Trailing 12 month EPS growth higher than 0 and industry median Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks    Last four quarter average EPS surprise greater than 5  Positive EPS surprise indicates potential    Positive   50 day moving average and relative strength over 4 weeks High   50 day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend    Momentum Score equal to or less than B A favorable Momentum Score indicates that it is ideal to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success  These few parameters narrowed down the universe of over 7 876 stocks to only 26 Here are five of the 26 stocks Ternium S A    NYSE TX   is a manufacturer and processor of various steel products  The company has a Momentum Score of A and an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 50 2  MSA Safety Inc    NYSE MSA   is a developer  manufacturer and supplier of safety products  The company has a

these  mounting political instability in Italy and Spain  and tensions with North Korea are rippling through markets Thus  the best way to go about this tricky June is investing in small caps  This niche segment is undeterred by trade war and other geopolitical concerns  They are expected to outdo their large cap peers by a comfortable margin  defying the obvious deterrents June Typically Rough for InvestorsWhen do we see a typical market swoon  It s when major bourses  including the Dow Jones and the S P 500  experience a substantial drop  And that s exactly what happens in June  After all  it is among the worst phases for indices  per the Stock Trader s Almanac The Dow Jones  on average  has shed 0 3  in June  per data that goes back to 1950  In the last 67 years  the blue chip index

decides to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the European Union  EU   Canada and Mexico  This in turn has sparked chances of retaliation by the trade partners and reignited concerns of a global trade war  A full fledged trade war will have rippling effects on global economy growth  casting a pall over businesses With White House pulling the tariff trigger  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that Canada will impose a 25  tariff on U S  steel imports and 10  on aluminum  Mexico also vowed to slap tariffs on U S  goods  while the EU targets classic American industries like whiskey and motorcycles  The EU  in particular  is expected to levy tariffs on nearly  7 5 billion worth of U S  goods Jean Claude Juncker  president of the European Commission  said that  the

smart money is expected to pour into stocks with high domestic exposure  Small caps remain unperturbed by international disputes due to limited exposure to foreign markets  Meanwhile  geopolitical tensions are  mostly  headwinds for large cap companies as they eat into overseas profits Lest we forget  the current strength in the U S  dollar is weighing on multinational stocks  But  small caps

In a regulatory filing on May 31  the company stated that it issued about  48 million in loan to the unidentified borrower  which excludes another  32 million the borrower had taken from other financial lenders 
Having conducted a thorough review of the lending relationship  Fulton Financial expects to take a  40 million charge off  which amounts to an after tax hit of  32 million  Also  the company is dealing with the borrower to determine assets that can be used for recovery  Thus  at the moment  Fulton Financial could not provide an estimate of any additional recoveries that may be realized in the future 
In March 2018  the Lancaster  PA based lender had started the  21 million expansion of its headquarters  which is expected to increase job prospects in the city by nearly 400

always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Bryn Mawr has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 91  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 65  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Bryn Mawr s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 16 16 over the past five years The stock s PE also compares quite favorably with the Finance Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 84  This indicates that the stock is quite undervalued right now  compared to its peers Meanwhile  Bryn Mawr has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 12 08  which is slightly higher than the current level  So  so it is fair to expect an increase in the share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Bryn Mawr has a P S ratio of 2 78  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 29x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is much below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Bryn Mawr currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Bryn Mawr a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Bryn Mawr might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of A  This gives BMTC a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching funda    mental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  While the current quarter estimate has seen one upward and no downward movement  the current year estimate has seen two upward and no downward movements over the past two months This has had a positive effect on the consensus estimate  While the current quarter consensus has shot up 2 6  over the past two months  the current year estimate has increased 1 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation Price and Consensus   Despite such positive analyst sentiments  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and it is the reason why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBryn Mawr is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 23  of more than 250 industries   with a Zacks Rank  3 it is hard to get too excited about the stock Also  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for Zacks rank  industry rank and past industry performance to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal
