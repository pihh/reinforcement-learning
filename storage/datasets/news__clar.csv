7129,228644,CLAR,5 Breakout Stocks For Amazing Returns,opinion,Possibly the single most popular method utilized by active investors is to identify breakout stocks  This method seeks out stocks whose prices are varying within a tight range  In the event of a stock declining below the floor of this channel  it may be time to offload it from your portfolio  But if a stock manages to rise above this channel  it holds the possibility of delivering strong returns Picking Prospective CandidatesIn order to identify breakout stocks  you must first determine their resistance and support levels  A resistance level is the barrier which must be broken so as to be identified as a breakout stock  Meanwhile  a support level is the floor for the stock s movement At the breakout level  the demand for the stock has peaked  making it a natural choice for traders  On the other hand  when a stock hits the support floor  traders are eager to offload it  In order to spot breakout stocks  you would have to see which of these are on the brink of breaking the resistance barrier or those that have just breached this level Checking Whether It s for RealStocks which have breached their resistance level should ideally be in high demand among traders  But the test of whether this is a genuine breakout is when they go on to attain higher prices and the old barrier becomes a new support  This is why it is important to determine whether a long term price trend is about to emerge Only a study of long term trends can determine whether the existing trading channel has been breached effectively  This indicates the strength of the support or resistance levels  If you can identify the effective channel for a stock  picking it even at a not so reasonable price would give you significant returns

7132,228647,CLAR,Consumer Spending Growth Maximum Since 2009  5 Winners,opinion,U S  consumer spending rose the maximum in almost a decade in March as households increased purchases  quelling concerns about the economy s health  Price pressure  in the meanwhile  was under control  as a key inflation measure increased the slightest in 14 months   This calls for investing in consumer discretionary companies that are poised to grow on signs of consumer spending strength  U S  Consumer Spending Roars Back U S  consumers ramped up spending in February and March  a sign that they are pretty confident about their well being  Consumer spending  which accounts for more than two third of economic output  increased 0 9  in March  This was the largest monthly increase since August 2009  according to the Commerce Department   Spending rose 0 1  in February  The release of the February data got delayed due to the longest ever partial federal government shutdown that ended on Jan 25  By the way  data for January was revised up to show a 0 3  rise in spending instead of the earlier reported growth of 0 1     When adjusted for inflation  consumer spending increased 0 7  last month  while the real consumer outlays somewhat remained unchanged in February  Nonetheless  March s uptick in consumer spending levels suggests accelerated consumption in the second quarter   Lest we forget  consumer spending rose a meager 1 2  in the first quarter  compared with 2 5  gain in the preceding quarter  Then again  the surprise 1 6  uptick in March retail sales indicates possibilities of higher consumer spending in the days ahead  Headline retail sales saw the largest monthly increase since September 2017  driven by sales of motor vehicles  petrol and clothing  which shows that consumers continue to support the economy  What Drove Consumer Spending  Consumer spending was largely driven by strength in the labor market  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  the economy added 196 000 new jobs in March  exceeding analysts  estimates of around 179 000  In fact  hiring sped up by an average of 180 000 in the first three months of this year despite questions about employers  ability to find skilled labor  Meanwhile  the jobless rate remained at 3 8  last month  slightly above a 49 year low  The real unemployment rate  including those who are underemployed and discouraged  also known as the U6 rate  is down from 7 9  a year ago  At the same time  wage growth kept its momentum  ensuring that pay is increasing at a faster pace than inflation  Easing Price Pressure Talking about inflation  the personal consumption expenditures  PCE  price index  excluding the volatile food and energy components  was a little changed in March after edging up 0 1  in February  The so called core PCE index  thus  was up 1 6  on a year over year basis last month  the smallest increase since January 2018   The broader PCE index rose 0 2  in March compared to the previous month and jumped 1 5  from a year earlier  but both fell below expectations  In fact  the Fed s preferred price gauge remained well below the central bank s target of 2   but consumers certainly won t be complaining  After all  rise in prices of essential goods and commodities impacts the cost of living and the propensity to spend    Top 5 Gainers Courtesy of the rise in household

7134,228649,CLAR,Risk Averse Investors May Buy These 5 Low Leverage Stocks  ,opinion,Leverage refers to a well known business strategy in corporate finance  which involves usage of borrowed capital by companies to ensure smooth run of operations and expansion of the same  Basically  it is the amount of debt a firm uses to invest in its business operations One may ask why a company chooses debt when the option of equity financing exists  The answer is simple  Debt is a much cheaper form of financing than equity  Moreover  payments on debt are tax deductible  So  the majority of companies resort to debt financing However  debt is still considered a taboo as it carries the burden of interest payments  In particular  companies with heavy debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt if things go downhill So  if a company is highly leveraged  in other words carries an exorbitant amount of debt  investors will not be willing to add the stock  A high degree of financial leverage means high interest payments  which affects the bottom line Therefore  to avoid any kind of risky investment  choosing a less debt ridden stock should be an appropriate option for a risk averse investor  To gauge how risky a company is  potential equity investors look at leverage ratios  Debt to equity ratio is one such measure  perhaps the most popular one  to evaluate a company s creditworthiness for potential equity investments Analyzing Debt EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio shows improved solvency for a company Investors are on the lookout for stocks that exhibited solid earnings growth in the last couple of quarters  However  blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth without considering their debt level is not a wise move The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors  it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt to equity ratio to ensure steady returns However  an investment strategy based solely on debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors Here are the other parameters Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median  Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer the best upside potential Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectation Zacks Rank  1 or 2   Irrespective of market conditions  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 have a proven history of success Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt to equity ratio  here are five of the 22 stocks that made it through the screen Herman Miller  Inc    NASDAQ MLHR

7165,228680,CLAR,5 Moderately Priced Breakout Stocks For Strong Returns ,opinion,For active investors  seeking breakout stocks is often a preferred investment strategy  In order to do so  they must zero in on stocks trading within a fairly tight range and purchase them when they move out of this band and offload them whenever they fall below the band  If correctly implemented  such a strategy could deliver impressive returns Determining Breakout LevelsThe key to this strategy is calculating the support and resistance levels of a stock  The floor of the stock s trading channel is its support level and it should be sold as soon as it threatens to fall lower  On the other hand  the resistance is its breakout level and it is poised to gain substantially if breaks the resistance level When a stock is close to its support level  demand is literally hitting the floor  On the other hand demand rises when it is breaching its resistance level  signaling that this is the right time to make a lucrative addition to your portfolio  The idea is to pick stocks which have just broken above their resistance barriers or are very closing to doing so Identifying Whether It s for RealStocks which have breached their resistance level should ideally be in high demand among traders  But the test of whether this is a genuine breakout is whether they go on to attain higher prices and the old barrier becomes a new support  This is why it is important to determine whether a long term price trend is about to emerge Only a study of long term trends can determine whether the existing trading channel has been breached effectively  This indicates the strength of the support or resistance levels  If you can identify the effective channel for a stock  picking it even at a not so reasonable price would give you significant returns Screening Parameters  Percentage price change over four weeks between 10  and 20   Stocks which are showing considerable price increases  but whose gains are

7167,228682,CLAR,Twenty First Century Fox  FOXA  Q2 Earnings Top  Revenues Lag,opinion,Twenty First Century Fox  Inc    NASDAQ FOXA   delivered second quarter fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings of 37 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents  However  the figure decreased 11 9  on a year over year basis owing to lack of contribution from stake in Sky following its sale to Comcast   NASDAQ CMCSA   Revenues of  8 49 billion increased 5 7  from the year ago quarter  However  the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  8 58 billion The top line growth can primarily be attributed to increasing affiliate revenues from the Cable Network Programming  and growth in affiliate and advertising revenues in the Television segments  offset by lower home entertainment revenues at the Filmed Entertainment segment  Notably  foreign currency had a negative impact of about  195 million on revenue growth Twenty First Century Fox  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Quarter DetailsSegment wise  Cable Network Programming revenues  53 7  of total revenues  increased 3 6  to about  4 56 billion  Television segment net revenues  25 3   increased 18 9  on a year over year

9   declined 1  year over year to  2 12 billion The Cable Network Programming segment gained from higher affiliate and advertising revenue growth  partially offset by increase in programming and contractual expenses  Increase in contractual rates of all domestic cable brands led to year over year increase of 8  in domestic affiliate revenues  Domestic advertising revenues increased 6  year over year primarily due to higher pricing at Fox News However  international affiliate revenues declined 4  owing to unfavorable impact of a stronger U S  dollar  which was offset by local currency growth at FNG International and STAR  International advertising revenues decreased 9  on account of unfavorable impact of a stronger U S  dollar and  lower local currency advertising revenue at FNG International more than offset local currency advertising growth at STAR  Filmed Entertainment revenues declined due to lower syndication revenues at television production studio and lower home entertainment revenues from film studio The Television segment gained from higher advertising and affiliate revenues  Advertising revenues increased 15  year over year due to increased number of sports broadcast and higher political advertising revenues generated from the mid term U S  elections  Increase in contractual retransmission consent fee and higher content revenues from FOX Broadcast Network s on demand streaming service led to year over year increase of 21  in affiliate revenues Operating DetailsThe company s total segment operating income before depreciation and amortization  OIBDA  came in at  1 57 billion  up 8 8  year over year on the back of higher contributions of the Filmed Entertainment and Cable Network Programming segments  partially offset by lower contribution

18 4  OIBDA at Cable Network Programming rose 7  to  1 45 billion on higher affiliate revenues  4    The increase was partially offset by 2  rise in expenses  Higher sports rights costs at both FS1 and the Regional Sports Networks  RSNs   and increase in FX entertainment costs resulted in increased expenses  This was modestly offset by lower cricket rights costs at STAR OIBDA contribution from domestic market rose 10  year over year due to increase in contributions from FOX News and RSNs  OIBDA contribution from International cable channels declined 8  year over year owing to unfavorable impact of a stronger U S  dollar  partially offset by local currency growth at both FNG International  and STAR Filmed Entertainment s OIBDA increased to  193 million up 47  from the year ago quarter  The increase can be attributed to higher contribution from film studios due to the global release of Bohemian Rhapsody  lower theatrical costs on account of less number of films released in second quarter fiscal 2019 and strong performance of The Greatest Showman across home entertainment and pay television  This was partially offset by  lower domestic syndication contribution and higher new series deficits  Notably  Bohemian Rhapsody  the biopic about Queen lead singer Freddie Mercury  won the award for best picture   drama this year s Golden Globes  Moreover  Rami Malek  portraying the legendary singer  won the trophy for best actor in a motion picture   drama Television segment reported OIBDA loss of  22 million  declining  78 million from the year ago quarter  Growth in affiliate  advertising and content revenues  19   was more than offset by increase in expenses  24    The rise in expenses was due to higher sports programming costs on account of the inaugural season of

7179,228694,CLAR,Carnival s  CCL  Expansion Efforts On Track  Costs Rise,opinion,Carnival  LON CCL  Corporation s   NYSE CCL   continual expansion efforts and other revenue yielding strategies seem encouraging  However  higher costs along with negative currency translation continue to be potent headwinds Last month  Carnival reported better than expected   Earnings of 63 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13 cents but were down 6 3  year over year  Revenues of  4 3 billion beat the consensus mark by  108 million and rose 8 2  year over year Earnings also surpassed the consensus estimate in each of the trailing four quarters  the average positive surprise being 12 33  We observe that over the past year  the company s shares have rallied 23   outperforming the  s gain of 20  Launches   Expansion to Drive Demand   SalesCarnival continues to introduce flagships to drive demand  With frequent launches  the company aims to build capacity growth that allows its global fleet to meet escalating demand for cruise vacations around the world In a recent press release  Carnival announced plans of launching four cruise ships this year as part of its current fleet enhancement strategy  While Carnival Horizon  belonging to Carnival Cruise Line brand  and Seabourn Ovation  Seabourn  will be launched in April and May  respectively  AIDAnova  AIDA Cruises  and ms Nieuw Statendam  Holland America Line  are slated for a December launch  Carnival has 18 new ships scheduled to be included in its portfolio of leading global cruise brands between 2018 and 2022 In fact  launching ships is part of the company s long term strategy to build state of the art vessels which would help the company drive guest traffic  Moreover  Carnival continues to invest in its fleet to enhance guest experience The leading cruise company is focused on growing beyond its familiar itineraries and capitalizing on new markets  The Asian source market for cruises is expected to grow significantly as it is becoming more consumer driven  Carnival is especially optimistic about the prospects in China  Japan and Australia Further  the company forayed into the markets of Cuba  Mexico and Bermuda where demand is expected to ramp up and boost revenues significantly  In fact  Carnival Cruise Line s Carnival Paradise is the largest ship sailing from the United States to Havana and is capturing attractive ticket price premium  Carnival has more sailing scheduled to Cuba than any other major U S  operator  This should help meet increased demand The company is also focusing on port development to make use of its industry leading scales to create better guest experiences  In this regard  the company recently signed a deal to construct a cruise port facility on the Grand Bahama Island Strategic Initiatives Boost RevenuesCarnival continues to drive revenue growth by creating more demand than the estimated capacity growth through improved guest experience  In fiscal 2017  Carnival s ticket prices increased 4 5  The company is particularly positive on recent innovation like the transformational new ocean experience platform  featuring  Ocean Medallion  a guest experience platform  PlayOcean  a proprietary mobile gaming portfolio  and OceanView  a proprietary digital streaming network  These offerings are anticipated to enhance guest experience further by leveraging on its industry leading scale Meanwhile  the company believes it is well positioned for continued earnings growth  given the current strength in bookings  particularly in Caribbean  Alaska  Europe  Asia and Australia  In fact  management noted that since November  booking volumes for 2018 have been exceeding that of last year at higher prices  Moreover  cumulative bookings for 2018 are well ahead of last year on both price and occupancy  Banking on its yield management system  the company expects revenue yields  in constant dollars  to continue improving in fiscal 2018 Moreover  to improve brand perception  Carnival is promoting its brands through documentaries  television programs  motion pictures and digital initiatives  Recently  the company created four original TV programs in order to engage viewers High Costs   Other Macro WoesCarnival aims to make additional investments this year as its brands have identified more revenue generating opportunities  Though these efforts are expected to benefit the company over the long run  these would put pressure on near term margins and earnings  Also  increased investments in advertising and TV programming are driving costs Moreover  with a major portion of its revenues coming from Asia and Europe  the company is exposed to the impact of negative currency translation  Continual strengthening of the U S  dollar against the functional currencies of the company s foreign operations is likely to impact results  Additionally  higher fuel prices are likely to impede earnings growth Zacks Rank   Stocks to ConsiderCarnival has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Some better ranked stocks in the  are Clarus Corporation   NASDAQ CLAR    Las Vegas Sands Corp    NYSE LVS   and Melco Resorts   Entertainment Limited   NASDAQ MLCO    While

20508,242023,CLAR,Atlanta s Housing Market Crash,opinion,As I pondered what to write this morning  I thought about addressing the 15  pullback in the price of gold over the last three months  What was happening to this supposedly safe haven  Despite this pullback  gold is still up 135  over the last 5 years  Time to look for a more interesting topic    Let s turn our gaze to the southeast and address what can only be described as the CRASH of the Atlanta housing market    While nationwide home prices were down 1 9  over the last 12 months  our home owning friends in Atlanta experienced close to an 18  cliff dive in home values during the same time period    In what can only be compared to a black diamond slope  here is the last 5 year graph of the Atlanta housing market The Wall Street Journal brings further attention to this CRASH in writing this morning   Some Atlanta Realtors say they have seen signs recently that sales are picking up  They also point out that the Case Shiller data lags behind actual market trends by several months   Their numbers are more in line with what we were seeing a few months ago   said Mitch Kaminer  president of the Atlanta Board of Realtors and a broker with Re Max Paramount Properties in Atlanta   It s been the best spring season in five years  How many brokers have ever told you differently Other Atlanta market watchers and real estate agents say the price declines are driven by several factors  including many foreclosures  a glut of housing inventory left over from the real estate boom and high unemployment Georgia was a sub prime mortgage origination hotbed  But not a lot of fraud  though  right  Stop it  Let the Atlanta housing market be the legacy of those Washington who filled their own pockets and advanced their own agendas while shirking their responsibilities to properly regulate our nation s mortgage market  We can start this long list with the name Alan Greenspan  You d think we d be getting through this by now  But you re not going to start moving this property until people have jobs   said Michael Bell  a professor of public policy at Georgia State University and the former chief financial officer of DeKalb County  which includes a portion of Atlanta and the city s northeastern suburbs Atlanta s unemployment rate has hovered above 11  for much of the past year  even as the national jobless rate has fallen to 8 1   according to the Georgia Department of Labor The state leads the nation in bank failures  with 78 lending institutions closed since mid 2008  many because of profligate lending to home builders during the real estate boom  The result has been hundreds of thousands of vacant or half finished lots and tens of thousands of homes lost to foreclosure in the suburbs  RealtyTrac  an Irvine  Calif   provider of foreclosure data  reported this month that Atlanta s rate of foreclosure sales typically when buyers lose their homes to their lender or at a courthouse auction has remained steady at about 8 000 a month for the past two years  Atlanta s going to take longer  to recover   It was just horribly overbuilt   said Richard Smith  chief executive of Realogy Corp   which owns the Coldwell Banker and Century 21 brands Bank of America has the largest presence in the southeast  Where do you think the bank has all of the mortgage exposure in the greater Atlanta region marked on their books Navigate accordingly ,2012-05-31,Larry Doyle,https://www.investing.com/analysis/atlanta’s-housing-market-crash-124942,124942
