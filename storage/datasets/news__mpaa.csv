21098,242613,MPAA,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Tesla  Blue Bird  PACCAR  AutoZone And Motorcar Parts Of America,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 14  2020   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Tesla  Inc    NASDAQ TSLA    Blue Bird Corp    NASDAQ BLBD    PACCAR Inc   NASDAQ PCAR    AutoZone  Inc    NYSE AZO   and Motorcar Parts of America  Inc    NASDAQ MPAA   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  Tesla  TSLA  and Other Automotive Stocks to Zoom in 2020Since the financial crisis a decade ago  U S  vehicle sales have only gone up  Sales hit a record 17 6 million in 2016 after it had bottomed out at 10 4 million in 2009  But since then  sales have been near the 17 million mark  providing an unusual steady trend for an industry that is particularly cyclical in nature Industry experts  however  expect the auto industry to slow down a bit this year  Analysts now expect U S  auto sales for the year to decline between 1  to 2   What s more  the auto industry in China  the world s largest auto market  is expected to witness a 2  fall in vehicles sales this year  according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers  CAAM   By the way  stricter emission standards may hamper auto sales in the European Union region But despite the moribund sales prediction  completely neglecting auto stocks won t be the right thing to do  Especially if you look at Tesla  Inc   Wall Street is currently loving the electric carmaker  It has now become the most valuable U S  automaker in history and its market cap is almost double that of Ford and General Motors  NYSE GM  combined According to data from the Center for Research in Security Prices  Tesla now has a market value of  86 billion  which tops the previous record high of  76 1 billion for shares of Ford in 1999  Needless to say  the Italian car manufacturer Fiat Chrysler is a distant fourth  with a market value of around  22 billion But does Tesla s meteoric rise raises doubt about its future price movement  Certainly not  Even though Tesla recently unveiled its much awaited all electric  Cybertruck   the Model 3 designed for electric powered performance has been a game changer  And with the company delivering 112 000 vehicles  mostly Model 3  in the fourth quarter of 2019  the company is poised to gain this year as well  The highly anticipated launch of Model Y  a small crossover vehicle  will also boost the company this year Tesla s orders  in the meantime  have been increasing steadily  Throughout last year  Tesla s orders grew at an impressive rate  And since the federal credit for U S  based buyers of Tesla vehicles has been trimmed  orders will continue to rise this year  Additionally  demand for Model X and S has been increasing sequentially again  Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn confirmed that the company is  increasing production on S and X lines in response to increasing demand  Tesla  thus  possesses a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has risen 46  over the past 60 days  The company s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 79 7   way more than the  industry s estimated rise of 7 8   Tesla  in fact  has outperformed the broader industry over the past year   43 0  vs  18 6    You can see But why just invest in Tesla  Investors should be a little more adventurous and increase their bets on other auto stocks poised to gain in the near term  In this process  you can double your returns  After all  the healthy U S  economy  low gas prices  low interest rates and longer loan terms bode well for the auto industry this year  So  here are the obvious choices  Blue Bird Corp designs  engineers  manufactures and sells school buses and related parts in the United States  The company currently has a Zacks Rank  2  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has moved up 0 5  over the past 60 days  The company  which is part of the Automotive   Domestic industry  is expected

Opportunity for Investors 
This  was used to find manufacturing companies that appear be trading at a discount to intrinsic value  Note that while improving demand is typically a good sign for US manufactures  the strengthening of the US dollar could make it more difficult for these companies to sell products overseas  Due to demand being primarily driven domestically in addition to the strong dollar  the screened stocks were then filtered to find manufacturing companies that generate the majority of their revenues within the United States

21104,242619,MPAA,Harvey  Pain Or Gain Ahead For Auto Stocks And ETFs ,opinion,"As Hurricane Harvey continues to wreak havoc in Texas  raising the level of floodwaters  market watchers are coming up with newer economic and corporate impacts  The tropical storm is expected to be heading offshore in the Gulf of Mexico before recharging in s  on Wednesday 
As per   loss estimates for Harvey is varying widely  but an insurance analyst at Imperial Capital projects it to be    Before this  Hurricane Katrina cost the U S  about  118 billion while Hurricane Sandy ended up hitting the country by about  75 billion 
Refiners  haven Texas saw their oil industry getting crippled thanks to Harvey  flood insurers turned soggy  and home improvement retailers rejoiced on the need to re arrange houses  Now  another important corner of the economy   auto sales   comes in the spotlight  read    
Hurricane Harvey Crashes into Auto Industry
The auto industry is in a tight spot for a few reasons as Harvey came lashing  As per an article published on   several auto dealerships have been shut down in this hurricane prone area  Vehicle imports have almost been held up 
 If these were enough  Hurricane Harvey dented thousands of new vehicles that were in dealership lots  according to a new analysis from   These new cars and trucks perhaps  have to be scrapped  as per  of AutoNation  NYSE AN  
The car shopping website estimates that Harvey affected 366 000 new vehicles across Texas and several of these are high profit trucks and SUVs  causing trouble for automakers  as per the source  This is especially true given Texas is the second largest market for U S  auto sales  making up about 9  of all retail states 
In fact  Texas is the top sales market for Ford   NYSE F    General Motors s   NYSE GM   GMC and Cadillac  Fiat Chrysler s   NYSE F   Ram and Mitsubishi brands  as per an article published on   read    
CNBC went on to note that Houston   ravaged by Harvey   is a key contributor to Texas auto sales  accounting for about  of total  with over 500 dealerships 
Since vehicles inventory will now be heavily hurt  potential sales for August will likely be 2  less  as per Edmunds  Sales decline could run into early September too  A  reduced his estimate for the rate of monthly auto sales in August  He foresees Harvey messing up about 125 counties in Texas and about 60  of the state s auto sales 
And AutoNation s  estimates that  Harvey disruptions will reduce the overall auto industry August sales rate by between 100 000 and 300 000 units  
What Lies Ahead for Auto Sector 
Having said that  we would likely to note that this could be a short term drag in sales as buying will pick up over the long term  AutoNation s CEO also emphasized that  there will be a substantial snapback either in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of next year because that s the American way  We rebuild  
ETF and Stock Impact 
Overall  we see a neutral impact on the auto industry as losses incurred now will likely be more than mitigated by the pickup in future sales  So  investors having a strong stomach for risks may shop auto ETF First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto ETF   see  here  
The fund has a global exposure  which gives certain protection against a U S  specific deterrent like Harvey  This fund holds about 34 auto stocks  General Motors  Toyota Motor   NYSE TM    Daimler AG  DE DAIGn   Honda Motor   NYSE HMC   and Ford Motor take the top five positions in the fund  with weights ranging from 7 46  to 8 05   In terms of country exposure  Japan takes the top spot at 34 9  while the U S  and Germany round off the next two spots with 21 8  and 18 5  share  respectively  read    
Auto Replacement Parts to Soar  
Since the need for parts replacement will be higher after Harvey s passage  companies like Douglas Dynamics Inc    NYSE PLOW    Motorcar Parts of America Inc    NASDAQ MPAA   and SPX Corporation   NYSE SPXC   should profit in the near term 
Auto Retailers  Near Term Pain  Long term Gain 
Needless to say  auto retailers that sell new and used vehicles  replacement parts  offer vehicle maintenance  warranty  and repair services  and arrange related financing and insurance for its automotive customers  may feel the pinch now but see higher sales in the upcoming quarters  This puts stocks like Lithia Motors Inc    NYSE LAD   and Rush Enterprises Inc    NASDAQ RUSHA   in focus

year of the tech stock  Across nearly every industry of the technology sector  shares have soared on the back of increased demand and shifting consumer habits  Interestingly  one of the most in demand

who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Motorcar Parts of America  Inc    NASDAQ MPAA   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Motorcar Parts of America has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of nearly 11 0  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 16 6  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Motorcar Parts of America s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past three years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 2  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Motorcar Parts of America has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 8 4  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Motorcar Parts of America stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Motorcar Parts of America has a P S ratio of about 0 7  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 0 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  MPAA is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Motorcar Parts of America currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Motorcar Parts of America a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 8 3  which is far better than the industry average of 14 0  Clearly  MPAA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Motorcar Parts of America might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of D  This gives MPAA a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  looking at the company s recent earnings estimates  the current fiscal quarter as well as the fiscal full year has not seen any estimate revisions in the past sixty days Still  the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 11 1  in the past two months  while the fiscal full year estimate has inched lower by 0 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Motorcar Parts of America  Inc  Price and Consensus    This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMotorcar Parts of America is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among the bottom 33   and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past three years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ,2018-12-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-motorcar-parts-of-america-mpaa-a-suitable-value-pick-200369508,200369508

21109,242624,MPAA,Tesla  TSLA  Shares Fall On Downgrade By Goldman Sachs,opinion,"Tesla Motors  Inc  s   NASDAQ TSLA   shares fell 3 58  to  201 00 on Oct 6 after Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  downgraded the stock to  Neutral  from  Buy   and reduced the 6 month target price to  185 00 from  240 00 
The lowered rating was based on concerns related to the proposed acquisition of SolarCity Corporation   NASDAQ SCTY    Given that both Tesla and SolarCity have a high cash burn rate  the combined company would have significant capital needs and high leverage  creating significant risks  Moreover  the Model 3 launch is approaching and expanding the scope of the company s operations at this stage may lead to risks  Particularly  a delay in the launch of Model 3 will weigh significantly on the stock  However  Goldman Sachs conceded that the acquisition would result in some synergies  particularly from lower customer acquisition costs 
The downgrade of the auto sector s rating to cautious from neutral also played a role in Tesla s downgrade  The sector s rating was reduced on concerns that the cyclical auto industry reached a peak last year TESLA MOTORS Price

21114,242629,MPAA,Tesla   Other Automotive Stocks To Zoom In 2020,opinion,Since the financial crisis a decade ago  U S  vehicle sales have only gone up  Sales hit a record 17 6 million in 2016 after it had bottomed out at 10 4 million in 2009  But since then  sales have been near the 17 million mark  providing an unusual steady trend for an industry that is particularly cyclical in nature Industry experts  however  expect the auto industry to slow down a bit this year  Analysts now expect U S  auto sales for the year to decline between 1  to 2   What s more  the auto industry in China  the world s largest auto market  is expected to witness a 2  fall in vehicles sales this year  according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers  CAAM   By the way  stricter emission standards may hamper auto sales in the European Union region But despite the moribund sales prediction  completely neglecting auto stocks won t be the right thing to do  Especially  if you look at Tesla  Inc    NASDAQ TSLA    Wall Street is currently loving the electric carmaker  It has now become the most valuable U S  automaker in history and its market cap is almost double that of Ford and General Motors  NYSE GM  combined According to data from the Center for Research in Security Prices  Tesla now has a market value of  86 billion  which tops the previous record high of  76 1 billion for shares of Ford in 1999  Needless to say  the Italian car manufacturer Fiat Chrysler is a distant fourth  with a market value of around  22 billion But does Tesla s meteoric rise raises doubt about its future price movement  Certainly not  Even though Tesla recently unveiled its much awaited all electric  Cybertruck   the Model 3 designed for electric powered performance has been a game changer  And with the company delivering 112 000 vehicles  mostly Model 3  in the fourth quarter of 2019  the company is poised to gain this year as well  The highly anticipated launch of Model Y  a small crossover vehicle  will also boost the company this year Tesla s orders  in the meantime  have been increasing steadily  Throughout last year  Tesla s orders grew at an impressive rate  And since the federal credit for U S  based buyers of Tesla vehicles has been trimmed  orders will continue to rise this year  Additionally  demand for Model X and S has been increasing sequentially again  Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn confirmed that the company is  increasing production on S and X lines in response to increasing demand  Tesla  thus  possesses a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has risen 46  over the past 60 days  The company s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 79 7   way more than the  industry s estimated rise of 7 8   Tesla  in fact  has outperformed the broader industry over the past year   43 0  vs  18 6    You can see   But why just invest in Tesla  Investors should be a little more adventurous and increase their bets on other auto stocks poised to gain in the near term  In this process  you can double your returns  After all  the healthy U S  economy  low gas prices  low interest rates and longer loan terms bode well for the auto industry this year  So  here are the obvious choices  Blue Bird Corporation   NASDAQ BLBD    designs  engineers  manufacturesand sells school buses and related parts in the United

21139,242654,MPAA,Forget Bargains  Play 5 Stocks With Rising P E Instead,opinion,"Stocks with low P E are always investors  favorites as the ratio indicates undervaluation  This ratio is obtained by dividing a stock s current market price with its historical or estimated earnings  It measures how much an investor needs to shell out per dollar of earnings 
So the golden rule is   the lower the P E of a stock  the higher its value for investors  This is because value investors believe that a stock s current market price is not reflective of its historical future earnings and therefore chances of outperformance are higher 
Naturally  there are very few investors who pay attention to stocks with an increasing P E  But this often overlooked trend can prove worthwhile in finding great stocks  Let s dig a little deeper 
How Can Rising P E Be Helpful 
Investors should note that stock prices move in tandem with earnings performance  If earnings come in stronger  the price of a stock soars  Solid quarterly earnings and guidance in turn boost the earnings forecast  leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price 
So  if the price is rising steadily  it means that investors are assured of the stock s fundamental strength  expect some strong positives out of it as well as solid and faster earnings growth  Moreover  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growth 
Percentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal to the previous year 
 These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years 
Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeks 
Percentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks 
 These two criteria show that the price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes 
Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 
Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500 
 Here  the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500 
Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100  
 A 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Strong Buy or Buy rating can get through 
Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just 5 
Here are the five stocks 
VeriSign Inc    NASDAQ VRSN    The company is into domain names and Internet security with the Zacks Industry Rank in the top 25   The stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Motorcar Parts of America Inc    NASDAQ MPAA    It is a renowned manufacturer of replacement alternators and starters for imported and domestic cars and light trucks  The Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 2   The stock has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see
