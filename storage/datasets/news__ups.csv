the Zacks Integrated International Oil industry over the past year   1 7  vs   2 8    The Zacks analyst believes that ExxonMobil s bellwether status in the energy space and optimal integrated capital structure have helped it come up with industry leading returns Moreover  the management s track record of capex discipline across the commodity price cycle make it a relatively lower risk energy sector play  The company owns some of the most prolific upstream assets globally  with a number of major projects slated to come online over the next few years Notably  ExxonMobil has made 15 oil discoveries in offshore Guyana  The firm estimates 750 000 barrels of oil production per day from the region by 2025 However  the integrated energy player s downstream   chemical units significantly underperformed in the first nine months of 2019  The units are unlikely to have recovered in the fourth quarter owing to scheduled maintenance activities Shares of AT T have gained  3 7  in the past three months against the Zacks Wireless National industry s rise of  1 5   The Zacks analyst believes that the company s three year financial framework  which is expected to drive significant improvement in margins and bottom line growth with sustained investments and debt reduction It aims to deploy a standards based  nationwide mobile 5G network in early 2020  AT T s 5G Evolution technology is live in more than 200 markets  which is expected to increase significantly in the near future The company anticipates gaining a competitive edge over rivals through edge computing services and healthy dividend payout  However  AT T is witnessing a steady decline in linear TV subscribers and legacy services Its wireline division is facing loss in access line due to competitive pressure from VoIP service providers  As the company tries to woo customers with discounts  freebies and cash credits  margin pressures tend to soar Disney s shares have gained  3 9  over the past six months against the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry s rise of  4 5   The Zacks analyst believes that Disney is expected to benefit from its solid slate of theatrical releases in fiscal 2020 The upcoming movies  including Mulan  Free Guy and Black Widow  are anticipated to aid the Studio Entertainment top line  The success of Frozen 2 and Star Wars  The Rise of Skywalker is positive for the company s first quarter fiscal 2020 results Moreover  growing popularity of Disney  makes it a key catalyst for the company s prospects  However  the company anticipates higher operating losses in the DTC   International segment due to the ongoing investments  Moreover  increasing operating expenses related to domestic parks and resorts are expected to negatively impact profitability Other

14764,236279,UPS,CrowdStrike  FedEx  Microsoft  Amazon And Alphabet Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 13  2020    Shares of CrowdStrike   NASDAQ CRWD   as the Bull of the Day  FedEx   NYSE FDX   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT    Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  CrowdStrikeis the  11 billion cyber security darling of 2019 that IPO d around  60 last June  ran to  100 in August and then just built a base around  45 50 in Q4 And that was part of the reason I pounced on shares under  50 on December 30 once the selling appeared to be over In fact  the sellers may regret what they just did last month  Here s what I told my TAZR Trader group in the recent Buy Alert   TAZR Traders  Portfolio is buying CrowdStrike between  48 and  50 CrowdStrike has a powerful AI machine learning  ML  approach to 24 7 malware threats that can no longer be recognized with traditional  signature based  metrics  past threat patterns CRWD became a Zacks  2 Rank after beating expectations and providing solid guidance in its Q3 report on Dec 5 But the stock sold off afterwards  with particularly heavy volume on Dec 9    exactly 180 days after its IPO on June 12 And that means it was IPO investors who were  locked up  and just wanted out after missing their chance to sell at  100  Shares dropped from that peak during the Ukraine news The bad news is that just about any selling was justified in the second half based valuation alone as the stock still trades at 20X forward sales with a  10 billion market cap The good news is that the insider selling hardly put a dent in the potential turn that is setting up  In fact  shares couldn t even touch the Oct Nov double bottom at  45 and there has been a good amount of volume this month showing willing buyers taking shares from shaky insider hands Now that they are out of the way  let s see what the growth and upside are for CRWD  end of excerpt from TAZR Buy Alert on Jan 30 I went on in that report to describe the analysts who were turning bullish again  despite the valuation Silencing the HatersStifel Nicolaus raised their price target on CRWD shares to  90 after going over the company s Q3 beats in core SaaS metrics     ARR increased 97 4  y y to  501 7 million vs   465 2M Stifel estimate  Total revenue increased 88 5  y y to  125 1M vs   119M Stifel estimate  Subscription revenue increased 98 1  y y to  114 2M vs   108 5M Stifel estimateStifel analyst Gur Talpaz said CrowdStrike delivered  another clean beat  in Q3 across all major financial metrics and he believes the company s report  has put to bed unsubstantiated fears surrounding heightened competitive pressures and various conspiracy theories  In a note titled  Mic Drop  CrowdStrike Silences the Haters   Talpaz added that he believes CrowdStrike s cloud centric approach to endpoint and device security is increasingly resonating with customers and he continues to see the company having  a significant cloud defined moat that other vendors are ill equipped to compete against   Guidance Raised Ahead of Another Big Growth YearCrowdStrike management also raised guidance for their Q4 FY20  ends in January  with total revenue in the range of  135 9 138 6 million vs  prior consensus  127 2M This caused analysts not only to raise this year s EPS estimates but FY 2021  begins February  jumped from a loss of 40 cents to a loss of just 21 cents The topline is expected to grow a healthy 42  from  467 million to  664 million in the new year Oppenheimer titled their post earnings note  Solid F3Q20 Execution Supported by Record Net New Customer   ARR  Positive Cash Flow In Sight for FY21  They have a  100 PT on CRWD shares Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz wrote that CrowdStrike Holdings reported another  spectacular quarter   Despite a high fundamental bar heading into the print  the company surpassed expectations as total annual recurring revenue growth of 97  year over year easily beat the Street s 85  estimate  The analyst continues to believe the stock will likely show a strong rebound over the next several months  He keeps a Buy rating on CrowdStrike with a  77 price target And on Dec 30  the day I first bought CRWD shares under  50  came this analyst move   Needham Adds CRWD to Conviction ListNeedham analyst Alex Henderson kept his Buy rating and  92 price target on Crowdstrike  and added the stock to the Needham Conviction List in favor ofZscaler  calling it his  Single Best Idea in Security  heading into 2020  The analyst said the company s  technology  platform and efficacy  combine to create  one of the core platforms in Security  regardless of its customer strategy  Henderson added that CrowdStrike offers the  right technology  to improve security for either legacy perimeter defense or for  emerging  zero trust  cloud direct security Customers from Goldman to Mercedes to US GovLast week I wrote a longer piece on CRWD and my increasing conviction in the company s solutions and sales potential after  1  learning more about their customers and  2  understanding their use of AI and machine learning  ML  to tackle persistent malware attacks  especially from skilled adversaries from Iran    In that short video and detailed article  I describe the security threats to banks  infrastructure  and technology networks that will only grow this decade  requiring 24 7 cyber  learning machines  The Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula 1 team did a video presentation with the company because their car engineers and technicians rely on CrowdStrike to protect the data streaming from thousands of sensors every time they test something Obviously  this group was willing to do a commercial for CrowdStrike  Hundreds of other companies probably don t want to talk about these data risks But just think about how many corps have similar voluminous proprietary data streaming in thousands of IoT channels that they need protected CrowdStrike Falcon on GovCloudAnother impressive customer win was at Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   where CISO  chief info security officer  Andy Ozment previously worked in senior level US government roles for over 6 years  Obviously  the dude knows his stuff The most critical vulnerability we all share is a cyber attack on government and utility services like happened in Atlanta in 2018 Not surprisingly  Crowdstrike is already working closely with US agencies as Falcon on GovCloud provides the industry s first cloud delivered endpoint security and IT hygiene solution  Each component is tailored for securing the U S  public sector  and is FedRAMP authorized and delivered from AWS GovCloud This is probably why CrowdStrike was such a natural choice for Ozment and Goldman Falcon on GovCloud enables customers to prevent all types of modern attacks and significantly reduces the cost of operating security infrastructure These things were on my mind last week after the US strike on Iran s top military general Qasem Soleimani  And it propelled me on Friday January 3 to issue this trade alert   TAZR Traders  Portfolio is adding to CrowdStrike under  51 Looking for the massive call buying action in CRWD that I noted earlier this morning  I came across two other data points   1  Nomura predicts that CrowdStrike is poised for  another year of hyper growth   The comment came in Nomura s note previewing the year and the firm s best ideas  The firm maintains a Buy rating and  71 target on CrowdStrike 2  As we evaluate what Iran is capable of and likely to do  I was reminded of the 2018 utility  ransomware  cyber attack on Atlanta that was executed by two Iranian hackers   story excerpt below from Wikipedia These might explain the bullish action in Jan  Feb  and March call options  end of Jan 3 TAZR Buy Alert Ransomware is Not NewAccording to CrowdStrike  an exponential growth curve of malware has made it a pervasive and persistent threat to end users  Most virus protection software can t catch half of it now What I love about the CrowdStrike approach to using AI and ML to seek and destroy cyber threats is that it s about  going where the ball will be  In other words  the most sophisticated cyber threats of this decade won t be designed by humans  They will be machine made So why not get ready for full scale cyber war with the only tools that can win    better machine programs that are constantly learning Besides that  even if CRWD is not the winner of this war  you and I will be because we ll be studying the most urgent application of ML and AI  national security Malware Meets Machine LearningOn Monday January 6  I gave my TAZR members this report   Short Game in CRWD Getting CrowdedThe investing crowd came for CRWD today and 4 more events made them chase the shares  9  on massive volume of over 21 million shares 1  CrowdStrike CEO on Cramer s show Friday evening2  Actual pro Iranian hack of a US government website on Saturday  as I suggested was likely 3  VMWare s head of cyber security interviewed Friday evening on Bloomberg on his knowledge of the  footprints  and  lateral  threats now possible from Iran4  Bloomberg published a story about the Iranian hack of Sheldon Adelson s Las Vegas Sands casino in 2014All of this combined for a massive bonfire of short positions as new longs deployed fresh capital CRWD shorts had already been covering in December  leaving the shares short at just 6 5 million  So that s how we know there was even more fresh money pouring in to the stock In the article vlog linked above  I go over each bullet in more detail  I also evaluate the current odds of a major vs  minor cyber attack by Iran and share some of the 2020 CyberWar outlook from the analysts at SunTrust CrowdStrike seems pretty confident that their model of  cloud native  and data centric solutions is a breakthrough in cyber security on par with Salesforce s CRM Cloud and Workday s HR Cloud If that claim of upper tier industry domination is even half true  the stock has higher to go in 2020 and beyond Disclosure  I own CRWD shares for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio  FedExdid it again  For the second consecutive quarter  the shipping and logistics pioneer delivered another disappointing quarter and outlook On December 17  the company reported a 10  EPS miss for Q2 fiscal 2020  ended Nov  on account of a weaker global economy due to escalating trade tensions  higher costs at the Ground unit and loss of business with Amazon Simultaneously  the company slashed its fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings outlook on expectations of lower revenues at each of the transportation segments and increased costs due to expansion of 7 day delivery service at the Ground unit Since then  analyst have taken estimates down yet again  The EPS consensus for the current fiscal year ending in May has dropped 10 2  from  12 07 to  10 84  And FY  21  starts in June  fell nearly 9  from  13 63 to  12 42  What s Going on with FedEx     Part 2FedEx Chief Executive Fred Smith gave analysts a surprisingly sober view of his business during the earnings conference call that day  When you have a change that comes on you as fast as this did  it s hard to react to it  Our international business  especially in Europe  weakened significantly since we last talked with you   Most of the issues that we are dealing with today are induced by bad political choices  I mean  making a bad decision about a new tax  creating a tremendously difficult situation with Brexit  the immigration crisis in Germany  the mercantilism and state owned enterprise initiatives in China  the tariffs that the United States put in unilaterally  So you just go down the list  and they re all things that have created macroeconomic slowdown  Most analysts were caught off guard  Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  analyst Ravi Shanker summed up the reaction of many when he wrote later  We recognize that global growth has slowed but we are very surprised by the magnitude of the headwind  which is what might be seen in a severe recession   My colleague Ben Rains wrote about FedEX as the Bear of the Day in late October after a similar report and outlook   What s Going on with FedEx     Part 1FedEx shocked many on Wall Street when the firm in August essentially ended its relationship with Amazon  Some might contend that the global shipping powerhouse pulled the cord too early  even though company management noted that  Amazon contracts represented only a small proportion  of its revenues CEO Frederick Smith said on FedEx s Q1 fiscal 2020 earnings call that his company s decision not to renew its Amazon contract will hurt near term profits  However  he went on to note that the company has started to land and onboard deals to help replace the lost traffic  while also removing  significant costs which were unique to Amazon s requirements  It seems that the Memphis  Tennessee based firm didn t want to be in business with a company that aims to take over the global shipping and logistics market  And FedEx hopes to do what Microsoft has done with cloud computing  attract Amazon s direct rivals  including companies like Walmart  NYSE WMT  FDX aims to improve its FedEx Express hub automation  modernize its FedEx Express air fleet  and much more going forward  Management also outlined how it plans to enhance its offerings to attract more e commerce customers and business to consumer clients  while remaining a B2B heavy operation   To lead in e commerce  we have launched or announced FedEx Extra Hours  an express service  which provides nightly pickup with delivery the next business day   Smith went on to say on FDX s earnings call FedEx has more plans to help improve and bolster its e commerce business as it aims to better compete against its core competitors  Company management noted that FedEx competes against four other firms  United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS   DHL  the US Postal Service  and more recently Amazon Along with investors  Amazon related questions  FedEx continued to point to broader economic worries  Last quarter  the company significantly cut its fiscal 2020 profit forecast and noted that its  performance continues to be negatively impacted by a weakening global macro environment driven by increasing trade tensions and policy uncertainty  Canary in the Global Economy It s wise to be concerned about the trade war and global slowdown impacts on FedEx  Given the consistent shipping volumes that flow through their network  if they slowdown  the whole world economy may be headed that way Right now  we ve seen this show up in the manufacturing PMI and ISM data  But the rest of the US economy appears robust Until we have more data to know which way the momentum is going  it s probably best to just watch FedEx as a business and avoid the shares One thing for sure that will give you a clue is the Zacks Rank as it rises and signals rising estimates again Additional content Microsoft s Azure Poised to PopWedbush analyst Daniel Ives put out a positive note on Microsoft s cloud business  which isn t as easy to follow as Amazon s AWS because Microsoft doesn t break out all aspects of its cloud business So the comparison we actually read about in most cases is the infrastructure  IaaS  business  which still trails Amazon  But Microsoft also offers PaaS  which makes its cloud offerings more robust and attractive to new adopters  That s probably why the analyst thinks it is firing  on all cylinders around Office 365 and its Azure strategic vision    It also makes the business bigger than AWS  What s more  the December edition of the Goldman Sachs bi annual survey of 100 technology executives at Global 2000 companies shows that 56 are using Azure IaaS versus 48 for AWS  which seems to indicate that Microsoft is narrowing the gap in this segment as well Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that 23  of IT workloads are already on public clouds  a jump from 19  in June  They expect that number to go to 43  over the next three years  which means huge growth potential not only for Amazon and Microsoft but also for the distant third  Alphabet Microsoft has always had an edge at enterprise customers because of its being the incumbent player whose offerings most enterprises are already using  Migration or the hybrid approach that they largely prefer is easier when you re using the same vendor Ives is saying that the business has now reached a tipping point where the trend of Amazon winning more of the orders is going to change   Enterprise customers and partners we have spoken to over the past few weeks indicate a clear acceleration of larger and more strategic enterprise cloud deals as Redmond is poised to win the majority of the next phase of cloud deployments versus the likes of Amazon and Bezos   he says And best of all is the JEDI win according to Ives because of the  ripple effect  that  will be felt for years to come on both the government and enterprise fronts and thus indicates a seminal moment in the cloud battle between these two stalwarts  Overall  he thinks that  clearly Amazon won the first phase of cloud spending  but this next phase of cloud will be dominated by Redmond as it gains share and significantly narrows the gap over the coming years  The cloud business does indeed seem to be the thing driving share prices  which are up 57   over the past year  But this is also why the shares are overvalued with respect to the S P 500 on every consideration except cash flow  That s why we have a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  on the shares You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong

14767,236282,UPS,United Parcel Service  UPS  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This package delivery service is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 11 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 8  
Revenues are expected to be  20 58 billion  up 3 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 15  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for UPS 
For UPS  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 69  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that UPS will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that UPS would post earnings of  2 06 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 07  delivering a surprise of  0 49  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
UPS doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/united-parcel-service-ups-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200501099,200501099

171047,392563,UPS,Why Shares of UPS Fell in January,news,"What happened
Shares of United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS  fell 11 6  in January  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence  with nearly the entire drop occurring in the final days of the month  The culprit was the company s outlook for the year  which raised questions about the company s ability to deliver for investors 

UPS data by YCharts
So what
UPS had a much better 2019 than rival FedEx  and generated fourth quarter results that matched analyst expectations  But the shipping company s 2020 outlook was underwhelming  UPS sees 2020 adjusted earnings of between  7 76 and  8 06 per share  short of the consensus  8 07 per share estimate  due to expected further slowing of the global economy 

On a post earnings call with investors  CFO Brian Newman said UPS is cautious despite the recently announced U S  China trade agreement  which investors had hoped would boost international shipping and help reverse declines in the global economy 

Our outlook reflects forecasted year over year declines in U S  industrial production and other global softness  However  there is growing optimism due to the recent trade agreements that could move us higher  Another external factor that will affect our results is lower pension discount rates  For this reason  operating profits  specifically in the U S   will be muted 

Now what
UPS does offer some reason for optimism  Though FedEx and XPO Logistics were hurt in 2019 due to issues with Amazon com  UPS has been able to maintain a healthy relationship with the e commerce giant  Amazon s share of total UPS revenue rose to 11 6  in 2019  which UPS said is due in part to its network being able to accommodate Amazon s need for next day deliveries 
UPS is continuing to invest in its service to small  and medium sized businesses  That will lead to about  6 7 billion in capital expenditures in 2020  but the company is hopeful the added capacity will make it the shipper of choice for both Amazon and other retailers 
Of course  there is a risk that as Amazon continues to bring its logistics in house  UPS will eventually face an issue similar to what FedEx experienced in 2019  The bottom line is UPS struck a cautious tone during its late January earnings call  Investors who headed for the sidelines after the results were announced were simply heeding the company s advice ",2020-02-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/prgo7,2076855

171053,392569,UPS,United Parcel Service  UPS  Q4 Earnings Top Estimates,opinion,"United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS  came out with quarterly earnings of  2 11 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 10 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 94 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0 48   A quarter ago  it was expected that this package delivery service would post earnings of  2 06 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 07  delivering a surprise of 0 49  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
UPS  which belongs to the Zacks Transportation   Air Freight and Cargo industry  posted revenues of  20 57 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 05   This compares to year ago revenues of  19 85 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
UPS shares have lost about 1 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 3  
What s Next for UPS 
While UPS has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for UPS was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 54 on  17 98 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  7 98 on  77 38 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Transportation   Air Freight and Cargo is currently in the top 17  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2020-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/united-parcel-service-ups-q4-earnings-top-estimates-200503118,200503118

Relations OfficerThank you  and now I ll turn the call over to David David Abney    UPS Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  everyone  I d like to welcome Nando and George to the call  They oversee our two largest segments  Each have deep knowledge of our business through more than 30 years of UPS experience  This morning I ll share my thoughts about the fourth quarter and the year ahead  Brian will then review the financial details of the quarter and 2020 guidance  During the fourth quarter  we continued to successfully execute our strategies and deliver on our commitments  Revenue growth improved network efficiency to drive operating leverage and continuous transformation to stay ahead of market changes  Our multiyear investment strategy is positioning us well to support the needs of our customers generate profitable revenue growth  reward our shareowners and create opportunities for our employees I want to thank the 495 000 UPSers around the world for their efforts during peak  We delivered more than 1 6 billion packages in the fourth quarter  including a record level of residential packages  This exceeded our expectations and resulted in a near 8  increase in volume over last year  Also  we were recognized by third parties for providing industry leading  on time service for this remarkably high peak volume  Our execution over the holidays benefited from increased capacity and automation throughout the network  effective use of proven tools and enhanced technology and deeper collaboration with our customers to align volume with network capacity  Our operating teams took advantage of the 20 new aircraft and the additional 10 million square feet of automated capacity we added to our network in 2018 and  19  which enabled us to provide great service for our customers for the last two peak seasons And many of the technologies and processes we employed during peak will carry forward to make our normal daily operations more efficient year round  For the company  in the fourth quarter  revenue grew 3 6   operating profit was up nearly 14  and margins expanded in all segments  As a result  fourth quarter adjusted EPS was  2 11  a nearly 9  increase over last year  We re continuing to focus on our strategic growth imperatives  SMBs  e commerce  healthcare and international growth markets  Our transformation strategies and investments anticipated the growing significance of global e commerce and position UPS well to capture opportunities from all customers  We re embracing the e commerce structural shift to faster delivery  which bought a surge in Next Day Air volume of more than 22  in 2019  An increase we were well equipped to handle with greater efficiency Our investments drove productivity gains and lowered unit cost on a year over year basis  generating positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter and for the year  We also proved that our integrated network provides UPS and our customers tremendous flexibility to more efficiently respond to the fast pace of change in the market  Now looking ahead to 2020  I just returned from the World Economic Forum in Davos  where discussions with customers and policy leaders reinforced our current outlook for this year  The 2020 economic backdrop will provide opportunities for UPS  Consumer demand remains healthy globally and in the U S   and we re positioning solutions to grow commercial deliveries despite weakness in the industrial sector  Global GDP estimates call for slower growth in the first half of the year with full year growth of 2 5   finishing about the same as last year  which is below what many considered a normal growth rate On a positive note  advancements with U S  trade are encouraging with the president s recent signing of the USMCA and the U S  China Phase one trade agreement  an historic event I had the privilege to witness  Each is a big step in the right direction for global trade  Amid dynamic economic conditions and structural shifts in the market  UPS is taking aggressive steps forward by investing for growth  speeding up our network and introducing new SMB centric solutions that help them compete and grow  Our customers rely on speed to market as a competitive differentiator and we believe there s additional growth opportunity for UPS as we accelerate our network and further broaden weekend operations This year  we re significantly expanding Extended Hours pickup for Next Day Ground to cover an industry leading 98  of the U S  population  We re also expanding weekend delivery services or Saturday deliveries  We re bringing online more operations  doubling the amount of volume we handled in 2019 to reach an additional 40 million U S  consumers  Plus  we remain the only integrated carrier that offers commercial and residential pickup and delivery on Saturdays  We are initially launching Sunday delivery to the majority of the U S  with an economy product  and we ll expand throughout the year to provide our customers a wide range of delivery options covering all seven days of the week  We will also further expand our integrated network by adding more than five million square feet of new automated capacity Most notably  we recently announced plans for a super hub in Harrisburg  Pennsylvania  unlocking opportunities and speeding up the network in the Midwest and Northeast corridor  We see tremendous opportunities  and we are taking advantage now by reinvesting a portion of our transformation savings to speed time in transit and introduce unique new products and services  These actions generate long term revenue growth and enable further diversification among our growing SMB customer base  Yesterday  we announced several new solutions  To continue to help our SMB customers  we re expanding My Choice for business in 30 countries  And by the end of 2020  96  of UPS  global small package volume will be eligible to be tracked and controlled through My Choice for business  And we re enhancing ups com to simplify cross border trade  The website will guide customers through estimating duties and taxes and determining customs requirements  making it easier for SMBs to ship internationally We also had to do several next generation technology expansions  Drone delivery service from UPS Flight Forward will soon begin at the University of California San Diego Health Campus  We will soon close on an equity investment in Arrival  a leading electric vehicle manufacturer  along with our commitment to purchase 10 000 advanced EV delivery vehicles  And we are deploying dynamic ORION  continuously optimizing routing in the US as we progress to make the fastest  most technology enabled company in the industry  We have made great strides expanding and further automating our Smart Global Logistics network and in creating new solutions to grow revenue The impacts of our transformation are becoming more visible in our operating performance even as we invest in new capabilities  All of the network investments and SMB initiatives we are discussing reinforce our confidence in achieving our transformation EPS commitment of  1 to  1 20  The decisions and investments we are making  especially with our SMB initiatives and pulling forward actions to speed up our network  will uniquely position UPS in the industry and are designed to ensure continued success well into the future Now Brian will take you through our results Brian Newman    Chief Financial OfficerThanks  David  and good morning  Today  my remarks will cover our quarterly performance and the full year for 2019  then I ll finish with our 2020 outlook  Both our fourth quarter and full year results were enabled by UPS  strategies  execution and investments in our Smart Global Logistics Network  Our diversified growth is the result of making the right trade offs as we continually adapt to the changing environment  During the quarter  we generated positive operating leverage and grew operating profit and margins across all segments  As a result  4Q 2019 diluted EPS grew nearly 9   and full year EPS was  7 53 per diluted share  Moving into the segments  In the US  we continue to see strong volume growth  The additional aircraft capacity and automation we added enabled our operators to adjust the network and efficiently meet the surge in demand for our services  allowing us to take on new customers during the height of peak season  U S Domestic revenue increased nearly 7  driven by volume growth across all products  Next Day Air volume increased nearly 26   Deferred was up almost 16  and Ground volume rose more than 6   Growth came from B2C and B2B shippers  producing the fifth consecutive quarter of B2B growth  Customer and product mix dynamics decreased revenue per piece by 2  driven by lower average weight per piece and larger e commerce customers  adoption of faster delivery options  Most importantly  unit cost was down 3 2   which in turn generated positive operating leverage  the result of productivity improvements from the investments we have made over multiple quarters  U S  Domestic operating profit was more than  1 2 billion  a significant increase of more than 20   Now looking at the International segment  Strong execution and continued cost management enabled another quarter of profit growth and margin expansion  which helped to counter a 1 7  decline in revenue primarily due to conditions in the macro environment Total export volume was down slightly in the quarter as gains on intra Europe  intra Asia and U S  export trade lanes did not fully offset the declines into and out of the U K  and on the Asia U S  lane  We adjusted global air capacity to match demand where and when needed  driving high levels of asset utilization  We lowered International block hours by about 3   and in total  unit cost decreased by 2 8   While navigating within the challenging environment  we grew operating profit nearly 4  and expanded margins 110 basis points  reaching 21 5   Our performance further demonstrates our ability to leverage our capabilities and continuously adapt to grow profit  Now let s turn to Supply Chain and Freight  Even with the macro challenges in Forwarding  operating profit was up 17  and margins expanded 120 basis points primarily due to the diversity of our portfolio  our continued focus on SMBs and lapping last year s profit impact during labor negotiations for the Freight business Looking at the individual business units  Logistics  UPS Freight and Marken were bright spots  All three grew revenue with profit up double digits  helping to offset the softer business conditions faced by Coyote and Forwarding  Now let s turn to cash and shareholder returns  UPS continues to generate strong cash from operations  enabling further investment and rewards for our shareholders  As I guided last quarter  we lowered our 2019 capex due to increased capital efficiencies  The result was capital investments of  6 5 billion  Additionally  we returned  4 3 billion to shareholders  including about  1 billion of share buybacks and  3 3 billion in dividend distributions  Now let me comment more broadly on 2019  We made strong progress with our transformation We closely monitor market changes and made quick and prudent adjustments throughout the year  For example  we continually adjusted our integrated network aligning our capacity with changes in market demand resulting in a lower cost structure that drove strong operating leverage across our business  We launched numerous innovative solutions to help grow B2B and B2C volume as well as win new SMB customers and we took advantage of structural changes in the market like the rapid adoption of faster delivery driven by e commerce a benefit to UPS in 2019  The strength of our network allowed us to capitalize on the structural shift in the market for next day delivery and help all customers embrace this trend  UPS was also able to increase our business with Amazon through competitive wins and the structural shift to next day delivery  When combined with the revenue declines in the International and Supply Chain and Freight segments  Amazon s percentage of total company revenue rose to 11 6  for the year  On the whole  we managed a nearly 6  increase in annual volume And at the same time  we generated double digit increases in operating profit and expanded margins  And we were able to deliver EPS within our guidance range despite a dynamic market environment  Now looking to 2020  We expect full year adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of  7 76 to  8 06  Our outlook reflects forecasted year over year declines in U S  industrial production and other global softness  However  there is growing optimism due to the recent trade agreements that could move us higher  Another external factor that will affect our results is lower pension discount rates  For this reason  operating profits  specifically in the U S   will be muted  However  benefits below the line in other income and expense will more than offset the impact to operating profit  We provided a new table in our financial information that holds pension discount rates neutral on operating profit on a year over year basis  giving investors additional transparency in this area Now let me review the key drivers of our 2020 EPS guidance at the total company level  starting with 2019 EPS of  7 53  First  strong underlying segment performance is anticipated to produce year over year EPS growth between 6  and 10   Supporting this growth are several company specific tailwinds  including growing adoption of our new solutions  increased efficiencies from our expanding automation and the proven value of our integrated network that provides us and our customers flexibility to adapt to a changing environment  Working against us this year is the impact to operating profit from lower pension discount rates I mentioned earlier  This is equivalent to a drag on EPS of  0 26  In addition  there is a  0 33 EPS headwind from the SMB network initiatives  We have elected to implement SMB initiatives to speed up our network across multiple lanes and broaden our weekend operations This will result in tripling the rate of improvement we made in 2019  making time in transit faster for 80  of residential and commercial customers in the U S  Clearly  this will improve UPS  competitiveness and further diversify revenue  creating more opportunities for SMB growth  These initiatives will drive both start up costs and revenue growth in 2020  And in the coming years  revenue is expected to grow significantly  In 2021  we expect EPS and margin accretion from these initiatives  Turning below the line  Total other income and expense will be a positive for the company primarily because  in 2019  we generated more than 17  returns on pension assets  leading to a favorable impact in 2020  And lastly  in 2019  we enjoyed tax benefits from discrete items that are not anticipated to repeat  muting EPS by  0 10 The 2020 tax rate is expected to be between 22 5  and 23 5   Pulling it all together  full year 2020 adjusted diluted earnings per share will be in the range of  7 76 to  8 06  another year of solid EPS growth  The strong underlying segment performance builds on prior year gains and gives us confidence in our ability to deliver our long term targets  which includes an incremental  1 to  1 20 of EPS by the end of 2022 from transformation initiatives  Diving deeper into the segments  In the U S   we forecast revenue to increase 4  to 7  driven in part by continued adoption of faster delivery services and the new solutions we ve introduced  We anticipate Ground will grow in the low single digit range  with healthy growth in air shipments  keeping in mind that we will be lapping elevated Next Day growth over the last three quarters We re also planning for improvements in customer and product mix as well as growth in base rates  As I mentioned  we are further broadening our customer base through network and product initiatives  We also expect incremental efficiencies throughout the year from previously opened and new automated facilities that come online during 2020  Given all these factors  U S  Domestic operating profit  on a pension discount rate neutral basis  should grow in the low single digit range  This includes the impact from the SMB initiatives that we chose to accelerate and expand  in 2020 to capture the tremendous growth opportunity  Moving to International  we will continue to adapt to changing conditions  target high growth market opportunities and adjust the network to balance capacity with demand  Average daily shipments will increase in the low single digits  And revenue will increase 4  to 6  We will maintain our industry leading margins  and we expect to generate operating profit growth in the mid  to high single digits on a pension discount rate neutral basis  Finally  the Supply Chain and Freight segment will continue to execute its SMB and cost management strategies  The diversity of our Supply Chain and Freight business unit will again help us manage through cyclical moves in the market  We expect gains within our healthcare unit and truckload brokerage should rebound in the second half of the year  For the segment  revenue is anticipated to grow between 4  and 6   and operating profit is projected to grow between 5  and 7  on a pension discount rate neutral basis  Looking at the shape of EPS across the quarters  we expect 2020 to somewhat resemble 2019 In the first quarter  we expect EPS to be in the range of 17  to 18  of full year adjusted EPS midpoint driven by tougher year over year Supply Chain and Freight comps  softer macro conditions as well as the significant initial costs associated with our SMB initiatives  The remaining quarters will be fairly balanced in a range between 27  to 28  of the full year adjusted EPS midpoint  with the fourth quarter at the top end of the range  capex for 2020 is planned to be around  6 7 billion  These investments  which include automated buildings and technologies  continue to expand the efficiency and flexibility of the UPS Smart Global Logistics Network  Adjusted free cash flow is anticipated to be between  4 3 billion and  4 7 billion  We plan to reward shareholders with growth in dividends subject to Board approval and anticipate share buybacks of around  1 billion for 2020 similar to the last few years  In conclusion  the transformation investments we are making and the actions we are taking better position UPS to capitalize on growth opportunities  And if macro conditions turn more positive we could see additional upside potential for the year And now I ll ask the operator to open the line  Operator Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions Scott Childress    Vice President and Investor Relations OfficerThis is Scott Childress with UPS   Operator Instructions  Our first question is an online question  We ve got multiple analysts  Todd Fowler from KeyBanc as well as Fadi Chamoun from BMO  You mentioned that you are fast tracking initiatives in 2020 to capitalize on market opportunity  Can you elaborate on this David Abney    UPS Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI certainly can  This is David  And I would say we are faster fast tracking initiatives in 2020  We ve had positive momentum in 2019 and we see it in the underlying performance in 2020  We have clear visibility to some structural shifts that we really want to take advantage of  Next Day and seven days  And so we just see tremendous opportunity  especially with our SMBs  So we have elected  made a conscious decision that we want to pull forward some transformation initiatives into 2020 that would speed up our network significantly and take advantage of these opportunities that are being presented  And so we re focusing in two main areas  our time in transit and    we started improving time in transit  making it quicker in 2019  We re going to triple that rate of improvement in 2020  In fact  the UPS network  we will be faster  by the end of this campaign  for 80  of the U S  population than we were before we started  So 80   significant improvement And then  of course  weekend  7 day deliveries  just so important to consumers today  And we re going to double our delivery volume and    in weekend  on Saturdays  We re going to reach 40 million new consumers  And what s important is seven days is important  not just for residentials but for commercial deliveries  too  We have SMBs saying   What about us  We need 7 day delivery   And we re focusing in that regard  too  And then Sunday  we started out with an economy service that s over the majority of the population  And we re going to expand Sunday offerings throughout 2020 to give a wide  wide range of delivery options  So these are two structural shifts that we see that run hand in hand for our SMB strategy  And the good thing about these is they re not capex  heavy  They are opex costs  and we ll be putting in opex in 2020  But these initiatives  when you look at them together  are going to be accretive in 2021 It s going to give us much higher asset and lane utilization  It s going to give us better competitiveness and more pricing power  It s going to give us additional business or allow us to continue at a lower cost  And we re just really excited about this opportunity  Now is the time we seize the moment  and we believe investors expect us to seize these kinds of opportunities  and that s what we re doing  Brian will talk a little bit more about the effect for 2020  and then  of course  we ve already said accretive in 2021  So yes  fast  faster and we re going to continue to be speeding up our network for our customers  Thanks for the question Scott Childress    Vice President and Investor Relations OfficerOur next online question comes from Ben Hartford of R W  Baird  As transformation has progressed  how confident are you in UPS  ability to either realize the stated  1 to  1 20 or get it earlier or even exceed the initial estimates Brian Newman    Chief Financial OfficerI ll take that  Scott  Thanks  Ben  for the question  It s Brian  Look  we re confident in the  1 to  1 20 incremental EPS given the investments we ve made are already returning  We re looking at margin expansion across all three segments in 2019  and it s just building on the momentum  So I think by choosing to invest  accelerate and expand the investments in SMB that David referenced  we see opportunity to capture accretive growth going into 2021 and beyond OperatorWe have a question from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS  Please go ahead Tom Wadewitz    UBS    AnalystYes  Good morning  Wanted to get your thoughts about competitive environment  I think FedEx has accelerated  they re kind of quickly doing six days and seven days  so it seems that they re competing harder in e commerce  Obviously  you re getting a lot of traction in the market  getting strong growth in Domestic package and investing more aggressively as you announced today  Do you think that these investments accelerate your volume growth looking forward  Or is this something where you just have to spend more to compete and kind of keep the momentum  How do you think about competitive dynamic and how that translates to volume David Abney    UPS Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  we will  Tom  This is David  then I ll let Kate follow up  One  I can tell you that we re focused on serving the entire e commerce ecosystem  and that includes large e tailers  that includes the large retailers and that includes the SMBs  the thousands and thousands of SMBs that we help to compete and to punch above their weight with the larger companies  Just a few things to point out  When it comes to the major retailers  over 90  of the larger retailers utilize our innovative services  and we ve seen their business grow  I ll just give you a few examples of that target Qurate Retail Group  Macy s  Gap  Kohl s  Best Buy  Overstock  I mean  all of those companies have seen our innovative solutions  and we have grown  But where our real passion is    in this area is allowing and enabling small and midsized businesses to compete against the bigger companies  And that s where you saw just a string of announcements yesterday  We made more product and service announcements in 2019 than we ve made my entire career at UPS  and we are following it up this year  And Kate  I ll turn it over to you to highlight a few that you want to focus on Kate Gutmann    Chief Sales and Solutions Officer  Senior Vice President The UPS Store  UPS Capital UPSYes  absolutely  And so clearly  we are the e commerce provider of choice  and David just brought life to that  and focused on the SMBs  The exciting part of our solutions is that we actually are leaning in both on B2B and B2C  So speeding of the time in transit helps both and fast means through the weekend  UPS only has the commercial offering for our customers  helping the SMB to actually speed through the weekend and also replenish inventory  So very impactful  And these customers have told us it s about pace  speed and ease  And the ease is helping them to connect where they re already existing  and that is with digital access  That s exactly what that does  it brings together the community of buyers with the SMB sellers  And attach My Choice for business on that  it helps them to control not only their outbound but they re inbound  And the more you can do that  you save staffing  you save cost and then that helps them to reinvest into their businesses  So we do see these investments as accelerating growth  and we re excited that it is with the structural shift in the air  also the speed on the ground and very excited David Abney    UPS Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  there is just two that I want to highlight  One is we ve been the e commerce shipper of choice for years  This is something that we concentrated on six  seven years ago  and we have put the network in place and will continue  But just two things that I think is worth drawing out is we talk a lot about the structural change of Next Day Air and Next Day in general and our Extended Hours Next Day program  where we can pick up    you have late pickups  and we can actually serve 98  of the population for our brick and mortar retailers  That within 150 miles of their locations  we can cover 98   That is industry leading and that is giving them a competitive advantage  It allows them to hit Next Day through their ground network  And then    so that one is very important The other one that we ve made a lot of announcements about  we are just speeding through  and that s Access Points  And we are adding in the press release another 1 500 Access Points through package express centers  What makes us unique is this is in a lot of rural areas  people that don t have a lot of options  And by the time these get implemented with the others we ve announced  92  of the population of the U S  will be within five miles of our Access Points  So I d just give you some good examples of what we re doing to maintain our status as the e commerce shipper of choice  Thank you OperatorAnd we have a question from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Please go ahead Ken Hoexter    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHey  Great  Good morning  Dave or  I guess  Brian  that was great information on the breakdown in terms of the 6  to 10  outlook  but then with the pension and other network rollout  So looking at that  380 million or so pre tax expense you re spending on accelerating the network  can you maybe talk about the split between rolling out weekend delivery and what the other actions that are    that you re spending money on  And then within that shift from 2 day to next day to now intra region that Dave was just talking about  how do you play in that world  does that require any additional network shifts or investment as you do that Brian Newman    Chief Financial OfficerSo thanks  Ken  for the question  Look  we are looking at the SMB initiatives in total  As I broke it out  it s a  0 33 total investment with two objectives  we re trying to accelerate the time in transit  we re going to reach over 80  of our customers  and then in addition  expand the weekend coverage  So rather than break out the  0 33  we re looking at it in totality as a program  We see it accretive to 2021 and beyond  Maybe I ll let Juan take a stab at sharing some of the details of the two programs Juan Perez    Chief Information and Engineering OfficerYes  Thanks  Brian  And as we think about the expansion of the weekend delivery services  we started that already in the Q4  the advantage that we have is that we have a well defined integrated network that gives us unprecedented capabilities to be able to enable these services  We are going to leverage the relationship that we have with the USPS  David made a reference to the Access Point network that we have  It s a network that s in place  We ve already built the technology that supports the integration between UPS and the Access Points  That will make it really easy for us to be able to expand as well in those areas  And again  we will continue to provide services through the network that we ve already built with the great people that we have supporting those operations Scott Childress    Vice President and Investor Relations OfficerOur next question is an online question coming from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer  Please address UPS  progress in driving U S  Domestic B2B share growth and the potential to further expand in 2020 Kate Gutmann    Chief Sales and Solutions Officer  Senior Vice President The UPS Store  UPS Capital UPSThanks so much  This is Kate  So first  we re proud to be the B2B market leader  and also to say that we grew B2B for the fifth consecutive quarter  This quarter s B2B growth was fueled by retail and returns  returns growing 6  with our unmatched portfolio  so you can actually have the flexibility of returns  whether it be label lists  package lists and also right available on your mobile application  So very excited about the progress that we ve seen in that space  And then B2B  a critical component of that is our healthcare strategy as well as our SMB  with a large majority of B2B tied to those  Also  David mentioned the structural shift  Structural shift comes with businesses speeding  and that also impacts B2B  So everything you see us doing with speeding time in transit  through the weekend  all of that nets to continuing our success with B2B  Thank you OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead Jordan Alliger    Goldman Sachs    AnalystYeah  Hi  Good morning  Just sort of wondering  can you talk a little bit    I know there s the pension headwinds  but a little bit about your thoughts on managing the cost per piece and the revenue per piece in the Domestic business and managing to sort of that spread differential  And what we should think about in terms of cost per piece going forward Kate Gutmann    Chief Sales and Solutions Officer  Senior Vice President The UPS Store  UPS Capital UPSOkay  Sure  I ll start with revenue per piece  First of all  we were excited to deliver the positive operating leverage  and George will speak more about that  aligning cost per piece with revenue per piece  As we ve noted  revenue per piece was affected by weight per piece and customer mix as we leaned into this structural shift that s going on in the market  and we will continue to do so  With that  we re seeing speeding  whether it be in the air services  You saw our air growth  very strong  Three consecutive quarters over 20   with this past quarter at 26  for Next Day and double digit for Deferred  a lot of which  by the way  is coming from a very broad customer base  heavily SMBs in that area And then David mentioned that Ground solution that we have  which is our Extended Hours  Next Day Ground  and the coverage that we gain 98  of the population by activating brick and mortar  That will continue  So shorter zone  some less wait  but solutions that gain the whole portfolio Air and Ground from our customers  which will help RPP  And then we remain committed to growing price as aligned to our value and our cost per piece George Willis    President  U S  OperationsAnd Jordan  this is George Willis  and thanks for the question  So as far as the cost per piece goes  our investments have significantly lowered our structural costs  So in answer to your question  do you think that s going to continue to drop  we can see    we continue to see it improving as well  We re driving productivity gains and we re lowering our unit cost  We did that last year and we expect to do the same thing this year  We re creating excellent leverage  as Kate just talked about earlier  and it was actually exhibited last quarter in the fourth quarter  This was evidenced by our cost per piece actually going down 3 2  in the fourth quarter  So we see the benefits in our new facilities  we re going to continue that  We re    we also see the continuous improvement on on road and in our air network driven by the new technology and automation Scott Childress    Vice President and Investor Relations OfficerOur next online question comes from Scott Group of Wolfe as well as a few of the other analysts  Please provide an update on your relationship with your major customer  There is always much discussion of their plans and how that could impact UPS  business over the next few years David Abney    UPS Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  This is David  and I will    and our business did increase with them over 2019  And part of which was due to a structural change and this focus on Next Day  And we foresaw that change  and we had the lift available  and we really took advantage of that not only with large retailers but with other companies that are matching at the same structural change  We also had competitive wins with large retailers and others  And we saw a little bit of a muted growth top line from International and Supply Chain due to macro conditions  And of course  that made the percent revenue a little bit larger  But one of the things we want to focus on is  at the same time that we took on additional volume  that we did bring our cost per piece down significantly in the U S  operations for the fourth quarter  in fact  on an adjusted basis  by more than 3  from the year before And also  that other customers are able to take advantage of some of this capacity and structure  So other retailers and small and midsized companies have been able to take advantage the same way  As long as there is    with any of our big customers  as long as there s a mutually beneficial relationship  then we will continue and we will find ways to win together  But we also find ways to continue to help our small and midsized companies and others to compete against those large opportunities  whether it s through Ware2Go or e fulfillment or Access Points or other options  So that s kind of a rundown about where we stand  Thank you OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi  Please go ahead Chris Wetherbee    Citi    AnalystHey  thanks  Good morning  It looks like the guidance for the first quarter suggests basically flat earnings  although you re expecting growth throughout the rest of the year  Can you talk a little bit about the cadence of the investments that you re making  the SMB initiatives and others  And is that sort of front end weighted  And is that a driver of that sort of weaker than average first quarter  Or do we think that there is sort of introducing new seasonality to the business  Is it potentially sort of the growth in your largest customer as a percent of revenue  Just want to get a sense of sort of how we should be thinking about the cadence of the growth and the expenses  particularly in the first quarter Brian Newman    Chief Financial OfficerYes  it s Brian  Thanks very much for the question  So it has less to do with the changing of the seasonality  it s more about the phasing and cadence of the investments we announced  The  0 33 opex investment or EPS headwind that we re putting in  the revenue lags those start up costs  So as you think about Q1 and launching the investments  revenue comes a bit later and that s why we re muting the EPS  In addition  in the Supply Chain and Freight business  given the macro backdrop  we re expecting some rebound in the middle to late part of the year  So those are the two elements impacting the phasing of the guidance  Thanks Scott Childress    Vice President and Investor Relations OfficerOur next question is an online question that comes from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse  Can you discuss the announcement of the construction of a super hub in Pennsylvania  The    is the construction embedded in your three year capex  And can you tell us how the super hubs will differ from your other major sort facilities Juan Perez    Chief Information and Engineering OfficerAllison  this is Juan Perez  Thank you for the question  Just a couple of points  Let me first clarify  The  1 4 billion that we announced is for not just one facility in Pennsylvania  it s a total of four facilities in Pennsylvania  The largest of those is the super hub we will be building in Harrisburg  Pennsylvania  By the way  you ve heard us talk about the Smart Logistics Network a number of times  The part of the Smart Logistics Network is building critical capacity to support the needs of our e commerce customers  We continue to build that capacity  We ve been very effective  That capacity is yielding the expected results  Your question next talks about how we continue to improve the facilities that we built We have this philosophy at UPS that every time we build a new facility  that facility is going to have the next generation of advanced technologies that will help us continue to build capabilities  improve our automation  reduce our hours  In this particular building  we expect to see some really neat technologies  more data analytics that will provide better insights on how the facility is running  of course  how it can help the overall network  and we also expect this new facility to use the latest and greatest automation technologies that we have  The capex is included in our three year plan  so this is something that we have been planning all along as we continue to build our Smart Logistics Network  We re excited about what we re building in the Northeast critical corridor for UBS OperatorWe have a question from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein  Please go ahead David Vernon    Bernstein    AnalystHi  guys  Good morning  Brian  maybe could you talk a little bit about how the  0 33 is going to be kind of earned back into 2020  2021  Is this something that we should be expecting to be    basically just go away as a onetime item  Or is this going to take a little bit of time to grow through  And as you think about the next three year view on capex  Obviously  these investments announced in the last couple of days have been significant  but it sounds like they re part of the capital envelope  Has your thinking on reinvestment changed at all as far as kind of the    our next three year view on capex going forward David Abney    UPS Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerRight  This is David  I ll take the first part of that question  then I ll turn the capex over  So from an opex standpoint  on speeding up the initiatives  this is really about how to increase the asset and lane utilization of our transportation network  It s about competitiveness  it s about pricing power  When you have a much faster network  you don t have to discount as much  We also don t have to have customized solutions  so we re going to be able to take some of those that we have put over the years to help speed the network  We re going to be able to take that up  But we really see that we re going to get additional business And that was the thing that got our attention so much last year  is when we put these first ones in  we way exceeded the return of additional packages that we were going to get  So when you put this infrastructure in place  it s not fully utilized at first  It takes a while to grow  But based on what we ve seen last year  what we expect to see this year  then the revenue and the pricing power from this move is going to more than take care of the operating costs  That s why we are boldly saying that this is accretive and is accretive in 2021  And we ve got the  so far  the examples to show that  So let s turn it over to the capex side  and that s to you  Brian Brian Newman    Chief Financial OfficerThanks  David  And Dave  thanks for the question  So with respect to capex  you re right  the investments we talked about this morning  Harrisburg  etc   those are all embedded within our capital guidance envelope  David talked about the opex investment  But in terms of where we re headed on capex  you saw we re guiding to about  6 7 billion in 2020  That s really coming from a lot of efficiency being driven as we saw in 2019 as well as 2020  We see a glide path eventually moving down toward our historic average of 7   And ultimately  we look at the ROIC  which is among the leading in the industry  And really  it s a good investment for the company in terms of the return  So hopefully  that gives you a little insight on the capex guidance Scott Childress    Vice President and Investor Relations OfficerWe ve got a couple of questions on International  Tom Wadewitz from UBS as well as Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer  UBS realized 150 basis point margin improvement in International package in  21 despite small declines  Is there room left for further margin improvement  And does the recent Phase one of the China deal helped in that regard David Abney    UPS Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAll right  I ll talk about Phase one of the China deal and then Nando will go further than that  We think the U S  China Phase one was a historic agreement as much for what it kept from happening with additional tariffs being implemented  plus what was covered in the actual agreement  And certainly  we look forward to working with governments on both sides for Phase 2  but a positive start there  When you take a look at that and you also take a look at the terminal dues change that is going into effect this year  which is going to allow us  with our worldwide economy service  to really compete in cross global e commerce    cross border  I should have said  e commerce shipments that we hadn t been able to do before because of the very low cost of terminal dues  so that s gotten addressed  And so we do see some positive momentum  And I ll turn it over to you Nando to talk about the business unit Nando Cesarone    President  UPS InternationalSure  Thanks for the question  Of course  when we look at trade  obviously  concerns exist  We focused really strongly on making sure that we were growing our operating profits regardless of the macro backdrop  We were able to execute industry leading margins  create positive leverage and  of course  continue our profit growth during the quarter  I also want to just thank the International staff globally for the work and how they accomplished all of those things in a very challenging environment  While we saw the volume coming in a little bit differently  of course  we feel very comfortable about the cost reductions and the cost control and how we managed expense  namely the network efficiency  our revenue quality but also cost efficiency  We executed 2 8  decrease across all cost categories in International  Long term targets are 16  to 19   We re at 21   Higher margins are not exactly the primary goal  but maximize our profit certainly is  So thanks for the question  Appreciate it OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research  Please go ahead Scott Group    Wolfe Research    AnalystHey  thanks  Morning  guys  So can you just share what the air and ground volume expectations are for this year  And then on the  1 10  I just want to make sure I understand the numbers of how much you think you got in last year  what s assumed for this year  I just want to know what s left for  21 Brian Newman    Chief Financial OfficerSure  So I ll take the first part of that and kick it over to Kate to talk on the air outlook  So from a    in  1 to  1 20 in terms of what s in there  we basically    anything over the 7 5   in terms of 5  to 10  guidance  is    think about putting a deposit down  So we posted pretty strong operating growth in the 2019 results  We basically earned about 25  to 30  of that EPS upside  so the balance would be left to come in 2021 and 2022  So Kate  do you want to take the air piece David Abney    UPS Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOf course  she does  though  And we talked about when the transformation started that we had targeted  800 million to  1 billion of cost savings in the    in our Smart Logistics Network initiatives  And we are certainly on track  We may get another question on that  and we can talk about that  but we re on track there  too  So then  Kate  do you want to talk about the air side Kate Gutmann    Chief Sales and Solutions Officer  Senior Vice President The UPS Store  UPS Capital UPSYes  absolutely  I think it s a good starting place to say that we are the air market share leader  And we saw this and anticipated this change  a structural change  going on in the market and leaned into it with our solutions  And as a result  you ve seen the strong air growth  three consecutive quarters  over 20   We do expect to continue to see healthy air growth alongside    related to what Brian was saying  the ground comes hand in hand  So we re seeing next day or 2 day air resonating across our customer base whether it be from healthcare  SMB  e tailers  large retailers  We have expanded capacity  additional claims  all of that tying together to this strategy  And then we ve talked about the unmatched UPS network and the ability to cover 150 miles of 1 day ground really activating our retailers and our SMBs  brick and mortar  to help them to better compete in the market  So flexing where their inventory is and then using whichever of our products that fits for that need  So healthy future as well David Abney    UPS Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo key point that Kate brought up  our air volume really    and we gained a significant market share last year in our U S  air network  We ve been gaining market share in that sector at least four of the last five years  if not five of the five years  So we ve been constantly investing in aircraft and have 11 more that we re putting in this year that benefit the International  but then it cascades to the Domestic  So this is something that we offer a clear differentiated value advantage to our customers  and they are rewarding us and it s going very well for us Scott Childress    Vice President and Investor Relations OfficerOkay  We ll take another online question  There s multiple analysts asking this  Did    how did your peak season returns compare this year to last year  And please discuss UPS  process to handle this George Willis    President  U S  OperationsOkay  Yes  first of all  I d like to thank all of our partners and service providers in the U S  for a very good peak season  It was driven primarily because of several things  first  our collaboration with our customers  second  the efforts of our people  and third  the use of technology in our automated facilities  As a result of this  through third parties  we ve led the industry again in service for the second consecutive year  We delivered over 32 million packages  16 of the 18 delivery days between Thanksgiving and Christmas  The majority of our volume  as you heard us talk about investments and handle that growth was    year over year  was done in our automated facilities  Our network responded and was very responsive  and we continue to be agile  Our operators made good decisions during peak  And now for the technology part  Juan Juan Perez    Chief Information and Engineering OfficerJust a couple of quick statements folks  The first one that I think it s important for you guys to know is that at the end of 2019  75  of our U S  eligible ground volume was actually sorted through automation  In addition to that  we had completed the rollout of UPS ORION navigation  That gave us significant benefits  especially as we bring seasonal workers on and they needed that type of technology to improve their overall delivery capabilities  And of course  we now know that we re introducing additional technologies on the dispatch and delivery side that are going to continue to help us throughout the peak season  The benefit of automated facilities cannot be understated  We actually exceeded throughout the year and certainly throughout peak season the expected production improvements that we get from automation  We introduced new solutions as well in terms of autonomous guided vehicles in our automated facilities to support the movement of bulk  All those solutions proved extremely valuable in executing our successful peak season  And we re already planning for 2020  that s the way that we ve now approached peak season for a number or years Scott Childress    Vice President and Investor Relations OfficerWe re going to take one more online question  and then we ll close it out  The question is from multiple analysts asking about what technologies are in front of us  as well as our drone technologies  how we see that playing out Scott Price    Chief Strategy and Transformation OfficerThanks for the question  So as we mentioned  transformation helps us bend the cost curve to help us invest in growth  Some of the growth opportunities we see  in particular in support of our customers  is in the area of leverage of drones  so UPS Flight Forward  which was launched last year  A number of trials  We announced the San Diego  where we re able to move across campus  speed up for critical care our support to customers  We also announced the Waymo  And Waymo is an interesting opportunity for us  It allows us to test a new model for later pickups at UPS stores that supports our SMB customers who get then a later cutoff and a competitive ability to do late orders and fulfillment for the next day  So all these technologies are helping us to grow  and at the same time bend our cost curve  Thank you OperatorThat concludes our Q A  I will now turn the program back over to Mr  Scott Childress Scott Childress    Vice President and Investor Relations OfficerThank you  Stephen  David David Abney    UPS Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood  Scott  Yes  I m sure you could see on this call that we re making significant progress in executing our

announced 2019  2020 is to assist these SMBs to be more effective and to be able to compete with the larger companies  And our transformation initiatives  they re driving efficiency and they re allowing us to provide these new innovative solutions These things are interrelated  They go together  And the last thing I wanted to hit about our call day is we are absolutely speeding up our network and expanding our weekend  We see a unique opportunity here in the market  and we are going to take advantage of it  We re going to make those investments from an opex standpoint  And we do

171097,392613,UPS,Why Shares of UPS Are Falling Today,news,"What happened
Shares of United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS  traded down more than 6  on Thursday morning after the shipping company released year end results  Fourth quarter earnings were in line with expectations  but the company failed to deliver on 2020 guidance 
So what
UPS before markets opened reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings of  2 11 per share on revenue of  20 57 billion  roughly matching analyst expectations for  2 11 per share in earnings on sales of  20 66 billion  Average daily volume in the quarter was up 7 5  year over year to 26 6 million packages on strong demand for air service  and operating profit grew 6 4  year over year thanks to margin improvement and more demand for premium services 

 Our network improvements from transformation enabled UPS to embrace a surge in demand for air products while at the same time generate productivity improvements and positive operating leverage   chairman and CEO David Abney said in a statement 
Unfortunately  the company s outlook for 2020 underwhelmed  UPS sees 2020 adjusted earnings of between  7 76 to  8 06 per share  short of the consensus  8 07 per share estimate  due to expected further slowing of the global economy 
While shipping rivals including FedEx and XPO Logistics have sparred with e commerce giant Amazon com over the past year  UPS seemingly has been able to maintain a healthy relationship  Amazon s share of total UPS revenue rose to 11 6  in 2019  in part  the company says  because its investments in its network allowed it to accommodate Amazon s need for next day deliveries 
Now what
With the global economy uncertain  UPS is turning its attention to small  and medium sized businesses  That involves continuing to build out the domestic network  which means about  6 7 billion in capital expenditures in 2020  But the company hopes to reap the benefits of that spending later in the year and into 2021 
UPS appears to be taking a conservative approach to its guidance  seemingly not factoring in the potential for a global resurgence if the recent U S  China trade deal holds and tariff risks decline  Then again  there is also the risk that factory shutdowns due to the coronavirus will offset any gains from improving trade relations 
The bottom line is that UPS faces a lot of uncertainty in 2020  and the market is reacting to that uncertainty  But for long term holders able to look past one year results  this remains a solid company ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/po-eu,2071863
171098,392614,UPS,Stock Market News  Privacy Worries Hit Facebook  UPS Makes a Big Bet,news,"The stock market moved lower on Thursday morning  with investors mostly pointing to a rising number of deaths in China from the coronavirus outbreak  Some upbeat financial reports from prominent U S  stocks helped to counterbalance some of the downward impact from the disease  but other earnings results ended up disappointing investors  As of 11 a m  EST  the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJINDICES  DJI  was down 132 points to 28 603  The S P 500  SNPINDEX  GSPC  fell 20 points to 3 253  and the Nasdaq Composite  NASDAQINDEX  IXIC  was lower by 51 points to 9 224 
Facebook  NASDAQ FB  was one of the companies whose earnings numbers weren t able to overcome a sense of foreboding among shareholders  and in its case  even the company s CFO was mindful of potential challenges on the horizon  Meanwhile  United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS  weighed in with solid results  but its need for massive investment to keep up with its rivals could hurt its near term outlook 
Losing face
Facebook shares dropped 7  Thursday morning after the social media giant released its fourth quarter financial report  Slowing growth has been inevitable as Facebook grows  but the extent of the slowdown and the potential challenges to earnings in 2020 turned investor sentiment more negative 

Several things about Facebook s quarter looked good  Revenue growth for Facebook remained strong  rising 25  from year ago levels  Daily active users rose 9  to 1 66 billion  with 2 50 billion monthly active users representing an 8  increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 
However  much of Facebook s sales gains didn t make it to the bottom line  as net income rose at just a 7  pace year over year  Higher taxes played a role in the deceleration in earnings growth  but so too did a big rise in overhead expenses and other costs 
Investors seemed to focus on CFO David Wehner s comments  which centered on the idea that global privacy regulation is likely to have an even bigger negative impact on Facebook s business in the future than it has so far  That fed shareholders  worries  and while some see potential in areas like augmented reality  others fear that a business slowdown could continue 
Spending money to make money
Shares of United Parcel Service were down 6  in the wake of its fourth quarter financial report  With the shipping business changing dramatically in response to rising demand for faster e commerce driven service  UPS sees itself having to bulk up its capabilities to remain competitive 
The numbers at UPS were fairly solid  Revenue was up almost 4  on a 7 5  rise in average daily shipment volumes  Adjusted earnings climbed 9  from year ago levels  with the company seeing improvement in margin levels across all of its segments  UPS  mix of business was also favorable due to demand for premium services  as next day air volume was up almost 26  year over year 
However  UPS warned that its earnings for 2020 would reflect weaker economic conditions as well as significant spending on initiatives to serve small and mid sized businesses more effectively  That includes  6 7 billion in expected capital spending in 2020 to support global facility and automation expansion 
So far  UPS has managed to avoid some of the more direct confrontations that its rival shipping companies  have had in dealing with the rise of e commerce  If its decision to spend up for growth doesn t pay off  though  UPS could end up justifying the concerns its shareholders are having today ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pp0rd,2071990

What s Next for UPS 
While UPS has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

171267,392783,UPS,Stamps com Soars as UPS Deal Seen  Step in the Right Direction ,news," Bloomberg       Stamps com Inc     NASDAQ STMP  shares rallied Tuesday ahead of the opening bell after   United Parcel   Service Inc   NYSE UPS  announced a pact to offer discounted shipping rates to the company s customer base of more than 740 000 
 We long mentioned a new partnership was needed to help lift shares and believe the UPS collaboration is a step in the right direction   wrote Darren Aftahi  an analyst at Roth Capital Partners 
Rates are expected to be as much as 55  below daily rates  including surcharge waivers  he said  The deal should aid Stamps com volume and margins and add upside to fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 forecasts  Aftahi said  even as the rates are still unlikely to be below legacy United States Postal Service rates 
The UPS collaboration marks the first partner Stamps com has signed since ending its relationship with the USPS in February    a move that sent the stock tumbling 58   Less than three months later  Stamps com cut its year forecasts  sinking the shares another 56  
Shares of Stamps com rose as much as 31  pre market to  99 99  which would be the highest intraday level since late February  Before today  shares have dropped 51  this year

171291,392807,UPS,Earnings Preview  United Parcel Service  UPS  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This package delivery service is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 93 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  0 5  
Revenues are expected to be  17 94 billion  up 2 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 06  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for UPS 
For UPS  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 47  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that UPS will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that UPS would post earnings of  1 42 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 39  delivering a surprise of  2 11  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
UPS doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-united-parcel-service-ups-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200440798,200440798

171379,392895,UPS,Analysts Estimate United Parcel Service  UPS  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This package delivery service is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 42 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 4  
Revenues are expected to be  17 79 billion  up 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 55  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for UPS 
For UPS  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 56  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that UPS will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that UPS would post earnings of  1 91 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 94  delivering a surprise of  1 57  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

What s Next for UPS

171444,392960,UPS,United Parcel Service  UPS  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 31  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This package delivery service is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 91 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  14 4  
Revenues are expected to be  19 92 billion  up 5 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 1  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for UPS 
For UPS  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that UPS will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that UPS would post earnings of  1 82 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 82  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS    UPS  rose out of a consolidation channel in June and moved higher to an interim peak at the end of October  It retraced about half of that move before ripping to a higher high at the beginning of December  That could not hold either though and it fell back to a higher low  A much stronger move higher then took it to a new all time high in January  It has struggled ever since  A dramatic drop put the stock price back to the bottom of that initial consolidation channel  evaporating a year of gains 
It started to move higher again in March and broke through short term resistance at the end of last week  The RSI is over the mid line and rising toward the bullish zone with the MACD crossed up and about to turn positive  The Bollinger Bands  are also shifting higher  There is resistance at 113 and 116 75 followed by 120 50 and 124 with a gap to fill to 126 50  Support comes at 110 35 and 109 then 104 30  Short interest is low at 1 6  and the company is expected to report earnings next on April 26th 
The April options chain is just opening up single dollar strikes but shows high open interest at the 110  115 and 120 Call strikes  April 27 Expiry options have been lightly traded so there is no bulky open interest but they do show traders expecting a move of  6 60 between now and the expiry the day after the report  or about 6   May options have also been lightly traded but June options show open interest favoring the upside with it ranging from 105 to 125 on the call side then big again at 140  with puts focused at 105 and 110

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which with March Options Expiration done and spring around the corner sees the Equity Index ETF s looking mixed but positive 
Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate with a downward bias while Crude Oil consolidates in a tight range  The US Dollar Index is also consolidating in a downtrend  trying hard to reverse it  while US Treasuries are showing signs of a potential reversal to the upside  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets continue to consolidate  the former around long term support and resistance  and the latter at the highs 
Volatility looks to continue to drift lower easing the pressure on the equity markets  Their charts all show retrenchment in the short term  with the iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  trying to reverse and lead them all higher  On the longer picture the IWM and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  look strong with the SPY  NYSE SPY  stuck in broad consolidation  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

171588,393104,UPS,Old rules  algorithmic traders add costs to U S  share buybacks,news,"By John McCrank NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  companies are on track to buy back a record amount of their own stock this year  but a decades old markets rule aimed at preventing manipulation makes these trades easy to game and has probably cost companies billions in recent years  Stock buybacks were banned in the United States until 1982  when rules were set as to how companies could repurchase their shares without falling afoul of anti manipulation provisions   But the  safe harbor  rules have not been revised since 2003 and critics say they do not reflect the electronic  fragmented nature of today s markets  which makes share repurchase orders easy to spot and trade in front of by high speed trading firms  leading to higher prices for companies that buy back stock    Everybody knows there is a corporate order flow so they front run it and that just pisses me off because they will raise the price high enough where then they will sell it back to me  That s just not fair   Gary Barth  assistant treasurer at  United Parcel  Service Inc  N UPS   told Reuters   UPS has a  1 billion share repurchase program in place this year and has bought back around  15 3 billion of its own stock since 2012  Under a condition of the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission s Rule 10b 18  companies must bid to buy back their stock at the last purchase price set by another investor or at the best bid available in the market  But they cannot buy shares at the best offer available  because that could cause the company s shares to move and be deemed manipulative  Given that companies must announce their repurchase plans  the restrictions make it easier to detect stock buyback activity  said Ted Morgan  chief executive officer of brokerage Abel Noser  which executes share buybacks on behalf of corporate clients    It s a lot easier than it is to detect other types of institutional flow   he said  Since 2010  S P 500 companies have spent nearly  4 trillion on share buybacks  according to S P Dow Jones Indices   Graphic     Based on buyback announcements so far  2018 repurchases are expected to  smash totals from all other previous years  in the wake of the tax cut bonanza companies received under the Trump administration  according to research firm TrimTabs  There are no estimates how much high speed traders make  but even if the difference in price is mere pennies  exploiting the buyback vulnerability can translate into huge profits  while doing nothing for others in the market and effectively forcing companies to waste some of the buyback money because they cannot mask their activities   FLASH BOYS PETITION  Exchange operator IEX Group has petitioned the SEC to let firms buying back shares do so using hidden orders that only execute at the midpoint between the best bid and the best offer  That would make it difficult to move the stock price while making the activity harder to spot   The change we are arguing for could save public companies millions of dollars or more in execution costs   IEX CEO Brad Katsuyama said in a statement to Reuters  The share buyback petition is the latest cause taken up by IEX  which launched its exchange in August 2016 and was earlier featured in Michael Lewis s book  Flash Boys  A Wall Street Revolt   which followed Katsuyama and his colleagues as they set out to create a market that they saw as fairer to investors  The exchange features a so called speed bump that slows down trades to prevent the fastest traders in the market from trading ahead of slower investors  Like other exchanges  and private markets known as dark pools  it also features midpoint order types  Because those order types are hidden  it would make it much more difficult for trading firms  algorithms to spot buyback trading patterns  accumulate the shares and then sell them back to the issuer at successively higher last sale prices  The SEC declined to comment on the petition  but had itself suggested allowing midpoint share buybacks in 2010 as part of a proposed revamp of the safe harbor rules  But the proposal was dropped in the wake of the May 2010 stock market flash crash  which  along with Dodd Frank rule making following the financial crisis  overwhelmed the regulator s resources  Eight years later  UPS s Barth said he is still waiting for the SEC to take action  Current SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said on April 10 that the regulator  should listen to investors and market participants about where Commission rules are  or are not  functioning as intended   and do retrospective reviews on those rules

A draft of an executive order on  appears to give the pharmaceutical industry much of what it has asked for   and no guarantee that costs to consumers will drop  The four page document  obtained by the New York Times  contains several proposals that have long been championed by the industry  including strengthening drug makers  monopoly power overseas and scaling back a federal program that requires pharmaceutical companies to give discounts to hospitals and clinics that serve low income patients 
The proposed order does little to specifically call out the drug industry and instead focuses on rolling back regulations 
 have been working for weeks behind closed doors on legislation aimed at repealing and replacing major portions of the Affordable Care Act  Tomorrow  they are expected to unveil their plan  The Republican controlled House of Representatives narrowly approved its version of repeal last month  An estimated 23 million people could lose their healthcare under the House plan  according to the non partisan Congressional Budget Office 
The Senate proposal cuts off Medicaid expansion more gradually than the House bill  but would enact deeper long term cuts to the health care program for low income Americans  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday the Senate healthcare bill would be different from the House version  but he did not elaborate 
Given the opposition of all Senate Democrats to repealing Obamacare  Republican leaders will need the support of at least 50 of the chamber s 52 Republicans to ensure passage  The bill will be brought to the Senate floor once the CBO has assessed its cost and impact  likely next week  Even if the Senate measure does pass the upper chamber  it will still have to pass muster with the more conservative House before any legislation could be enacted 
A Roper Center  shows the proposal with just 29 percent support  making it the most unpopular piece of legislation Congress has considered in decades  There is no state in the union where a majority of voters support the bill 
Meanwhile  a new report  released by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality  AHRQ   says the coast to coast  is swamping hospitals  showing 1 27 million emergency room visits or inpatient stays for opioid related issues in a single year 
The report puts Maryland at the very top of the national list for inpatient care  The state  already struggling with overdoses from heroin and prescription opioids  has seen the spread of the synthetic opioid fentanyl  which can be mixed with heroin or cocaine and is extraordinarily powerful  Opioid related deaths in Maryland had nearly quadrupled since 2010  and deaths from fentanyl had increased 38 fold in the past decade

The sharpest increase in hospitalization and emergency room treatment for opioids was among people ages 25 to 44  The new report shows that women are now as likely as men to be admitted to a hospital for inpatient treatment for opioid related problems  The report identifies big increases in hospitalizations among people older than 65  but those cases predominantly result from reactions to prescription medication  rather than from overdoses or the use of heroin or other illegal drugs

Indeed  a non massaged metric  average weekly hours fell by the largest percentage since the 2008 recession 

There is simply no way to spin this as a positive 
The fact is  4  5  GDP growth is not just around the corner  The US most likely slid into recession in the last three months  GDP growth collapsed in 4Q16  with a large portion of the  growth  coming from accounting gimmicks

Tax receipts indicate the US is in recession 
Gross private domestic investment indicates were are in a recession 
Retailers are showing that the US consumer is tapped out  see AMZN s recent miss

171736,393252,UPS,2 Shipping Stocks Likely To Beat Earnings Estimates In Q3,opinion,"The third quarter 2016 earnings season is in its last leg for most of the 16 Zacks sectors  with only a few companies left to unveil their quarterly financial numbers   Per our latest  report  445 S P 500 companies  representing 91 1  in terms of market capitalization  have already reported their numbers 
The picture is an extremely bullish one with the bottom line expanding 4  and the top line displaying 2 7  growth  The healthy performance indicates that the current earnings season is set to become the first quarter to display bottom line expansion after five consecutive quarters of earnings contraction Transports Continue to Lag
Despite the overall favorable scenario  the transportation sector remains one of the most underperforming sectors  The sector has already seen reports from its entire S P 500 fraternity this reporting cycle  The above report states that the bottom line contracted 13 6  on a year over year basis for the sector  The earnings performance is worse than that witnessed in the second quarter  wherein the bottom line contracted 12 4  
However  the outcome is not surprising as the sector has been passing through turbulent times  The multiple headwinds confronting stocks in the space include declining travel demand due to security fears  weak coal market  driver shortages and Brexit induced uncertainty  Collectively  these negatives resulted in the disappointing year over year earnings performance 
The unfavorable Zacks Industry Ranks of most of the sub groups of the transportation industry also reflect the challenges faced by the space  We note that the Transportation Airline  Transportation Truck  Transportation Services and the Transportation Ship units carry a bearish Zacks Industry Rank of 184  247  206 and 178  respectively  among more than 260 groups Glimmer of Hope
Despite the multiple challenges confronting sector participants  quite a few players in the transportation space have outperformed on the bottom line front  Per the above report  an impressive 66 7  of the S P 500 transportation companies have reported better than expected earnings in the current reporting cycle  Key sector participants to have reported better than expected earnings in the quarter include the likes of Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   United Parcel Service  Inc   NYSE UPS  and Norfolk Southern Corp   NYSE NSC  
However  we note that earnings estimates have been declining for most of the sector participants due to the multiple headwinds  Consequently  it was easier for transports to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the earnings front in the third quarter as the  bar was lowered  significantly Shipping Stocks in Trouble
With the broader transportation sector in doldrums  it is unlikely for any sub group to outperform  Shipping stocks  which form an integral part of the sector  have been hurt by headwinds like low freight rates and weak financial position

171742,393258,UPS,Weighing the Week Ahead  Has The Santa Rally Been Trumped ,opinion,"2017 begins with plenty of economic data crammed into a short week  While most expected at least a touch of Dow 20K last week  it did not happen  The conversation quickly shifted to why the rally stalled out  In the coming week  the punditry will be asking 
Should we expect a weak start to 2017 
Last Week
Last week there was some soft economic news  but this week showed strength  There was little apparent market effect 
Theme Recap
In my last WTWA  two weeks ago  I predicted a shift from the Dow 20K obsession to developing a new list of market worries  That was a good guess  although as late as Wednesday some TV experts were debating whether 20K would be achieved by the end of the week  That represented another 55 points or so  Sheesh 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this great chart of the S P 500   He captures the trend for the week and the narrow range 

Doug has a special knack for pulling together all the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read his entire post where he adds analysis grounded in data and several more charts providing long term perspective 
This additional choice captures the pre election period  the Trump Rally  and last week s selling 

The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something very positive  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
This week s news was quite good almost all positive  I make objective calls  which means not stretching to achieve a false balance  If I missed something for the  bad  list  please feel free to suggest it in the comments 
The Good
Rail traffic ended the year on a strong note   reports the data  while also noting the year over year calendar effects  We will know a little more next week 
Mortgage rates declined in the last week of the year  that this modest improvement comes in the context of the worst five weeks in history in the post election period 
Earnings growth for Q4 is looking good   a second straight quarter of year over year increases  with strength in other metrics as well 
Commercial real estate is booming    

Homebuilder sentiment reached an 11 year high     
Initial jobless claims dipped to 265K  maintaining the recent low level 
Consumer confidence reached 113 7  Doug Short s chart    puts this strong reading in perspective   best since before 9 11 

The Bad
Pending home sales declined by 2 5  
Chicago Purchasing Index declined to 54 6 and missed expectations of 56     
China abandons the 6 5  growth target  Rupert Hargreaves    analyzes a change which many already expected 

The Ugly
Russian malware found on a Vermont utility laptop      The article notes that utilities in Western Ukraine were past targets and describes the possible consequences 
The Silver Bullet
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  This week s award goes to Robert Huebscher  founder and CEO of Advisor Perspectives  for his article   
His opening theme is excellent  Good financial products are bought  not sold 
He carefully avoids a discussion of the specific sales techniques  focusing on the facts of the offer  He writes 

But I caution anyone against buying precious metals from Lear Capital  It is not an SEC registered investment advisor and its web site states that there is no fiduciary relationship between it and its customers 

And also 

For example  Lear will  you a  10 circulated Liberty gold coin  1 2 ounce  for  753 00  plus  24 shipping   I did a quick search on eBay and found a circulated Liberty coin  for as low as  666  with free shipping  


Buying silver is no different  Lear will  you a pre 1921 circulated Morgan silver dollar for  30  plus  10 shipping   On eBay  I quickly  one of these for  22 00  plus  2 62 shipping  

Mr  Huebscher notes that other dealers are similar to Lear  I can confirm this  since I have checked out several such offers  I have seen many poor investments touted on TV and radio  but I cannot recall a single good one  It is just not that easy 
The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar
We have a big week for data and only four days of trading  It may start slowly  but expect seatbelts to be fastened before Friday s employment report 
The  A  List
Employment report  F   Still the most watched number  with continuing strength expected 
ISM Index  T   The first data for 2017 is expected to show continuing modest expansion 
FOMC minutes  W   While we should not expect much from the report of a unanimous vote  pundits will find something 
Auto sales  W   Has  peak auto  arrived 
Initial claims  Th   The best concurrent indicator for employment trends  Not a part of this Friday s report 
The  B  List
ISM services  Th   Continuing rebound expected in the large service sector 
ADP private employment  Th   Different methodology from the  official  report  but just as accurate 
Trade balance  F   Important for GDP  Growing interest with possible changes in trade policy 
Construction spending  T   November data for an important sector 
Crude inventories  Th   Recently showing even more impact on oil prices  Rightly or wrongly  that spills over to stocks 


There is not much FedSpeak on the calendar  but Congress is returning to work on Tuesday 
Coming Week s Theme
Last week attention started with more Dow 20K hype  This was true even though it is a rather meaningless round number in a flawed index  It shows the power of symbolism to attract attention  When the rally fizzled out  the story swiftly turned  Everyone questions rapid  short term moves  so it is a natural for the punditry 
I expect this theme to carry over into 2017  despite an abundance of fresh news  Any sign of weakness will raise the questions 
Will 2017 have a weak start  Just like last year  And what will it mean 
Pundits were already hard at work last week 
Trump rally mistaken  overdone  and a setup for selling 
Regular  Santa  rally pulled forward  reversing normal seasonal effects 
Selling for gains postponed in the hope of lower tax rates  Those waiting to sell strength are ready to move 
Reflation trade was already starting  it would have happened anyway  The Trump story was merely a catalyst 
What should investors conclude from these sharply conflicting ideas  Your opinions are quite welcome  As usual  I ll have a few ideas of my own in today s  Final Thoughts  
Quant Corner
We follow some regular great sources and the best insights from each week 
Risk Analysis
Whether you are a trader or an investor  you need to understand risk  Think first about your risk  Only then should you consider possible rewards  I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update 
The Indicator Snapshot

Although dropping last week  the yield on the 10 year note has increased significantly since the election  This has lowered the risk premium a bit  I suspect much more to come  By this I mean that the relative attractiveness of stocks and bonds will continue to narrow 
The C Score has also dropped  but is still well out of recession warning territory 
The Featured Sources 
Bob Dieli  The  C Score  which is a weekly estimate of his Enhanced Aggregate Spread  the most accurate real time recession forecasting method over the last few decades   His subscribers get  including both an economic overview of the economy and employment 
Holmes  Our cautious and clever watchdog  who sniffs out opportunity like a great detective  but emphasizes guarding assets 
Brian Gilmartin  Analysis of expected earnings for the overall market as well as coverage of many individual companies 
RecessionAlert  Many  for both economic and market analysis  While we feature his recession analysis  Dwaine also has several interesting approaches to asset allocation  Try out his new public   His most recent research update suggests some    from labor markets 
Georg Vrba  The  and much more  for an array of interesting methods  Georg  Bob Dieli s enhanced aggregate spread  considering when it might first give a recession signal  Georg thinks it is still a year away  It is interesting to watch this approach along with our weekly monitoring of the C Score 
Doug Short  The World Markets Weekend Update  and much more   Jill Mislinski   noting that their public leading index is at the highest point since 2010  Surprisingly  the ECRI public statements remain bearish on the U S  economy  the global economy  and stocks  It is as if they never recovered from the bad recession call in 2011  They have been out of step ever since 
Readers occasionally ask about the Risk Premium   has a slightly different method that I report every week  but an excellent discussion of the considerations 
Many are concerned about higher stock volatility during the Trump Administration  Expert Bill Luby   giving you a better idea about what to expect

Stock Ideas
There are so many end of year ideas  I like to include some leads to research in WTWA  but I have a special challenge this week  You have many opportunities to read a range of sources and get lists of favorite stocks  I always review them and then do my own analysis  I hope you do as well 
I want to emphasize a few ideas that you might otherwise miss 
One method of playing for a long term rebound is to take the  Dogs of the Dow   Here is the past record  but see  for the current rankings 

Lee Jackson at 24 7 Wall Street has several good columns with collections of picks  Here is one on   Check out the others for dividend choices  Trump stocks  financials and others 
 is back with an update on Flowers Foods  NYSE FLO  including a deep dive into fundamentals and the settlement of the recent lawsuit 
Simply Safe Dividends  at United Parcel Service Inc  NYSE UPS    boring but safe  I might consider this and write near term calls against it in our Enhanced Yield program 
Our trading model  Holmes  has joined our other models in a weekly market discussion  Each one has a different  personality  and I get to be the human doing fundamental analysis  We have an enjoyable discussion every week  including four or five specific ideas that we are buying   Holmes likes Palo Alto Networks  Palo Alto Networks Inc  NYSE PANW    Check out the post for my own reaction  and more information about the trading models 

While we cannot verify the suitability of specific stocks for everyone who is a reader  the ideas have worked well so far  My hope is that it will be a good starting point for your own research  Holmes may exit a position at any time  If you want more information about the exits  just sign up via holmes at newarc dot com  You will get an email update whenever we sell an announced position 

Eddy Elfenbein announced his eagerly awaited   Check out the post for the full list  You will definitely find some good ideas  Or you can also join in the whole list via Eddy s new ETF     It is both convenient and inexpensive 
Personal Finance
Professional investors and traders have been making Abnormal Returns a daily stop for over ten years  If you are a serious investor managing your own account  this is a must read  Even the more casual long term investor should make time for a weekly trip on Wednesday  Tadas always has first rate links for investors in his  There are always several great choices worth reading  My personal favorite this week is  on how to overcome a late start to retirement savings   a very common problem  The article has some good  practical advice 
Seeking Alpha Editor Gil Weinreich s Financial Advisors  Daily Digest has quickly become a must read for financial professionals  Somewhat to my surprise  the topics also stimulate comments from active individual investors  It has added to the value of the posts for both groups  This week I especially liked the discussion of  from a financial advisor  You might also be  of whether you should be providing a questionnaire to your advisor  instead of the other way around 
Watch out for 
Giving up liquidity   has another excellent warning for investors  explaining the hidden costs of tempting investments 
Final Thoughts
I do not know how the market will trade in the next week  and neither does anyone else  That will not stop everyone who can get quoted in a column or get on TV from offering an opinion  When you see these stories  you should keep in mind this   With a combination of insight and humor  he hands out his Financial Market Awards for 2016  Keep these two charts in mind 

This frightened nearly everyone at the time  but here is what happened 

And this year the S P was up 13 2 
My own conclusion is that the reflation trade    was teed up and ready to go  I expect the late year trends to continue  mostly because the reaction was small if you look at a long term chart 
I will discuss the prospect for 2017 more in my annual preview  coming soon  but Mrs  OldProf informs me that I have done enough for tonight  She is requesting  more  champagne and my company

171795,393311,UPS,The long  rough ride ahead for  Made in America ,news,By Nick Carey RUSTON  Louisiana  Reuters    Mini motorcycle and go kart maker Monster Moto made a big bet on U S  manufacturing by moving assembly to this Louisiana town in 2016 from China  But it will be a long ride before it can stamp its products  Made in USA    The loss of nearly one out four U S  factories in the last two decades means parts for its bike frames and engines must be purchased in China  where the manufacturing supply chain moved years ago   There s just no way to source parts in America right now   said Monster Moto Chief Executive Alex Keechle during a tour of the company s assembly plant   But by planting the flag here  we believe suppliers will follow   Monster Moto s experience is an example of the obstacles American companies face as they  along with President Donald Trump  try to rebuild American manufacturing  U S  automakers and their suppliers  for example  have already invested billions in plants abroad and would face an expensive and time consuming transition to buy thousands of American made parts if President Trump s proposed  border tax  on imported goods were to become law  When companies reshore assembly to U S  soil   in Monster Moto s case that took two years to find a location and negotiate support from local and state officials   they are betting their demand will create a local supply chain that currently does not exist   For now  finding U S  based suppliers  remains one of the top challenges across our supplier base   said Cindi Marsiglio  Wal Mart Stores Inc s  N WMT  vice president for U S  manufacturing and sourcing  Wal Mart partnered with Monster Moto and several other U S  companies in a drive to increase spending on American made goods by  250 billion by 2023 in response to consumer demand for American made goods  Their experience has shown Americans  patriotic shopping habits have limits  namely when it comes to price  Take Monster Moto s bikes  which sell for between  249 to  749  Keechle  the CEO  says he can t raise those prices for fear his price sensitive prospective customers will turn to less expensive rivals made in China   Consumers won t give you a free pass just because you put  Made in USA  on the box   Keechle says   You have to remain price competitive   Keeping a sharp eye on labor costs in their factory is one thing these U S  manufactures can control  They see replacing primarily lower skilled workers on the assembly line with robots on American factory floors as the only way to produce here in a financially viable  cost competitive way  It s a trend that runs against the narrative candidate Donald Trump used to win the U S  Presidency   Since taking office  Trump has continued promises to resurrect U S  manufacturing s bygone glory days and bring back millions of jobs  On March 31  Trump directed his administration to clamp down on countries that abuse trade rules in a bid to end to the  theft of American prosperity   But it s more complicated on the ground for companies like Monster Moto    It s almost as if people think you can just unplug manufacturing in one part of the world and plug it in to the U S  and everything s going to be fine   said David Abney  Chief Executive Officer of package delivery company  United Parcel  Service Inc  UPS   which helped Monster Moto reconfigure its supply chain to bring its Chinese made parts to Ruston    It s not something that happens overnight   he said  A White House official said that the Trump administration s efforts to encourage manufacturers to reshore production will be focused on cutting regulations and programs to provide new skills to manufacturing workers   We recognize that the manufacturing jobs that come back to America might not all look like the ones that left   a White House official said   and we are taking steps to ensure that the American workforce is ready for that   MAKING ROBOTS GREAT AGAIN  In Monster Moto s cavernous warehouse in Ruston  boxes of imported parts that are delivered at one end then become bikes on a short but industrious assembly line of a few dozen workers   A solitary  long bearded worker by the name of Billy Mahaffey fires up the bikes to test their engine and brakes before a small group of workers puts them in boxes declaring   Assembled in the USA   Helped by that label  Monster Moto has experienced a recent boom in demand from major customers that include Wal Mart  The company expects to double production to 80 000 units and increase its assembly workers   who make  13 to  15 an hour   to 100 from around 40 in 2017  The most likely components Monster Moto could produce in America first are black  welded metal frames for bikes and go karts  but they would have to automate production because human welders would be too expensive    We can t just blow up our cost structure   said Monster Moto President Rick Sukkar   The only way to make it work in America is with robotics   The same principle applies for much larger manufacturers  such as automotive supplier  Delphi Automotive  PLC s  N DLPH   Chief Financial Officer Joe Massaro told analysts in February that 90 percent of the company s hourly workforce is in  best cost countries   When asked about shifting production to the United States from Mexico  Massaro said depending on what happens to trade rules  it would have to be much more of the sort of the automated type manufacturing operations just given  the labor differential there   That trend is already showing up in data compiled by Economic Policy Institute  a Washington based think tank  According to senior economist Rob Scott  not only did America lose 85 000 factories  or 23 5 percent of the total  from 1997 to 2014  but the average number of workers in a U S  factory declined 14 percent to 44 in 2014 from 1997  According to Scott  much of the decline in workers was due to automation  For a graphic  click   We re going to see more automation in this country because it makes good sense economically for every company   said Hal Sirkin  a managing director at the Boston Consulting Group   You can spend a lot of time bemoaning it  but that s not going to change   Manufacturers say automated production requires fewer  but more skilled workers such as robot programmers and operators  The National Association of Manufacturers  NAM  estimates because of the  skills gap  there are 350 000 unfilled manufacturing jobs today in a sector that employs over 12 million people   In Ruston  Mayor Ronny Walker bet on Monster Moto by guaranteeing the company s lease because he wants to diversify the city s economy  and envisions suppliers setting up alongside Monster Moto s assembly plant   Could it take a long time to bring manufacturing back here  Sure   he says   But you have to start somewhere

171854,393370,UPS,UPS Bounces After Finding Support At 87 5,opinion,"N UPS  spent most of 2015 moving in a sideways channel between 95 and 102 50  It attempted a break out to the upside in October  but that failed upon reaching 107 50  Since then it has moved lower  falling below the prior channel to start 2016  After finding support at 87 5 the stock bounced and is now back retesting that channel from the downside into earnings in the morning 
As it rises the momentum indicators have turned bullish  The RSI is rising and about to cross the mid line while the MACD is crossed up and rising  The Bollinger Bands  are tightening but the upper one is still falling hard  This goes against the price and momentum  The price is extended from the 50  100 and 200 day SMA s which could lead to a snap higher  and the movement Friday brought it back to close over the 20 day SMA for the first time since December 1st 
There is support lower at 91 15 and 88 50 followed by 87 50 and 85 50  Resistance higher may show up at 93 50 and 94 50 followed by 96 and 98 before 99 55  The last 6 earnings reports have been followed by a 1 50  move on average or  1 40 making for an expected range of 91 50 to 94 50  Short interest is low at 1 1  
The February 5 Expiry Straddles suggest a larger  3 60 move by expiry Friday with implied Volatility at 46  above the February at 27   Open interest is mainly above the current price for this week  with the biggest from the 94 to 95 5 strikes  There was a large block of weekly 93 5 calls traded as a buy write today giving the investor a basis of 91 34 for a possible 2 37  return this week if called away 


Trade Idea 1  Buy the February 5 Expiry 93 5 95 1 2 Call Spread for a 10 cent credit

 1  and  2 look for a move higher but not to exceed about 96  following options projections   1 is profitable from anywhere up to 96 10  while  2 makes money between 93 95 and 96 05   3 looks for the upside and is profitable above 94 25   4 adds leverage to increase the profitability range to above 93 50   5 looks both ways and uses the big open interest  today s big volume as well as the historical range  It is profitable between 88 70 and 97 30 Friday

171869,393385,UPS,Rising revenue boosts UPS profit  2016 forecast confirmed,news,"By Nick Carey
CHICAGO  Reuters     United Parcel  Service Inc  N UPS  reported a higher quarterly net profit on Friday that met analyst expectations as revenue grew across its business units  and the company reaffirmed its full year earnings outlook despite global economic uncertainty 
Chief Executive David Abney told Reuters UPS is adding capacity to its network and will work more closely with retailers ahead of this year s crucial holiday peak season 
The company had put in a solid a performance during the 2015 peak season after two years of struggling to handle holiday demand and the costs associated with it 
 We think it s going to be a repeat of last year   Abney said   We just have more tools in our toolbox this year  
Often seen as a bellwether of U S  economic activity  UPS revenue at its core U S  domestic package business rose 2 4 percent on the year to just over  9 billion  Lower fuel costs and technology improvements helped UPS cut costs by 0 2 percent per package in the second quarter 
Like other package delivery companies  UPS has benefited from a rapid rise in ecommerce  but has also struggled to bring down the extra costs associated with making stops at individual residential addresses rather than at businesses 
UPS  a long standing proponent of free trade  reiterated concerns over anti trade rhetoric in this year s U S  presidential election  arguing that U S  businesses benefit from trade deals 
 It s not big companies that benefit  small and medium sized enterprises need to compete and trade deals can make all the difference in the world to them   Abney told Reuters 
UPS said second quarter margins at its more lucrative international package business were boosted by volume growth  strong pricing and improved network efficiency gains 
The package delivery company posted second quarter net income of  1 27 billion  or  1 43 per share  up more than 3 percent from  1 23 billion  or  1 35 per share  a year earlier 
Analysts had  on average  expected earnings per share for the quarter of  1 43 
Total revenue grew nearly 4 percent to  14 63 billion  from  14 1 billion in the second quarter of 2015  Analysts expected quarterly revenue of  14 62 billion 
UPS reiterated its 2016 full year profit outlook  expecting earnings per share in a range of  5 70 to  5 90 
The company was optimistic of meeting that target despite continued softening of the U S  economy  thanks to investments in improving network efficiency

Friday morning we had McDonald s  NYSE MCD  out with their biggest miss against the Wall Street estimate in over 15 years  In addition  United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS  issued downtrodden preliminary results  sending the stock down nearly 10  
In addition to unexpected misses  estimates for companies that have yet to report have also been slipping  especially amongst the energy names  Currently  the S P 500 is poised to post Q4 growth of 5 0   with energy as the biggest laggard at  19 4   While certain sectors are undoubtedly benefiting from lower oil prices and somewhat offsetting weakness presented by energy  that sector still weighs heavily  In fact  if you remove energy  that 5  growth rate would shoot up to 8 8  
The aforementioned revenue misses have brought growth down to 1 2  for Q4  from the 1 9  expected in the beginning of the year  The outlook for revenues in 2015 is not stellar  with low top line growth looking like it s here to stay around the 2  level  Furthering the trend of suffering sales is due primarily to weakness in Europe  the stronger dollar  and some company specific reasons such as McDonald s issues with food supply quality in China  Strict cost management programs and share buybacks still giving a kick to the bottom line

The Markets
Stocks ended lower on Tuesday as investors reacted to new US sanctions against Russia  The S P 500 Index closed below the rising 20 day moving average  a level that has supported the benchmark since breaking out in mid May    Momentum indicators for the large cap index have gradually been trending lower since mid June as investors show signs of upside exhaustion    The Volatility Index  VIX  ended higher by almost 6   respecting the heightened geopolitical risks attributed to the situation between Ukraine and Russia  The VIX has jumped over 25  since the lows charted in June  following the familiar seasonal pattern that sees a rise in volatility between the start of July and the middle of October  With earnings season moving into the rear view mirror  economic data and hints from the Fed will move back into focus  Economic activity during Third Quarter typically remains stagnant ahead of the always important Fourth Quarter  which is dominated by consumer and business spending prior to the close of the year 


Among the top movers during Tuesday s session were Transportation and Telecom stocks  both moving in opposing directions as investors reacted to fundamental events released before the opening bell  Transportation stocks weakened following disappointing earnings from United Parcel Service Inc  NYSE UPS   which fell by 3 7   As a result  the price of the Dow Jones Transportation broke firmly below its rising 20 day moving average  a level that has supported the short term trend since April  Momentum indicators have been negatively diverging from price since June  suggesting waning upside strength  Transportation stocks seasonally weaken between the end of July and the beginning of October  declining by almost 4   on average  over the period 




On the flip side were Telecom stocks  which gained following news that Windstream Holdings  NASDAQ WIN  filed to spin off assets into a tax efficient real estate investment trust  Shares of WIN jumped over 12   propelling the Telecom ETF  iShares US Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ   higher by 3 22     Momentum indicators for the Telecom ETF have been trending higher since May  suggesting growing upside strength prior to Tuesday s breakout    Seasonally  telecom stocks enter a period of seasonal strength in August September as investors take advantage of the appealing yields that equities in this sector offer in order to hedge against rising volatility  which persists through to October  The diverging paths between Transportation and Telecom stocks just adds to the recent trend of risk aversion that has become apparent within the equity and bond markets  potentially a leading indicator that broad market weakness is soon to follow

171945,393461,UPS,Will The S P Be Able To Hold 1900 ,opinion,"The question on everyone s lips at the end of last week was whether or not the red ink was the start of the long awaited  long scorned correction  or just another dip to be bought  From a technical perspective  there was some real damage  as the S P 500 index that everyone takes direction from sliced right through its 50 day exponential moving average  EMA  for the first time in three months  The Dow 30 is now down about half of a percent on the year  and perhaps most worrisome is that the Russell 2000 small cap index is now down 4 2  
The S P is also down 4  from its closing high of only 8 days ago  when it made its first flirtation with 2000 by poking its head above 1990  Now the question is whether or not it holds 1900   while it is oversold short term  it is by no means oversold on an intermediate or long term basis  and hasn t been so in nearly two years  Just as the index would work off short term overbought conditions by pausing for a few days during recent months  it s possible to see similar sideways action again before trades are faced with the true test of the 150 day EMA  at 1885  The 150 line was the bottom of the January February pullback  the resistance level for the May June Fed panic last summer  and has not been pierced since November 2012  the last time the 200 day average was tested either   That may seem like a lot of technical talk  but this is not a market running on earnings growth  despite the cheerful assurances of brokerage house bulls 
I think a test of the 150 day is plausible  but prices are going to need a bigger excuse to get past that  Last week s action was a confluence of factors   the last day of the month  post Fed meeting sell off with taper worries  contagion worries  Argentine default  Portuguese bank stumble   growing violence in the Ukraine and Middle East  anxiety over growth being too high or too low  some weak corporate guidance  the calendar  and of course plain old fear that this dip was for real 
It s also common for stocks to rally through the first half of earnings season and then begin to sell off as it winds down   the two week intervals that begin at the end of April  July and October are well traveled weak spots for stocks  There s no law about it  but it s familiar enough behavior that another episode shouldn t surprise anyone 
All that said  not enough has happened to really get the market to doubt itself  Even many of the short term bears that were popping up at the end of the week were avowing their long term bullishness  A genuine break down past the 150 day average   and yes  everyone will be watching it   is going to require some fresh horror  be it the credit markets  Fed  or the battlefields  Markets quickly get bored with yesterday s carnage and mere tension
There are always a multitude of things that can go wrong  and places like the Ukraine and the Middle East are real hot zones  But the market only stops to heed the very worst events  Going forward  the market s most immediate worry is the tide going out from either the Argentine default or Portuguese banks and revealing some over leveraged clown that scares the credit markets  Barring that  it would be open warfare in the Ukraine  If neither of those happen   and they don t seem odds on   without some big ugly to take their place  the markets will find a way to start rallying again as soon as it looks like the selling has tired itself out  Keep in mind that the last 10  correction was occasioned by a surprise downgrade of the U S  credit rating that came rating against a backdrop of stalling recovery  Today s worry situations don t have to get better to appease stocks   they just have to stop getting worse 
At the risk of sounding like I want to have it both ways  the above shouldn t be construed as the all clear siren  Valuations are still quite rich across both stocks and bonds  and when the reversion to the mean does finally come  it will mean serious pain  The breakdown of the Russell 2000 is the classic kind of genuine warning sign that we are in the fourth quarter of the game  But markets never heed the first bells  and in fact prices nearly always go on to make defiant new highs first  It s just the nature of the beast 
One soothing remark from a Fed governor would stop any decline in its tracks  On the other hand  a burst of hawkishness could be the trick that rattles our policy obsessed markets into the dreaded 10  zone  It s a sign of just how tied to easy money asset prices have become 
The Economic Beat 
It s hard to say what was the highlight of last week from the economic calendar   2nd quarter GDP  the FOMC statement  or the employment report  The former two seemed to contribute to the market sell off  I wouldn t blame all of it on them  and the last probably had more of a calming effect than anything else 
The jobs report is the headline that most people see  and it was immediately pronounced  Goldilocks  at CNBC  and elsewhere  the rest of the day  In at least one way  it was  At 209 000  the initial estimate of additional non farm payroll jobs was below the estimate for about 235 000  well below the whisper number of 300K plus  yet still above some sort of scary slippage number like 180K  You might think that a number over 300K would be good  but coming on the heels of a 4  quarterly GDP print on Wednesday  it would have revived tightening fears in our policy besotted stock market 
Despite the GDP print that was much higher than expected  there was still a lot of anxiety about growth during the week  Bellwether companies like Visa Inc  NYSE V  and United Parcel Service Inc  NYSE UPS  haven t been very enthused about the second half outlook  and the Chicago purchasing manager index took a terrific plunge on Thursday  with its largest single month drop since 2008  The number wasn t really bad at 52   still above the neutral line of 50   but the roughly ten point drop might have done as much as anything to rattle markets on Thursday  If the Chicago number  which is heavily influenced by auto sales  does reflect auto inventories that are too high  then the implication is that the inventory boost from the second quarter may already be receding 
But we were talking about employment  Much of the report was more of the same   no growth in weekly hours and puny growth in wages  Some parts were a tad more interesting   the participation rate edged back up one tenth of a percent  immediately hailed as a sign of the strengthening market  Now  the household data is pretty volatile and it s only one month  but I didn t hear anyone mention that the 881K increase in the  not in the labor force   NILF  category   people not working but not counted in the rate because they are not  actively  unemployed   dwarfed the increase in employment of only 131K  As I said  the household is swingy and there s a lot of seasonal adjustment going on  but there is more than one side of the picture 
The establishment data looked better  Though the initial estimate missed estimates  and who knows  maybe it gets revised back up next month  I was a little puzzled as to why it came up short  The year on year increase in unadjusted payrolls is tentatively 1 92   compared to July 2013 s result of 1 76  and the best showing for the month since 2000  The seven month percentage increase of 0 29   unadjusted   even after the inevitable revisions  should still be the best showing since 2005  It looks like the adjustment factors held the headline number back 
Despite this seemingly stellar growth  personal income and wages continue to grow at an anemic pace  At least a partial explanation can be found in the following couple of charts from the BLS that focus on part time labor  Although June s controversial jump in part time labor disappeared  the graphs are still striking  Figure 1 is part time workers for economic reasons  while Figure 2 is part time workers for non economic reasons 


We have an awful lot of people working part time  A  from last fall addressed the issue and trotted out the usual suspects   aging demographics  potential impact of Obamacare   but concluded that the largest impact was from the slow job recovery  That seems right for two reasons   one is that at 14 1   the percentage of part time worker for non economic reasons  i e   want to work full time but can t get the hours  has been creeping up slowly the last few years  but is still lower than 2007  14 5   and the average since 1990  14 4    No doubt Obamacare has played a role in corporate America s relentless battle to minimize labor costs  outside of the executive suite  along with the other above named factors  but the strongest conclusion from the data is that one of the main reasons for anemic income growth is the heavy mix of part time workers 
The other indication that the job recovery has been slow is that the number of officially insured  that is  covered by unemployment insurance  workers at the end of the second quarter is still 1 8 million less than the last cycle s peak in 2008  That was nearly six years ago  the last expansion cycle took four years to surpass the previous peak  We are at least three more quarters away  and it s not even certain that we ll get there  the number of workers added in the second quarter of 2014 was actually a bit less than the second quarter of 2013  The claims survey doesn t double count workers the way the payroll survey does 
The more moderate July number  which included some mild upward revisions to May and June  will at least be less of a topic of conversation than the hotter June number  The  bragged up the seasonally adjusted increase in manufacturing jobs  but the result was from an outdated adjustment factor that still thinks auto factories shut down at this time of year  The actual monthly increase of 6K jobs  estimated  was less than July 2011 or 2012  and may start to head the other way if automakers do in fact slow their mounting inventories  Talk about the domestic economy should start to shift toward third quarter GDP  now that the first month s auto sales are in  to be followed by July retail sales and industrial production the week after next 
While I covered GDP in some detail in my Seeking Alpha article  the essential was that the longer the time frame  the more you can see there is little to no change in the trend  The quarter over quarter rebound gave a good looking number that was boosted by inventories  but the year on year number of 2 4  is just average and the first half of the year remains anemic  Looked at over the last four years  the only thing happening in 2014 so far is a mild easing of economic growth  one that at the moment does not appear to be set to take off in the second half  Recent revisions have been very large to this number  so I wouldn t take anything to the bank yet 
The FOMC statement on monetary policy was also more of the same  There was a tiny bit of defensiveness in its decision to continue the taper while asserting its right to carry on ultra low rates for as long as it wants  Considering that the committee almost surely knew that the unemployment rate had edged up to 6 2   its emphasis on its  dashboard of indicators  might imply that the committee doesn t plan to wait until 5 5  to take the first step  The market eventually closed down  though that isn t unusual after the Fed statement  but one had the feeling that the market was a tad less convinced about Yellen s dovishness  Perhaps she is setting them up for another rally down the road 
The Chicago PMI turned out not to be a harbinger of the ISM survey  The Markit PMI survey did turn lower from its flash reading  but the ISM rose to a greater level  57 1  than expected  The sector ratio was broad too  with 17 reporting expansion versus only one contracting  though the responder comments emphasized the mildness of the growth  That s the drawback to diffusion surveys  which can give misleading clues about the depth of monthly direction  especially over short periods  Still  it did cheer the market  especially when compared with June construction spending  The latter is another number subject to big revisions   May was revised from  0 1  to  0 8    but June came out with   1 8    That ll mean a downward drag for the next GDP revision due in three weeks time  the Dallas Fed reported a very good 12 7 reading for its survey 
Pending home sales eased back a bit with a   1 1   decline  while the rate of year on year sales appreciation also moderated according to the Case Shiller index that dropped from 10 8  to 9 3   Buyers may be starting to resist increases  Consumer confidence surpassed 90 for the first time since December 2007  Despite the irony of that   couldn t help gushing over it  exclaiming over the  very favorable mix of readings  that  point to healthy acceleration   That overlooks two points   one is that confidence and spending don t correlate very well  and the second is that extreme confidence readings are great contrary indicators 
The other highlight of the week was an increase in the Chinese PMI to 51 7 in both the public and private surveys  This has been setting off overstimulated stimulus buying of Chinese stocks  but the numbers have really been on the soft side since the latest mini stimulus 
Next week is a light one  with doesn t augur well for stocks   light weeks tend to follow the direction of the previous week  The first reports of note come Tuesday  with the ISM services survey and June factory orders  Wednesday has international trade  Thursday the very small same store sales sample from retailers  and Friday has productivity and costs   the latest release of the employment cost index showed a big gain   0 7   that stocks didn t like at all  Wholesale trade on Friday should give a clue to third quarter inventor direction  The back half of the week will also have a good chunk of PMI data from Europe  which is starting to suffer from growth scares again ",2014-08-01,Kevin Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-the-s-p-be-able-to-hold-1900-221405,221405

 By David Sheppard
 NEW YORK  April 26  Reuters    Silver was on course for its
largest one day fall in six weeks on Tuesday after having hit a
31 year high in the previous session  while gold came under
pressure from investor uncertainty over the likely course of
U S  monetary policy 
 Spot silver fell by as much as 4 9 percent to a session low
of  44 63 an ounce  after having risen to  49 31 on Monday  its
highest since touching  49 48 in January 1980 
 High volatility and the expiry of U S  silver options added
to the intensity of the decline  impacting gold  which fell
back from Monday s record of  1 518 10 an ounce ahead of the
outcome of the U S  Federal Reserve s policy meeting on
Wednesday 
 The Fed is expected to indicate it is in no hurry to raise
interest rates  while Chairman Ben Bernanke will deliver the
first regularly scheduled post decision news briefing in the
bank s 97 year history 
  There are quite a few things coming out in the next day or
two    the FOMC and the GDP release  People are just taking
profits on these markets around that event risk   said Standard
Chartered analyst Daniel Smith 
 Silver was last bid at  45 04 an ounce at 11 48 a m  EDT
 1548 GMT   compared with  46 90 late in New York on Monday 
set for its biggest daily loss since March 15 
 Silver at the money implied options volatility has risen by
over 35 percent in the last four trading days to hit its
highest level since mid November 
 U S  silver futures saw record volume on Monday  with over
300 000 lots changing hands  with another 225 865 trading
before midday on Tuesday 
 Silver futures for May were down at  45 00 having closed at
 47 15 on Monday 
 The iShares Silver Trust  the world s largest silver backed
exchange traded fund  also saw heavy trading  with a record
34 93 million shares trading on Monday and a further 12 6
million shares changing hands in early trading on Tuesday 
  Everyone has heard that silver is in a parabolic uptrend 
but it now appears ready to take at least a respite to calm
down a bit   wrote Larry McMillan  president of McMillan
Analysis Corp  in a report 
 Gold meanwhile was on course for a second daily decline  in
spite of the weakness in the dollar  which usually acts as an
incentive to non U S  investors to buy the metal 
 The spot price was last down 0 7 percent at  1 499 00 an
ounce  while U S  gold futures for June delivery were down 0 6
percent at  1 499 45 
 DOLLAR LINK WEAKENS
 However  gold s usual inverse relation to the dollar has
been weakening consistently since mid April  meaning the
bullion price will derive less of a bounce from any softness in
the U S  currency 
 Tighter U S  policy would restrict the amount of cash in
the financial system and could temper concern about inflation 
which investors often protect against by buying gold 
 The Federal Open Market Committee meeting started on
Tuesday and concludes on Wednesday  The U S  central bank is
expected to confirm it will stick to plans to complete its  600
billion bond buying program 
 Solid earnings from U S  companies  including Ford  3M Co
and United Parcel Service lifted stocks on Tuesday  helping the
S P 500 and the Dow industrials set highs for the year 
 Consumer confidence in the United States also picked up in
April  despite rising gasoline prices  The Conference Board  an
industry group  said its index of consumer attitudes rose to
65 4 in April from a revised 63 8 in March  though it remains
low by historical standards 
  The dollar fell to a 16 month low against the euro on
expectations that U S  monetary policy will remain
accommodative compared to the European Central Bank  which has
already begun to raise rates 
 Traders say part of the reason for the volatility in gold
and silver prices is activity related to options    contracts
which give holders the right to buy or sell the underlying
security at a fixed price in the futures 
  There s been a rush to cover exposure to these contracts
ahead of expiry  maturity    a trader said   It s been more
pronounced in silver futures  
 Silver prices are still up about 50 percent so far this
year after gains of more than 80 percent last year 
 Platinum was last at  1 807 48 an ounce  down from Monday s
last quote at  1 819 30  while palladium traded at  757 50 an
ounce versus  757 80 on Monday

 NEW YORK  April 26  Reuters    Wall Street rallied and the
S P 500 hit its highest level since June 2008 on Tuesday as a
flood of positive corporate results added to increasing
optimism about the economic growth outlook 
 Ford Motor Co   3M Co  and United Parcel
Services Inc  were among the bellwether names to
impress  continuing a string of better than expected results 
3M and UPS also raised their full year profit outlooks 
contributing to the bullish sentiment  For details  see
 ID nN26272264 
 Shares of 3M  a Dow component  rose 2 2 percent to  96 22
while UPS was up 1 2 percent at  74 52  Ford advanced 2 5
percent to  15 92 
  The very positive outlooks from today means things look
very bright going forward   said Peter Andersen  portfolio
manager of the Boston based Congress Asset Management 
  I was frankly delighted with Ford s results  and the
market is taking some of its cue from the strength there  
added Andersen  who helps manage  7 billion and owns Ford 
 Though 73 percent of New York Stock Exchange issues were
in positive territory  there were some disappointments 
Coca Cola Co  fell 1 7 percent to  66 61 and was the
Dow s biggest loser after its results were hurt by lost
Japanese revenue  U S  Steel Corp  and Netflix Inc
 also fell after results 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  was up 108 83
points  or 0 87 percent  at 12 588 71  The Standard   Poor s
500 Index  was up 11 55 points  or 0 87 percent  at
1 346 80  The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 20 85
points  or 0 74 percent  at 2 846 73 
 The three major U S  stock indexes hit highs for the year 
and the Nasdaq was at its highest since late 2007  erasing
losses after a drop in February  But some caution remained a
day before a press conference by U S  Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke 
 The conference follows the Fed s last policy statement
before it is expected to stop its quantitative easing program
at the end of June  Investors have concerns that the end of
that program could remove support for buying stocks 
 Trading volume was weaker than average  with 3 94 billion
shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange  the American
Stock Exchange and Nasdaq as of 1 p m  EST 
  There s some apprehension about what to expect   Andersen
said   People are anxious to reinvest in equity markets  but
they re tentative about the Fed  which is why you ve been
seeing such low volume lately  
 U S  consumer confidence rose in April as inflation
expectations eased somewhat and consumers felt better about
the short term outlook  according to a private sector report 
The data helped ease concerns that the recent rise in oil
prices have started to hit shoppers   ID nN26293308

172137,393653,UPS,GLOBAL MARKETS U S  dollar  stocks slip on debt fears,news,"  U S  debt default looms as lawmakers remain divided
   Dollar hits fresh record low versus Swiss franc
   U S   European stocks fall
  Updates prices  adds comment  byline 
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK  July 26  Reuters    The U S  dollar fell on
Tuesday as U S  lawmakers remained deadlocked over raising the
nation s debt ceiling to avoid a devastating default  while
U S  and European shares also declined 
 Unless lawmakers reach a deal to raise the  14 3 trillion
ceiling by Aug  2  the United States would face the prospect of
a default on some of its  9 6 trillion government bonds
outstanding 
 In a televised address  President Barack Obama warned that
this would be a  reckless and irresponsible outcome   but he
gave no indication that a compromise was imminent  For more

 Weakness in stocks earlier weighed on crude oil prices 
while gold hovered near a record high hit in the previous
session as investors looked to the precious metal for safety 
 The U S  currency hit a record low against the Swiss franc
of 0 7997  on trading platform EBS and fell to a
four month low near 77 883 yen   approaching a record
low of 76 25 set in March 
  The market is getting more nervous about the debt ceiling
issue   said You Na Park  currency strategist at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt   If the market was really starting to price in the
possibility of a default  the dollar would be losing more than
what we saw this morning  
 Against a basket of currencies  the dollar  fell 0 6
percent  The euro rose 0 8 percent to  1 4498  
 U S  stocks were mostly lower  pressured by worries about
U S  debt talks and weakness in 3M Co  and United Parcel
Service Inc   which both reported earnings 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  was down 60 85
points  or 0 48 percent  at 12 531 95  The Standard   Poor s
500 Index  was down 2 15 points  or 0 16 percent  at
1 335 28  The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 2 10
points  or 0 07 percent  at 2 844 90 
  The level of confidence that a deal will be done is
starting to weaken based on last night s speeches and all of
the analysis that s gone on since last night   said Hugh
Johnson  chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC
in Albany  New York 
 European stocks fell 0 3 percent  after
weaker than expected results from BP  and UBS  
 World stocks as measured by MSCI world equity index
 rose 0 3 percent  while emerging stocks
 rose 0 7 percent 
 Investors so far appear to have done little to prepare for
a default or a cut in the U S  triple A credit rating  Many are
still clinging to the hope that lawmakers will eventually reach
a deal  It is also nearly impossible to insure against what is
considered a low probability event  especially given the lack
of alternatives and the depth of the market  analysts said 
 The cost of insuring the United States against default

   Dollar hits fresh record low versus Swiss franc
   U S   European stocks fall
  Updates prices  adds comment  details 
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK  July 26  Reuters    The U S  dollar fell broadly
on Tuesday as U S  lawmakers remained deadlocked over raising
the nation s debt ceiling to avoid a devastating default  while
U S  and European shares also declined 
 Unless lawmakers reach a deal to raise the  14 3 trillion
ceiling by Aug  2  the United States would face the prospect of
a default on some of its  9 6 trillion bonds outstanding 
 In a televised address Monday night  President Barack Obama
warned that this would be a  reckless and irresponsible
outcome   but he gave no indication that a compromise was
imminent  For more see  ID nN1E76N0CA  
 Weakness in the greenback helped buoy crude oil prices 
while gold hovered near a record high hit the previous session
as investors looked to the precious metal for safety 
 The U S  currency hit a record low against the Swiss franc
of 0 7997 franc  on trading platform EBS and fell to a
four month low near 77 883 yen   approaching a record
low of 76 25 set in March 
  The market is getting more nervous about the debt ceiling
issue   said You Na Park  currency strategist at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt   If the market was really starting to price in the
possibility of a default  the dollar would be losing more than
what we saw this morning  
 Against a basket of currencies  the dollar  fell 0 6
percent  The euro rose 0 8 percent to  1 4493  
 U S  stocks were mostly lower  pressured by worries about
U S  debt talks and weakness in 3M Co  and United Parcel
Service Inc   which both reported earnings 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  was down 69 82
points  or 0 55 percent  at 12 522 98  The Standard   Poor s
500 Index  was down 3 64 points  or 0 27 percent  at
1 333 79  The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 0 30
points  or 0 01 percent  at 2 843 10 
 European stocks fell 0 3 percent  after
weaker than expected results from BP  and UBS  
 World stocks as measured by MSCI world equity index
 rose 0 3 percent  while emerging stocks
 rose 0 7 percent 
 Investors so far appear to have done little to prepare for
a default or a cut in the U S  triple A credit rating  Many are
still clinging to the hope that lawmakers will eventually reach
a deal  It is also nearly impossible to insure against what is
considered a low probability event  especially given the lack
of alternatives and the depth of the market  analysts said 
 The cost of insuring the United States against default
stood around 59 basis points   nearly half the
March 2009 peak 
 The credit default swap curve is nearly flat with one year
CDS  at 59 4 basis points  This in itself
reflects investor jitters  but it is not the kind of pricing
normally seen when investors expect an imminent default

 NEW YORK  April 26  Reuters    United Parcel Service 
is expected on Tuesday to report higher quarterly profits as an
improving economy and higher pricing seem likely to overshadow
increasing fuel costs and harsh winter weather 	
 The economic bellwether s first quarter operating profit is
expected to rise to 83 cents per share from 53 cents a year ago 
with revenue increasing to  12 72 billion from  11 73 billion 
according to Thomson Reuters I B E S 	
 Adjusted earnings are expected to rise to 85 cents from 71
cents per share a year ago 	
 UPS in February forecast record high profits for this year 
saying it controlled costs as compensation and benefit expenses
rose less than volume 	
 Analysts will be looking for indications that oil prices
have not risen enough to choke consumer demand and that UPS
volume and rate increases can stick 	
 UPS handles goods equal to 6 percent of the U S  gross
domestic product and 2 percent of global GDP in its trucks and
planes  so its shipment trends give a tangible view of consumer
demand 	
 The company in February estimated 2011 profits of  4 12 to
 4 35 a share  which would be up more than 15 percent from last
year and surpass its prior peak earnings set in 2007 	
 Wall Street analysts expect  on average   4 25 earnings per

to Thomson Reuters I B E S 	
 UPS shares closed 0 6 percent higher on Monday at  73 64

 By Edward Krudy
 NEW YORK  April 26  Reuters    Solid earnings from big U S 
companies such as Ford  3M Co and United Parcel Service lifted
stocks on Tuesday  but investors braced for a report on
consumer confidence amid concerns about the recent rise in oil
prices 
 Corporate earnings have been generally strong so far this
season  with around three quarters of S P 500 companies beating
analysts  forecasts so far  That has helped push the Dow
industrials up to near three year highs 
 U S  consumer confidence data for April  to be released
later on Tuesday  will be closely watched against a backdrop of
rising oil prices and stubbornly high unemployment  which
investors fear could hurt consumer spending 
  With gasoline prices continuing to climb  at some point
it s definitely going to affect the mind of the consumer   said
Peter Cardillo  chief market economist at Avalon Partners in
New York   Have we reached there yet  I m not too sure  
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 23 54 points  or 0 19
percent  at 12 503 42  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index climbed
4 38 points  or 0 33 percent  at 1 339 63  The Nasdaq Composite
Index added 5 59 points  or 0 20 percent  at 2 831 47 
 United Parcel Service  an economic bellwether that handles
a large chunk of the world s business deliveries  said the
global economic outlook was a little cloudier than 3 months
ago  but at the same time it said it sees record earnings in
2011  The shares rose 1 5 percent to  74 52 
  On balance we have seen good earnings come through and
today is no exception   said Mark Luschini  chief investment
strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia   We
continue to see good news coming out of industrial America  
 Ford Motor Co reported its best first quarter profit in 13

172185,393701,UPS,GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD Accentuating the positive,news,"By Jeremy Gaunt  European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON  April 24  Reuters    Investors have pushed stock
markets up to the point where some of the drive has sputtered 
but they still appear more inclined to embrace good news and
ignore the negative 
 Although equities are now more expensive than they were
after a near 30 percent rise for global stocks and many major
investors still consider the March to April gain to be a bear
market rally  there has been little sign of retrenchment 
 This may be tested in the coming week  however  as the
results of examinations of U S  banks leak out and some key U S
data on growth is released 
 Globally  equity markets have been showing what for many is
a surprising degree of resilience  Having gained for six weeks
in a row  the MSCI all country world index was heading for
nothing worse than a mild weekly loss on Friday 
 Since March 9  the index has risen as much as 29 6 percent 
That said  it is still some way from its early January high and
is down more than 3 5 percent for the year to date 
 While the sustainability of the rally has been questioned by
some    Societe Generale s bearish Albert Edwards says a
reversal will cause a  catastrophic loss of confidence     to
date it has only been dented by poor news  not wrecked by it 
 Investors appear to be seeking out the positive  wherever
they can find it  and turning away from bad news 
 U S  stocks rose on Thursday  for example  on
better than expected results from regional banks such as PNC
Financial Services 
 This came despite disappointing earnings from economy
bellwether United Parcel Service and data showing that existing
homes sales fell in March to a much lower than expected annual
rate 
 
 GLIMMERS
 What has driven the market forward is a combination of
shares having fallen so far last year and into 2009 with
tentative signs of economic recovery 
  In recent weeks  there have been some encouraging signs
that the global economic downturn may be slackening   U S 
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner wrote in Friday s Financial
Times 
  Conditions in some financial markets have improved and the
decline in world trade may be abating  
 Many analysts and economists are particularly noting that
lack of production now means company warehouses are empty of
inventory    usually a sign that production will pick up 
  We have seen a lot of de stocking in the last six to nine
months and we will see a re stocking of the global economy in
the second half of the year   Folker Hellmeyer  chief analyst at
Bremer Landesbank  told Reuters financial television 
  That will have a     positive impact on the global growth
picture   he said 
 Markets will get a big taste of the state of growth on
Wednesday when U S  first quarter Gross Domestic Product data is
to be released 
 A preliminary Reuters survey of economists showed that
growth was on average expected to have contracted by an
annualised 5 percent in the quarter 
 Given the current mood of investors  if the data matches
that or shows less of a contraction  stocks likely would gain
and bonds sell off 
 That might even happen if the data is simply not as bad as
worst case scenarios 
 
 STRESS AHEAD 
 Markets  however  will have a new potential headwind to deal
with related to banking  the issue that most rocks them 
 U S  regulators are conducting  stress tests  of the 19
largest U S  banks  including Citigroup  JPMorgan Chase   Co and
Wells Fargo  to try to find out how much capital any big bank
might need should the recessionary economy deteriorate further 
 The final results are not due until May 4  the week after
next  but the banks themselves are to get a read out later on
Friday 
 It would be most unusual if some of the findings did not
leak out or rumours fly over the next week  potentially making
markets volatile 
 The process is actually a difficult one for the regulators
because they will need to be credible but at the same time will
have no desire to spook the markets 
 But even here investors appear to be accentuating the
positive 
  We would be surprised to see a large number of U S  banks
failing a stress test devised by the authorities who are
underpinning and have capital stakes in these banks   said
Richard Batty  a strategist at Standard Life Investments 
 Then again  that could set up markets for trouble if the
tests are bad

   Emerging markets stocks and bonds under heavy pressure
   Dollar rises to two year high before dropping back
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt  European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON  Oct 23  Reuters    Fear of global recession battered
stock markets again on Thursday while a flight from emerging
market debt and stocks helped push the dollar to a two year high
against major currencies 
 European shares lost more than 2 percent and Asian shares
hit four year lows 
 Investors were also focusing on major company earnings
reports  fearful that the worst financial crisis in 80 years and
a deteriorating global economy would combine to decimate
corporate profits 
 Emerging markets were particularly under the gun 
 MSCI s main emerging market stock index  was down
3 8 percent on the day  hitting a nearly four year low after
major losses on Wednesday  It has lost nearly 35 percent of its
value so far this month 
 Emerging market sovereign debt spreads  11EMJ  blew out to
more than 825 basis points over U S  Treasury yields  a gap not
seen since late 2002 
 The cost of insurance against sovereign debt default in
countries such as South Korea  Indonesia  the Philippines 
Russia and Kazakhstan has soared over the past two days 
  There is now little argument that the world economy will
experience a period of sub par growth  and a recession in
several advanced economies looks increasingly likely   Goldman
Sachs said in a research note 
 Investor flight from emerging markets over the past few
weeks has accelerated this week  helping push the U S  dollar to
new heights as money is both repatriated from overseas and seeks
relative safety in U S  fixed income 
 The dollar index   which tracks the greenback against
a basket of major currencies  hit a two year high of 86 07 
although it later fell back to 85 56 
 The euro was barely changed from late U S  trade at  1 2844
 
  We are going to see the current pressures continue as
tensions in emerging markets continue  The dollar will remain
supported and the high yielders will stay under pressure   said
Ian Stannard  FX analyst at BNP Paribas 
 
 EARNINGS IN SIGHT
 European shares were choppy  rising by more than 1 percent
at one point before tumbling  The FTSEurofirst 300 
index of leading European shares was down 2 1 percent after
falling 5 4 percent on Wednesday 
 Results were mixed  Nestle   the world s biggest
food group  reported a forecast beating rise in nine month
sales  Agrochemicals and seeds group Syngenta  also
reported a strong rise in third quarter sales 
 But Swiss bank Credit Suisse Group AG  fell after
it confirmed a 1 3 billion Swiss franc third quarter loss 
engineering group ABB  plunged after posting a
forecast missing rise in third quarter net profit  helped by
demand from emerging markets 
 In the United States  Microsoft  will release
quarterly results alongside drugmakers Eli Lilly  and
Bristol Myers Squibb  as well as Dow Chemical  and
mail and logistics group United Parcel Service  
 Earlier  Japan s Nikkei average  hit its lowest point
since May 2003 before paring losses to end down 2 5 percent  It
shed 213 71 points to 8 460 98 after earlier falling as low as
8 016 61  its lowest in nearly five and a half years 
The broader Topix  ended the day down 2 percent at
871 70 after earlier falling more than 6 percent 
 Euro zone government bond yields fell  The two year Schatz
yield was 9 basis points lower at 2 734 percent  and
10 year Bund yields were down 1 basis point at 3 796 percent
