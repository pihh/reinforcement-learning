measures Now  I ll turn the call over to Maria Maria Henry    Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Paul  And good morning everyone  Thanks for joining us today  Let me start with the headlines on our full year results  Organic sales increased 4   driven by higher net selling prices  We achieved strong margin improvements and bottom line growth  while increasing our brand investments  And we improved capital efficiency and return significant cash to shareholders Now let s cover the details of our results starting with sales  Full year net sales were  18 5 billion  That s even year on year and included a 3 point drag from currency rates  Organic sales were up 4   Looking at the topline by geography  In North America  organic sales in consumer products increased 3   Within that  Personal Care grew 4  with positive volumes  pricing and mix  Consumer Tissue grew 2  with selling prices up 7  and volumes down 5   In KC Professional in North America  organic sales increased 3   driven by higher prices in all major product categories  In Developing   Emerging markets  organic sales rose 6   That included about 2 5 points from Argentina In terms of key Personal Care markets  organic sales increased 20  in Eastern Europe and high single digits in Brazil  China  and ASEAN  Outside of Brazil and Argentina  we experienced increased volatility and soft results in Latin America  particularly in the second half of the year in Peru  Bolivia and Chile  In Developed Markets outside of North America  organic sales rose 1  Moving on to profitability  Full year adjusted gross margin was 35   up 180 basis points year on year  Adjusted gross profit increased 5   We generated  425 million of cost savings from our FORCE and restructuring programs  That was right in line with our initial target and slightly better than we expected in October  For 2020  we re targeting to deliver between  425 million to  500 million in total cost savings  and that includes  325 million to  375 million from FORCE Commodities were a drag of  145 million in 2019  although they turn favorable in the back half of the year  Foreign currencies were also a headwind  reducing operating profit at a high single digit rate  For 2020  we expect commodities will be somewhat favorable  mostly offset by currency headwinds  particularly in Latin America  Other manufacturing costs were also higher in 2019 Moving further down the P L  Between the lines spending was up 90 basis points as a percent of sales  That included higher advertising spending  which was up 60 basis points  SG A spending also increased and included higher incentive compensation  along with capability building investments  Adjusted operating margin was 17 8   up 80 basis points  and adjusted operating profit grew 5   Operating margins were up nicely in all three business segments  led by consumer tissue and secondarily KC Professional The adjusted effective tax rate was in line with plan and a drag year on year  partially offset by higher equity income and a lower share count  In total  full year adjusted earnings per share were  6 89  up 4   Our October guidance was for earnings of  6 75 to  6 90  And our original outlook last January was for earnings of  6 50 to  6 70 Now  let s turn to cash flow and capital efficiency  Cash provided by operations was  2 7 billion  down year on year as expected and driven by higher working capital  We expect a solid increase in cash flow this year  driven by higher earnings  Capital spending was  1 2 billion in 2019  in line with plan and up year on year  due to supply chain restructuring projects  Spending will remain elevated in 2020 because of our restructuring  We improved adjusted return on invested capital by 70 basis points to 27 2   which is an all time high  On capital allocation  dividends and share repurchases totaled  2 2 billion  That s the ninth consecutive year we ve returned at least  2 billion to shareholders  We expect to return a similar level of cash to shareholders in 2020  And our Board has already approved our 48th consecutive annual dividend increase Let me finish with a short update on our restructuring program  Overall  we ve made significant progress as we close out the second year of this program  The implementation of our redesigned overhead organization has gone very well  and we ve already realized most of the total program SG A savings  In terms of supply chain  activities continue to ramp up  We ve announced seven of the approximately 10 facilities that we expect to close or sell  and we ve taken action on six of those  In 2020  we will start up approximately 20 new assets globally  which is roughly twice the level of activity that we would have in a typical year Looking at the key metrics  We re about 70  to 75  of the ways through pre tax charges and workforce reductions  Cash payments are about 65  complete  And on savings  we accelerated savings in both 2018 and 2019  And so far  we ve generated  300 million of savings compared to our total program target of  500 million to  550 million by the end of 2021  So overall  it was a very good year  and I m pleased that we deliver top and bottom line growth ahead of our plan  while we invested more in the business for the long term With that  I ll turn the call over to Mike Michael D  Hsu    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Maria  Good morning  everyone  Let me start by saying  I m encouraged by our results and the progress we made in the first year of executing K C Strategy 2022  On the top line  organic sales were up 4  in  19  ahead of our original plan for 2  growth  Our team has maintained strong focus on price realization and executed their plans well throughout the year  As a result  pricing was up 4   And that s the highest realization we ve achieved in a decade and it was necessary because of the multi year inflation that we faced Our strategy is to elevate our categories and drive trade up also helped us improve product mix by 1 point  While volumes were down 1   That was better than our original expectation because of strong end market execution  higher brand investment and less impact from price increases  Beyond sales  we delivered broad based margin improvements and above plan earnings  We continue to leverage our financial and capital discipline as we achieved significant cost savings  improved ROIC and returned significant cash to shareholders We also invested more in our brands and businesses in 2019  As Maria noted  we increased advertising spending by 60 basis points  Digital advertising is now about two thirds of our working media mix  and it s helping us target consumers more effectively and deploy our campaigns more quickly  We re leveraging our digital expertise and more businesses around the world  and our marketing ROI is improving  Importantly  our digital strategy is helping us grow volumes and businesses like in fem care internationally  diapers in Eastern Europe  and adult care in North America Now  beyond advertising  we ve also started to invest behind and focus more on improving our other commercial capabilities  including revenue management  We re taking a disciplined program management approach to this effort  This includes making sure we have the right tools  processes and resources  so we can better leverage these growth capabilities  While it s still early days  we re making good progress and I expect more going forward  All in all  our teams have made excellent progress in 2019  And I m proud of their accomplishments Now  I ll turn to our outlook for 2020  Our plan is consistent with our balanced approach to value creation  includes higher growth investments and aligns with our K C Strategy 2022 financial objectives  On the top line  we re targeting organic sales growth of 2   and that s consistent with our medium term objective and similar to our expectation for category growth  We expect selling prices  product mix and volumes to all improve in 2020  Pricing should be weighted to the front half of the year  while volume growth will likely be more weighted to the back half  We expect the promotion environment to be competitive  but remain broadly constructive  We will continue to increase our growth investment in 2020  and that includes investment in digital marketing  in our commercial capabilities and in our products as part of our innovation agenda In the first half  we will launch innovations in North America on Huggies diapers and adult care and on Cottonelle bathroom tissue  In D E  we have several upgrades coming in Personal Care in key markets such as China  Eastern Europe and Latin America  We re confident our growth investments and innovations will help us grow volume and improve product mix this year  and improve share performance over time  Our investments will start right away in the first quarter  while the benefits should build as the year progresses  We re targeting to grow adjusted operating profit 3  to 5  and on average  that implies 50 basis points of our operating margin expansion  Gross margin should increase more than that  On the bottom line  we re targeting adjusted earnings per share of  7 10 to  7 35  At the midpoint  that represents growth of 5   in line with our K C Strategy 2022 objective  Finally  as Maria said  we expect to improve cash flow and return significant amounts of cash to shareholders So in summary  I m encouraged by our progress in 2019 and our outlook for 2020  We re investing more in the business to drive long term success  and we re confident in our ability to deliver balanced and sustainable growth and create shareholder value Now that concludes our prepared remarks  And now  we d be happy to take your questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Our first question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Michael D  Hsu    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerHey  Lauren Lauren Lieberman    Barclays    AnalystHey  good morning  I guess  first thing is  I m struck by the 60 basis point increase in advertising spending in my model  which goes back to dare I say at 1997  that s the largest one year increase in advertising in the Company s history if that goes back that far  So that coupled with the fact that you had  100 million of incremental SG A in the fourth quarter and then  looking ahead into next year  the implied reinvestment spend  So can you talk about like  are there areas where you feel like as a company  you ve been under invested that it requires this much step up in spend  some of it is being supported by the fact that it s a benign input cost environment  But the plans that you laid out a year ago didn t contemplate the deflation that we re seeing So I m just kind of curious like the aggregate amount that s going back in  where you would say it s most focused and what it takes to start to see a return on that because the revenue guidance for 2020  while healthy  doesn t seem to tie with the amount of money that s going back into the business Michael D  Hsu    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  OK  Thanks  Lauren  Yeah  I think there is a part of it    maybe  there is a small part of it  which say  hey  we had a tough couple of years and so we had trimmed back a little bit of A CP  so part of that is restoring a bit of that  But the other part I would tell you is we feel really good about our stance on investment and I think it really reflects in our view the quality that we have in our commercial programing for this year and also  I think the fact that the category conditions we think are very conducive to growth  and I think that s a big change versus when you talk to this time last year where    we were uncertain about the marketplace  And we still were launching new innovations and new commercial program  So we feel really good about that  I think consumer demand has been pretty non resilient  and the competitive environment has been  we would say  broadly constructive  And so  that makes the conditions pretty    very good for growth And then the commercial programing  we ve got great innovation that launched in 2019 in North American adult care  in China in diapers  We ve got great innovation coming this year across Personal Care in multiple markets that we re very excited to support  And so  we feel good about that  So a big chunk of it is increased investment in the product and ongoing  and we have some good news coming  And then  importantly  I mentioned Digital  which is about two thirds of our overall advertising spend is being very productive for us  And we feel really good about our campaigns and the content we have out there and our team s ability to manage it effectively at a higher ROE level  So that s the second area And then  commercial capability  for us  I ll translate commercial capability  It includes kind of the innovation process  It includes revenue growth management  It includes sales execution and then  the digital aspect  And so  all those areas  we are investing and building our capability there Maria Henry    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And Lauren  I chime in that we were up 200 basis points in the fourth quarter  We were also up in the third quarter  And if you recall  fourth quarter in the back half of 2018 had particularly low spending between the lines  I think the full year comparison is the best way to look at this and for the full year  were up 90 basis points  60 basis points of that was advertising  Mike mentioned the investment in commercial capabilities  which ramped up toward the end of the year and then  the other thing I call out is incentive compensation  which we ve talked about before  This year  we overdelivered on our plan and therefore  had higher variable compensation And last year  the opposite that was true  We underdelivered on our plan and therefore  the variable compensation was lower  So you look at the year on year increase in that  that s an effect  And the last thing I d point out there is the way that our plan was constructed back in January  we had planned for a ramp on between the lines spending in the second half and an even more so in the fourth quarter  just the way that timing of our programs in areas like IT we re scheduled to Lauren Lieberman    Barclays    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you so much Michael D  Hsu    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerAll right  Lauren OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with the Bank of America Michael D  Hsu    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Olivia Olivia Tong    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGood morning  Wanted to talk about the pricing contribution for fiscal  20  Interesting to see that you re expecting to be positive  So is that price that s already in place that has yet to lap or more pricing that hasn t been introduced yet that you re putting in place are more a function of decisions you re making on promotional levels like you did on China as you focus on revenue management Paul Alexander    Investor RelationsYeah Olivia Tong    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHas there been    sorry  and just any change in your promotional expectations for fiscal  20  Thanks Michael D  Hsu    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thanks  Olivia  Yeah  I think broadly  I d say the pricing environment in 2019 was broadly constructive  And our expectation is for to remain so in 2020  We do have some pricing in our plan  I would say  a big chunk of that    the majority of that is carryover from actions we took in 2019  right  And so  you ll see most of that come through in the first half  And then  we do have probably some pricing plan to address specific issues in specific markets where we ve got some volatility in currencies or the economy  So that s aspect  I think in the overall  I would say net pricing in 2019  I think  was ahead of plan and the volume impact was less than plan  There were probably a few isolated hotspots  and there are probably a few isolated hotspots now  Our teams are staying close to those situations  and we re going to fine tune our promotional plans as appropriate  but maybe the headline I would say is  we re more focused on driving category growth and driving it the way that you would want us to do that by launching improved products and driving advertising  We d rather I think earn our share and own our share through innovation and advertising instead of renting it through promotion  And so  I think right now  our expectation is the environment should remain constructive Olivia Tong    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGreat  Thanks  And then just following up  obviously  you ve talked about China price promotion actions you ve taken in the past  Just your view on the market for D E personal care because it s nice to see the volume growth again  but the sales have decelerated a bit  so just if you could talk through that a little bit  Thanks Michael D  Hsu    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Olivia  just to be clear  that was about China Olivia Tong    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystYeah  specifically in China Michael D  Hsu    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  OK  Yeah  China  we re feeling very encouraged by our progress  We are up double digits behind  really strong momentum on fem care and really an improving trend in the diaper business  I d say on the diaper side  really what s driving our improvement is really good innovation that s gaining a lot of traction with consumers in the marketplace  It has been to date mostly launched in our premium tiers  so our tier 5  6  7 and    which is growing at a pretty good clip  I d say  we still have some issues on our lower tiers where we have    still a little more softness there  We are expanding our innovation  We have more exciting innovation that we re launching this year  and we re rolling that out across the business in diapers  And so  we feel really good about our position The birth rate has been down a little bit  19 versus  18  We expect it to probably be flat to down a little bit in this year as well  But we still think there s plenty of developed    market development opportunity in China  and we re still very early  I think  in the life cycle of our categories in China Olivia Tong    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Michael D  Hsu    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Ali Ali Dibadj    Sanford C  Bernstein   Co     AnalystHi  how are you  So I have a couple of    three questions  One is on your comments about constructive pricing  We ve    I asked this    earlier this morning too  but we ve kind of seen this movie before where there is sometimes these air pockets where pricing stays  that commodities rollover  so gross margins expand  offers the opportunity to invest in the category through advertising everything else  which is what your plan is for the year Michael D  Hsu    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYeah Ali Dibadj    Sanford C  Bernstein   Co     AnalystBut again  having seen this before  you ve seen it before as well  Often times  a quarter from now  maybe two quarters from now  you started seeing competition creep in from a pricing perspective and things get that worse  not that they get back  They just get a little bit worse than the plan  So how are you confident that this movie is not going to end the same way or have the same competitive pressure picking up over the next little while here and tactically how much notice do you get about that Michael D  Hsu    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean  the scenario that you paint or that possibility is always exists  And I think the overall is  we re going to remain competitive in the marketplace and will be competitive on price  However  I think maybe the emphasis is always for us is we feel really good about our innovation and we feel really good about our commercial or our marketing programs  And so  that s what we want to invest  And you may have covered categories that have commoditized  I ve worked in categories that people seeing that commoditized over time and that s a dead end  And so for me  I think we want to take the high road and build our categories we have  If you    our thesis is there s a lot of growth left in our categories in D E and in elevating our categories in developed markets  but to do that  you need to bring innovation and you need to give the consumer a good reason to buy  which is by creating more value through our products  So that s where our focus is We will be  however  competitive  but the other factor on pricing  I d say is also  if you look at it  we re still above our 2017 cost levels  And so  we re still    we still want our margins back to kind of where they are  We re not all the way back into the extent that we would like them  And then  the other side of it is that we are anticipating some pulp inflation in the back half of the year  So there is a lot of other factors going on  but our teams  I would say  have gotten sharper and more tuned with our revenue growth management capability to the market conditions  And so  we ll stay close to it  but we re going to run the play  which is the highroad play right now Ali Dibadj    Sanford C  Bernstein   Co     AnalystOkay  Okay  I m not    again my question you guys  I just wonder others follow that same highroad who are more private label prone or smaller or more private or whatever  Okay  I guess  we ll watch it  Second question of three is on free cash flow  looks like certainly for the year  it was down quite a bit  A lot of that was capex driven  Could you talk a little bit about    maybe Maria for you  can you talk a little bit about the drivers of free cash flow in 2019  how we should think about it for 2020 and in particular  the capex as a percent of sales still looking perhaps elevated Maria Henry    Chief Financial OfficerSure  The cash flow in the fourth quarter was actually strong at  924 million for the year as you call out  Operating cash flow was  2 7 billion and that s down from prior year  It s not    it s in line with our expectations  So it was a very planned for  As you know  we are funding the restructuring last year  this year  And so  we ve got elevated expenses coming up on capex  The big driver on operating cash flow  which we ve talked about before is that we had a big shift in working capital  particularly around payables  where in the fourth quarter of 2018  we had very high inflow from working capital  driven by payables timing  We basically had a pay that back out in the first quarter of 2019  and that affected the operating cash flow for the year  That was the big driver Encouragingly though  Ali  when I look at our cash flow from operations  we were up nicely year over year in the second half of 2019  We are up about 10   And the trends on working capital are positive  but that was true both in the third quarter and the fourth quarter  I d also call out    related to that  our cash conversion cycle was 10 days for the year  which was a day better than it was in the prior year and it was better than our expectations In terms of capex  capex was elevated in 2019 and it will be elevated again in 2020 as we work through the restructuring  And as you recall  we got when we announced the restructuring program that we were expecting incremental capex of  600 million to  700 million on that program  And  during the time of the supply chain activities  which is  19 and  20 on restructuring on a percent of sales  we ve got a pretty high number  I think it was 6 5  of sales or something like that  but we did say that coming out of the restructuring  our expectation is that capex will be 4  to 5  of sales and that is down from our historical model of 4 5  to 5 5  So a long answer  but I feel that  that cash flow for the year was good and as expected  Capex is in line with what we ve been talking about as we execute the restructuring Ali Dibadj    Sanford C  Bernstein   Co     AnalystOkay  So it s still going to ramp down after 2020  Okay  that s very helpful  Thanks for indulging me for my last question  We talk about China with a question earlier  but just more broadly  the emerging and developing markets for you only grew 3   That continues to be a slow down  I get the comp is tougher  but are there signs of improvement in that growth rate or should we continue to expect  kind of  again taking into account compares that we re talking about this low single digit type emerging market    emerging and developing market growth rate  Thank you Michael D  Hsu    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  hi  Yeah  I think we feel very good about our D E performance  I know it s slowed down sequentially a little bit in the fourth quarter  but if you look at the key markets  Brazil continues to do very well  We would say excellent performance in a tough market  China  I think the trends are improving  CEE  as Maria pointed out  20  growth on the year  So we feel good in our key markets  I think the big driver of the slowdown if you look at the fourth quarter was one  we re starting to cycle pricing in some key markets in Latin America  For example  in Brazil  I think our pricing on the front half was up double digits And so  we re starting to cycle that  and the other part of it is  as we mentioned  we ve got some softness due to some macro issues and competitive issues in what we would call South of Latin America  which is Peru  Bolivia and Chile  And you re probably aware of what s going on there  but there s a lot of social unrest  which is actually affecting some of our categories  And so  we re managing through that  We got a great team  They are very experienced in kind of working through this  and we ve got very solid plans to address at least some of the competitive issues in those markets Ali Dibadj    Sanford C  Bernstein   Co     AnalystOkay  thanks very much Paul Alexander    Investor RelationsThanks  Ali OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan Andrea Teixeira    JP Morgan Chase    AnalystHi  good morning Michael D  Hsu    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerAndrea  you re cutting up  We can barely hear you Andrea Teixeira    JP Morgan Chase    AnalystI m sorry  I don t know if you could hear the question  So my question is on emerging markets  So with China growing double digits  I think you just mentioned Brazil doing well  but lapping the double digit price increase  So is the other South of Latin America markets  which I understand they re much smaller  What are you embedding in terms of deceleration for developing and emerging into your guide or you just expecting it to continue to be in the low single digits into your 2   so that obviously embeds that developed markets would be about 1   So I would just want to kind of double click in your separate emerging markets and developed and developed markets And then just a clarification question on the reinvestment question  so I understand that you are trying    like you re saying like we have a lot of innovation  but according to our math  you re kind of reinvesting about  400 million on top of your base of SG A and already invested about    you already increased around  170 million  So I understand the breakdown in assumptions  but if you can break into the larger line items  including compensation  R D and advertisement into your guide  so that we can understand why it s capped into the mid single digit growth Paul Alexander    Investor RelationsSure  this is Paul here Andrea  There was several questions there  So I ll take the first one or two and then  we ll pass the investment questions over to Mike and Maria  On the outlook for 2020  in Developing and Emerging Markets  we don t have a hard and fast number to give you  given the several moving pieces in the business  But as Mike said  we re confident about the underlying trends in several of the markets  There is some increased volatility that we saw in the first    in the back half of 2019  We think that those have largely stabilized  but probably at a lower level  So as we enter 2020  that will be with us for a period of time  But overall  we would be looking to deliver a solid organic growth in Developing and Emerging Markets in 2020  In Developed Markets  in general  our expectation is unchanged from what we ve been delivering over time  which is modest growth Maria Henry    Chief Financial OfficerAnd then  on the between the lines outlook for 2020  we are expecting it to increase both in terms of dollars and as a percent of sales and that we expect to be driven by higher advertising as well as I d say secondarily capability investments  Just as a reminder  there is a few other moving pieces in SG A  We are expecting some modest benefits from restructuring  In 2020  it ll have the benefit of incentive compensation normalization  And then  going the other way  we ll have our normal labor and other cost inflation that runs through SG A  Beyond that  we re not providing a specific target for the level of increase  but we are anticipating that it will be a healthy level of increase Andrea Teixeira    JP Morgan Chase    AnalystOkay  thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs Paul Alexander    Investor RelationsGood morning  Jason Jason English    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHey  good morning folks  Thanks  Indecipherable  me and I appreciate it  And Happy Belated New Year  I wanted to come back to emerging markets because I m having a hard time footing the narrative with the numbers  the 3 points of organic  How much did Argentina add to that this quarter Michael D  Hsu    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerIt was slightly less than 2 points Jason English    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  So we ve got slightly north of 1 point is sort of underlying emerging market growth right now  And you re seeing China is up double digits  Central Eastern Europe growing like  20s  Brazil strong  Is it the declines in these sort of non core EMs  Are that substantial that they re weighing you down or were there growth figures you are giving us  so these markets for the annualized  not just a quarter  I m just having a hard time because I ve always view Brazil  Central and Eastern Europe and China is like chunky  And if they re growing  the EMs I thought would do better  So I m really having a hard time footing strength there  but really no growth kind of in aggregate Michael D  Hsu    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So again  I think it s  as you postured  which is a good growth out of those markets and I think a continued growth and a little softness and what I would term our other Latin America was probably the big chunk of that  It s actually probably a little more substantial or when you add it all up  then you might think  And then also K C Professional outside of North America has had lower numbers in the D E markets than what we would have anticipated and the same factors as we talked about with the volatility  but obviously  when we get the total numbers  that includes KCP as well as the consumer business Jason English    Goldman Sachs    AnalystYeah  Okay  All right  That s somewhat helpful  Thank you Michael D  Hsu    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Thanks  Jason OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup Paul Alexander    Investor RelationsGood morning  Wendy Wendy Nicholson    Citigroup    AnalystHi  just    good morning  Circling back on kind of line of questioning about the international markets  we talked about the margin internationally before and I know there s just a lot of structural lower pricing and whatnot  but just in terms of the longer term kind of over the next three to five years  how much will be international margins benefit from the restructuring and a lot of the restructuring you re doing is North America centered  but I m just wondering how long will it be until we can see real margin improvement in those international markets  Thanks Paul Alexander    Investor RelationsYeah  I mean    well  I would say we are planning for margin improvement over time  And I think there is a couple of different things  One  related to the restructuring  which gets us to better and more common assets across the world  especially in Personal Care  so that s going to be one factor  But the other piece is our strategy to elevate our categories  And so  we are going to see    we are expecting and planning for mixed premiumization and innovation that s going to drive more positive mix and margin over time  A good example of that would be China We feel great that we ve delivered substantial product improvement  Our gross margins are at record levels with that product improvement  So that s kind of a win win innovation in our minds Michael D  Hsu    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerAnd Wendy  you ll be able to see our geographic disclosures when we publish our 10 K in February  but I can preview it to say that our international margins in total were up somewhat in 2019 despite the volatility and the currency headwinds Wendy Nicholson    Citigroup    AnalystOkay  Because I m just thinking obviously to the extent of focus is on accelerating the growth there  so long as the margin gap is a significant as it is  It s actually a headwind to your margins  So I m just trying to balance that as I think about over the next few years  We d love to see you grow faster outside the US  but obviously going to come at a cost that you can t ramp up those margins as well Maria Henry    Chief Financial OfficerRight Wendy Nicholson    Citigroup    AnalystOkay  Second question just back on the North American business  are you surprised  I mean just given sort of the size of private label in some of your categories on    we are surprised that we haven t seen more promotional aggression on the part of private label  Do you think we should expect that in 2020 I mean  I guess  we ve been surprised not only because so many retailers are talking more about private label investments  but also in your categories  it seems like given the commodity environment  we re at pretty unique opportunity for some of those private label guys to get more aggressive on pricing  So what s your take on that  And is it just that consumers are really loyal to brands and innovation in your category all of a sudden  or is that a legitimate threat as we look at 2020 and the cost environment Michael D  Hsu    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I guess maybe the key thing for me is in general  we ve seen a little increase in private label throughout  19  Pricing particularly in tissue has not moved up  right  and so    maybe in some select pockets  but in general has not moved up at the same levels that the brands have  So that s one factor  I really don t expect  and wouldn t think would make sense to overly promote private label  mostly because of the reason that you probably surmised  which is    I don t believe consumers drive retail choice or their choice of retail outlet by because of private label  I think study after study  that concludes that they make choices based on national brands and they    and that s what drives that behavior  And so  I don t know that necessarily promoting on the private label side is a productive behavior In fact  obviously I have skin in the game here  but I would suggest that if they drive the right national brand strategy  I think that will help grow the retail business more effectively Wendy Nicholson    Citigroup    AnalystGot it  Terrific  Thanks so much Michael D  Hsu    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies Kevin Grundy    Jefferies    AnalystGood morning  everyone  Hey Mike  I wanted to come back to the topic you were kind of dancing around I guess asking a different ways  but with respect to gross margin  so your performance was fantastic as was Procter s this morning  Still seeing some pricing  so we ve been asking this from  OK  what a Procter move  sort of private label moves or so forth on promotion  But from a retailer s perspective  why wouldn t they be coming back to you guys now to the manufacturers and asking for some of this to be dealt back through trade promotion  They never want to take a price increase  right So now in the current environment now  why wouldn t    what s that the retailers sort of force the issue and lean on manufacturers to start dealing some of this back  And then I have a follow up Paul Alexander    Investor RelationsYeah  well  I think Kevin again  I still point out that we still had inflation in 2019  Our costs are still higher than they were in 2017  And so  when we say this inflationary impact has been multi year  our pricing hasn t fully recovered that  It s actually far from fully recovering that  So that s kind of my view from my chair on the pricing  On the other side of that  I think you need to talk to the retailers to get their views  but my personal side would be our discussions with retailers tend to be around how we re going to grow the category and that s what they re most interested in as long as we ve got the right plans with innovation and category support to drive category growth  That s really kind of where their focus is  And that s what most of our conversations are about these days Kevin Grundy    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  Thanks  Mike  I m really    a quick follow up to a question that was asked earlier  I think what investors  what analysts will try to figure out is the level of conservatism that s in your guidance versus how much investment  whether that s advertising and marketing or other areas    excuse me of opex that are more sort of locked and loaded  Can you help us think about that  because in the absence of kind of putting some parameters around that given the benefit that you re seeing from commodities that you re seeing from from FORCE that you re seeing from restructuring  it certainly looks conservative  And it s hard to envision advertising and marketing stepping up to a level that s implied So can you help us as best you can with the level of conservatism and flexibility  may be behind the competitive environment  Maybe kind of help us think about that  And that s it from me  Thank you Maria Henry    Chief Financial OfficerSure  What I would say is I think that we ve got a reasonable and balanced plan that we re shooting for in 2020  and we ve shared with you the primary assumptions that go into that  what I can also tell you coming up on my fifth year is that there are a lot of variables that happen that we can t accurately predict as we go into a year  We ve seen that happen on the downside a couple of years ago  a bit on the upside last year  And so  as we go through the year  we ll react to the environment that that we re in  but there is potential volatility on the commodity side  There is potential volatility on the currency side  We ve talked a lot about strong competition and competitive activity so far in this call  So there s a lot of moving pieces  And as we always do  we will make the decisions that we need to make during the year to deliver on the balanced model that we strive to achieve year on year Kevin Grundy    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  thank you both Paul Alexander    Investor RelationsThanks  Kevin OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Steve Stricker with UBS Steve Stricker    UBS    AnalystHi  good morning  I ve got a question for Mike and then a quick follow up for Maria  Mike  on your organic sales outlook for the full year  should we interpret that to mean the volume should improve from the rate it was in  19 or we should see absolute volume growth for the full year fiscal  20 and what specifically is driving that  I imagine you re going to say innovation  so how do we put the diaper innovation in the context for 2020 relative to how the special delivery diapers for Huggies did in  call it  2019 Michael D  Hsu    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  The organic outlook is 2  and that really reflects our expectation for both the category and then  obviously our performance as we cycle the pricing  the volume in our plan is absolute growth  Again  we re expecting balanced growth from volume mix and still a little bit of pricing  Steve  It s innovation  I probably would say that the flip on volume is not going to be as daunting as you might perceive because I would say our underlying volume performance in 2019 was very good  And what I mean by that is  obviously if you re going to take pricing  you re going to have a negative volume effect in accordance to whatever you think your elasticity is And so  we saw that  but I do think we had really good underlying initiatives  whether they were driving distribution in new categories or new markets in different countries or launching innovation and increasing advertising  We saw the volumes come underlying that offset most of where some of the price elasticity effect and actually more than we had anticipated  So we think    we ve got very    we had very good execution in 2019  And I don t think the effect in  19 was related to the elasticity impacts were less than we expected  It was more related to execution of volume initiatives were better than we had expected Steve Stricker    UBS    AnalystOkay Paul Alexander    Investor RelationsDid that help Steve Stricker    UBS    AnalystIt does  For Maria  just quick follow up to all these question  did you give an operating cash flow number  If it was  2 7 billion in 2019  should that be a little better    a little worse in 2020  And then on the commodity piece  if it was  60 million deflationary in the fourth quarter  but the full year outlook is  50 million to  200 million  Can you help us think through what is basically baked into your commodity outlook assumption  Thank you Maria Henry    Chief Financial OfficerOn cash from operations  we are expecting that to be up in 2020  And on commodities  we are expecting fiber to start to tick up  particularly in the back half of 2020  which is built into our assumption of the  50 million to  200 million for next year OperatorThank you  At this time  we have no further questions in the queue Michael D  Hsu    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerGreat  We appreciate everyone s questions today and have a good day  Thank you very much Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  46 minutesCall participants Paul Alexander    Investor RelationsMaria Henry    Chief

126388,347903,KMB,Kimberly Clark Predicts a Growth Slowdown Ahead,news,"Kimberly Clark  NYSE KMB  shareholders have had to endure mixed results from their investment lately  While the consumer staples giant posted faster growth and reduced costs in 2019  its rebound trailed the broader market  and looked weak in comparison to Procter   Gamble s  NYSE PG  expansion 
The gap between the two businesses  which compete directly in areas like diapers and paper products  continued into early 2020  In fact  in earnings results posted Thursday  Kimberly Clark revealed operating and financial metrics that all suggest it is struggling to keep ahead of major changes in the global selling environment  

Small steps forward
Kimberly Clark s organic sales improved by 3  in the fiscal fourth quarter  which translated into a 4  gain for the full 2019 year  That result was ahead of management s initial outlook  and represented a solid acceleration from the 1  uptick it logged in 2018  Executives noted that rebound  saying in a press release that the results  capped off a year of excellent progress   
But the company s growth results look weaker in context  Rival P G has been growing at about a 6  rate over the last six months  for example  and its sales gains are being driven by increasing volumes  which suggest rising market share  Kimberly Clark  meanwhile  is relying entirely on price increases to deliver its growth  This quarter was no different  as volumes declined 1  across its portfolio 
Stronger earnings
The news was a bit better on the financial side of the business  where falling input prices and cost cuts combined to support significant profit gains  Adjusted earnings jumped in the fourth quarter on what management described as  strong margin improvements   That boost delivered full year adjusted profit growth of 4   near the top end of the guidance that CEO Mike Hsu and his team had issued 
Cash flow declined a bit  which marked another area where Kimberly Clark and P G are trending apart in recent quarters  Kimberly Clark also trailed its larger consumer products peer in core profitability metrics like operating margin and in the scale of its earnings rebound  P G is expanding its core profits at a double digit pace right now 
Looking out
Kimberly Clark s initial 2020 outlook syncs up well with the rebound path that Hsu and his team have been predicting for investors for at least the last year  Yet it s hard to view its expected growth rate as anything but disappointing 
The company sees organic sales gains slowing to 2  this year  while P G is predicting a nearly 5  spike  Adjusted profit is set to rise by about the same 4  as last year  thanks to the combination of cost cuts and rising prices  P G is growing earnings at almost triple that rate today 
Looking ahead  investors will be watching for signs that Kimberly Clark is beginning to close that performance gap  But with its sales volumes holding at or slightly below flat  there s no indication of that rebound having started ",2020-01-26,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pn25-,2067967
126389,347904,KMB,Kimberly Clark Talks About Its Biggest Price Hike in a Decade,news,"Kimberly Clark  NYSE KMB  investors had modest expectations heading into the company s fourth quarter earnings report  The consumer staples specialist had been struggling with below market growth through most of 2019  during what management was referring to as the first of a three year transformation period for the business 
On Thursday  the company revealed operating results that kept it significantly behind rival Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  in key growth and cash flow metrics  Yet Kimberly Clark also had good news to report about its profitability outlook and its progress toward becoming a much stronger business by 2022  Below we ll look at a few takeaways from those results  as highlighted in management s conference call with Wall Street analysts 

Pushing through major price increases
CEO Mike Hsu said   Our team has maintained strong focus on price realization and executed their plans well throughout the year  As a result  pricing was up 4   And that s the highest realization we ve achieved in a decade and it was necessary because of the multi year inflation that we faced  
Kimberly Clark s growth rate has trailed the wider industry and its main rivals  Organic sales rose by just 3  for the fourth quarter and 4  for the full fiscal 2019  P G grew 6  over the same period  Kimberly Clark also underperformed with respect to sales volumes  which declined and left nearly all of its growth as coming from higher prices 
The good news is that the consumer staples company successfully moved higher prices through most of its portfolio without sacrificing too much in terms of volumes  That metric dipped 1  overall  mainly because its tissue segment slumped 5  as prices surged by 7   Executives said that volume result was better than they expected at the start of 2019 
Getting more profitable
CFO Maria Henry said   Adjusted operating margin was 17 8   up 80 basis points  and adjusted operating profit grew 5   Operating margins were up nicely in all three business segments  led by consumer tissue   
A portfolio wide price hike can do wonders to your profitability  but Kimberly Clark also got big contributions from its cost cutting program and its significant efficiency initiatives  These factors helped push gross profit margin up to 35  of sales in 2019 from 33 2  a year earlier  Operating margin also inched higher  up to nearly 18  of sales from 17   despite increased marketing spending 
Success in these areas allowed adjusted core earnings to rise 4  for the year even as reported net sales were flat 
Projecting stronger results
 Our  2020  plan is consistent with our balanced approach to value creation  includes higher growth investments and aligns with our  transformation initiative s  financial objectives   Hsu said 
Kimberly Clark s 2  sales growth outlook appears weak given that P G is projecting a 4  increase for its current fiscal year  Still  management detailed a few projections that imply better results as the year progresses  Specifically  Hsu and his team are calling for stable market share and for volume trends to improve in the back half of the year so that overall volume returns to modest growth in 2020 
Executives say they are confident that the investments they are making in areas like innovation and marketing will support more robust sales gains  but shareholders might have to wait until later in the year before seeing concrete evidence of this rebound  In the meantime  they can collect more cash returns from the recently hiked dividend and Kimberly Clark s stock repurchase program  These channels together are expected to produce a tenth straight year of over  2 billion in direct cash returns in 2020 ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pnxqg,2069453

126424,347939,KMB,Kimberly Clark Needs to Grow Sales  Will Its Strategic Plan Do the Trick ,news,"Kimberly Clark  NYSE KMB  has been involved in the manufacture and marketing of a wide range of personal care products for the past 148 years  The company has a long track record of delivering quality products and  according to the company  holds No  1 or 2 brand share in 80 countries  with iconic brands such as Huggies  Cottonelle  Kleenex  and Scott  
The company has a long track record of stellar brand recognition  Yet  of late  sales growth has been lackluster for the company  with flat year over year sales performance for 2017 and less than a 1  year over year improvement for 2018  Costs have been rising relentlessly  however  with gross margin declining from 36 6  in 2016 to a low of 30 3  in 2018   The company is scheduled to report its 2019 numbers on Jan  23  
Kimberly Clark delivered a share price return of close to 2 5 times in the past 10 years  while rival Procter   Gamble only managed to double its share price  making Kimberly Clark the better choice for a consumer staples stock over that time frame  However  P G managed to report a 7  year over year sales growth in its recent Q1 2020 report  Growing sales have been elusive for Kimberly Clark  even as it embarks on a global restructuring program and a new strategic plan 
Kimberly Clark needs to spend money where it matters to deliver quality products with desirable features after intensive research and development  Though the company has committed to spending more  the details of this spending have not been clearly communicated to investors  leaving me unclear on how the company plans to rekindle sales growth 

The plans
In early 2018  Kimberly Clark released a Global Restructuring Program  GRP  that  in a nutshell  was supposed to reduce costs and put that money into marketing and research and development for its core product portfolio  The supply chain would be simplified and 10 manufacturing facilities would be closed or sold as part of a program to exit or divest low margin businesses  
The idea was to alter the company s cost base to make it permanently lower  while also exiting unprofitable businesses that were sucking up time  resources  and cash  This would complement the company s existing FORCE  focused on reducing costs everywhere  initiative in delivering sustainable cost savings  Total expenditure of around  1 5 billion to  1 7 billion was estimated at the time  along with around  600 million to  700 million of additional capital expenditure for brand building purposes  By the end of Q3 2019  restructuring charges of around  1 25 billion had been incurred  but the program had also generated cumulative savings for  260 million for the company  
In early 2019  Kimberly Clark announced its Strategic Plan 2022    the year the company will celebrate its 150 year anniversary  The key pillars of this plan include growing sales in line with  or ahead of  category growth rates  as well as driving supply chain improvements through FORCE to further control spending  Sales growth initiatives include focusing more on core brands and products  targeting developing and emerging markets  and leveraging digital marketing and e commerce 
The company plans to spend around 4  to 5  of net sales on capital expenditures while returning the rest to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks  The stock s current dividend yield stands at around 2 9  
How s it going so far 
GRP 2018 has delivered some positive results thus far  Gross margin for the first nine months of 2019 has improved to 32 2   lower commodity prices played a role in this   while marketing  research  and general expenses have declined by 8  year over year 
However  in terms of the progress toward Strategic Plan 2022  the company has not registered any growth in its top line for the first nine months of 2019  In the personal care segment  its largest segment   third quarter sales jumped 2  thanks to increased prices and volume  In the consumer tissue segment  the company s next largest segment  sales rose 1  as prices increased and volume declined  There was a negative currency impact on both segments  
It appears growth may not come easily for Kimberly Clark  even though it has embarked on strategic initiatives and launched a three year plan  While the GRP 2018 has indeed trimmed expenses and excess fat  reducing expenses can only do so much for a company  There comes a point where expenses may already be reduced to the bone  leaving the company with no other options for net income growth other than to boost sales 
Trading at a price to earnings ratio around 24  the shares seem to be pricing in sales growth that has not come through yet  The company needs to shed its overemphasis on cost reduction and  instead  start to refocus on growing sales volumes with superior products ",2020-01-18,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pjpi-,2062609
126425,347940,KMB,Kimberly Clark Earnings  What to Watch,news,"Kimberly Clark  NYSE KMB  stock sat out much of the stock market rally in 2019  with shares underperforming both the wider market and the returns of chief rival Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG   The consumer products giant posted sluggish sales growth even as P G s expansion pace set a multi year high 
This week  Kimberly Clark has a chance to change that investing narrative by closing the operating gap with its peer and demonstrating that its transformation plan is finally starting to show concrete financial benefits  With that bigger picture in mind  let s look at the metrics to watch when the owner of the Kleenex tissue and Huggies diaper brands announces its earnings results on Thursday  Jan  23 

Market share checkup
Kimberly Clark s last earnings report showed that it had a significant challenge ahead to break its multi year streak of market share losses  Organic sales growth slowed to 4  in the fiscal third quarter from 5  in the prior quarter  At the same time  P G s expansion pace set a modern record at a scorching 7   Both companies raised their growth outlooks in late October  but Kimberly Clark s boost still leaves it trailing its rival and the wider industry 
The good news is that the consumer goods company is taking the challenge seriously  Another clue to that aggressive approach came in early January when Kimberly Clark announced a shakeup in its international management ranks 
CEO Mike Hsu will likely discuss that transition on Thursday in terms of market share goals in emerging markets like China  Yet the concrete answers in this week s results will come from metrics like pricing and volume  which have been weak lately  Faster growth can t occur without an improvement to last quarter s 1  volume decline 
Earnings trends
The picture has been much brighter on the financial front  as falling commodity costs combined with savings from the restructuring plan to boost earnings  Operating profit last quarter jumped 8  to  859 million and cash flow soared to  886 million from  692 million a year ago  The company is taking a meaningful step toward P G s market leading profit generation  but still has a way to go 

KMB Operating Income  TTM  data by YCharts
These wins have allowed Kimberly Clark to direct more cash toward direct shareholder returns  with dividends and stock repurchase spending on pace to reach  2 2 billion for the full 2019 year  Still  investors this week will want to see evidence that the company can use its cash in ways that can speed up long term growth  whether through marketing  supply chain upgrades  or innovative product and packaging development 
Looking forward
Investors will focus on Kimberly Clark s official 2020 outlook this week  and any big movements in the stock might be tied to those comments  Assuming it reaches its updated 2019 targets  the company will have posted roughly 4  growth to mark a solid improvement over the prior year s 1  uptick 
We ll find out on Thursday whether Hsu and his team are expecting another acceleration in 2020  Kimberly Clark s new outlook will also show whether the company might again lose market share to P G  which currently is projecting organic sales gains of as much as 5  and core earnings growth of between 4  and 9  ",2020-01-19,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pj-gm,2062800

participants provide batteries and lighting products  while the space includes food store retailers operating superstores  convenience stores  supermarkets and drugstores Let s take a look at the three major industry themes As the industry participants mainly provide essentials used in daily lives  demand for most of the products remains fairly stable  Thus  consumer product players are focused on concerted revenue boosting initiatives to squeeze out more from their operations  While demand is relatively stable  competition posed by cheaper alternatives is a concern  Industry players are focused on optimizing portfolio through buyouts and divestitures  which enable them to increase focus on areas with higher growth potential   Also  innovation in areas that are witnessing increasing consumer interest such as organic products is adding to portfolio strength  Companies are also adopting prudent pricing strategies to gain market traction and battle input cost challenges  Several players are enhancing their digital and e commerce capacities to keep pace with evolving consumer patterns  While these endeavors act as major tailwinds  the related costs keep margins under pressure  Also  higher advertising and other growth related investments are threat to margins  Nevertheless  solid cost containment and restructuring plans by companies should offer some respite Zacks

126475,347990,KMB,Venezuela Tells Firms to Open Accounts in Russia and Turkey,news," Bloomberg     The government of Venezuela s Nicolas Maduro told a group of executives representing about 50 consumer companies to open bank accounts in Russia  Turkey  China and India and to begin building relationships with suppliers in those countries  according to two people with direct knowledge of the meeting 
The Finance Ministry will host workshops so that executives learn how to open the foreign accounts  one person said  The companies were also warned that attempts to disrupt production to destabilize Maduro s regime would trigger reprisal from the state 
In the meeting called by Vice President of Economy Tareck El Aissami and Interior Commerce Minister William Contreras at the presidential palace in Caracas on Monday  the executives were told not to raise prices since inflation has allegedly begun to decelerate  the two people said  asking not to be named speaking about a private meeting  A model of price increases tied to the country s official exchange rate is being studied  the government officials said 
Press departments at the government ministries didn t immediately reply to requests for comment on the meeting 
Maduro s government is scrambling to try to work around U S  sanctions and asset freezes that are crippling state finances and curtailing Venezuela s ability to operate in the global financial system  Restricted access to raw materials  price controls and a lack of dollars to import goods have already prompted multinational companies to leave the troubled nation  such as Kellogg Co  and Kimberly Clark Corp  NYSE KMB  
The sudden emergence of Juan Guaido  the opposition head of the National Assembly  and the global support he s received recognizing him as the legitimate leader of Venezuela  has given business leaders and investors renewed optimism that an end to the two decade socialist regime could be near  Still  Maduro continues to control nearly all levers of the state at home 
Maduro continues to enjoy international support from China  Russia and Turkey while India has become a key buyer of its crude oil that was previously shipped to the U S

126482,347997,KMB,Can Kimberly Clark  KMB  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Kimberly Clark  KMB   This company  which is in the Zacks Consumer Products   Staples industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
When looking at the last two reports  this maker of consumer products such as Huggies diapers and Kleenex tissue has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 4 81   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Kimberly Clark came out with earnings of  1 67 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 64 per share  representing a surprise of 1 83   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 54 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 66 per share  delivering a surprise of 7 79  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Kimberly Clark  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Kimberly Clark currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 04   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on October 22  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-kimberlyclark-kmb-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200470377,200470377

The pilot was officially announced on Tuesday at an event in Cannes  France  The experiment will expand IBM s collaboration with Unilever launched a few months ago 
Mediaocean CEO Bill Wise said that the test might help the technology win some real use case amid the current hype that is mostly fueled by speculative conferences with little results  He expects that the pilot may continue with an extensive beta test in early 2019 

 I think by the end of next year we will have a fully functioning scalable solution that will be adopted by the majority of the industry   Wise said 

The consortium will attract many media companies  publishes  demand side platforms  and measurement firms like IAS and Oracle s Moat 
Wise revealed that the distributed ledger technology  DLT   as blockchain is also called  would help cut about 60  in costs that go to intermediaries  
According to Babs Rangaiah  who is partner global marketing at IBM iX and a former employee at Unilever  the initial members were chosen to avoid competitive crossings  In light of this  Unilever can veto any new member as it has the status of a participant in the first round of the pilot 

 We were doing design thinking workshops  and having competitive brands in the room would make it less open and transparent   Rangaiah said  However  in the longer term  competitors might be able to join the blockchain project  he added 

The pilot  which is to start in July 2018  will be built on top of Mediaocean s campaign management platform  which currently handles over  140 billion in annual spending across multiple media firms  The blockchain system will track the whole circuit of an advertiser s media dollar movement  The technology will record all media transactions  from purchase order issuance to payments

126576,348091,KMB,Kimberly Clark  KMB  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Kimberly Clark  KMB  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of consumer products such as Huggies diapers and Kleenex tissue is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 63 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 5  
Revenues are expected to be  4 59 billion  down 0 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 49  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Kimberly Clark 
For Kimberly Clark  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 31  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Kimberly Clark will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Kimberly Clark would post earnings of  1 54 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 66  delivering a surprise of  7 79  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Kimberly Clark appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kimberlyclark-kmb-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200440177,200440177

126599,348114,KMB,Multinational firms dumping Venezuela operations in fire sales,news,"By Corina Pons and Eyanir Chinea CARACAS  Reuters    Multinational companies are selling their Venezuelan operations at hefty discounts   or even giving them away   as they to seek to escape the OPEC nation s soaring inflation and chronic supply shortages  Six firms  including  General Mills   NYSE GIS  and oil producer Harvest Natural Resources  have sold operations for as little as half their assessed value on the companies  books  according to securities filings and interviews with a dozen people knowledgeable about the deals  One company  U S  autoparts maker Dana  last year sold its debt laden Venezuela operations to a local buyer for no cash compensation  Two multinational corporations   Clorox and Kimberly Clark  NYSE KMB    chose instead to abandon their operations here  Sell offs by foreign companies could further isolate Venezuela s economy  which is already reeling from low oil prices and an unraveling socialist system  The fire sale trend will likely accelerate as the crisis continues to cripple the local operations of more multinational firms  according to two private sector sources familiar with similar deals in the works   Firms acquiring such distressed operations  however  could reap huge gains if the country s economy improves  Corimon   a Caracas firm best known for production of paint   in May purchased the local operations of Bridgestone Corp  the world s largest tire maker  Corimon will continue to produce tires under the Firestone brand  Carlos Gill  president of Corimon s holding company  declined to disclose the sale terms but called the timing of the purchase  an opportune moment  for his company   Bridgestone declined to comment  The sold off operations  in some cases  were all but defunct before the deals because of chronic shortages of raw materials ranging from sugar to steel bars  as well as triple digit inflation and difficulty exchanging a crashing local currency for dollars   A company that isn t operating is a corpse  and the vultures start to circle it   said Juan Pablo Olalquiaga  president of Venezuelan industry association Conindustria  SOLD  FOR NO CONSIDERATION  President Nicolas Maduro has blamed the country s woes on an  economic war  launched by U S  business elites and encouraged by Washington politicians  Maduro has said companies are intentionally slowing production or hoarding goods to destabilize his government  The Venezuelan government s Information Ministry did not respond to requests for comment  For years  Venezuela operations generated major revenue for Fortune 500 companies because high oil prices allowed the government to sell subsidized dollars through its exchange control system  boosting companies  local buying power  But the 2014 oil price crash left Venezuela short of dollars because the country depends on oil for almost all its foreign exchange   More companies are deciding the country s challenges now outweigh any benefits  General Mills   owner of locally popular Diablitos Underwood deviled ham   reported in a filing earlier this year that it had taken a  38 million pre tax loss on the sale of its local unit to an undisclosed third party  Negotiations dragged on for nine months as the economy tanked  forcing General Mills to steadily lower the price  according to two sources with direct knowledge of the talks  General Mills did not disclose the sale price and declined to comment to Reuters   Insurer Liberty Mutual said in statement last year that it was selling its local affiliate  Seguros Caracas  to a local entrepreneur  Humberto Gil  One source familiar with the deal described the arrangement as a  gift    Gil did not respond to requests for comment on the sale  which still needs approval from Venezuela s insurance regulator  Liberty Mutual did not respond to requests for comment  In 2014  Danish conglomerate The East Asiatic Company  EAC  sold its Venezuelan food business  Plumrose  to Liechtenstein based Valartis Opportunities Fund  Neither company responded to requests for comment  U S  auto parts firm Dana said in a 2015 filing that it had sold its local affiliate  for no consideration  to a Venezuelan firm called Manufacturing and Logistics Solutions  While auto sales soared during the oil boom era of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez  they dropped 80 percent in 2014 as Venezuela s economy ran into hard times   Dana sold the company for no payment  though it did secure an agreement that Dana would continue to supply raw materials and that the buyer would assume debts    After 49 years here  Dana couldn t exactly walk away from the company   said Jose Hernandez  who was on the board of directors of Dana s local unit and stayed on after the sale  WRITING OFF VENEZUELA Some companies did decide to walk away  an unusual move  Despite mounting losses  companies rarely shut down businesses in Venezuela because they can face government accusations of economic sabotage or have managers imprisoned  But Cleaning supplies company Clorox and personal hygiene products manufacturer Kimberly Clark shuttered their operations as their facilities nearly ground to a halt for lack of raw materials  Clorox  which left in 2014  said in a statement at the time that its Venezuela business was  no longer viable   Kimberly Clark suspended operations this year  citing inability to obtain raw materials or hard currency  Both were taken over by the Venezuelan government and have resumed operations under state control  Jorge Arreaza  Vice President at the time  accused Clorox of setting an  evil example  by leaving  Labor Minister Oswaldo Vera said  Kimberly Clark  threw  thousands of workers onto the street   Both companies declined further comment on their Venezuela exit  Other companies are writing down the value of their Venezuela operations through an accounting mechanism known a deconsolidation  which could signal that more sell offs are in the offing   The maneuver  already used by more than a dozen multinationals  involves a one time write off of the entire value of a company s subsidiaries  It is meant to avoid a constant trickle of balance sheet losses caused by repeatedly slashing the worth of assets that are valued in Venezuelan currency   It also creates incentives for Venezuelan buyers to put in bids for local factories and other assets  Bridgestone  before selling its Venezuela operations to Corimon in May  deconsolidated its Venezuela operations in 2015 and reported an associated loss of  350 million  Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co and Oreo cookie manufacturer  Mondelez International Inc   NASDAQ MDLZ  are among those who have written off their assets because of severe operational difficulties   Ford told Reuters it remains  hopeful that the government will resolve local issues  and we can then begin to support the Venezuelan people with additional production   Mondelez said it would continue to manufacture products  to the extent that we can locally fund operations and access necessary materials and labor   GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION Last month s sale of the Venezuela operations of Harvest Natural Resources offered a rare opportunity for local investors to gain a foothold in the Venezuela oil industry  which is dominated by state run firm PDVSA and large foreign energy companies   PDVSA has for years been delaying payment to business partners  including Houston based Harvest  Struggling to make up those losses  Harvest in 2013 negotiated a  400 million asset sale with Petroandina Resources Corp  a unit of Argentina s Pluspetrol Resources Corp  according to a Harvest filing from March  Harvest Natural Resources said in an August filing that Venezuelan government blocked the deal  Oil Minister Eulogio Del Pino told Reuters in 2015 the government rejected the sale because the buyers did not have sufficient financing capacity  Harvest declined to comment  but the company said in its filing that the deal s failure made clear that the government would not approve acquisitions by buyers based outside Venezuela   The company in October ended up successfully selling its operations to Delta Petroleum  which is owned by Venezuelan businessman Oswaldo Cisneros   Cisneros did not respond to requests for comment  
Principally known as a telecom magnate  Cisneros is making his first forays in to the oil business this year   and got a considerably better deal that what Petroandina negotiated  according to Harvest filings  Cisneros acquired the assets for 143 2 million  including legal fees and settling of Harvest debts  or about a third of what Argentina s Pluspetrol had agreed to pay ",2016-11-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/multinational-firms-dumping-venezuela-operations-in-fire-sales-440738,440738

Why Low Volatility Products Are Set to Rule 
Of late  geopolitical tensions between Iran and the United States flared up after officials from both countries said Iran downed a U S  military drone near the Strait of Hormuz  In any case  both parties have been at loggerheads for about a year  read    
Most recently  President Donald Trump announced that the United States will levy  major  incremental sanctions on Iran in order to prevent it from procuring nuclear weapons  It followed the announcement by Iran that it  on its nuclear program 
U S  China relations are also sour  Just before the G 20 meet where Trump and China s premiere Xi are supposed to talk about trade  five additional  purchasing U S  made components  Analysts believe that chances of a more comprehensive deal appear far off 
Investors should also note that stocks are near record highs amid dovish Fed comments  So  if anything negative comes out of the upcoming U S  China meeting and U S  Iran relations  global equities may skid due to overvaluation and low volatility  defensive plays may win again in the second half of the year

126650,348165,KMB,Are You Looking For A Top Momentum Pick  Why Kimberly Clark  KMB  Is A Great Choice,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Kimberly Clark  KMB   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions

Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for KMB that show why this maker of consumer products such as Huggies diapers and Kleenex tissue shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For KMB  shares are up 2 03  over the past week while the Zacks Consumer Products   Staples industry is down 0 46  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 3 58  compares favorably with the industry s 1 38  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Shares of Kimberly Clark have increased 9 44  over the past quarter  and have gained 35 4  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 3 76  and 9 3   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to KMB s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  KMB is currently averaging 1 443 172 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with KMB 
Over the past two months  2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost KMB s consensus estimate  increasing from  6 65 to  6 71 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period

126729,348244,KMB,Kimberly Clark  KMB  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q1 Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Kimberly Clark  KMB  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 22  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of consumer products such as Huggies diapers and Kleenex tissue is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 55 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 4  
Revenues are expected to be  4 49 billion  down 5 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Kimberly Clark 
For Kimberly Clark  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 76  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Kimberly Clark will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Kimberly Clark would post earnings of  1 68 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 60  delivering a surprise of  4 76  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Kimberly Clark appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kimberlyclark-kmb-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q1-release-200406815,200406815

the fourth quarter reporting cycle reflects the companies  full year performances  However  we note that the Zacks  sector has been somewhat troubled over the past year  by hurdles like elevated input

While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of consumer products such as Huggies diapers and Kleenex tissue is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 68 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7  
Revenues are expected to be  4 46 billion  down 2 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3 44  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Kimberly Clark 
For Kimberly Clark  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 70  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Kimberly Clark will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Kimberly Clark would post earnings of  1 64 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 71  delivering a surprise of  4 27  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Kimberly Clark appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kimberlyclark-kmb-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200376216,200376216

126805,348320,KMB,Dividend Growth Stocks In Stealth Bear Market  Kimberly Clark Corp  Part 2 ,opinion,"Introduction
In part 1 of this multi part series  I discussed how several blue chip dividend growth stocks have already entered a bear market 
Therefore  I thought it would be helpful to provide FAST Graphs Analyze Out Loud videos on several dividend growth stocks that have corrected from high valuation levels to more reasonable levels  My first research candidate was General Mills Inc  NYSE GIS   with this article I will be covering Kimberly Clark  NYSE KMB   The following slide summarizes their key product lines  And the second slide highlights management s optimism about the future growth potential of the company 
FAST Graphs Analyze Out Loud Video  Kimberly Clark
Kimberly Clark s stock price has fallen more than 20  since February 2017  However  as I intend to illustrate in the following Analyze Out Loud video  nothing fundamentally has really changed with the company  I made a similar statement when I presented General Mills in my previous article and received some pushback in the comment thread  Consequently  I offer the following clarification that might help readers and viewers understand what I m suggesting 
In 2016  Kimberly Clark was extremely overvalued  and it entered 2018 still overvalued but not at the extreme level it was in 2016  Thanks to the correction  this quality consumer staples company now offers investors a dividend yield exceeding 3 8   But most importantly  growth expectations going forward are more of the same and consistent with the company s historical achievements 
On the other hand  this is not the same as saying that every year will be the same as every other year  That is rarely if ever true with any company  Although Kimberly Clark is far from what I would classify as a cyclical company  it does have years where operating performance is better than others and years when it is worse  That is normal and is very unlikely to change with a consumer staples company like Kimberly Clark  Therefore  and to clarify  market value has changed dramatically over the last couple years but the company s intrinsic value remains at historical norms 

Summary and Conclusions
Kimberly Clark is a blue chip dividend growth stock and Dividend Champion that has increased its dividend for 46 consecutive years  As such  I offer it as a dividend income option and not necessarily as an opportunity to beat the market  This idea that every stock must beat the market is one that I find quite na ve  Investors invest in fixed income investments such as CDs and bonds without any expectation or goal of beating the market  Instead  they invest in these instruments because of their safety and the opportunity to generate a reliable income stream 
Nevertheless  in the case of Kimberly Clark  I am quite confident that it will produce a greater level of dividend income than the market  Moreover  if purchased at an attractive valuation  it is also likely to produce a respectable level of capital appreciation  As it is with most research candidates that I offer  it s up to the individual reader to decide whether or not the candidate meets their own personal goals  risk tolerances and objectives 
In my next article  Part 3  I will cover 3M  a Dividend Champion and Dividend Aristocrat that has increased its dividend for 60 consecutive years

126806,348321,KMB,3M Company  It Didn t Take a Crystal Ball to See That It Was Overvalued  Part 3  ,opinion,"Introduction
Regular readers of my work will attest to the fact that I am an avid proponent of valuation  So much so  that I cannot recall writing an article where I didn t discuss the importance of only investing in a stock when it was fairly valued  or better yet   undervalued  This obsession with valuation inspired one reader to dub me  Mr  Valuation   Frankly  it is a mantle that I wear proudly  I bring this up for an important reason  Long running bull markets  like we ve been in since the end of the Great Recession  are very difficult markets for value oriented investors to navigate 
The reasons are simple and straightforward  First  it is very difficult to find attractively valued stocks when investor sentiment is wildly optimistic  Rising stock prices lead to investor overconfidence which often further leads to complacency  Consequently  valuations based on fundamentals  even when they reach dangerous levels  are easily ignored  Rationalizations overtake logic  therefore  bull markets can persist far beyond reason 
This exuberant environment is a scourge to value investors like yours truly  As a result  I have often lamented to clients that I live in money manager hell  At precisely the time when clients are lavishing me with compliments  the height of bull markets   I find myself in a state of what can only be described as depression  All I see is danger  while all clients see are the recent profits even when they are unjustified by fundamentals 
However  reality inevitably takes its toll  Unfortunately  the  when  is rarely predictable but inevitable nevertheless  Consequently  selling overvalued stocks that have performed far above what fundamentals dictate creates client unrest and even reprimands  even though it s the right thing to do  This leads me to sharing what I found to be fascinating comments on an article I read about 3M Company  NYSE MMM  while conducting research for this article  I will provide excerpts of these comments  but the authors will remain anonymous 
To me  this first comment was both on the money  and perhaps the most interesting   Same company it was 3 months ago  You should be buying now  
This comment led to a second comment that I also considered credible   Correction  you should have been selling 3 months ago  
However  a third comment was the inspiration for the title of this article  and I believe speaks to what I have written above   You realize both could be true  right  Anyone with a crystal ball might have sold 3 months ago and could be buying now  I personally don t have a crystal ball  so I ll just stay long and sleep well  
The Importance and Benefit of Being Grounded in the Principles of Valuation
In my opinion  possessing a firm grasp and understanding of fundamental valuation principles is as close to having a crystal ball as investors can get  Admittedly  understanding valuation will not serve as a perfect short term market timing tool  but nothing ever has  will  or can  However  understanding the principles of fair valuation will empower investors towards making sound and prudent long term investing decisions  But most importantly  and in the same vein  understanding valuation can help prevent investors from making obvious mistakes 
On the other hand  sensible investors should also recognize that calculating fair valuation precisely is not possible  There are many nuances to ascertaining fair value  This simply means that there is no one size fits all valuation metric or equation  Consequently  when dealing with valuation  it s enough to be essentially correct  Part of the reason for this is that valuation is really a measurement of rational ranges of value  Stated more directly  it s rarely about a precise P E ratio or a precise price to cash flow ratio  etc  Instead  valuation is best thought of as an array of prudent measurements  Warren Buffett once stated this perfectly when he said   It is better to be approximately right than precisely wrong  
3M Company  FAST Graphs Analyze out Loud Video
3M is a perfect example of a blue chip Dividend Aristocrat company where Mr  Market has a long history of valuing it at a higher multiple of earnings than other lesser quality companies with similar fundamentals  On the other hand  the correlation between price and operating cash flow for this Dividend Aristocrat is most profound  Consequently  with the following FAST Graphs analyze out loud video  I intend to demonstrate that 3M is better valued based on operating cash flows than it is based on operating or even GAAP earnings  When it comes to valuing a business  there is more than one way to skin a cat 

Summary and Conclusions
As illustrated in the video  3M was clearly overvalued in 2017 and the beginning of 2018  Since that time  and because of its high valuation  the company s stock price has fallen approximately 20  off its high set in late January 2018  However  even after such a precipitous drop  I would currently consider the company fully valued  To be clear  I do not believe it is overvalued any longer  but it is not yet a bargain either  On the other hand  this high quality blue chip Dividend Aristocrat might be worth keeping a careful eye on  For those that are already long the stock  I would rate it a hold

126807,348322,KMB,Top Analyst Reports For Merck  Occidental Petroleum   Capital One Financial,opinion,"Thursday  June 7  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Merck  NYSE MRK   Occidental Petroleum  OXY  and Capital One Financial  COF   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Buy ranked Merck s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry year to date  gaining  10  versus a loss of  4 0   The Zacks analyst thinks Merck s new products like Keytruda  Lynparza and Bridion should continue to contribute meaningfully to the top line in 2018  
Keytruda sales are gaining strong momentum with approval for additional indications especially in the first line lung cancer setting as it is the only anti PD 1 approved in this setting  Its Animal Health unit is also strong and remains a core growth driver for Merck  
Meanwhile  Merck will continue to focus on cost cutting initiatives to drive the bottom line  However  generic competition for several drugs and pricing pressure will continue to be overhangs on the top line  Rising competitive pressure on the diabetes franchise and on products like Isentress  HIV   Zepatier  HCV  and Zostavax  vaccine  will remain headwinds in 2018 
 You can   
Shares of Strong Buy ranked Occidental Petroleum have outperformed the Zacks Domestic Integrated Oil industry in the last year  gaining  47 5  vs   43 5   As oil prices continue to improve  Occidental Petroleum gains from more oil production in the Permian Resources and concentrating on high margin production region  
The Zacks analyst thinks ongoing capital investment will further strengthen the existing operations of the company  The company generates stable cash flow and its Chemical plant will further improve this metric  However  Occidental Petroleum  like other oil and natural gas companies  faces the risks of cost overruns and development interruptions due to delays in drilling and other approvals 
 You can   
Capital One Financial s shares have outperformed the Zacks Consumer Loans industry in the last six months  gaining  0 7  vs   1 1   Further  the company has an impressive earnings surprise history  having earnings expectations in three of the trailing four quarters  
The Zacks analyst thinks that its solid liquidity position  strength in credit card and online banking businesses  higher interest rates and solid loan balance will aid growth  Also  benefits from the lower tax rates and restructuring initiatives will support its financials  
However  mounting operating expenses are likely to keep the company s bottom line under pressure  Expenses are expected to remain high driven by the company s business restructuring efforts  Also  deteriorating asset quality remains a major near term concern

What to Expect The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is  1 41 per share  reflecting a year over year decline of 23 4   We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged in the past 30 days  Further  analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of  3 67 billion  up about 4  from the year ago quarter Notably  Bed Bath   Beyond has outperformed the broader industry in the last three months  reflecting positive investor sentiment ahead of earnings  The company s shares inched up 0 3   against the  s decline of 9 8  
Factors at PlayBed Bath   Beyond is gaining from its focus on transformation plan to deliver a seamless customer experience  The transformation plan focuses on improving operational efficiency through the overhaul of IT and business processes  as well as adopting customer centric plans like enriching product assortment and enhancing services In this regard  it adopted a new model to better recognize and prioritize technology related needs  It has also set up a strategic portfolio management office   SPMO   to allocate resources toward more profitable areas  Through the SPMO  the company is creating an integrated portfolio of strategies to improve gross margin  optimize inventory levels  enhance supply chain and implement customer service transformation Further  the company s capital initiatives and constant shareholder friendly moves bode well  Additionally  the company is progressing well with its strategic store expansion plans  It also targets increasing the productivity of existing stores by adjusting the breadth and depth of its merchandise offerings to suit customer preferences  Consequently  it remains focused on expanding  renovating and relocating stores to adapt to the changing market conditions  We believe these initiatives will go a long way in retaining the company s existing customers while attracting new ones However  Bed Bath   Beyond has been grappling with soft gross and operating margins for the past six quarters now  Management expects this trend to continue in fiscal 2017 due to higher shipping and coupon expenses as well as rise in SG A expense Additionally  the company s dismal comparable store sales  comps  trend remains a concern  Driven by initial comps performance in the fiscal fourth quarter  it projects comps to decline in the low single digit percentage range  Further  it envisions fiscal 2017 earnings per share of roughly  3 00  which reflects a decline of more than 30  from the year ago period Though Bed Bath   Beyond is striving hard to spark a turnaround  the current dismal trends cannot simply be overlooked  So  let s see what is in store for the company in the upcoming release What the Zacks Model Unveils Our proven model shows that Bed Bath   Beyond is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key components  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  The company has an Earnings ESP of  0 07   This  along with the company s Zacks Rank  3  makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat Amazon com Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   has an Earnings ESP of  12 11  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  Fastenal Company   NASDAQ FAST   has an Earnings ESP of  0 21  and a Zacks Rank  2 Kimberly Clark Corporation   NYSE KMB   has an Earnings ESP of  0 76  and a Zacks Rank  2 Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6  and  67 1  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ",2018-04-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bed-bath--beyond-bbby-q4-earnings-is-a-beat-likely-200303395,200303395

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Mastercard  MA   Petrobras  PBR  and Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Buy rated Mastercard s shares have increased 54 5  over the last year  significantly outperforming the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry s gain of 33 2  during the same period  The Zacks analyst likes its solid market position  ongoing expansion and digital initiatives  
Also  there are significant opportunities from the secular shift toward electronic payments  The acquisitions of VocaLink and NuData Security complement the company s efforts to participate in new payment flows and enhance its safety and security offerings  
The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings being revised upward over the last 60 days  It  however  continues to face increasing costs  Also  higher incentives and rewards will put pressure on the bottom line 
 You can   
Shares of Petrobras have outperformed the Zacks Emerging Markets Integrated Oil industry over the last three months  gaining  21 5  vs   11 7   Adding to the bullishness  Brazil s flagship oil company reported robust fourth quarter results  While its strong free cash flow performance reflects operational improvement and lower investments  Petrobras has been able to partly revive its financial health through divestments and spin offs  
The company s ambitious plan to boost volumes by 27  through 2022 also looks achievable considering its impressive pre salt reservoirs portfolio  However  Petrobras still carries a massive net debt of  85 billion  with net debt to capitalization ratio of 51   Weak oil products sales volume in Brazil and lower margins at its downstream unit are other headwinds  As such  the Zacks analyst maintains a cautious stance on the stock 
 You can   
Walgreens Boots Alliance s shares have done better than the embattled Zacks Drug Stores industry over the last year  WBA is down  10 5  vs  decline of  13 4  for the peer group   Walgreens Boots reported better than expected second quarter fiscal 2018 results  This time the company witnessed its highest sales in the last eight quarters  
The Zacks analyst likes Walgreens Boots  increase in sales at the Retail Pharmacy International  Moreover  the company has been gaining on account of strategic tie ups  The company s alliance with Express Scripts aiming to expand their existing group purchasing efforts is another positive  
This apart  the company s decision to acquire a 40  stake in Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores in China looks promising as it should provide a strong impetus to Walgreens Boots  worldwide retail pharmacy business  However  declining Retail Pharmacy sales at CER was a disappointment  The company faces tough competition along with currency fluctuations

126836,348351,KMB,Cost Cutting Plans To Fuel Kimberly Clark  KMB  Q1 Earnings ,opinion,Kimberly Clark Corporation   NYSE KMB   is slated to release first quarter 2018 results on Apr 23  This consumer goods company has reported an average earnings surprise of nearly 2  over the trailing four quarters  Let s see how things are placed ahead of the upcoming results  Kimberly Clark Corporation Price and EPS Surprise     FORCE   Global Restructuring Plans to Drive Bottom LineKimberly Clark is likely to continue gaining from its ongoing Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere  FORCE  program  while it should also receive some benefits from its recently unveiled 2018 Global Restructuring plan  Notably  the latter marks the company s biggest restructuring in a long time now  This plan is likely to enhance the company s underlying profitability  help it compete better and provide greater flexibility to undertake growth oriented investments  Delving deeper  we note that the program is expected to simplify Kimberly Clark s overhead organization and manufacturing supply chain structures  Well  the program will benefit all segments of the company as well as all the major geographical region Markedly  management expects cost savings of  50  70 million from this program in 2018  which also bodes well for the quarter under review  Moving to the FORCE Program  Kimberly Clark has long been gaining from this cost cutting plan  In fact  the FORCE program has generated higher cost savings each year with record savings of  450 million in 2017  following  435 million in 2016 and lesser each year prior to that  The company anticipates cost savings of  400 million in 2018  On a combined basis  Kimberly Clark expects cost savings of more than  2 billion from the FORCE program and 2018 Global Restructuring Program  discussed below   over the next four years These dedicated efforts are likely to help Kimberly Clark offset hurdles related to input cost inflation  Incidentally  Kimberly Clark has been witnessing rising input costs of late  Increased input costs on account of greater costs of pulp and other raw materials caused adjusted operating profit to fall 2 7  to  836 million in the fourth quarter   Further  in 2018  management expects input cost inflation of about  300  400 million  primarily in international markets  However  the robust aforementioned strategies should help the company combat these hurdles and fuel bottom line growth Earnings Expectations in NumbersIn fact  FORCE program was a driver for the company in the fourth quarter as well  wherein both top and bottom lines improved year over year and the latter also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second consecutive quarter  The year over year growth in earnings was driven by cost savings from FORCE program as well as reduced effective tax rate stemming from the latest tax reforms and associated activities  Also  management expects the tax reforms to favorably impact its bottom line and cash flows  which again remains a driver for Kimberly Clark in the quarter to be reported  Well  the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at  1 70  which shows an increase of nearly 9  from  1 57 recorded in the year ago period  The estimate has remained unchanged in the past 30 days Will Sales Grow Amid North American Challenges Moving to top line  the year over year growth in the last reported quarter was aided by greater Personal Product and K C Professional  KCP  sales  However  on a region wise basis  softness in North American consumer products and higher competitive activity have been major concerns for quite some time  Evidently  net sales in North America declined year over year across most segments  owing to lower selling prices  This in turn stemmed from intense promotional activities undertaken amid the mounting competition  Also  organic sales at consumer products decreased 3  in North America  In fact  the company s overall organic sales also dipped 1   due to lower net selling prices across most categories Nonetheless  management stated that it remains committed toward making further brand investments and implementing strategic growth initiatives  For the quarter under review  the consensus marks for Personal Product and KCP sales are pegged at  2 304 million and  795 million  in comparison with  2 250 million and  768 million  respectively  Also  analysts polled by Zacks expects Consumer Tissue sales to grow 2 35 to  1 488 million  Finally  the consensus estimate for Kimberly Clark s total revenues stands at  4 595 million  marking a 2 5  rise from the year ago reported figure What the Zacks Model UnveilsHowever  our proven model doesn t show that Kimberly Clark is likely to beat bottom line estimates this quarter  For this to happen  a stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re

Programs to Drive Savings Management remains encouraged about its 2018 Global Restructuring Program  which marks the company s biggest restructuring in a long time now  This plan is likely to enhance

The cumulative effect of these strategies and actions is well reflected in the company s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and a  of B  Further  the company s long term earnings growth rate of 8 8  highlights its inherent strength 
Newell Poised for Growth on Solid Brand Portfolio
Newell Brands is a leading name in the home and office products space backed by its solid portfolio of brands including Sharpie  Paper Mate  Dymo  Expo  Waterman  Parker  Irwin  Lenox  Rubbermaid  Graco  Calphalon and Goody  Also  the addition of popular brands like Mr  Coffee machines and Rawlings baseballs after the Jarden acquisition positions it well for future growth 
Portfolio Management  A Powerful Tool
The company s Growth Game Plan not only focuses on simplification of operating structure but also makes prudent investments in higher growth potential areas  As a part of this plan  Newell Brands significantly strengthened its portfolio by completing six acquisitions and divestitures in and just after the end of first quarter 2017  Acquisitions included the Sistema food storage and the WoodWick fragranced candles businesses while divestitures comprised the tools  consumer storage totes  fire building and fire starting  and the rope and chain business 
Additionally  Newell Brands recently divested its central European baby gear business  Teutonia  The company is also on track with its plan of exiting product lines having an annual sale of  200  300 million across its combined business with Jarden  over the next two to three years 
Cost Savings and Investments
Newell remains on track with its Project Renewal Program  which is expected to generate annual cost savings of  700 million by 2017 end or 2018 beginning  The company is currently in the third phase of the plan that focuses on generating cost savings in the areas of procurement  This is to be achieved by reducing complexity of its business and simplifying the manufacturing and distribution processes as well as further overhead reduction 
Moreover  the company plans to use a major portion of the savings to accelerate growth by reinvesting in its business while the remaining cost savings are expected to reflect in earnings  The company is poised to generate more than  300 million savings in the year  Also  Newell obtained cost synergies as anticipated with an additional  86 million in the third quarter 
Balance Sheet Looks Strong
Newell Brands  financial flexibility enables it to enhance shareholder values and drive future development through value added investments aimed at accelerating growth and expanding margins  Further  the company s commitment toward enhancing shareholder value is evident from its robust dividend payment history and share repurchase programs 
Thus  the company anticipates growing dividend at par with earnings  Additionally  it approved a new share buyback plan of up to  1 billion  expiring by 2020 end The company also has  256 million remaining under its current buyback plan  which is now extended til 2020 
Bottom Line
While all seems well with this company  the recent effects of the Hurricane Harvey on its results and strained margins cannot be ignored  Also  the company s lowered outlook for 2017 indicates troubles for the company in the near term  Consequently  the stock has plunged 26 1  in the past three months wider than the  s decline of 3 4    

Though these troubles seem temporary and are slated to impact near term performance  we believe the company is well poised for growth in the longer term driven by the aforementioned strategies and cost saving initiatives

segment s performance  This  in combination with the company s dismal gross margin trend  has been a hurdle for long   The implication of such factors is quite apparent from the recent downtrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate and investors  receding optimism in the stock  following its third quarter fiscal 2018 outcome Evidently  shares of this leading grocery company declined almost 16 8  over the last three trading sessions  post the company s quarterly results on Jan 10  2018   In fact  SUPERVALU s shares have been struggling for a while   The company s shares plunged almost 45  in a year  much wider than the  s dip of 3 8  Soft Retail Business   Gross Margins  A Consistent WorryWhile earnings for third quarter fiscal 2018 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate  sales missed the same  on account of underlying weakness in the retail segment  Well  the issues pertaining to the retail segment runs deep and has been pulling down the company s overall results for a while  Price competition  competitive store openings and intense promotional environment are major deterrents  Markedly  the company has been witnessing identical store sales decline in the retail segment for the past 11 quarters  In third quarter fiscal 2018  identical store sales dropped 3 5   which along with store closures caused net sales at the retail unit to tumble 4 1  to  1 017 million  Moreover  the segment incurred adjusted operating loss of  3 million  while retail gross margin also contracted due to soft sales and high promotions  Unfortunately  management expects the retail segment to continue bearing the brunt of these headwinds in fiscal 2018 In addition to the worries pertaining to the retail segment  SUPERVALU has been suffering year over year declines in gross margin  since three consecutive quarters  Notably  unfavorable business mix and lower margins from Unified Grocers dented gross margin during the third quarter   Estimates Trending DownFor fiscal 2018  management projects net earnings from continuing operations in the range of a loss of  20 million to earnings of  2 million  Management also expects adjusted EBITDA in a range of  475  485 million  compared with the previous expectation of  475  495 million  The narrowed view reflects the impact of greater than expected trucking and logistic expenses incurred in the Wholesale segment during the third quarter Owing to such factors as well as the aforementioned hurdles pertaining to the retail segment  consensus estimate for the fourth quarter have declined 8 cents to reach 73 cents  since earnings announcement Growth CatalystsNevertheless  SUPERVALU s booming Wholesale business segment offers considerable strength to combat the aforementioned hurdles and keep the company afloat in the industry  Notably  sales from this segment improved 52  year over year to  2 888 million in third quarter fiscal 2018  representing roughly 73  of the company s total revenues  Thus  the company is on track to develop wholesale operations  primarily through adding new customers  retaining and developing business with existing customers and acquisitions  Incidentally  the company concluded the buyout of Associated Grocers of Florida in the beginning of the fourth quarter  which along with efficient integration of Unified Grocers  acquired in June 2017  underscores the company s focus on solidifying Wholesale business Further  SUPERVALU has been trying to improve performance and business effectiveness by focusing more on prospective areas  such as organic food products  The company has been evaluating the growth prospects in the organic foods arena and has partnered with wholesale merchants to explore opportunities in this category  Apart from this  SUPERVALU also strives toward improving its omni channel capabilities to resonate with the evolving consumer trends  In this respect  the company recently agreed on a multiyear contract with Instacart to provide integrated store

126890,348405,KMB,Factors Likely To Decide Kimberly s  KMB  Fate In Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"Kimberly Clark Corporation   NYSE KMB   is slated to release third quarter 2017 results on Oct 23  before the opening bell  The company s earnings have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters  In the preceding quarter  it missed the consensus mark by 0 7   Therefore  the question lingering in investors  minds now is whether Kimberly Clark will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the third quarter Kimberly Clark Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 
   Factors Likely to Impact the QuarterKimberly Clark has been witnessing slower organic sales growth in developing and emerging markets for quite some time now  While performance improved in China  it softened in Latin America  particularly in Brazil and Argentina  due to lower volumes and highly competitive promotional activity Though management expects modest improvement in the overall environment in developing and emerging markets in the second half of 2017  the current promotional environment is weakening the market dynamics In 2017  management anticipates input costs to increase owing to modestly inflationary environment  Input cost inflation are expected to be higher in the range of  200  300 million from its previous estimate of  150  250 million  This uptick can be attributable to higher prices for several raw materials including pulp Nevertheless  we note that the company s higher cost savings  continued product innovation  strong international presence have been the catalysts that are expected to drive growth  For 2017  the company expects to generate cost savings in the range of  425 to  450 million from the FORCE program  up from the prior estimate of  400 million Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at  1 54  Although the current quarter estimate has moved down by a penny in the last seven days  it is couple of cents above from the prior year quarter figure  The consensus estimate for revenue is currently pegged at  4 668 million for the to be reported quarter  reflecting a year over year increase of 1 6  Expectations of an increase in both the top and bottom lines boost investor confidence about the stock s performance in the quarter Sales for Personal Care  Consumer Tissue and K C Professional segments are projected to be  2 354 million   1 490 million and  817 million  respectively  These estimates show a year over year increase of 1 8   1 2  and 1 9  for each segment  respectively Further  we note that volumes are estimated to increase 0 03  for both the Personal Care and Consumer Tissue segments  and 0 02  for the K C Professional segment What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kimberly Clark is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Kimberly Clark has an Earnings ESP of  0 08  per share  However  the company s Zacks Rank  4  Sell  lowers the chances of a beat in the ensuing release Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat The Estee Lauder Companies Inc    NYSE EL   has an Earnings ESP of  0 26  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  Colgate Palmolive Company   NYSE CL   has an Earnings ESP of  0 14  and a Zacks Rank  3 Avon Products  Inc    NYSE AVP   has an Earnings ESP of  6 06  and a Zacks Rank  3 Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ",2017-10-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/factors-likely-to-decide-kimberlys-kmb-fate-in-q3-earnings-200220105,200220105
126891,348406,KMB,Kimberly Clark Is Worth A Look At These Levels ,opinion,"Dividends are central to my investment philosophy  They not only lower portfolio volatility but also provide a continued source of funds for reinvestment  In that vein  I continually monitor a small list of companies that have consistently raised dividends for at least 25 years  When these companies are weak technically  it s an appropriate time to examine them as a potential addition to a portfolio  I detail this process in my book   
Kimberly Clark Corporation  NYSE KMB  is currently looking attractive from a technical perspective 


The weekly chart  top chart  shows a double top in the first half of this year followed by a consistent downtrend  Weekly prices are currently approaching the 200 week EMA  The daily chart  bottom chart  is very weak  it is below the 200 day EMA and recently gapped lower  
  KMB has three lines of business 
Personal Care brands offer our consumers a trusted partner in caring for themselves and their families by delivering confidence  protection and discretion through a wide variety of innovative solutions and products such as disposable diapers  training and youth pants  swimpants  baby wipes  feminine and incontinence care products  and other related products  Products in this segment are sold under the Huggies  Pull Ups  Little Swimmers  GoodNites  DryNites  Kotex  U by Kotex  Intimus  Depend  Plenitud  Poise and other brand names 
Consumer Tissue offers a wide variety of innovative solutions and trusted brands that touch and improve people s lives every day  Products in this segment include facial and bathroom tissue  paper towels  napkins and related products  and are sold under the Kleenex  Scott  Cottonelle  Viva  Andrex  Scottex  Neve and other brand names 
K C Professional   KCP   partners with businesses to create Exceptional Workplaces  helping to make them healthier  safer and more productive through a range of solutions and supporting products such as wipers  tissue  towels  apparel  soaps and sanitizers  Our brands  including Kleenex  Scott  WypAll  Kimtech and Jackson Safety  are well known for quality and trusted to help people around the world work better 
The company faces intense competition  This means KMB must very efficient 
Their balance sheet  as researched on Morningstar com  isn t as clean as I would like  But a high asset liability ratio is less important for a multi billion dollar company  Over the last 5 years  total assets have decreased about  5 billion  thanks to a modest decline in receivables along with a larger decline in property  plant  and equipment  about  800 billion  and inventories  about  900 billion   Turning to liabilities  the company has increased its debt levels by about  1 4 billion  which is to be expected during a period of record low interest rates  According to their revenue statement  their interest expense is 1 75  of gross income   a manageable level 
Expenses demonstrate that management is top notch  Over the last 5 years  their gross margin has improved by 450 basis points  their operating income has risen nearly 550 basis points and their net margin has increased almost 390 basis points  And then there is EBITDA  which is up 525 BPs  Considering the intense competition in their market  these are very important and impressive numbers 
The company is large enough to fund current expansion out of net income  This means the primary play on their cash flow statement is in their financing structure  Over the last 5 years  they ve done a large amount of debt refunding  which is prudent in a low rate environment  They have also been buying back stock at a solid pace   another great way to reward shareholders 
According to FINVIZ  their current yield is 3 42     which is about 60 basis points higher than the AAA effective yield and on par with a BBB effective yield  according to FRED  data  Their dividend coverage ratio is just south of 62   which means they have room to raise it further 
Technically  the company is weak  which means it s time to look at this company  While the balance sheet isn t that impressive  the rising margins show management is very good at its job  The company has taken advantage of low interest rates to refund its debt  interest rate expenses are under control

126909,348424,KMB,Seeking Income  Here Are 4 Better Choices Than Caterpillar,opinion,"Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   has a lot more long term upside potential  but we sold 100  of our Caterpillar shares this morning for a gain of  110  after owning them for 19 months  Before describing the 5 better income producing investments  we review why we sold our shares of Caterpillar  Our 5 better options than Caterpillar for income seeking investors are organized from least to most risky  but they re all attractive  in our view  Keep in mind  this article is about attractive income opportunities  but not necessarily the highest income opportunities  As we ve written in the past  we loathe  yield chasing   and it s one of our  Why We Sold Caterpillar
We sold our shares of Caterpillar because its valuation has been driven too high  Specifically  a lot of the optimism surrounding the  Trump Rally s  economic growth and tax reform expectations  possible overseas cash repatriation  lower corporate tax rates  protectionism in general  are already baked into the price  Caterpillar is no longer a  Dog of the Dow   it has the highest short interest of any Dow component  the upcoming upgrade cycle will only go so far  and we ve held it over a year allowing us to recognize the lower long term capital gain rate  For your reference  you can read an excerpt from our original members only buy thesis report on January 8  2016  here 
Caterpillar  CAT  stock has fallen 43  since July of 2014  and it has a large 4 9  dividend yield  Additionally  the company has plenty of cash to continue its track record of dividend increases  and the stock also offers significant opportunity for capital appreciation  Despite dramatic declines in Caterpillar s mining business  significant weakness in energy  a strong US dollar  and a declining outlook from management  CAT is still worth more than its current market price  Further  the company has ample financial wherewithal to weather intermediate term challenges  and we believe Caterpillar will eventually revert to moderate growth making now an exceptional buying opportunity for long term dividend investors as well as those seeking capital appreciation 
And you can also read our earlier public write up on Caterpillar here 
  12 3 15 
Simply put  we believe Caterpillar is one of the great American industrial companies  but its valuation has gotten too far ahead of itself given the risks such as valuation  tax irregularities  the IRS executed a search warrant in March over tax irregularities   overseas competition  e g  Kamatsu   stagnant commodity prices  and currency realities  the marginal benefits of this year s weaker dollar are priced in   and its relatively high cost of capital 

For a little more color on valuation  here is a look at Caterpillar s lofty EV to EBITDA ratio 

And Caterpillar s declining margins 

And here is the big  price driven  decline in Caterpillar s dividend yield 

We suspect Caterpillar has significant very long term price appreciation potential  but the price is ahead of itself  Given our  110  19 month total return  and the fact that the dividend yield was nearl 5  when we bought it and it s under 2 5  now  we freeing up this cash to move it to other opportunities that are more attractive for us 
5 Better Options for Income Seekers
Our 5 better options than Caterpillar for income seeking investors are organized from least to most risky  but they re all attractive  in our view  Without further ado  here is the list 
1  Verizon  VZ   Yield  4 8 
Unlike Caterpillar  Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ  is a Dog of the Dow based on its current yield  If you don t know  the  Dogs of the Dow  strategy proposes that an investor annually select for investment the ten Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  stocks whose dividend is the highest fraction of their price  Here is a look at the current components of the Dow sorted by dividend yield 

The Dogs of the Dow is a contrarian strategy whereby investors choose companies that are often out favor  and as you saw in the above table  Verizon s stock has delivered negative returns over the last year whereas the overall Dow Jones Industrials Average has been positive  Granted the Dogs of the Dow strategy is passive in nature considering it can be implemented without looking much further than dividend yields  proponents of the strategy argue that blue chip companies don t alter their dividend to reflect trading conditions and  therefore  the dividend is a measure of the average worth of the company   However  it worth considering a few of Verizon s  fundamentals  
For starters  Verizon is the nation s largest network  it generates lots of free cash flow  and despite growing competition  as competitor networks catch up in quality  and compete more on price  Verizon is not going away  Communications networks are the lifeblood of businesses and retail consumers  and with the ever expanding sophistication and demands of network users  especially the eventual arrival of 5G  Verizon s importance will remain strong considering its vast network and economies of scale  Further still  many of the weaker communications company s  e g  Frontier  CenturyLink  NYSE CTL   Windstream  may eventually go the way of the dodo bird thereby creating opportunities to pick up marginal customers and marginal assets at fire sale prices 
Further still  in addition to executing on the fundamentals  Verizon is taking steps to evolve for the future 

Another thing to consider about Verizon  simply from an investment allocation standpoint is that it is a  large value  stock  a category that has been underperforming  large growth  stocks lately  as shown in the following table 

However  over the long term  value stocks tend to outperform growth stocks  and this phenomenon will eventually resume  in our view  No one knows exactly when  but large value stocks will eventually overtake large growth stocks  and now is a particularly attractive time to consider large value stocks from a contrarian standpoint 
We ve written detailed  many times in the past  and based on its current price and dividend safety  Verizon is worth considering if you are a lower risk income seeking investor 
2  Kimberly Clark  KMB   Yield  3 3 
Kimberly Clark  NYSE KMB  is not a Dog of the Dow  it s not a member of the Dow  but it is similar in the sense that it is a steady blue chip company with a relatively attractive dividend yield and it s trading at an attractive contrarian price  in our view 

A lot of you may be scoffing that we d even consider purchasing a boring  paper making  company like Kimberly Clark  but our thesis is clear  This profitable business is NOT going away  the price is cheap  and the dividend is big  growing and safe  Here is a look at some of this company s products
For further perspective  here is a look at Kimberly Clark s current and forward price to earnings ratios

The fact that they re similar is an indication of low growth expectations  and the fact that they ve declined is an indication of decreasing optimism about the company  Many contrarians like these low valuation multiples especially considering this is a low beta company with a very steady business  it s a safer bet that consumers will keep using Kimberly Clark products no matter what happens to the market than say Rolls Royces or some other luxury item  
Also  as we mentioned earlier  large value stocks  such as Kimberly Clark  have been out of favor compared to the rest of the market  and over the long term this is generally not the case  value stocks tend to significantly outperform growth stocks over market cycles  
Another important consideration for Kimberly Clark is the consistent share repurchase  This is an attractive way to return cash to shareholders and it helps keeps the total returns stronger than this company s low but steady growth would suggest  Here s a looks at Kimberly Clark s long term earnings per share versus shares outstanding  it s a very steady  growing  profitable business  

Also worth noting  Kimberly Clark has increased its dividend for 45 consecutive years  If you are an income seeking contrarian investor  Kimberly Clark is an attractive blue chip  with a steady growing yield  and it is currently trading at an attractive price  in our view 
3  Ventas  VTR   Yield  4 8 
Ventas  NYSE VTR  is a well managed  attractive dividend paying   4 8  yield  healthcare REIT that is currently trading at a compelling price  We recently reviewed ten attractive qualities about Ventas in this article 

As an overview of that article  we like Ventas because of its powerful demographic tailwinds  high private pay revenue sources  low beta  business and operator diversification  valuation  management  financial strength and dividend safety  to name a few 

Also worth noting  Ventas is a real estate investment trust   REIT   and that whole group has been underperforming the rest of the market over the last year as investors have been fearful  overly fearful in or view  about the possibility of sharply rising interest rates  and REITs have been out of favor as investors have preferred growth stocks as we discussed earlier  If you are looking for an attractive income opportunity  Ventas is worth considering 
4  Simon Property Group   Yield  4 5 
 Selling Put Options for Income 
Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG  is another attractive dividend paying REIT that has been particularly out of favor recently  SPG owns shopping mall real estate  and that industry has gotten crushed over the last year as many investors fear online retailers  such as Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   will put all  brick and mortar  stores out of business  And while we believe this may be true for some brick and mortar retailers  it is not true for Simon Property Group considering its highly attractive property locations and its very strong  and continuously record breaking  financial position  Simon Property Group was our investment idea of the month earlier this year  and you can  ",2017-10-01,Blue Harbinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/seeking-income-5-better-options-than-caterpillar-200216298,200216298

Adjusted earnings of  1 49 per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 50 by 0 7  and year ago adjusted results of  1 53 by 2 6   Despite higher cost savings  earnings suffered due to lower sales and higher cost inflation 
Quarter in Detail
The company reported sales of  4 55 billion in the second quarter  Sales marginally lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 56 billion by 0 2  and declined 1  from the prior year quarter  Notably  currency did not impact second quarter sales results

126925,348440,KMB,Forget Kimberly Clark  Buy These 3 Consumer Staples Stocks,opinion,The Consumer Staples sector has been reaping benefits from an improving economy and rising consumer confidence  lately  Further  labor market optimism and gradual wage acceleration has been positively impacting consumer s spending nature However  investors are skeptical regarding headwinds plaguing the sector such as unfavorable currency  declining volumes  price wars  an aggressive promotional environment and rising competition  One such stock affected by the ongoing challenges is Kimberly Clark Corporation   NYSE KMB   Kimberly Clark  engaged in the manufacture and marketing of a wide range of consumer products around the world  has been disappointing investors for a while now with dismal organic sales trend  As a result  the company s top line has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last seven quarters in a row  including the recently concluded second quarter 2017 Headwinds Derailing the Stock                  The company has been witnessing weakness in organic sales particularly due to a tough industry environment in North America  During the first and second quarters of 2017  the region s organic sales declined due to high competition  reduced promotional shipments and lower net pricing  Although organic sales have been positive in the developing and emerging markets  its growth rate has decelerated in the past few quarters   Though the company expects modest improvement in the overall environment in developing and emerging markets in the second half of 2017  the current promotional environment is weakening current market dynamics Kimberly Clark has incurred lower input cost in 2016  but the trend has changed since the first quarter of 2017  Rising input costs are now hurting the company s margins  Moreover  it expects the inflationary trend to persist in the periods ahead and anticipates increased prices for several raw materials  including pulp  in 2017  Of late  the company has also experienced a negative shift in consumer behavior in its diaper segment Dull Outlook  Estimates Showing DowntrendThis Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company continues to expect industry headwinds to linger and has therefore issued soft earnings guidance for the full year  It now expects earnings per share at the low end of its previous targeted range of  6 20  6 35  Following the company s discouraging performance and dull outlook  the Zacks Consensus Estimate also witnessed a downtrend in the past 60 days  In the said period  estimates for 2017 have gone down nine cents to reach  6 22  Also estimated earnings of  1 55 for the third quarter depict a decline of five cents  Shares Underperforming the IndustryKimberly Clark has been trying to spark a turnaround through initiatives such as aggressive cost cutting  planned innovation and marketing campaigns  However  these initiatives have failed to attract investor s confidence  Shares of the

 s decline of 7 6   Meanwhile  the  sector  which includes the company  has depicted growth of 4 3  in the same time frame The ongoing weakness in Kimberly Clark s results has made investors jittery  amid global tensions  We note that investors are skeptical about President Trump s policies  North Korea s latest nuclear test has further raised geopolitical tensions and increased pressure on the Trump administration Despite these worries  it may be a good idea to look at some other consumer staples stocks that have the potential to outperform the industry  These stocks remain well positioned in the current market situation and can perform well despite the aforementioned trends  Fetching higher returns in such investment climate is a difficult task We have highlighted three consumer staple

126939,348454,KMB,Kimberly Clark  KMB  Eyes Growth Strategies  Time To Hold,opinion,"With cost savings  restructuring initiatives and product innovation  Kimberly Clark Corporation   NYSE KMB   is well positioned to sustain its growth momentum  Let s now look into the factors impacting the performance of this leading player in several consumer product categories 
Factors Impacting Performance 
The upside in Kimberly Clark s performance was observed to be driven by cost savings and continued product innovation related efforts  Kimberly Clark is aggressively cutting costs through a program called Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere or FORCE 
This program has generated higher cost savings each year with savings in 2016 exceeding the initial target  For 2017  the company expects cost savings of at least  400 million  out of which it already achieved  110 million of cost savings in the first quarter 2017   Read more   
Coming to product innovation  the company has a number of new product launches lined up in North America in the near term  As one of the leading players in several consumer product categories  Kimberly Clark s regular innovative efforts help in improving its brand positions and market share 
The company is focused on developing long term prospects by improving its international presence  Organic sales in diapers have increased in Eastern Europe and China over the past quarters  due to strong volume growth and innovation 
However  the company s top line missed estimates in seven of the past eight quarters  Additionally  over the past few quarters the company has been witnessing sluggish organic sales growth especially in developing and emerging markets  Highly competitive promotional activity continues to negatively impact the selling prices and weaken market dynamics for organic sales  Furthermore  input cost inflation and stiff competition especially in the diapers segment remain headwinds 
Price Performance
Over the past six months  the company was observed to have performed slightly better than the Zacks categorized  industry  During this time frame  shares of the company gained 12 1  while the industry grew 12  

Stable Estimates 
Estimates have remained stable for the company over the past 30 days at  1 51 and  6 29 for the second quarter and for 2017  respectively   Additionally  the company reiterated earnings guidance for 2017 is in the band of  6 20  6 35 per share 
Bottom Line 
Given the pros and cons  Kimberly Clark currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   We are hopeful that the company s cost containment and innovation strategies would facilitate improving its top line performance while sustaining its earnings growth 
Key picks 
Better ranked stocks in the same industry include Ollie s Bargain Outlet Holdings   NASDAQ OLLI    Energizer Holdings  Inc    NYSE ENR   and Tupperware Brands Corp    NYSE TUP    all carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

126952,348467,KMB,Kimberly Clark  KMB  To Post Q1 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,"Kimberly Clark Corporation   NYSE KMB   is set to report first quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Apr 24  The question lingering in investors  minds is  whether this consumer products giant will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to be reported quarter  The company s earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 1 4  
A glimpse of Kimberly Clark s stock performance shows that its shares have been outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry and the broader Consumer Staples sector since past six months  The stock rallied 12 4  in comparison to the above mentioned industry s growth of 4 0  and sector s growth of 3 4   Notably  the industry is part of the top 9  of the Zacks Classified industries  24 out of the 256  

Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Which Way are Estimates Treading 
Let s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter and 2017 has been stable over the last 30 days  However  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 54 per share for the first quarter reflects a year over year increase of 0 5   Further  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  4 51 billion for the said quarter  up 0 7  from the year ago period 
What Does the Zacks Model Unveil 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Kimberly Clarkis likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Kimberly Clark has an Earnings ESP of  1 30  as the Most Accurate estimate of  1 52 is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  which is pegged at  1 54  Although the company s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  we need a positive Earnings ESP in order to be confident about an earnings surprise 
Factors Influencing the Quarter
Kimberly Clark has been performing well since the company reported impressive results in fourth quarter 2016  We believe the company s higher cost savings  continued product innovation  strong international presence will drive growth in the long term  However  Kimberly Clark continues to expect currency trends to impact profitability and margins in the near term  Moreover  the company provided weak sales forecast for 2017  Nevertheless  the company has a solid share buyback plan in place to return value to its shareholders 
However  we cannot ignore the fact that Kimberly Clark has been witnessing slower organic sales growth  especially in developing and emerging markets  over the past few quarters  In the fourth quarter  organic sales increased 4  in developing and emerging markets  but growth is decelerating from the preceding quarters  probably due to lower volumes in Latin America  particularly in Brazil and Argentina and highly competitive promotional activity and an even more difficult economic environment 
Though the company has strong long term growth prospects in developing and emerging markets  the current promotional environment is weakening the current market dynamics  In fact  the company expects only modest improvement in the overall environment in developing and emerging markets in 2017  particularly in the second half of 2017 Kimberly Clark Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies in the Consumer Staple sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat 
Pinnacle Foods Inc    NYSE PF   has an Earnings ESP of  2 17  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see 
Treehouse Foods  Inc    NYSE THS   has an Earnings ESP of  4 62  and a Zacks Rank  2 
Newell Brands  Inc    NYSE NWL   has an Earnings ESP of  13 79  and a Zacks Rank  2 
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars 
Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge 
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research

126974,348489,KMB,Consumer Stocks To Report Earnings On Oct 24  VFC  KMB  ERI,opinion,The third quarter 2016 earnings season has kick started and the investor community is engrossed in tallying the estimated earnings of companies with their actual outcomes  Stocks of companies that meet or beat expectations are rewarded with surging prices while the ones that miss  see falling share prices  No matter whether the results are good or bad  the reporting period is considered the ideal time to rebalance one s portfolio Per the  report  published on Oct 19  2016  the third quarter earnings season looks quiet promising  with improved results from major banks clearing much of the dark clouds that had made the scenario gloomy in the last few quarters  The results so far have exhibited a larger number of companies coming out with positive surprises for both earnings and revenues  That said  we are hoping to see a positive third quarter overall  provided the trend seen thus far continues If our hopes come true  the third quarter is likely to mark the first positive quarter for the S P 500 index after five consecutive quarters of earnings decline As of Oct 19  81 S P 500 members   that cumulatively account for 19 9  of the index s total market capitalization   have reported earnings results  Total earnings for these index members are up 3 8  and revenues grew 3 6   with 80 2  beating EPS estimates and 63  beating revenue estimates  Further  total S P 500 earnings are expected to be down 1  on 1 5  higher revenues  which is a notable improvement from a 2 9  earnings decline predicted a few weeks earlier Coming to the consumer related sectors  Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary  have respectively seen 21 9  and 14 3  of its S P 500 members report their third quarter results  Of this  the Consumer Staples sector has an earnings beat ratio of 85 7  and the Consumer Discretionary sector has 80  earnings beat ratio  The third quarter forecasts show that earnings for the Consumer Discretionary sector are expected to dip 0 1   whereas revenues are anticipated to surge 11 7   On the other hand  the Consumer Staples sector is expected to witness a 2 4  rise in earnings along with 1 3  improvement in revenues Of the earnings to be reported next week  we will focus on three consumer stocks which are expected to report third quarter 2016 results on Oct 24 To start with V F  Corp    NYSE VFC    we are unsure whether this designer and producer of branded apparel and related products will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported  The company s past performance reveals that it has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 0 5  over the trailing four quarters  Despite beating earnings estimates for two consecutive quarters  V F  Corp  continues to battle foreign currency headwinds  which have been affecting its performance  Further  management expects this to prevail and hurt the company s ongoing performance  Additionally  the sale of Contemporary Brands business is likely to dent results in 2016 However  V F  Corp  s solid brand portfolio and opportunities with regard to distribution bode well  Further  the company s focus on strategic buyouts and expansion of global operations emphasize its growth prospects  The company carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see   However  our criteria of earnings beat has been let down by an  of 0 00    Read more   V F CORP Price and EPS Surprise    Next  the earnings picture for Kimberly Clark Corporation   NYSE KMB     a Texas based manufacturer and seller of personal care  consumer tissue and professional products   looks vague  The company has positive earnings surprise history with an average beat of 1 2  in the trailing four quarters  However  the company s Zacks Rank  4  Sell  when combined with an Earnings ESP of 0 00   makes surprise prediction difficult  Its Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate   both stand at  1 54 Of late  Kimberly Clark has been seeing sluggish top line growth  evident from organic sales growth of just 3  in the last quarter  Further  unfavorable currency and increased competition are eroding sales growth  In such a scenario  the company is relying on cost saving measures and restructuring programs to drive earnings  It is also striving to reduce expenses and buying back shares in order to boost its profits  Kimberly Clark anticipates the trend to continue in the third quarter as well  Hence  we are not very optimistic about its results in the upcoming quarter

126982,348497,KMB,Beat The Market For The Rest Of 2016  and Beyond ,opinion,"With all of the major indexes breaking out to new all time highs  there are plenty of investors handily beating the market  


So why are so many other investors underperforming the market  


Could it be that one of the reasons why so many people are not seeing the kinds of returns they want is because they don t know of new stocks to get into  They find themselves in mediocre stocks because they don t know of anything better instead  


I think that for some  their knowledge or  universe  of familiar stocks is relatively small and this limits their opportunity of getting into better ones  
Which Half Are You In  


More than half of the companies in the S P are beating the index and showing positive returns for the year  But that means nearly half of the stocks in the S P 500 are underperforming the Index  


Even  good  companies like Kimberly Clark  NYSE KMB   they re down  10 61   Or Nike  NYSE NKE   which is down  17 95   Or even Under Armour  down  25 87   So what gives  


I don t single these out so you can feel bad if you have them  But instead  to stop and think about  why  you have them  


Nobody invests so they can underperform the market  But if you are    why  You don t have to  If you re underperforming the market  that means you have more of these types of laggards in your portfolio than leaders  


More

How the Other Half Lives 


Of course  there are a lot of big names beating the S P too  Take Mattel  NASDAQ MAT   or Archer Daniels  or FedEx  NYSE FDX  for example  All are outperforming the S P with gains of 14   19  and 26  respectively  


But now let s move outside of the S P  


Did you ever hear of a company called Cognex  What if you did  It has outperformed the market by gaining 75 99  since the start of the year  Or Fabrinet  They re up 83 17   Or Koppers Holdings  Up over 113    By the way  these are all Zacks  1 Rank stocks   


There are hundreds and hundreds of stocks producing fantastic gains that many people may never have even heard of  


What about you  How many times have you heard about a stock or read about a stock that skyrocketed    only to think to yourself   if only I knew about that stock ahead of time  I would have been in that   
Expand Your Universe and Pick Better Stocks 


Increasing your stock knowledge and awareness of new and better stocks is easier than you think  And you don t have to re invent the wheel  


  For example  over the last 28 years  the Zacks  1 Rank stocks have beaten the S P 500 in 23 of the last 28 years  with an average annual return of 25 6  a year vs  the market s 10 2   That s nearly 3 times the returns of the S P with an 82  annual win ratio

Once you know what to look for  and how to pick better stocks  it can transform your portfolio  


You don t need to turn yourself into an analyst to beat the market  Just focus on what works  and apply those methods consistently  
Leadership 


For most of us  our investments are the largest  most important chunk of money we ll ever be responsible for in our entire life

126984,348499,KMB,Consumer Staples Stocks To Avoid Or Buy In December,opinion,"The consumer staples sector has been on a roller coaster ride of late  This has put risk averse investors in a fix as to where to park their investments in such a scenario 
Looking at the third quarter earnings season  which has just ended  we note that while there were many consumer staple stocks which had put up a strong performance  many others suffered due to a volatile macroeconomic environment 
A host of factors have been plaguing the global economy  Headwinds like unfavorable currency  food deflation  declining volumes  potential price wars  a competitive environment  slowdown in international markets and other global issues adversely impacted the consumer staple stocks in the quarter 
The decline in consumer confidence   a key determinant of the economy s health   in October also hurt the investors  sentiments  The probable interest rate hike by the U S  Federal Reserve in December has further spurred market volatility and unnerved investors 
Stocks to Avoid
Given this backdrop  this may be the right time for investors to reshuffle their portfolio and consider avoiding these consumer staple stocks  which are not capable of delivering desired returns  These stocks have delivered sluggish results in their recently reported third quarter and continue to expect weakness in the near term 
Dull Third Quarter Results
Some consumer staple stocks that were hit hard after their last quarterly earnings release included Treehouse Foods  Inc    NYSE THS    Inventure Foods  Inc    NASDAQ SNAK    Kimberly Clark Corp    NYSE KMB   and Craft Brew Alliance  Inc    NASDAQ BREW   
On Nov 3  Treehouse Foods reported weaker than expected third quarter 2016 earnings and revenues and lowered its earnings guidance for the full year  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  stock has tumbled 19 9  since then  in comparison to the Zacks categorized Food Miscellaneous Diversified Market industry s 1 65  slip 
The company anticipates the overall food industry to be sluggish and full year revenues for the industry to be flat  Moreover  foreign exchange headwinds will continue to challenge margins  Estimates have also been declining for full year 2016 and 2017 over the past 30 days period TREEHOUSE FOODS Price and Consensus
    Kimberly Clark reported lower than expected earnings and revenues in the third quarter of 2016 results  in stark contrast with stellar results in the preceding quarter  This consumer product giant further lowered its 2016 guidance for earnings and organic sales 
Kimberly Clark has been witnessing slackness in organic sales over the past few quarters  Also  currency volatility and higher marketing expenses remain matters of concern for the company  This Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock has slumped 9 18  on a year to date basis 
Additionally  it has underperformed the Zacks Categorized Consumer Products Miscellaneous Staples industry  which slipped 2 11   In addition  the stock has been witnessing negative estimate revisions over the past 60 days for the current quarter and full year 2016 and 2017 KIMBERLY CLARK Price and Consensus
    Inventure Foods reported lower than expected earnings and revenues in the third quarter of 2016  Further  Inventure has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year  A Zacks Rank  5 further confirms weakness in Inventure INVENTURE FOODS Price and Consensus
    Another stock which performed dismally was Craft Brew  On Nov 3  the company reported softer than expected earnings and revenues in the third quarter of 2016 results  which led to a 9 5  decline in the share price  Moreover  Craft Brew holds a Zacks Rank  5 and has been witnessing negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year over the past 30 days CRAFT BREW ALLN Price and Consensus
    Economy Stable Ahead
Despite a slight decline in October  consumer confidence made an impressive turnaround in November  in the process hitting a nine year high  According to The Conference Board  the Consumer Confidence Index increased to 107 1 in November  touching its highest since Jul 2007 
The Present Situation and Expectations Indices were also up 7 2 and 5 7 points from October to 130 3 and 91 7 in November  respectively  This indicates that the Presidential election could not dampen consumer spending  In fact  analysts believe that the market anticipates Trump s policies to spur growth and stimulate the economy in the form of tax cuts and reinvestments into sectors like defense and infrastructure 
That s why it may be a good idea to invest in consumer related stocks at this juncture  as they are considered a  safe  option because of the sector s inherent defensive nature  Surging consumer confidence and definite signs of near term economic recovery is making the consumer staple sector attractive  However  picking the winning stocks may prove to be quite difficult 
This is where our  comes into play  Here  V  stands for Value   G  for Growth and  M  for Momentum  and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select the sure winners  But it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score 
We have narrowed down our search to the following two stocks based on their VGM Score of  A  combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   These stocks also have positive estimates revision and their share prices are trending higher than the industry average

Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   JNJ   Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   WFC  and Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   WMT  
Johnson   Johnson shares have bucked the broader healthcare slump this year and are up almost 9  year to date  While the company is faced with a number of headwinds like unfavorable currency movements  increased competition from generics  pricing pressures and an uncertain global macroeconomic backdrop  the analyst believes that JNJ s diversified business model  deep product pipeline  lack of cyclicality and financial strength position it for continued momentum going forward 
We saw this in the company s Q3 earnings report when it beat on the top  and bottom lines and provided favorable outlook  The analyst expects these trends to continue in the coming periods as well   You can  
Wells Fargo has long maintained a reputation for disciplined and reliable operations and an attractive retail banking franchise  Recent quarterly results showing strong growth in loans and deposits reconfirm the bank s inherent strengths  but they have been totally offset lately by the sales practices controversy that has already cost the well regarded CEO his position 
The new management team is making all the right moves and further downside risks in the stock may be low at this stage  the stock is down only 0 1  year to date vs  a roughly 14 6  gain for the peer banks   but it will likely take a while for clouds to fully lifted   You can   
Wal Mart s shares have surpassed those of other supermarkets  gaining more than 14  year to date  Though the company is facing a number of headwinds  estimates and share price of Wal Mart has been rising since the company reported its third quarter fiscal 2017 results  Wal Mart posted positive earnings streak for the fifth consecutive quarter  but top line marginally fell short of expectations after surpassing the same in the preceding two quarters  possibly due to deflationary pressure hurting comparable store sales 
Nevertheless  the analyst likes Wal Mart s focus on building its e commerce capabilities  forays into new markets  expanding product assortments and implementation of innovative ways to drive traffic   You can

Nevertheless  the economy is picking up steam with inflation gradually edging toward the desired 2  target and the job market gaining strength  According to the recent Conference Board data  the Consumer Confidence Index rose to 107 1 in November from October s upward revised reading of 100 8  and is at its highest level in nine years  The second estimate for GDP shows that the U S  economy grew 3 2  in the third quarter  faring better than the first estimate of 2 9  growth and an anemic increase of 1 4  in the second quarter 
Per the Labor Department  the economy added 178 000 jobs in November  significantly higher than the revised figure of 142 000 for October  The job additions were in line with expectations even as the unemployment rate declined more than expected  from 4 9  to 4 6  in November 
Given an improving labor market and the gradual rise in wages  we expect consumer spending to improve  This shows that the environment is much conducive now and Fed officials may look for a rate hike this December

	Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Johnson   Johnson  NYSE      Wells Fargo  NYSE     and Wal Mart  NYSE      

Johnson   Johnson shares have bucked the broader healthcare slump this year and are up almost 9  year to date  While the company is faced with a number of headwinds like unfavorable currency movements  increased competition from generics  pricing pressures and an uncertain global macroeconomic backdrop  the analyst believes that JNJ s diversified business model  deep product pipeline  lack of cyclicality and financial strength position it for continued momentum going forward 

	We saw this in the company s Q3 earnings report when it beat on the top  and bottom lines and provided favorable outlook  The analyst expects these trends to continue in the coming periods as well   You can  

Wells Fargo has long maintained a reputation for disciplined and reliable operations and an attractive retail banking franchise  Recent quarterly results showing strong growth in loans and deposits reconfirm the bank s inherent strengths  but they have been totally offset lately by the sales practices controversy that has already cost the well regarded CEO his position 

	The new management team is making all the right moves and further downside risks in the stock may be low at this stage  the stock is down only 0 1  year to date vs  a roughly 14 6  gain for the peer banks   but it will likely take a while for clouds to fully lifted   You can   

Wal Mart  s shares have surpassed those of other supermarkets  gaining more than 14  year to date  Though the company is facing a number of headwinds  estimates and share price of Wal Mart has been rising since the company reported its third quarter fiscal 2017 results  Wal Mart posted positive earnings streak for the fifth consecutive quarter  but top line marginally fell short of expectations after surpassing the same in the preceding two quarters  possibly due to deflationary pressure hurting comparable store sales 

	Nevertheless  the analyst likes Wal Mart s focus on building its e commerce capabilities  forays into new markets  expanding product assortments and implementation of innovative ways to drive traffic   You can

Stocks in Asia finished mostly higher on Monday as investors may have been exercising some caution ahead of a couple of high profile central bank monetary policy meetings taking place later this week in the U S  and Japan  Japanese equities finished slightly to the downside  but mostly flat as the island nation reported a larger than expected trade surplus for June  though exports were shown to have declined for the ninth consecutive month  Stocks traded in both Mainland China and Hong Kong finished slightly higher with some volatile trading occurring on lower than average volume as traders in the world s second largest economy may be searching for some economic clues as data from the country is expected to be light for the week  Meanwhile markets in Australia  South Korea s and India finished higher

4 Great Dividend Stocks in the Consumer Staples Sector

The consumer staples sector has been performing really well among most product categories over the past few months  despite tepid economic figures  Brexit aftershocks  the Federal Reserve s reluctance to hike rates and other global growth issues 

Further  lower gas prices and increasing consumer confidence are doing the trick for these stocks  Also  the sector has the potential to counter headwinds stemming from the global market turmoil and continued volatility in the equity market 

We note that the GDP has expanded at a slower rate in the second quarter than earlier estimated  thus leading to concerns about the health of the economy  However  the largest contributor to U S  GDP  consumer spending  experienced a significant upward revision  In fact  there is enough evidence to suggest that a strong rebound is likely in the third quarter  owing to improved residential construction and strong labor market conditions  Meanwhile  the reduction in business inventories  the primary culprit when it comes to a fall in estimated GDP  is expected to give a boost to the industry as it will result in a buildup of fresh inventories 

The Winning Strategy

In the face of prevailing economic conditions  we believe investors should be very careful about their strategy  Thus  investing in the consumer staples stocks is safe because of their defensive nature 

With the U S  economy picking up steam  investors should venture into dividend stocks  Not only do these stocks offer higher income in the current low rate environment but also provide a cushion against equity market risks 

Moreover  dividend stocks are historically less volatile and are proven outperformers over the long term  These stocks are a safe bet as dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty 

4 Dividend Yielding Consumer Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio Now

The following stocks are good bets as all of them offer a dividend yield of above 2  and flaunt a solid Zacks Rank  These consumer staples stocks provide generous dividends and possess upside potential 

Kimberly Clark Corporation     

Delaware based Kimberly Clark has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and a dividend yield of 2 86   It is one of the leading players in several consumer product categories including diapers  paper goods  and female personal care 

The company is cash rich and has a consistent track record of returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividend payments and share buybacks  It returned  2 1 billion in 2015   3 3 billion in 2014 and  2 4 billion in 2013 to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends 

For 2016  the company expects to repurchase shares worth  600  900 million  It also expects to increase the dividend at a mid single digit rate  consistent with the 5  growth in adjusted earnings per share delivered in 2015 

The company has increased its annual dividend for 44 consecutive years  including 4 5  in 2016  4 8  in 2015  3 7  in 2014  9  in 2013  9 5  in 2012 and 6  in 2011 

Altria Group  Inc    

Marlboro maker  Altria Group is one of the leading manufacturers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products in the U S 

Altria boasts a solid balance sheet and regular shareholder returns  This Zacks Rank  3 company has consistently raised its dividend and has a dividend yield of 3 42   Last Friday  Altria Group s board announced an 8  hike in its quarterly dividend to 61 cents per share  The new dividend will be paid on Oct 11  to shareholders on record as of Sep 15  2016 

The cigarette maker regularly returns value to shareholders and since the spin off of Philip Morris International Inc  NYSE PM   in 2008  the company has raised its dividend 50 times in 47 years  Also  the company has a dividend payout ratio target of around 80  of adjusted earnings per share 

The J  M  Smucker Company    

OH based Smucker is the leading marketer of jams  jellies  preserves  and other fruit spreads in the U S  It currently holds a Zacks Rank  3 

The company has been increasing its rate of quarterly and annual dividends consistently  Last month  the board of Smucker approved a quarterly dividend hike of 12 0   thereby maintaining the trend of rewarding its shareholders consistently  The new dividend of 75 cents marks an increase from the previous quarterly dividend of 67 cents per share  Also  this dividend hike represents the fifteenth consecutive year of dividend growth  Currently  the food company has a dividend yield of 2 12  

Apart from increasing dividends  Smucker also repurchases shares consistently  In fiscal 2016  the company reduced its total debt by nearly  750 million  reflecting strong free cash flow  It also returned over  750 million of cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends 

Pinnacle Foods Inc    

NJ based Pinnacle Foods has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and a dividend yield of 2 24   It is a manufacturer  marketer and distributor of branded food products  primarily in North America 

Pinnacle Foods regularly enhances shareholder value through dividend payouts 

On Aug 17  the company s board approved a quarterly dividend hike of 12  to 28 5 cents per share  The new dividend is payable on Oct 10  2016  to shareholders of record as of Aug 30  The raise brings the annualized dividend to  1 14 per share  implying an increase from the previous annualized rate of  1 02 per share 

The recent announcement reflects the company s strong cash position  Notably  this was the fourth dividend increase by Pinnacle Foods since the initiation of its quarterly dividend program shortly after its IPO in Mar 2013  The last dividend hike of 8 5  to 25 5 cents per share was announced in Sep 2015

Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Kimberly Clark has been disappointing investors lately  which is driving its share price down 
In the last reported second quarter of 2016  the company witnessed sluggish organic sales growth of just 3   about 1  lower than expected  Emerging market organic sales growth of 5  was flat with the prior year quarter  Unfavorable currency and increased competition are also eroding sales growth 
In such a scenario  the company is relying on cost saving measures and restructuring programs to drive earnings  It is also striving to reduce expenses and buying back shares in order to boost its profits  Kimberly Clark expects the trend to continue in the third quarter as well 
Third quarter revenue is expected to be about  4 7 billion on 36 3  gross margin  
Of late  the company has been facing headwinds  which is pulling down its estimates  In mid July  Kimberly Clark suspended its operations in Venezuela without prior notice and fired around 1000 workers  thus violating the South American country s laws 
Moreover  a few law firms have filed a shareholder class action lawsuit against the company and Halyard Health  Inc    NYSE HYH    which was spun out of Kimberly Clark in Oct 2014  According to these firms  Kimberly Clark and Halyard made false and misleading statements regarding surgical gowns and knowingly provided defective surgical gowns to U S  workers amid the Ebola crisis  These allegations are dampening investors  confidence KIMBERLY CLARK Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

	Chicago  IL   June 9  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Consumer Staples  Part 3   including Unilever  LON ULVR  plc     Procter   Gamble Co      Kimberly Clark Corp  NYSE KMB       PepsiCo  NYSE PEP  Inc     and Pinnacle Foods  Inc      

	Industry  Consumer Staples  Part 3 

	Link  

	The recent disappointing jobs report has raised legitimate questions about the U S  economic outlook  These questions notwithstanding  the best one can say about the U S  economic outlook is that it can continue to muddle through at the growth pace of the last few years going forward as well  That isn t the case with the rest of the world  with the outlook for emerging markets  particularly China  notably uncertain 

	The Chinese economy has been struggling and its stock market saw a terrible sell off last year  The slowdown in China is lowering international revenues for U S  companies 

	Currency headwinds  uncertainty regarding the Fed rate hike  potential price wars  a competitive environment  slowdown in international markets  political turmoil in Russia  sluggishness in Japan and an unfavorable economic environment in Europe are some of the other headwinds for these operators 

	The best one could say about the outlook for consumer staples stocks at present is that the sector s perceived defensiveness should help them in the current uncertain environment  That said  the operating environment is far from friendly 

WEAKNESSES

Slowdown in Emerging Markets

	The majority of the global population lives in emerging economies  Due to a slowdown in income and consumption growth  affordability is low  Though there remains huge opportunity for sales growth in these markets  currently the state of affairs remains volatile  Besides China  which is struggling since the past few quarters  developing countries like Brazil and Mexico are facing economic slowdowns  The Middle East  Russia and Ukraine are witnessing continued political and civil unrest resulting in challenging operating conditions  Some developed markets are also facing weakness due to sluggish consumer demand 

	For example  consumer product company Unilever plc    witnessed some improvement in India and more stable conditions in China in 2015  but is still struggling with declining volumes in Brazil and a soft economy in Russia  The company is also witnessing weakness in the developed markets with little sign of recovery in North America or Europe  Moreover  it still remains cautious as consumer demand continues to be weak  Companies like Procter   Gamble Co      are also struggling with decelerating growth in the developing markets and currency headwinds 

Higher Operating Expenses to Limit Profits 

	Consumer staple companies tend to spend heavily on marketing and advertising  Though advertising strengthens brand appeal and helps to counter competition  it severely hits the profit margins of these companies  Companies like Kimberly Clark Corp      PepsiCo Inc      and Procter   Gamble have significantly stepped up their investments in marketing  innovation  R D  supply chain and capacity additions which will put pressure on profits  Pinnacle Foods  Inc      incurs higher expenses as a result of innovation and promotional activity

127059,348574,KMB,How Can You Avoid Value Traps In this Market  ,opinion,"Introduction
When the stock market turns bad  like it has been recently  investors find it extremely difficult to remain positive   As a result  people tend to be more cynical during bad times than they would normally be during better times   When this happens  it becomes all too easy to paint every stock in the stock market with the same negative brush   Since most stocks will  temporarily at least  experience falling prices during a bad market  the distinction between good stocks and bad stocks can become blurred 
As someone that believes in value investing  most of my work is focused on identifying strong and sound companies at attractive valuations   As I ve written in the past  stocks do not become attractively valued when they are popular   But more importantly  popularity is not always justified by strong enough fundamentals  just as unpopularity can occur in spite of strong fundamentals   Nevertheless  one of the most common refrains I often run into when I write about what I believe is a strong company that has become attractively valued is someone will call it a  value trap    Of course  this comment is typically applied when and because the company s stock price has fallen 
Nevertheless  since I am typically writing about companies that I believe are fundamentally strong and healthy  I tend to react to the phrase  value trap  with cynicism of my own   If I see a good company that I believe the market is valuing too low  I see it as a  value opportunity    However  my judgment is always based on my assessment of the company s true fundamental value regardless of stock price   In contrast  and in my personal experience at least  the vast majority of the time that people call a company a value trap is predominantly based solely on a falling stock price 
In reality  there are low valued stocks that are in truth value traps  and there are low valued stocks that are in truth value opportunities   Making the distinction is not always straightforward and easy  However  when you get it right  the profit opportunities can be extraordinary   In other words  if you can successfully identify a true value opportunity  you can make outsized returns at reduced levels of risk   In contrast  if you mistakenly invest in a true value trap  you end up with outsized losses at significantly higher levels of risk 
The Definition of Value Trap
I believe the most important step towards avoiding value traps is to start by precisely defining what a value trap actually is   The reason I believe this is so important is because I have personally found that many people have a vague definition of what a value trap truly is   For example  here is one definition for value trap I found simply through Google 
 INVESTOPEDIA DEFINITION of  Value Trap 
A stock that appears to be cheap because the stock has been trading at low multiples of earnings  cash flow or book value for an extended time period  Stock traps attract investors who are looking for a bargain because these stocks are inexpensive  The trap springs when investors buy into the company at low prices and the stock never improves  Trading that occurs at low multiples of earnings  cash flow or book value for long periods of time might indicate that the company or the entire sector is in trouble  and that stock prices may not move higher  
Notice how the above definition focuses heavily on stock price movement   Important fundamentals such as earnings  cash flow and book value are vaguely alluded to in the opening sentence   However  from that point forward the focus turns to stock prices   Indistinct statements about low prices that never improve  trading and long periods of time  and stock prices may not move higher  do not satisfactorily define the term for me   The above definition talks too much about price and not enough about intrinsic value 
Admittedly  fundamental deterioration is perhaps alluded to  but in my opinion not focused on or clarified enough   For me to consider a company a value trap  I have to believe that there is a permanent long term deterioration in the future fundamental strength and health of the company   To me  a company becomes a value trap when either it s on the verge of going out of business  or poised for a long protracted period of collapsing or even disappearing earnings  cash flows  and inevitably dividend cuts or elimination 
The purist value opportunity manifests when earnings  cash flows and dividends continue to grow or improve in spite of current price weakness   It is for these reasons that I believe in focusing on fundamentals first and foremost  with the primary objective of evaluating a company s intrinsic value   Once this is accomplished  and only when it is accomplished  will I even consider bringing price into the analysis   When I am confident that the current stock price is lower than my assessment of intrinsic value  I see opportunity  not a trap 
However  value opportunities can also be found with cyclical or semi cyclical companies as well  What makes these a little trickier is that both earnings and or cash flow can be in a temporary down cycle in conjunction with a falling price  The value opportunity occurs when price drops farther than temporary or cyclical fundamental deterioration warrants  In other words  the market overacts to normal cyclicality  This is where focusing on the dividend can identify a value opportunity rather than a value trap  If the dividend continues to rise in spite of cyclicality in earnings  attractive value is created representing opportunity  not a trap 
During Market Times Like These Remember Profitability Is A Major Component of Value
With this article my objective is to illustrate the important distinctions between a value trap and a value opportunity   However  I m going to try to keep it simple by offering two examples  one I consider a value opportunity and the other I consider a quintessential example of what a value trap truly is   Since a picture is worth 1000 words  I will present these examples by utilizing a series of earnings and price correlated  on each 
Pentair plc  PNR   Example of a Value Opportunity
By my definition  a true value opportunity occurs when the price of a stock falls below its intrinsic value   However  the sequence is in reverse   Before I even think about the price of a company  I focus my attention on its fundamental strengths as an operating business   Since my objective is to invest in the business  not the stock  I like to get a perspective on how business has been long term 
The following earnings and dividends only graph on my first example  the Dividend Champion Pentair  serves to illustrate my point   From an earnings perspective I see occasional periods of earnings cyclicality  but long term I see a profitable and growing enterprise   More importantly  since my primary interest in this business is based on its current yield and long term dividend record  I am very impressed by what I see   The honeydew green  white looking  line on the graph plots dividends per share since 1996   The consistent and steadily growing dividend is precisely what I m looking for 

Once I ve established a long term perspective  I turn my attention to more recent times   By shortening the timeframe from 2011 to current time I discover healthy growth of earnings  and a dividend income stream that has been growing at approximately 10  per annum   Therefore  although the long term record for this Dividend Champion was impressive  more recent earnings and dividends add to my confidence 
Furthermore  upon examining the rate of change of earnings growth for each successive year  Chg Yr  a couple of interesting facts come to my attention   For fiscal years 2013 and 2014 Pentair produced earnings growth of 34  and 18  respectively  see orange highlights    I also found it interesting that those earnings achievements followed a rather flat to slightly down 2012 earnings achievement 
But what really caught my attention were the estimates for 2015  which should be reported in the next few weeks  and the estimates for 2016   Earnings growth for 2015 will be tepid at approximately 2  relative to 2014 s 18  growth  with slight improvement estimated at 6  for 2016  see yellow highlights    Common sense suggests that those numbers could be disappointing to investors after following two excellent years of high growth   At this point  I m beginning to wonder what stock prices will look like relative to those fundamentals 

Now it s finally time to bring stock prices into the equation   I have established that this is a profitable company with a great dividend record  but I am also aware that earnings growth is expected to temporarily slow down a little over the next couple of years   Common sense would also suggest that the slowing of growth could have an impact on intermediate term dividend growth as well   Consequently  I now have a perspective that investors might be disappointed by those expectations 
Therefore  my next step is to overlay monthly closing stock prices on to the long term graph in order to establish a perception of how the market has historically valued this business based on fundamentals   For the long term perspective  I discover a very strong correlation between price and earnings over time   Additionally  I see brief periods of time where price becomes overvalued relative to earnings but quickly move back into more rational alignment 

When I once again shortened the timeframe but now include both earnings and price  I get a chance to analyze and evaluate the earnings and price relationship more clearly   Here is what I deduce and assess from the facts as they are presented   Stock price  the black line  rose strongly in 2013 on the strength of 34  earnings growth and valuation stayed high for most of 2014  on February 28  2014 P E ratio peaked at 24 5  but waned a little as earnings growth of 18  for 2014 was lower than the previous year   More simply stated  stock price was strong when earnings growth was strong  
However  as earnings weakened in 2015  the stock price reacted by drifting steadily lower throughout 2015   Although I consider this rational behavior for the most part  I also observed that the negative price action moved to the extreme   In other words  stock price fell farther than earnings results justified they should   Once the price went below the orange valuation reference line  I contend that a value opportunity is manifesting 

I applied a little deeper analysis by turning to FUN Graphs in order to review the 2015 quarterly earnings releases that have been reported thus far   This analysis further supports the reasonableness of the continuously falling 2015 stock price based on the fact that Pentair s 2015 earnings became slightly weaker with each passing quarter   In other words  this helps me understand why 2015 was a weak stock price performance year   Valuation was high based on the euphoria generated by strong earnings growth in 2013 and 2014  but 2015 s weaker results dampened investors  views   However  as previously stated  I believe that price has fallen too far creating a value opportunity 

My bottom line conclusions on Pentair based on the above analysis suggests a strong opportunity to purchase this Dividend Champion at a currently attractive valuation   In the past  the long term view suggests that periods of earnings weakness are often followed by periods of earnings strength   Moreover  although earnings growth has slowed down a little  the company is still profitable and still growing   Therefore  I believe the dividend is safe and very likely to continue growing as it has in the past   Consequently  I consider this company a value opportunity and worthy of the effort of a more comprehensive research and due diligence process  
Avon Products Inc   N AVP   Example of a Value Trap
As I previously suggested  I consider a company a value trap when there is a long and protracted period of fundamental deterioration   On occasion  I will accept a down year  however  I am very intolerant of a dividend cut   Clearly  as evidenced by the following graph  Avon has generated a steady decline of earnings since the end of 2008 

When monthly closing stock prices are added to the complete F A S T  Graphs  it is no surprise that stock price followed  nor is it a surprise that the company slashed its dividend   This is what a true value trap looks like  and it is materially different than what we saw above 
However  here is the interesting point about whether or not low valuation alone indicates a buying opportunity   I added a performance calculation from September 30  2011 to current   The first pop up on the graph indicates that Avon was trading at a low P E ratio of 11 7 at that time   This is lower than my typical fair valuation threshold of a 15 P E ratio  but that alone does not indicate low value   The P E ratio calculation was made on current earnings  and although it was low on that basis  it was extremely high on a forward earnings basis   Avon was a value trap because you would have lost approximately 78  of your investment to date  including dividends   because earnings continued to collapse 

Bonus   Overvaluation Trap  V F  Corporation  VFC  A Falling Stock Price Does Not Create a Value Opportunity Until It Does
Since this article is primarily addressing value traps  there is another kind of value trap that I believe is mostly unrecognized by many investors   This is what I refer to as an overvaluation trap   However  in this case the trap is not sprung by deteriorating fundamentals   Instead  it is the trap that many investors fall into when they overpay for a company with strong price momentum above what fundamentals would justify 
Even though this market is recently going through a significant correction by most people s standards  it does not simultaneously follow that all stocks are getting cheap   This especially applies to the retired dividend growth investor that covets Dividend Champions and Aristocrats   My analysis suggests that several Dividend Champions and Aristocrats have become significantly overvalued as a result of the recent long stock market s bull run   Some of them have already experienced moderate to significant price corrections in 2015 and thus far into 2016   Unfortunately  many still remain significantly overvalued based on fundamentals 
What frustrates me is the fact that some of my favorite businesses have currently entered the overvaluation trap category   Some of the more prominent names would include Kimberly Clark  N KMB   Hormel Foods  N HRL   Sherwin Williams  SHW  McDonald s  MCD  and Walgreens Boots Alliance  O WBA    However  the company I m featuring in this bonus section is V F  Corporation because it is a long way into its correction process   Therefore  VFC represents a classic example of an overvaluation trap that has been sprung 
As you examine the following earnings and price correlated graph  note how high valuation had gotten in 2014 and for most of 2015   Then further note how flattening earnings in 2015 brought valuations down to a more realistic level   When a company becomes overvalued  stock price becomes exposed to even the slightest bit of negative news 
The company is clearly a better valuation today than it was just a few short months ago   Moreover  current valuation could be reasonable enough to warrant consideration for the long term ownership   On the other hand  I would still not consider it a significant valuation opportunity   Nevertheless  the purpose of this example was to illustrate the reality of an overvaluation trap 

Summary and Conclusions
When you discover companies trading at low P E ratios you cannot automatically assume that they are attractive   If future earnings are expected to fall  and worse  if they are expected to fall for an extended period of time  then a low valuation could in fact be a value trap   On the other hand  if you discover a company trading at a low P E ratio that possesses healthy fundamentals  this could represent a valuation opportunity   It s important to make the distinction   Of course  the primary way to make that distinction is through comprehensive research and due diligence 
However  not all value traps are associated with apparent low P E ratios   Overvaluation traps can also be dangerous to long term results and represent taking on more risk than you should   In my experience  more people fall into overvaluation traps than low valuation traps   The former is rarely given consideration  and too many people eschew bargains when they appear  at least in my opinion   My advice   Do your homework and make your decisions on facts rather than emotions or opinions   And most importantly  never let irrational short term price movements drive your investment decisions  You can t predict them  or trust them

127069,348584,KMB,4 Dividend Aristocrats Could Be In Serious Trouble,opinion,"As an income investor  you ve probably heard of the illustrious    

These 54 companies have continuously raised their dividends over the last 25 years or more 

And because dividend growth   not just yield   is critical for achieving outperformance  the Aristocrats are popular investments for income seekers 

But some of these regal companies may be hiding behind their spotless reputation 

Just a little digging reveals that several of these lauded stocks are teetering on the edge of losing their Aristocratic rank 

Indeed  just because a stock has raised its dividend for a quarter of a century doesn t mean it ll continue to do so forever 

Thus  it s important to look at the financials of the 54 Aristocrats and identify which dividends may be in danger of a freeze  or even a cut 

First  let s take a look at the dividend payout ratio  Anything above 80  should be a red flag for investors  Yet  four of the Dividend Aristocrats  excluding HCP Inc  NYSE HCP   which  as a real estate investment trust  is held to a different standard  are above this important threshold 



The chart above shows both the 2014 dividend payout ratio and the trailing 12 month payout ratio  The latter gives an idea of whether the company is moving toward a more or less sustainable dividend  as its most recent quarter is included 

Now  let s take a closer look at these four companies to see whether their dividends are truly in danger 

Sysco  NYSE SYY   With a trailing 12 month payout ratio of 80 9    just slightly above our 80  threshold   Sysco is in the least danger of losing its title of Aristocrat  Still  the financial numbers aren t encouraging  Both revenue growth and net income have declined every year since 2010  and free cash flow has been in decline for just about three years now  In order to continue increasing its dividend  Sysco will have to make some tweaks 

Kimberly Clark Corp  NYSE KMB   This company has a trailing 12 month dividend payout ratio of 86 9   Though it s not above 100   which would be cause for immediate concern  KMB s financials are still worrisome  First  revenue peaked back in 2013  and then declined 6 8  last year  Even more shocking  net income dropped over 28  from December 2013 to December 2014  To top it off  free cash flow has been in decline since 2012  All in all  these aren t favorable trends for KMB 

AbbVie Inc  NYSE ABBV   Though AbbVie has only been around since 2013   which would render it unfit to be a Dividend Aristocrat   it was spun off from Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT   which had been paying a dividend since 1983  Currently  AbbVie s dividend payout ratio is well above 100   which is alarming  What s more  free cash flow has been in precipitous decline since 2012  In fact  ABBV s trailing 12 month free cash flow is just 49  of 2012 s level  Similarly  net income plummeted 57  last year  If ABBV continues down this path  its future as a Dividend Aristocrat looks bleak 

AT T  NYSE T   Finally  we come to the Dividend Aristocrat with the highest payout ratio  AT T s trailing 12 month dividend payout ratio is a brutal 168 1   more than double our payout threshold  That seems pretty damning  but not all of the financials are bad  For instance  its revenue growth has actually been increasing for over three years now  So  is the dividend in danger  The answer is  quite possibly  Consider the company s free cash flow  which peaked at  19 7 billion in 2012  but has since declined a whopping 49 7   If AT T wants to continue raising its dividend  it ll have to find a way to generate more cash flow going forward 

Bottom line  The Dividend Aristocrats represent the best of the best when it comes to consistent dividend growth  but it doesn t mean they re invulnerable 

Always be on the lookout for companies with excessively high dividend payout ratios  After all  you don t want to get stuck with a company that ends up freezing or even slashing its dividend ",2015-05-13,Wall Street Daily,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-dividend-aristocrats-could-be-in-serious-trouble-251649,251649
127070,348585,KMB,Here s The Best Way To Reinvest Your Dividends For Retirement  ,opinion,"Introduction
Reinvesting your dividends received from high quality dividend growth stocks is a great  relatively conservative and proven way to build wealth over the long term  This is especially true and appropriate for investors in the accumulation phase that are planning for future retirement  Accumulating additional shares of dividend growth stocks can  and will  provide an increasing and eventually larger stream of income available at retirement when income is needed most 
There are two primary strategies that can be implemented to reinvest the dividends provided from a portfolio of dividend growth stocks  First of all  most high quality dividend growth stocks investors have the option of enrolling in formal company dividend reinvestment programs  also known as DRIP plans 
When the investor formally enrolls in a dividend reinvestment plan  they will no longer directly receive their dividends in cash  Instead  the dividends will be automatically used to purchase additional shares of stock in the company  Also  if the company you own does not have a formal DRIP plan  many brokerage houses offer their own plans that will allow you to reinvest your dividends directly back into the company 
The second strategy for investors interested in investing their dividends is informally known as  collect and invest   With this strategy  the investor allows their dividends to accumulate and then personally picks and chooses which companies they will add this fresh and received dividend capital to  The central idea behind this strategy is to avoid reinvesting dividends into high priced or overvalued stocks and opting instead to reinvest accumulated dividends only into low priced or undervalued stocks 
Which strategy is the best way to reinvest dividends 
One of the most commonly asked questions I receive from dividend growth investors is which or what is the best way to reinvest their dividends  The following is a classic example of this question that I was recently asked 
 Reinvesting Dividends  Currently for both my taxable and IRA accounts I reinvest all my dividends automatically back into those companies every quarter  Is this the best approach or should I reinvest these funds in stocks that are currently  fair valued  every quarter  
In my personal opinion  both strategies are viable and attractive  Moreover  there are advantages and disadvantages to both  Automatically reinvesting dividends each quarter takes advantage of the underlying and proven principal of dollar cost averaging   but with a slight twist  I will elaborate more on the twist I m referring to later in the article  The primary benefit of this principle is that it takes all decision making  thought and emotion out of the equation 
If the price of the stock you are automatically reinvesting in is high  overvalued or expensive   your dividends automatically buy fewer shares  If the price of the stock you are automatically reinvesting in is low  undervalued or cheap   your dividends automatically buy more shares  Consequently  your money is in essence being more aggressive when prices are low and more conservative when they are high  In the long run  your average price will balance or average itself out  I am a big believer in dollar cost averaging  in over my almost 50 years in finance  I have seen it work quite well many times 
On the other hand  collecting dividends each quarter and then reinvesting them only in stocks that you feel are currently fairly valued is also a great strategy  In theory  you would be more likely to be making sound and more profitable investments with each dollar available  However  both judgment and time are required 
In other words  collecting dividends and then allocating them only to the stocks you feel are appropriate is both more research intensive and time consuming  Furthermore  both judgment and emotion are involved  Personally  this is the approach that I prefer and utilize  However  I am a professional that analyzes investments all day   every day  Therefore  I have the time  experience  and with all due humility  the knowledge to most effectively reinvest the dividends I gather into what I consider the best valued choices available at the time 
Consequently  I do not think either option is right or wrong  Moreover  I do not consider either option necessarily better or worse than the other  The best choice ultimately comes down to the one that each individual investor is most comfortable with and capable of executing  In the long run  I have seen both approaches succeed 
The Difference Between Dollar Cost Averaging And DRIP Investing  Dividend Reinvestment Plans 
DRIP investing plans  in essence  take advantage of the concept or principal of dollar cost averaging  However  there is a subtle difference based on the purest definition of dollar cost averaging  In its purest form  dollar cost averaging is mostly about applying a disciplined investment strategy  The discipline comes from investing a specific or equal amount of money over specific and consistent timeframes  For example  an investor might commit to investing  100  or  500  or  1000 each and every month for years  Here is the precise definition of  Dollar Cost Averaging  DCA courtesy of Investopedia 

 The technique of buying a fixed dollar amount of a particular investment on a regular schedule  regardless of the share price  More shares are purchased when prices are low  and fewer shares are bought when prices are high  

A DRIP plan  dividend reinvestment plan  works in the same disciplined fashion as dollar cost averaging  and therefore  offers similar benefits  However  there is a primary difference  but it is subtle in nature  When you are automatically reinvesting your dividends  the amount of money you are investing each quarter is not necessarily fixed 
If you are investing in Dividend Champions or Aristocrats  for example  your dividends are  in theory  increasing each year  Therefore  the total amount of money you are automatically reinvesting each year changes  You are still applying the discipline of investing on a regular schedule  quarterly   but the total amount of money you are investing varies each year  Nevertheless  you are still applying and receiving the benefit of buying more shares of stock when prices are low  and fewer shares when prices are high  Consequently  the averaging out aspect still applies  Here is the precise definition of a Dividend Reinvestment Plan courtesy of Investopedia 
  DRIP  A plan offered by a corporation that allows investors to reinvest their cash dividends by purchasing additional shares or fractional shares on the dividend payment date  
Reviewing the Theoretical Advantages and Disadvantages of DRIP versus Collect and Invest
I have already thoroughly covered the advantages of applying an automatic dividend reinvestment plan  DRIP   Nevertheless  the primary advantage is worth repeating and elaborating on  Every time an investor is required to make an investment decision  they are simultaneously placed in the position of making a potential mistake 
For example  a stock that they believe is undervalued based on current earnings  could be an illusion if future earnings collapse  In other words  their judgment and analysis could be in error  Furthermore  investors always face the innate emotional fight or flight response  In other words  it s often hard to invest in a stock after its price has fallen precipitously  Even though it might be the right long term decision  it s often quite difficult to pull the trigger 
Consequently  the primary advantage of a DRIP program is that it takes advantage of the principle of dollar cost averaging  while simultaneously taking out the risk of judgment and emotion  However  the disadvantage is that it s often hard for many investors to stick to the discipline  For example  it is often tempting to shut the DRIP program off during a major bear market  Ironically  bear markets have historically been the best time to become aggressive   not defensive 
In contrast  there can be significant advantages gained by applying the collect and invest strategy  In theory  if effectively applied  the collect and invest investor is never investing any of their money when stocks are overvalued  Therefore  in theory at least  their long term returns  including higher future potential income  will consequently be greater  The opportunity provided by investing every dollar  regardless of its source  at sound and attractive valuations can be profound  In other words  every dollar you invest is being aggressive and buying the maximum number of shares of stock during times when prices are low  undervalued   In the long run  only investing at sound valuation will pay off handsomely 
However  this strategy as previously indicated is much more research and time intensive  It takes time  effort and skill to be sure that all of your investments are being made at sound and attractive valuations  Additionally  as also previously stated  the individual investor also has to be effectively dealing with their emotions  Even though it has historically been profitable to invest during the throes of a bear market  it is also emotionally difficult to do  Most people don t like to invest when they are scared or unsure 
Examples of Collect and Invest
In order to illustrate the advantages of the concept  collect and invest  I will utilize two blue chip Dividend Champions  Both are extremely high quality companies with similar historical growth characteristics of earnings and dividends  Both of these examples also have calendar year ending fiscal years 
However  I consider one of them extremely overvalued and the other attractively valued  Additionally  both of these blue chip dividend stalwarts are currently offering yields just a little over 3   Importantly  this exercise is hypothetical  and therefore  for illustrative purposes only 
My first example is the Dividend Champion Kimberly Clark Corporation  N KMB   which is the company I consider currently overvalued  Kimberly Clark currently trades at a blended P E ratio of 20  With this in perspective  this means that I would have to pay  20 to buy one dollar s worth of Kimberly Clark s earnings in order to purchase the source of my dividends  Since I consider that a high price to pay for their earnings  I would not be inclined to organically add to this position with fresh capital at current valuation 
To me  the dividend I would receive from Kimberly Clark on the next payment would be fresh capital  Therefore  based on my judgment of current valuation  I would not be excited about having my Kimberly Clark s next dividend automatically reinvested  Regardless of the advantages of the principle of dollar cost averaging  I see this as a clear and vivid choice to not invest at this time  On the other hand  I would also interject that in order to successfully collect and invest  it s important to have a fairly valued alternative available when I receive and collect my dividend 

Fortunately  I do believe I have a viable alternative in Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ  with similar quality characteristics and historical fundamental metrics  Johnson   Johnson is also a Dividend Champion that possesses very similar historical earnings and dividend growth rates as Kimberly Clark  However  the primary difference is that Johnson   Johnson appears fairly valued currently  Consequently  I would rather add fresh capital to Johnson   Johnson at this time  than I would to Kimberly Clark 
In order to achieve a similar current yield on new shares purchased  I would only be required to pay  15 for one dollar s worth of Johnson   Johnson s earnings  That is a 25  discount to what I would have to pay to purchase more Kimberly Clark shares  But best of all  I am not giving up any growth potential in either earnings or dividends  Therefore  I am much more comfortable and motivated to purchase Johnson   Johnson today than I am Kimberly Clark 
The collect and invest strategy provides me the opportunity to make these kinds of strategic investment decisions  I don t need to be defensive with my dividend distribution from Kimberly Clark  instead  I can aggressively invest it into Johnson   Johnson at a much more attractive valuation  I consider this an advantage over a DRIP strategy  However  it does require me to spend the time and effort to conduct analysis  which is a disadvantage to a DRIP plan  Nevertheless  I believe that with this example  I would do better in the long run by collecting and investing into a better valued alternative 

The following historical performance reports on both Kimberly Clark and Johnson   Johnson clearly illustrate the similarities from a rate of return perspective of both companies  Although there is a slight total return advantage with Kimberly Clark  it s important to recognize that some of that has been achieved as a result of its current overvaluation  On the other hand  Kimberly Clark has produced more cumulative total dividend income than Johnson   Johnson in spite of its overvaluation 

I have prepared the following short video  no link required  comparison between KMB and JNJ on live  to illustrate the benefit of collecting dividends and reinvesting the proceeds into fairly valued selections  The primary benefit of collect and invest  although it does take work and effort  is the idea that dividends will be reinvested into stocks only when they are attractively valued 

A Dividend Reinvestment Comparison
For the reader s additional perspective  I offer a second set of performance results on both companies where dividends have been automatically reinvested at the end of each quarter  This would be analogous to a DRIP plan  and does illustrate the benefit of dividend reinvestment  In addition to the enhancements to both total cumulative income and total return  I suggest the reader focus on the column  End of Period   Shares   For retired investors in the accumulation phase  the additional shares purchased will represent additional sources of dividend income in retirement years 

The Difference Between Dollar Cost Averaging And Averaging Down
There is one additional financial term that I would like to discuss that relates to the concepts of dividend reinvesting presented in this article  When discussing these concepts with individual investors  I have often found them confusing the terms dollar cost averaging with averaging down  These are not the same thing  Therefore  I thought it might be helpful to clarify the differences 
The concept of averaging down implies adding more shares to a holding at prices that are currently lower than your original cost basis  To me this concept makes the most sense when you originally invested in a quality stock at fair value that subsequently fell to a level where it was significantly undervalued 
The reason I add this concept to this discussion on reinvesting dividends  is because it is a strategy that I often found useful when managing my dividend growth portfolios  especially when my dividend growth portfolio is already fully invested  Furthermore  it also represents an additional advantage of the collect and invest strategy   flexibility 
Conceptually  the collecting of dividends provides the source of capital that I can utilize to take advantage of an extreme opportunity if and when it occurs  If I was automatically investing my dividends in a DRIP plan  I might not have that opportunity  However  the key to the attractiveness of this strategy is the notion that the stock I am averaging down was initially purchased at an attractive valuation 
DEFINITION of  Average Down  courtesy of Investopedia 

The process of buying additional shares in a company at lower prices than you originally purchased  This brings the average price you ve paid for all your shares down 

Summary and Conclusions
First and foremost  I consider myself a fan and advocate of both DRIP plans and the collect and invest strategy  Over the past 4   decades  I have seen both dividend growth strategies produce excellent and successful results  Consequently  I don t believe there is clear cut evidence that suggests that one is better than the other  Both strategies possess advantages and disadvantages against the other  At the end of the day  it comes down to investor preferences and abilities 
DRIP plans provide discipline and take emotion and decision making out of the equation  With this strategy  your dividend investment process is on autopilot so to speak  The collect and invest strategy in contrast requires the inclination and desire to analyze the stocks in your portfolio  In the long run  you may be able to generate better returns  However  it comes at the price of effort and attention

127081,348596,KMB,BuyBack Yield Isn t The New Magic Bullet,opinion,BuyBack Yield is an interesting concept  and a useful tool as part of stock analysis  However  it SHOULD NOT be used as a security selection or rejection criterion without interpretation with other data  What seems good could be bad  and what seems bad could be good There are some advisors talking up BuyBack Yield as if it is some kind of new magic bullet for yield seekers  Well we think it ain t so It is a good idea for yield seekers to look for as much supplemental evidence of strength and shareholder reward as possible  and BuyBack Yield has a role in some cases as a preliminary indicator  However  BuyBack Yield can just as easily mislead you as point you in the right direction unless it is accompanied by careful consideration of other fundamentals  as well as industry and company specifics BuyBack Yield simply measures the percentage change in outstanding shares over a period of time The argument for BuyBack Yield is that if a company is using earnings to purchase its own shares  it is concentrating earnings   in effect yielding earnings to shareholders more efficiently than shareholders could do by receiving dividends  paying taxes on them and then purchasing more of the company s stock For dividend paying companies  a combination of dividends received and earnings accretion due to share buybacks creates an extra dose of value creation  That is an appealing argument for what some call  Total Yield   BuyBack Yield   Dividend Yield  Certainly the idea warrants measuring BuyBack Yield and Total Yield  but the data must be taken into context to avoid undue positive or negative views of a stock  and to avoid ranking stocks by Total Yield in a way that is misleading How Might BuyBack Yield and Total Yield Be Misleading If a company issues shares to acquire another company  even if the acquisition is accretive to earnings  the BuyBack Yield is negative and the Total Yield is reduced and may be negative  That would be misleading  unless you are simply opposed to acquisitions If a company issues shares to investors to raise more capital when the stock price is high  and the new capital is to be used for CapEx for business expansion  the BuyBack Yield is negative  but the implication may be positive If a company reduces its outstanding shares by a repurchase program when the stock valuation multiple is high  the BuyBack Yield is positive  but if the valuation multiple is unreasonably high and likely in your view to revert to a lower multiple  then that positive BuyBack calculation would be a false indication of a positive effectIf a company reduces its outstanding shares with a repurchase program  but at the same time awards executives boat loads of stock options  the intermediate term to long term value of the BuyBack Yield calculation could be very much in questionCompanies that step in with both feet to buy shares in a down market are often making a good choice  but the short term BuyBack Yield at that time cannot reasonably be projected into the future  and long term average BuyBack Yield may be distorted by a recent spike in share purchases due to a market downturn BuyBack Yield based on the past 12 months  as is the case with the NASDAQ BuyBack Index  is far less useful than dividend yield as a long term yield indicator  because share repurchase programs are often highly variable from year to year  whereas dividends have a far greater tendency to be carefully managed for consistency and growth You may be able to think of other examples  The point is that dividends are what they are   cash in your hand  but BuyBack Yield may or may not be as good or as negative as a simple calculation and or ranking would suggest We think BuyBack Yield is an interesting and useful tool  but one that must be taken in context of more information about why and how the BuyBack Yield came about  We think just looking at the 12 month BuyBack Yield is particularly dangerous for yield seekers  and instead or in addition investors should also look at multi year average BuyBack Yields EXAMPLE RAW DATA We identified the 135 stocks available in the USA as of 06 07 2013 with 3  or more in trailing yield  and 3  or more in dividend growth over the last 4 quarters  and also on average over 1  2  5 and 5 fiscal years  Within than universe  we looked at 12 month and 5 year BuyBack Yield Seagate Technology  STX  has the highest 12 month BuyBack Yield at 19 7   bringing the Total Yield to 23 2   But its 5 year BuyBack Yield is only 5 2    still a nice number  but no where near 19 7  We would suggest a Total Yield of 8 7  is more reasonable than 23 2  for STX  We have not research the why or how their repurchases took place  but with this data simply illustrate the importance of taking a longer view of share repurchase behavior Here is a chart from YCharts com showing their trailing BuyBack Yield and dividend yield for the last 10 years   you can see the comparative irregularity of the BuyBack Yield versus the dividend yield  Along the same lines  Vodafone  VOD   which has a 5 3  dividend yield  has a 5 8  12 month BuyBack Yield  but only a 1 5  5 year BuyBack Yield   On the other side of the question  Raytheon  RTN  has a 3  12 month BuyBack Yield and a 5 3  5 year BuyBack Yield   Again  we have not researched the acquisition  CapEx  R D  or options granting behavior of these companies  but we think the raw data shows the high variability of BuyBack Yield data over different time periods  That argues against the 12 month approach for long term views  in our opinion   Some companies that appear to show good consistency  such as Chevron  CVX   which has a 1 8  12 month BuyBack Yield  and a 1 6  5 year BuyBack Yield have nonetheless significant variability on a period to period basis  while their dividend yield shows comparatively high consistency   What about companies with large negative BuyBack Yields  We don t think it tells you that much with capital intensive companies   Take Northeast Utilities  NU  for example  They have a negative 77  12 month BuyBack Yield  and a negative 14 1  5 year BuyBack Yield  and a 3 5  dividend yield  Assigning a negative 73 5  or negative 10 6  Total Yield to them seems rather useless  By the nature of the industry  their BuyBack Yields would tend to be negative   Of the 18 Utilities in the 135 stocks in our sample  only 3 have positive 12 month and 5 year BuyBack Yields  Maybe they are doing well  or maybe they have declining demand  or are deferring CapEx  We would have to look into that  and in fact intend to do so  but overall utilities and BuyBack Yield may not go together well   Those three positive BuyBack Yield utilities are  Wisconsin Energy Corporation  WEC   Alliant Energy Corporation  LNT  and Dominion Resources  D   Their 10 year BuyBack Yields are shown in this chart   There is a slight difference in the data in our source database and the one used by YCharts  but the numbers are close enough for illustrative purposes  Different databases almost always have some differences  and virtually all databases contain some errors  so don t get too lathered up about small discrepancies  and before making final decisions check original sources   Another interesting example is Enterprise Products Partners LP  EPD   the largest pipeline MLP   Their dividend yield is about 4 4   Their 12 month BuyBack Yield is positive 0 8   but their 5 year BuyBack Yield is negative 38 4   Which would you use for Total Yield   We wouldn t use either one  because MLPs payout most of their cash flow and must either issue more shares or borrow more money to expand  Eventually there are borrowing limits  and parent entities might typically take shares for asset  drop downs  into MLPs  In any event  we don t think BuyBack Yield is useful for companies like this  The same may be true for REITs  Consider Digital Realty Trust  DLR   with a negative 18 1  12 month and negative 13 9  5 year BuyBack Yield  Equity REITs payout most of their cash flow and need to borrow or issue shares to expand There are companies  though  where BuyBack Yield does make sense to us  and may help identify better opportunities  Kimberly Clark  KMB   GlaxoSmithKline  GSK  and McDonalds  MCD   may be examples  They have been reasonably consistent in their repurchases  but also stepped in big during the 2008 crash when they could buy earnings cheaply  BUYBACK ACHIEVERS ETF  There is an ETF that focuses on the NASDAQ BuyBack Achievers index  based on trailing 12 months of outstanding shares data  PowerShares BuyBack Achievers Portfolio  PKW   It has done very well  beating the S P 500  SPY  and the S P 1500 High Yield Dividend Aristocrats  SDY    That does not however  mean that BuyBack Yield is an effective universal tool to evaluate effective Total Yield to shareholders  What it means is that recent strong share repurchases correspond to near term subsequent price increases  We give that approach full kudos  but we caution not to extrapolate that phenomenon to the yield seeking goal  They are two different things   To be eligible for inclusion in the index  a stock must have repurchased at least 5  of its outstanding shares in the past 12 months  The index is rebalanced quarterly   Here is price performance  PKW wins  Here is the rate of change of dividend payment amounts for the ETFs  The share repurchase criterion does not correspond to a superior rising dividend CONCLUSION We recommend looking at BuyBack Yield as part of your stock evaluation process  but also looking past BuyBack Yield as to why and how it cam about before relying upon it as a yield seeking investor ,2013-06-16,Richard

127084,348599,KMB,Kimberly Clark  Storied And Consistant ,opinion,"Kimberly Clark Corporation  NYSE KMB  is a storied company and often a reasonable investment opportunity based on ordinary metrics 
Frequently investors view these few basic metrics and come to an investment decision 
With this article we would like to highlight additional fundamental data on this specific company that that might be useful 
If you ve ever had a baby  a cold or used a restroom  not necessarily in that order  you likely have a pretty good idea what Kimberly Clark does  Headquartered in Dallas  Texas  this consumer care company sells products in more than 175 countries with 5 billion dollar brands including  Huggies  Kotex  Scott  Pull Ups and Kleenex  With a history dating back over 140 years  the company now employs 58 000 people worldwide 
Ordinarily we might go through an analysis using the most recognizable items of the company   such as the current P E   normal P E   earnings growth and dividend yield along with the company s estimated future possibilities  Further  we often like to point out the folly of viewing price only graphs and instead emphasize the relationship between both price and business results  However  for this article we wanted to take a slightly different view of the company by focusing on a variety of additional fundamental metrics  To accomplish this  we thought it might be  FUN    pardon the pun   to use the Fundamental Underlying Numbers  FUN  Graphs as provided by  
To begin  let s look at the difference between viewing metrics on the company level and on a per share basis  For instance  below we have included a graph showing total revenue  rev  for the company over the past decade and a half  We can see that sales moved from about  13 billion in 1999 to today s number closer to  21 billion  Expressed differently  the company was able to grow total sales by about 3 5  a year   ahead of the inflation rate during this time period  but only by about 1  annually 

So to begin you might not think that the company has been altogether impressive   consistent  but not the fastest of growers  Yet contrast this graph in comparison to the revenue per share graph below   it s the same fundamental data item  just a different way to measure it  In this case we can see that revenue per share  revps  went from about  24 to  55   a 6  yearly compound gain  Said in another way  total revenue for the company grew at 3 5  per annum while revenue per share grew by 6   Kimberly Clark goes from a company growing with inflation to a company in the middle of the growth spectrum pack 

Of course the underlying reasoning behind this discrepancy relates to the number of common shares outstanding  Before presenting the graph below  we already know that Kimberly Clark has an effective share repurchase program  By viewing the common shares outstanding  csho  this inference can be confirmed  In 1999 Kimberly Clark had 544 million shares outstanding as compared to just 381 million today  That s a 2 5  yearly reduction and directly explains why revenue per share growth can consistently outpace total sales growth 

In finding this information  one s analysis may be positively influenced  For instance  last year Kimberly Clark sold about half of its products in North America and the other half around    Looking forward  perhaps your analysis of the company were to suggest that North American sales would remain flat while revenue in the emerging and developing markets grew at say 7   not too dissimilar from recent history   As such  you might imagine that the company grows sales at 3 5  per year  Yet keep in mind  as we just saw  that this could easily translate to 6  revenue per share growth 
Now this is just a single demonstration  but it largely holds for any metric   such as earnings or dividends  Even if a company  as a whole  can only grow by a small margin there are factors at play that differentiate the prospects of company growth versus per share growth  In the very long term these are likely to converge  but for sustained periods per share growth can easily outpace total company growth  This illustration simply demonstrates that 4  growth could actually mean 6  or 7    even without cost cutting or improved margins 
A second example of looking beyond the normal metrics comes in the form of dividends  Ordinarily one might note the dividend yield and move on to the next metric   without considering some underlying tenets  For instance  knowing that Kimberly Clark pays a dividend is a start  Knowing that Kimberly Clark has not only paid but also increased its dividend for 42 consecutive years is better  Yet perhaps most important is whether or not this payment is sustainable  A short cut would be to check out the company s earnings and find a payout ratio ranging from 50  to 56  in the last few years  Conceivably the best option is to compare the cash inflows to the major outflows  This is precisely what we have done in the graph below 
In this graph we see cash flow per share  cflps  as the top  light blue line in comparison to both capital expenditures per share  capxps  and dividends paid per share  dvxps   Note that in no year since the turn of the century has the combination of dividends paid and capital expenditures exceeded cash flow  We suppose that s somewhat recognizable considering our earlier presentation of the company s strong and consistent buyback program  Nonetheless  it s reassuring to see that the company you are invested in or are considering partnering with has enough inflows to cover its outflows 

Moving forward you can keep this in mind   if you assume dividends will continue to increase  you might also want to be confident that cash flows will continue to cover these obligations  In other words  you should have an expectation about the company s returns and whether or not they will persist moving forward 
For instance  below is Kimberly Clark s return on equity  roe  and return on invested capital  roi   We can see that while the ratios have been somewhat volatile  they have historically been quite reasonable  Return on equity has regularly stayed above 20    sometimes much higher   and return on invested capital has hovered around the 15  mark 

Likewise  the company s margins have been largely consistent  Gross profit margin  gpm  has been in the low 30  range while net profit margin  npm  has inched up near 10   Now it is true that there is a somewhat downward trend   possibly due to generic competitors  pricing wars  discounting options or a combination of the three   but for the most part the healthy margins have remained intact 

Using history as one s guide  your investment thesis shouldn t simply revolve around whether or not the company has a reasonable dividend yield but more aptly as to whether you believe the current margins and returns can be sustained  thereby increasing the likelihood of increased cash flow and an ample amount of inflow coverage 
Finally  there are far too many additional metrics one might view than could be included in a single article  but we would like to end on the concept of valuation  Ordinarily you might look at the P E ratio primarily   as it s often the most readily available  For instance  F A S T  Graphs provides 5 earnings mnemonics   which correspondingly have 5 different P E ratios  Each one can be useful in their own way  but really these metrics are often more similar than they are different  For instance  below we have included a graph looking at price to basic earnings  peb   price to diluted earnings  ped  along with price to operating earnings  peo   Sure they re not precisely the same  but by and large they move in tandem  

To supplement this view  a potential investor might look to other valuation metrics that aren t as apt to be nearly as correlated  For example  below we have included the price to book  pb  ratio for Kimberly Clark  You can see that it had ranged from 3 5 to 7 4  and last year stood near the upper end of that range   at 6 6 

Or you might also be inclined to view Kimberly Clark s price to sales  ps  ratio  We can see that this ratio ranged from 1 1 to 2 8  has been trending downward in the last few years and presently sits at about the same level as it did prior to the recession 

Overall we believe Kimberly Clark is a storied and consistent company  Ordinarily we might be inclined to view the company primarily through the lens of the Earnings and Price Correlated graph in F A S T  Graphs  However  for this article we thought it might be  FUN  to look at a variety of different  less observable  fundamental metrics  At the end of the day we come to a similar conclusion as we would have by viewing the F A S T  Graphs you have become accustomed to   Kimberly Clark has the opportunity to grow per share metrics in the mid single digit range and continue to increase its well covered dividend  yet shares are trading at the higher end of the valuation range than they might normally  Further  you still have to make predictions about the company s future  But the important part is that coming to the analysis from a different angle allows you to more easily illuminate the underlying drivers of performance   and perhaps it will even make the process a bit more enjoyable  As always  we recommend that the reader conduct his or her own thorough due diligence

127088,348603,KMB,This Stock s Dividend Has Grown For 40 Straight Years,opinion,In this low interest rate environment  investors have turned to high yielding blue chips as a source of retirement income  This five part series will outline what we believe to be the top five dividend aristocrat stocks  most suitable for a retiree s portfolio    In recent years  retirement planning has become a whole lot harder  With interest rates near all time lows  keeping money in the bank just doesn t add up    One key alternative is the stock market  Although investing in stocks can at times be tricky  a safe haven is high quality  defensive  dividend paying stocks  Within this group are my favorites  the  dividend aristocrats  Dividend aristocrats are companies listed on the S P 500 that have increased their dividend every year for at least the past 25 years  These stocks have weathered many storms  They are companies with stable and reliable business models  Most often  they are solid money makers  While creative accounting can mask shortfalls in revenues and sometimes even earnings  it can t hide rising dividends for very long    One of my favorite dividend aristocrats is consumer staples giant Kimberly Clark  NYSE  KMB    This international health  hygiene and paper company operates in more than 150 countries across the globe  Its most popular brands include Kleenex tissue  Scott toilet paper  Huggies and Pull Ups diapers  Kotex sanitary products and Depend incontinence products  Aggressive cost cutting  expansion into emerging markets and the introduction of higher end  higher margin products are factors that have been driving the stock higher    But  what makes the company so attractive  in addition to its capital gains potential  is its healthy dividend and solid projected revenue and profit growth outlook    This dividend aristocrat currently offers a healthy 3 8  annual yield  In contrast  interest rates on 10 Year U S  Treasury notes are currently around 2 1   just more than half of the Kimberly Clark yield    Kimberly Clark s dividend has consistently increased for the past 39 years  Best yet  the company just increased the dividend again    marking the 40th straight year of dividend increases    From a technical perspective  Kimberly Clark s stock is on a strong growth trajectory   As the above chart shows  shares have been on a major uptrend for the past two years  In August 2011  an accelerated uptrend line formed as the stock rose from a low of  59 17 to a late 2011 high of  73 49    The stock then entered a  U  shape basing pattern  Basing patterns are bullish and usually imply that the stock will move higher  When a stock completes a basing pattern or  breaks out   you can use a technical analysis concept called the measuring principle to forecast an immediate price target    I won t trouble you with the intricacies of this calculation    there s a detailed explanation of the measuring principle in the financial dictionary from Investing Answers  our sister site    but the stock should reach at least  77 20  about a 4  return from current levels  When dividends are factored in  the return to shareholders should be about double that  As the company grows earnings over time  the share price should also gradually increase    MACD  a buy sell indicator  appears to be giving a fresh buy signal  indicated by the black line crossing above the red  The MACD histogram has just risen into positive territory  Both of these are bullish technical signals     These bullish technicals are backed by strong a fundamental outlook  For the first quarter of 2012  increased demand in emerging markets cause revenue to notch up 4 0  to  5 20 billion    from  5 03 in the first quarter of 2011 For the full 2012 year  the 12 analysts following the company expect heightened demand will cause sales to increase 0 6   to  20 96 billion  up from  20 85 billion a year ago    With strong sales and higher sales volumes  analysts estimate full year 2013 revenue should rise a further 2 4  to  21 47 billion    The earnings picture is similar    For the first quarter of 2012  earnings rose 37 2  to  1 18 per share  up from  0 86 per share in the first quarter of 2011 With expansion into international markets  the company projects full year 2012 earnings to be in the range of  5  5 15 per share    a 4  to7  increase from earnings of  4 80 per share in 2011    As international growth continues  analysts project full year earnings in 2013 to increase a further 7 8  to  5 50 per share  As earnings grow  the share price should rise along with it providing strong  stable returns over time    Risks to Consider  As with any investment  there are risks to consider  If inflation heats up and material costs rise  Kimberly Clark s profit margins could be negatively affected  Furthermore  if international expansion slows  so would overall growth     However  given that the company makes essential products  many of which cater to an aging population  the company should be able to maintain its large customer base  As well  since the company offers an attractive  stable dividend  shareholders are likely to keep sustained interest in the stock  by Dr  Melvin Pasternak,2012-04-27,StreetAuthority,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-stock's-dividend-has-grown-for-40-straight-years-121493,121493
