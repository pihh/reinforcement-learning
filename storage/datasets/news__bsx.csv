200238,421754,BSX,What to Like    and Dislike    About Boston Scientific s Q4 Results,news,"You might say that Boston Scientific  NYSE BSX  delivered an average performance in 2019  But while the stock delivered a gain that nearly exactly matched that of the S P 500 index last year  it s hard to look at a 28  jump as just average 
This year hasn t started off as positively for the medical device maker  though  But Boston Scientific announced its fourth quarter results before the market opened on Wednesday  giving investors some good news    along with some news that wasn t as good  Here are the highlights from the company s Q4 update 

By the numbers
Boston Scientific reported fourth quarter revenue of  2 91 billion  This reflected a 13 4  year over year jump  but it fell a little short of Wall Street s consensus Q4 revenue estimate of  2 92 billion  However  the revenue figure was within the company s guidance for the fourth quarter 
The company announced net income of  4 billion  or  2 83 per share  in the fourth quarter based on generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP   This represented a significant improvement from GAAP net income of  386 million  or  0 27 per share  reported in the same quarter of 2018  
Boston Scientific posted adjusted net income of  0 46 per share  up from adjusted earnings of  0 39 per share in the prior year period  It also beat the analysts  average earnings estimate of  0 44 per share 
Behind the numbers
The cardiovascular segment ranked as Boston Scientific s strongest unit in Q4  with sales jumping 18 7  year over year to  1 15 billion  Peripheral intervention products delivered especially strong growth  with revenue soaring 33 2  to  403 million  Interventional cardiology sales rose 12 1  to  748 million 
Sales for the company s MedSurg segment increased by 9 8  year over year in Q4 to  878 million  Its urology and pelvic health business led the way  with sales climbing 11 1  to  379 million  Endoscopy sales grew 8 8  to  499 million 
Boston Scientific s weakest link in the fourth quarter was its rhythm and neuro segment  Revenue for this segment rose 3 5  year over year to  817 million  Cardiac rhythm management sales slipped 3 3  from the prior year period to  473 million  This was offset by an 18 7  year over year sales gain for neuromodulation and a 3  gain for electrophysiology to  261 million and  84 million  respectively 
The company also reported  58 million in sales in Q4 for its specialty pharmaceuticals business  Boston Scientific picked up this business with its acquisition of BTG in August 2019 
Looking ahead
Some healthcare stocks are being impacted by the coronavirus outbreak in China that has also spread to other parts of the world  Boston Scientific isn t an exception 
The company expects revenue growth of between 10  and 12  in the first quarter of 2020  with organic growth of 5  to 7   This outlook includes a negative sales impact of between  10 million and  40 million due to the potential effects of the coronavirus scare on procedure volumes in China 
For full year 2020  Boston Scientific anticipates revenue growth to be in a range of 10  to 12   The company also projected 2020 earnings per share  EPS  to come in between  0 95 and  1 00  Adjusted EPS is expected to be between  1 74 and  1 79 ",2020-02-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/priph,2077003

2019 as we significantly strengthened our portfolio and capabilities for the future while delivering strong revenue and EPS growth  Consistent with the preliminary results we announced on January 14  we delivered 14 1  operational revenue growth and 7 3  organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter of  19  This represents excellent growth yet was below our organic revenue guidance of 8 to 9   due primarily to our US high voltage and US EP businesses  Importantly  operational growth outside of US in both CRM and EP were solid as were worldwide results in five of our other divisions  which all grew at or above market  and three posted double digit growth  interventional cardiology  urology  public health and endoscopy  With today s results  we disclosed adjusted EPS of  0 46 in Q4  exceeding the high end of guidance due largely to a  0 03 tax benefit  For the full year 2019  we delivered 11 1  operational revenue growth  7 3  organic revenue  a 60 basis point improvement in profitability to 26 1   and adjusted EPS of  1 58  which is up 13  over the prior year  which is also normalized for the  0 07 tax settlement benefit in 2018  We delivered these results while also generating approximately  2 billion in adjusted free cash flow  Our 2019 financials continue a five year trend of excellent results and provide solid evidence that our strategy of category leadership in key markets and portfolio diversification into higher growth adjacencies continue to deliver differentiated results  Our goal is to continue to execute against our strategic plan objectives  further increase our organic growth profile and deliver top tier sales and EPS growth results over the next five years  Boston Scientific brings a combination of long term  consistent  above market revenue growth  margin expansion  targeted double digit adjusted EPS growth and a greatly improved ability to deploy our strong free cash flow  and that is what we believe positions Boston Scientific to continue to drive compelling shareholder value  We re excited about our plans to build upon our momentum in 2020 and beyond  We re targeting 2020 operational revenue growth of 10 to 12   which includes approximately 350 basis points of growth from the Vertiflex and BTG acquisitions  resulting in full year 2020 organic revenue growth guidance of six and a half to eight and a half percent  Similar to the trend in 2019  given the ramp and timing of 2020 product introductions  acquisitions that will turn organic in the second half  as well as an expected negative first half impact of China procedure growth from coronavirus  we expect to see organic revenue accelerate in the second half of 2020 in comparison to the first half of the year by approximately 200 basis points  We re guiding to adjusted EPS of  1 74 to  1 79  representing 10 to 13  adjusted earnings growth  which includes a  0 04 to  0 05 of accretion from the BTG acquisition  as well as approximately 2 3 billion in adjusted free cash flow  I ll now provide some highlights of our fourth quarter and  19 results  along with our thoughts on 2020 outlook  Our revenue growth in this quarter was broad based across businesses and regions  led most notably this quarter by 13  operational revenue growth in the US  12  in Asia Pac and 10  in Europe and Middle East  Africa  Emerging markets had another outstanding quarter  growing operational revenue 16  in the quarter and 19  for the full year and now represent 12  of total company sales  So turning to each business  Our med surg segment represents 31  of our revenue mix in  19 and continues to deliver excellent results  with sales growth of 11  in the fourth quarter and 9  for the full year  Endo sales grew 10  in the quarter and 9  for the full year  with fourth quarter sales led by double digit growth in our biliary franchise and infection prevention franchises  Endo sales also are expected to decelerate slightly in first quarter 2020  where we re targeting full year growth acceleration in endo  given the breadth and strength of our category leading portfolio  as well as more significant contributions from the Exalt D single use scope launch in second quarter and beyond  I m also pleased to announce that Exalt D received CE Mark in late January  We ll begin the limited launch later this quarter  Our endo business is also advancing additional pipeline opportunities  including the Resolution Ultra hemostasis clip and the next generation Lotus therapeutic imaging portfolio called the SpyGlass Discover  which is a single use surgical scope  We continue to believe our therapeutic imaging portfolio represents a differentiated opportunity in  20 and an incremental 2 billion market opportunity by 2024  Turning to uro and pelvic health  This franchise also continued its excellent performance  growing organic sales 12  in the quarter and 8  for the full year 2019  with 15  full year operational growth  and that s despite a 170 basis point headwind for the mesh withdrawal  Fourth quarter strength was led by double digit growth in our single use LithoVue scope  core stone  Rezum minimally invasive therapy for BPH and almost doubling of SpaceOAR revenue  As a reminder  SpaceOAR Hydrogel diminished the risk of local undesirable side effects of prostate cancer  radiation therapy and continues to resonate in the marketplace and with patients  resulting in 100 million in sales in 2019  In addition  the Rezum system recently obtained expanded commercial coverage wins this year  including Anthem  Blue Cross Blue Shield and Cigna  We expect uro and pelvic health to deliver double digit revenue growth in 2020 and the continued progress of our broad portfolio and globalization efforts  Turning to global rhythm and neuro sales  which were 1  in the fourth quarter and 3  for the full year  and they represent 29  of our total mix in  19  Neuromodulation delivered fourth quarter organic revenue up 8  and operational revenue up 19   The full year organic sales were up plus 7  and operational sales were up 13   As detailed last month on our investor update on the recent NANS Annual Meeting  we remain very bullish on our comprehensive portfolio and exciting pipeline in both pain and brain modulation  Neuromod results for the quarter were led by doubling in sales of our precise DBS system  which offers unique directionality with our Cartesia Lead  Their ability to provide precise neural targeting with this lead allows physicians to optimize therapy and help reduce unwanted side effects for patients  This  in addition to the CE Mark approval of Neural Navigator 3  which integrates enhanced visualization with clinical programming to simplify and accelerate physician program  We expect continued strong momentum in DBS in 2020  Our global spinal cord stimulation sales also improved sequentially from third quarter to fourth quarter in  19  For the full year  SCS sales were down low single digits  but we believe the SCS market will return to growth in 2020  given low patient penetration rates  as well as new product launches and clinical data from our team and the industry more broadly  In SCS WaveWriter  the only platform approved by the FDA to provide simultaneously paresthesia based and sub perception therapy  which targets two different mechanisms of action at the very same time  not alternating them for patients suffering chronic pain  In our combo randomized clinical trial three month data presented at NANS last month  WaveWriter combination therapy demonstrated an 88  responder rate  which is one of the highest responder rates reported among other comparable SCS clinical studies  Also  our Vertiflex acquisition complements our RF ablation and SCS portfolio in pain and represents an important therapy for patients with moderate lumbar stenosis  Vertiflex performed well in the quarter and exceeded its full year pro forma  19 sales goal of 60 million  Turning to CRM  CRM sales fell 3  in the fourth quarter after growing above market in Q1 through Q3  They ended up 1  for the full year  The weakness in fourth quarter was caused primarily by mid single digit declines in the US ICD revenue with global ICD sales declining low single digits  Fourth quarter patient revenue  as expected  was down low single digits worldwide  And we believe that global ICD softness in fourth quarter was largely related to the tough comps we faced with a global mid single digit growth comp in fourth quarter  18  In addition  while we don t have all the fourth quarter inputs  our best estimate is the fourth quarter  19 worldwide CRM market  which excludes implantable cardiac monitors  likely declined low single digits  In 2020  we ll aim to continue to deliver above market growth in defib due to our longevity benefits  HeartLogic heart failure diagnostic and Emblem S ICD  In 2020  we remain on track to launch LUX DX  which is our implantable cardiac monitor  by midyear  but we do expect limited revenue contribution due to the revenue recognition policies  Overall  we expect worldwide CRM revenue to be more in line with the market in 2020  potentially flat to down low single digits  EP sales grew 4  in the fourth quarter  and for the full year  7   and US sales grew 8  in the quarter  Importantly  international sales continued to be very strong  up 15  in fourth quarter and up 16  for the full year  led by the launch of our DirectSense catheter in Europe and Japan  as well as continued double digit growth in major markets for our Rhythmia HDx mapping system  We also continue to enjoy strong response from Lumipoint  which is the next gen HD mapping algorithm that illuminates critical areas of the heart by utilizing user defined inputs to assist and map interpretation  We continue to enhance our pipeline globally in EP  and we re pleased to announce that we ve just received CE Mark for our Rhythmia single shot pulmonary vein isolation technology in Europe  We look forward to bringing Polar X to the market in Europe  as well as beginning enrollment in our US IDE trial  So overall  we do expect EP sales growth accelerate in 2020 as we re excited to enter the single shot market while continuing to increase our mapping and navigation footprints and also expanding the launch of our nav enabled catheter portfolio and adding new features to Rhythmia mapping  Turning to cardiovascular  This segment grew sales in fourth quarter 19  operationally and 10  organically  For the full year 2019  growth is 14  on an operational basis and 9  organic and accounted for 39  of our total company sales  Peripheral Interventions grew 4  in the quarter and 8  for the full year on organic basis  and 34  for the quarter and 19  for the full year operationally with the BTG interventional medicine acquisition  Legacy PI growth was driven by strong double digit growth in Asia Pac  offset by a slight decline in US sales due to tough comparisons from the US launch of Eluvia  as well as a competitor s manufacturing issue one year ago  The Interventional Medicine business performed in line with expectations  growing plus 7  pro forma with high single digit growth in interventional oncology  We expect similar global organic growth trends in PI in the first quarter of 2020 with acceleration thereafter on the integration of BTG  as well as important new product approvals such as Ranger DCB  which is supported by great new head to head data from the compare trial  which was just released last week at length  Interventional cardiology continues to grow nicely above market  delivering 13  organic and operational revenue growth in the quarter  For the full year  IC organic sales grew 10   which is a 550 basis point increase versus  18 while operational sales were up 11  for the full year  We delivered coronary therapies growth of 1  in the fourth quarter and 2  for the full year  Synergy Megatron is an important line extension to our market leading Synergy bioabsorbable polymer stent platform as its purpose built for large proximal vessels  Megatron will be    is launching in Europe now and is on track for a second half 2020 US launch  Strong structural heart sales then drove the IC sales of 13  overall in the quarter  Strong growth across our structural heart platforms led to achievement at the high end of our  19 revenue guidance of 700 to 725 million  which is up over 50  versus  18  Watchman achieved its strongest quarterly growth rates for the year in fourth quarter as we continue to focus on four important areas  Market development and education  continued pursuit of clinical evidence to understand the benefits of Watchman in broader patient populations  including lower risk patients to be enrolled in the head to head Champion AF study  No  3  product enhancements such as the next gen Watchman FLX  which is expected to launch in the US in second half of this year  And fourth and lastly  geographic expansion in Japan and other countries  Turning to TAVR  We continue to be pleased with the launch and progress of Lotus Edge and remain on track to open 150 accounts in the first 12 months post approval  We also recently received Lotus Edge reimbursement approval in Japan  We ll begin a limited market release over the coming months  Our supra annular valve offering  Accurate neo  grew mid teens in the quarter  and we look forward to launch of the next generation Accurate neo2 in Europe midyear  In Sentinel  which is the only cerebral embolic protection device  is now in over 600 US hospitals  We estimate that Sentinel is approaching 20  of the overall US TAVR procedural penetration  and we believe definitive evidence focused on a stroke endpoint will continue to elevate Sentinel to become the standard of care for all patients and will help influence future clinical guidelines  To that end  we look forward to beginning to roll in this quarter the protected TAVR randomized clinical trial  Finally  Mitral field  We are pleased to have entered the clinic in December in Australia with our Millipede full annuloplasty ring for mitral valve repair  We re targeting enrollment in our early feasibility study in the US by the end of 2020  So  with our portfolio of Watchman  Accurate  Lotus  Sentinel and Millipede  we re excited about our structure and our capabilities and long term growth prospects  And we target combined revenue of 900 million to 1 billion in 2020  Now also outside of the three reporting segments I detailed  fourth quarter BTG spec pharma revenue of 58 million brought full year pro forma sales to 250 million  which is down slightly year over year and also in line with our expectations  So  to wrap up  we have extremely exciting future and believe that we re well positioned to continue and strengthen our performance track record in 2020 and beyond  And for that  I d like to thank our employees and their winning spirit and commitment to patients  So  I ll turn things over to Dan for a detailed review of our financials Dan Brennan    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thanks  Mike  Fourth quarter consolidated revenue of  2 905 000 000 represents 13 4  reported revenue growth and reflects an  18 million headwind from foreign exchange  slightly less than the  20 million to 25 million headwinds expected at the time of guidance  On an operational basis  revenue growth was 14 1  in the quarter  Sales from the Vertiflex and BTG acquisitions  partially offset by the divestiture of our legacy embolic beads portfolio  contributed a net 680 basis points of growth at the high end of our acquisition contribution guidance range  Of the 680 basis points  BTG contributed 610 million split between Interventional Medicine  contributing 380  and specialty pharmaceuticals  230  The resulting 7 3  organic revenue growth in the quarter was below our organic guidance range of 8 to 9   as Mike detailed  Despite the miss  we delivered Q4 adjusted earnings per share of  0 46  above our guidance range of  0 42 to  0 45  representing 16  year over year growth and 19  growth excluding the  0 01 net tax benefit in Q4 2018  Earnings were driven by healthy P L metrics across the board  as well as an approximate  0 03 tax benefit  higher than expected at the time of our preliminary fourth quarter and full year results announcement  The tax benefit is related to both discrete tax items within the quarter  as well as the lower full year operational tax rate  which I will detail shortly  The FX impact on adjusted earnings per share was immaterial as expected at the time of guidance  Our full year 2019 consolidated revenue of  10 735 000 000 grew 9 3  on a reported basis and 11 1  on an operational basis  which includes 380 basis points of growth related to the acquisitions of NxThera  Claret  Augmenix  Vertiflex and BTG  net the divestiture of the beads portfolio  Operational growth was in line with our guidance as the contribution from acquisitions was slightly higher than our expectations  and organic growth of 7 3  was slightly below our guidance of approximately 7 5   Full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share of  1 58 represents 8  growth or 13   excluding the 2018 net tax benefit of  0 07 in the base  Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 73 1   just above the midpoint of our guidance range and an improvement of 30 basis points over the prior year due to manufacturing improvements  favorable FX and mix driven primarily by strong sales in our Watchman franchise  For the full year 2019  adjusted gross margin was 72 4   within our guidance range and represents 10 basis points improvement over 2018  The full year impact of FX to adjusted gross margin was a positive 70 basis points  in line with our expectations  and along with manufacturing improvements  was offset by price erosion primarily in coronary drug eluting stents and pacers  Adjusted SG A expenses were  1 026 000 000 or 35 3  of sales in Q4  above our guidance range primarily due to the lower sale  but an improvement of 40 basis points over the prior year period  Throughout the year  we balanced the need to fund initiatives related to key commercial launches and recent acquisitions with our commitment to operating expense control and optimization  As a result  we were able to achieve our full year 2019 guidance and decreased adjusted SG A spending by 30 basis points year over year to 35 1   Adjusted research and development expenses were  297 million in the fourth quarter or 10 2  of sales  which is down 60 basis points from Q4 2018 primarily due to the timing of certain investments  and we re also gaining traction within our R D efficiency efforts  For the full year 2019  adjusted R D expenses were  1 138 000 000 or 10 6  of sales compared to 10 7  in 2018  Royalty expense was 0 6  of sales in Q4 and the full year 2019  which was roughly flat year over year for both periods  As a result  Q4 2019 adjusted operating margin of 27  improved 150 basis points year over year and is within our guidance range of 27 to 28   We also met our full year 2019 adjusted operating margin commitment with a rate of 26 1   representing an improvement of 60 basis points over the full year 2018  I ll now move below the line to interest and other expense  Adjusted interest expense for the quarter was  93 million  compared to  62 million in Q4 of 2018  Our average interest rate expense was 6 6  in Q4 2019 or 3 4   excluding the bond repurchase costs related to our Eurobond offering  compared to 3 5  in Q4 of 2018  Adjusted other expense for the quarter was  17 million compared to adjusted other income of  4 million a year ago primarily due to a net gain on certain of our available for sale investments in Q4 2018  and both periods include expenses related to our foreign exchange hedging program  For the full year 2019  adjusted interest expense and adjusted other expenses were  325 million and  65 million  respectively  resulting in total below the line expenses of  390 million  This is in line with guidance and an increase from 2018 largely due to the acquisition of BTG  as well as the make whole call exercised in Q1 of 2019 to execute the early retirement of our 2020 notes  Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was four and a half percent on an adjusted basis  below our guidance of approximately 11  due to discrete tax benefits within the quarter  as well as a lower full year operational tax rate  Our full year tax rate was 7 3  on an adjusted basis  also below our guidance of approximately 9  due to the lower operational tax rate  On a GAAP basis  our tax rate for the fourth quarter and full year included a deferred tax benefit of  4 1 billion related to transfers of certain intellectual property rights among our various wholly owned subsidiaries  These transactions more closely align the global economic ownership of our intellectual property rights with our current and future business operations  We ended Q4 2019 with 1 413 000 000  and full year 2019 with 1 411 000 000 fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding  Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was  638 million  compared to  659 million in Q4 2018  In the quarter  we used cash primarily to pay down  900 million of BTG related debt  executing on our plan to achieve a debt leverage ratio of approximately 2 6 times EBITDA by the end of 2020  As of December 31st  2019  we had cash on hand of  217 million  Our full year 2019 adjusted free cash flow of  2 billion is lower than guidance and down slightly year over year as a result of the timing of capital expenditures and increased working capital requirements  mainly in inventory to support upcoming new product launches  We continue to target double digit  adjusted free cash flow growth in the future  and our goal for full year 2020 adjusted free cash flow is  2 3 billion  which would represent 15  growth over 2019  On a GAAP basis  we recorded a net litigation related charge of  223 million in the fourth quarter  primarily related to litigation with Channel Medsystems  This drove a  129 million sequential increase in our total legal reserve to  697 million as of December 31st  2019  which otherwise would have decreased sequentially as we continue to work to fully resolve the mesh litigation  Over 95  of all known claims are settled or in the final stages of settlement  and we expect to pay the remaining  115 million of anticipated payments into the qualified settlement funds in 2020  which will then resolve all significant existing contingencies related to mesh  As a reminder  this liability is released from our balance sheet as payments are made out of the qualified settlement funds to plaintiffs  Capital expenditures for the full year 2019 totaled  461 million  above the high end of our range of 375 to  400 million  primarily due to timing and some pull forward from 2020 in manufacturing capacity in anticipation of certain 2020 product launches  We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of 450 to  475 million for 2020 as we continue to build capacity  integrate acquisitions  and position the company for growth  I ll now walk through guidance for Q1 and the full year 2020  For the full year  we expect 2020 reported revenue growth to be in a range of approximately 10 to 12   which corresponds to 6 5 to 8 5  on an organic basis  with an approximate 350 basis point contribution from the Vertiflex and BTG acquisitions  net the divestiture of the beads portfolio  As a reminder  Vertiflex is included in organic guidance for 2020 as of June and BTG as of August  at which time  the divested beads portfolio will also no longer have an operational impact  We expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately 30 to  40 million for the full year 2020  However  as I ll detail shortly  due to our hedging program  we expect the FX impact to EPS to be neutral for the year  We expect our adjusted gross margin for the year as a percentage of sales to be approximately 72  for the full year with no FX impact  We do not anticipate material improvement over full year 2019 as manufacturing improvements will be offset by pricing declines  which are expected to be slightly higher than usual due to biannual Japan price cuts and China tenders  in addition to mixed challenges from our new high growth products that are initially dilutive to total company gross margin such as Exalt D  Polar X and Lotus Edge  We expect full year adjusted SG A to be in the range of 34 5 to 35   This assumes up to 60 basis points of improvement over 2019 as we continue to execute on our cost optimization initiatives and also recognize the benefits of programs currently under way  Full year adjusted R D is expected to be in the range of 10 to 10 and a half percent  and we expect our royalty rate to remain at less than 1  of sales for 2020  This implies a full year 2020 adjusted operating margin of approximately 26 7   which represents 60 basis points of improvement over 2019  consistent with our previously outlined goal of 50 to 100 basis points of annual improvement  We continue to make progress toward our long term goal of 30  adjusted operating margin  We forecast our full year 2020 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 10   consistent with our disclosure in January  This assumes an operational tax rate of approximately 11   with an approximate 100 basis points of benefit from the accounting standard for stock compensation  We expect adjusted below the line expenses  which include interest payments  dilution from our VC portfolio  and costs associated with our hedging program  to be approximately 400 to  425 million for the year  and we expect fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1 417 000 000 shares for Q1 2020 and 1 421 000 000 shares for full year 2020  As a result  we expect full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of  1 74 to  1 79  representing 10 to 13  adjusted earnings growth  and we expect FX to be neutral for the year if rates hold constant  On a GAAP basis  we expect earnings per share to be in a range of  0 95 to  1  Now  turning to Q1 2020  We anticipate reported revenue growth to be in the range of approximately 10 to 12   which represents 11 to 13  operational growth  and an approximately 600 basis point contribution from the Vertiflex and BTG acquisitions net the divestiture of the beads portfolio  On an organic basis  we believe our business  without the impact of the coronavirus  would be in a range of 6 to 7 5  growth year over year  However  while we re still in the very early stages of assessing the impact  and highly focused on supporting our patients and employees in China  we believe it is prudent to include a potential impact to our Q1 revenue related to the coronavirus  Our best estimate at this time is a preliminary 10 million to  40 million potential negative impact to revenue as a result of deferred procedures  supply chain and other disruptions  Although it is early  the Chinese healthcare system is highly focused on containing the spread of the virus  thus  we expect to see a reduction in volume for all nonemergency medical device procedures as it will not be business as usual in China in February and March  This 10 million to  40 million potential negative impact resulted in Q1  20 organic growth guidance of 5  to 7   Full year organic growth of 6 5 to 8 5  contemplates our ability to recapture some of the lost procedure volume in China during the year  as well as other offsets throughout the remainder of the year  Note that given the leap year  Q1 includes an extra selling day over prior year  but this equates to roughly one half of a day sequentially based on the weighted average of selling days globally  We expect the foreign exchange impact on Q1 revenue to be an approximate 25 to  30 million headwind  For the first quarter  adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of  0 37 to  0 40 per share  representing 6 to 15  growth  and GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in a range of  0 16 to  0 19 per share  Please check our investor relations website for Q4 2019 financial and operational highlights which outlines Q4 and full year results  as well as Q1 and full year 2020 guidance  including P L line item guidance  So  with that  I ll turn it back to Susan to moderate the Q A Susie Lisa    Vice President of Investor Relations Thanks  Dan  Greg  let s open it up to questions for the next 25 minutes or so  In order to be able to take as many questions as possible  please limit yourself to one question and one related follow up  Greg  please go ahead  Questions   Answers  OperatorThank you   Operator instructions Mike Mahoney    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I have a question for Dan OperatorYour first question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JP Morgan  Please go ahead Mike Mahoney    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robbie  can you hear us Robbie Marcus    J P  Morgan    Analyst I can hear you  Can you hear me Mike Mahoney    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We can hear you now Robbie Marcus    J P  Morgan    Analyst Great  You know  maybe you could just start with the top line guidance for 2020  The range is a little wider than we ve seen from you historically  You have a lot of new product launches into new markets in 2020  Maybe just walk through the rationale for the wider guidance range and any important cadence issues to pay attention to Mike Mahoney    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure  Yeah  So the full year guidance  organic  You heard the script there  six and a half to eight and a half  We think 200 basis points wide range isn t crazy for a company our size  so we think that makes sense  Similar to  19  in  19  we saw a 6 3  organic in the first half  8 3  organic the second half  and so we expect a similar trend in 2020  As I mentioned  you ll see second half acceleration  as mentioned  due to the product cadence  and we can talk about the various products if you d like  as well as the M A train organic  And also  we expect hopefully    we hopefully aim for a resolution of the potential impact in China as we enter the second quarter  So  we ll see second half acceleration  and we expect many of our businesses to grow double digit  We expect UroPH and endo  as well as EP  all to accelerate in 2020  We expect PI to put up a first quarter similar to fourth quarter  We accept    expect nice acceleration due to important product launches in PI  as well as the integration going on plan  And we ve also given the structural heart guidance  900 to 1 billion  which is a significant increase over 2019  So  we re very confident in the product launches that we have across all the divisions and the execution  Our aim will be to accelerate organic revenue growth in  20 faster than we did in  19 Robbie Marcus    J P  Morgan    Analyst Great  And maybe just a follow up on CRM  At the JPMorgan conference  when you preannounced  you thought that some of the softness in fourth quarter was due to replacements at high power  Have you been able to dig into that any further and come up with why maybe replacements were softer in December versus expectations Mike Mahoney    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  So  we don t have all the market data yet  It s still too early to receive kind of unit volume across the industry  Similar to what I mentioned before  we think primarily  the impact in Q4 was due to our comps  We had mid single digit positive comps  Competitors had negative comps  And so  we don t see a    we don t believe that we lost market share in defib in fourth quarter  We think we ve faced a tougher comp than our competitors did  and also  we don t have the ICM loop recorder yet  Some competitors include that in their sales  So in a pure like for like basis  we think we held share  And we do think the market s a bit softer  though  We think the market  in 2020  we project global CRM to be flat  declining low single digit  And we expect    we obviously aim to continue to grow faster than the market  like we have for many years in defib  but we think the market growth is probably zero to negative two for the full year Robbie Marcus    J P  Morgan    Analyst Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America  Please go ahead Bob Hopkins    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst Oh  thank you and good morning  So first question  I just wanted to ask about the guidance you re providing for the first quarter  that 5 to 7   And if you use the midpoint of your assumptions on coronavirus  maybe 6 to 8  excluding that  My question is that even excluding the slower China growth in Q1  it does feel like a deceleration from what you ve been experiencing over the last couple of quarters  given the selling day and an easier comp in the first quarter  So  what do you assume slows in Q1 relative to the last couple of quarters  Or is this just you guys being conservative Mike Mahoney    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure  Morning  Bob  So yeah  we re very comfortable in the quarterly guidance we provided  as well as the full year  and we aim to accelerate in  20 over  19 organic growth  which I think is the most important piece here  We look at first quarter  there is a extra  what Dan calls a half day  when we look at all the global selling days and so forth  so there s a slight benefit there  But as mentioned in the script in a few areas  we do expect to see  in first quarter endo decelerate a little bit  from first    from fourth quarter  as well as PI being soft again in first quarter similar to fourth quarter  So those kind of are in line  And we also see some challenges in drug eluting stents with Japan price cuts  as well as the overall pricing environment in drug eluting stents  So  we anticipate that first quarter  and we talked about the CRM market kind of the zero to negative two range  But importantly  we have some nice mixed launches in DBS to support the full year  and we expect to see continued complex coronary growth do well  And then all the other businesses across the company should do extremely well with structural heart  But first quarter  combination of some of those pricing pressures we re seeing in DBS  combined with the coronavirus issue that Dan outlined and really moving through that BTG integration  that was the guidance of the six to seven and a half pre coronavirus  We estimate the impact  as mentioned  10 to 40 from China  which brings our first quarter guidance down to five to seven Bob Hopkins    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst OK  And then maybe as just a sort of an obvious follow up on that  What do you assume in endo slows a little bit in Q1  And then also I d love to see  hear your comments on Exalt D in terms of what you re expecting for the year out of that product Mike Mahoney    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  So endo is one of our more predictable businesses  I would say  in the company  Very good execution against our plans  And it s not uncommon for them to have a slightly softer first quarter  So slightly soft is going to be above the BSC average and likely above market  so their definition of soft there is probably not fair  But as we see    as we look at the full year  they have a nice set of product launches with new hemostasis clip  improvements to digital Spyglass  and the big one  the Exalt D  We ve had our first few cases take place over the past week  and they went    they re very  very encouraging  and so you re going to see a kind of more of a controlled launch in the first quarter to make sure things are going well  A lot of the contracting in terms of the capital placements are being organized now  and we re very confident in acceleration  really  each month in Exalt  with a much bigger impact in second quarter and a significant impact in the second half of the year  and then the surgical scope coming  So  I think we re really on track with Exalt D launch  and couldn t be more excited about the early results Bob Hopkins    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst Great  Thank you Dan Brennan    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer And then just to give you a little bit of the math on the ranges  so the six to seven and a half is the range without coronavirus for Q1 in terms of organic revenue growth  Just to let you know how we got to the five to seven  So  the low end of five is basically the midpoint of 6 75  and we took the high end of the risk of 10 to 40 for the coronavirus  and took that off to get to the five  And then similarly  for the high end of seven  it s the seven and a half high end less the low end of the coronavirus of 10 million  which brings you to the 7   So just to give you a little bit of that math as to how it came to five to seven from the six to seven and a half OperatorYour next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley  Please go ahead David Lewis    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Good morning  Just two questions for me  Dan  I want to come back to coronavirus just to sort of set expectations  So by our quick math  China s kind of 5  of the company  Maybe it was a point of growth to 2019  I appreciate the focus in the first quarter  But picking those numbers  it seems like you re implying for first quarter that that China business is either  you know  a 10  grower  kind of half what you grew last year  20   or maybe slightly declined  Is that kind of roughly accurate  And what s actually in the annual guidance for impact from China given it drove a point of growth from last year  Then I have a quick follow up Mike Mahoney    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure  I mean  as we talked about at our investor day  China was about a  500 million business  growing 20   That would imply about a  600 million business in 2020  So rough math   50 million a month  The 10 and the 40 are simply the impact    our China team  obviously  very close to the issues in China on the ground  That s how they size it today  and so that s why we included that in the Q1 guide  For the full year  as you saw  the six and a half to eight and a half  we assume that we can get some of those procedural volumes back and then other parts of the company could kick in and keep that six and a half to eight and a half organic revenue growth range intact  But it s just the ability to react within Q1 with the acute nature of what we see as the potential in China  that s why we raised it David Lewis    Morgan Stanley    Analyst OK  Then you are seeing that impact    you have seen that impact here in the early part of January into February Mike Mahoney    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer As you look at China  I mean  everybody sees it on the news and such  they re just    the number of procedures for medical device procedures in Q1 is not going to be what was expected 90 or 180 days ago  So certainly  we are planning to see an impact in that business in Q1 David Lewis    Morgan Stanley    Analyst OK  And then just for the guidance for the year  just two things  maybe for Dan or for Mike  One  obviously  you talked about second half acceleration  Maybe just help us understand the key drivers of that second half acceleration from a product perspective  And kind of related to that  you have two big products from a revenue perspective absolute dollar contribution or Augmenix and Lotus  Maybe just sort of talk to your confidence in those two products and what drives that back half acceleration Mike Mahoney    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure  We have a number of things we could talk about  but just to hit on the bigger ones  The biggest growth driver contributor is going to be structural heart  that 900 to a billion  And the big impacts there are  excited about  led by Watchman  with the new Watchman FLX launch will happen in the US in the second half of the year  and that s doing extremely well in Europe  and we have a number of big clinical trials  so we expect very strong growth on a Watchman  Lotus is doing very well in the market  It s kind of an on plan for 150 accounts  so you ll see a full year impact of Lotus  and we expect to see each quarter  greater impact there  Our Symetis valve  Accurate is doing well  It grew above the company average  It grew about mid teens in the fourth quarter  and we expect to see neo2 launching in the second half  So the whole basket of structural heart will be big  Exalt will be a meaningful new incremental revenue driver with stronger second half impact  And then in PI  I would say we re confident in quarterly improvements as we settled in on the BTG integration  and you have new products being launched from legacy BTG  as well as potentially Ranger in the second half of 2020  which will put our position there  And EPU  I mentioned Polar X  you ll see a nice impact from that  particularly in the second half of the year as we ramp that up  And uro continues to do well with  as you mentioned  Augmenix  which did over  100 million and is growing very  very well  as well as NxThera which also is doing well  and we ll expect five year data shortly and new reimbursement approvals from Cigna and Blue Cross  So really across the portfolio  there s a number of exciting things  That s why  to reinforce Dan s comment  despite some of the near term issues in China  we re very comfortable with six and a half to eight and a half full year range OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel  Please go ahead Rick Wise    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst Good morning  Mike  If we could focus    if I could focus on Exalt D  Obviously  you re excited  We ve had a bunch of in depth doctor conversations lately  Happily  all of them wanted to try it and were interested  so I m very interested  But they highlighted usability and sort of comparability to their current reusable technology  And they were all seemed uncertain about pricing and cost  Can you talk to us about your confidence that Exalt D equals current reusable technology  Talk to us about pricing and how you re going to go at making the economic case to the docs and the hospitals  And maybe last  just talk about the manufacturing ramp and how that ties into the acceleration as you move toward full launch Mike Mahoney    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Rick  So the teams have    as you know  this has been a multiyear program built off of the capabilities we ve learned with LithoVue and digital SpyGlass  Those capabilities are leveraged for Exalt D  And you hit the key criteria  the No 1 criteria  if this is to be a blockbuster product  which we think it will be  well  to be    have comparable usability and functionality as existing scopes that require the sterilization expense of processes  and so that is the spec that the team has been focused on over the past three or four years  And so  the good news is we ve had done a number of procedures  We ve had a number of key positions around the globe involved with the product for multiple years  and we re quite confident in the design elements and the visualization capabilities of the product  Also I think  we have formed with us with the FDA approved device and the capabilities as a team  We ll able to make improvements to the platform within each year  And so just like we ve done with digital and with LithoVue  excited to see probably a once a year enhancement upgrade  if you will  to the platform  And so  it s not as if this is a stagnant product and which sometimes you get with the reusables for many years  This is a product that we ll be able to enhance at least once per year throughout the next year period  whether it be smaller handles  left handed  right handed  different user features that the competition doesn t have  so I think that cadence will allow us to please physicians and the spec is to make it as good  On the manufacturing side  we have a lot of experience with this  We ve been investing ahead of it  That s one reason why you saw the increase in our capital investment in  19 and  20 as to manage the volume that we expect  So  we re comfortable with the ramp that we have laid out with acceleration in the second quarter and beyond  On the economics of it  it s a complicated topic  We do believe there s ample room in the existing reimbursement with in patient at roughly 4 000 to 12    to 11 500  and outpatient 3 000 to  call it  5 000  And we re also  as you know  we did receive FDA kind of the breakthrough status  which potentially  could help with additional potential reimbursement tailwinds  In terms of the pricing itself  we have lots of flexibility within our endo business to price it on its own or potentially look at contracting capabilities  leveraging our portfolio across the business there Rick Wise    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst Thanks so much for all that Mike Mahoney    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yep OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI  Please go ahead Vijay Kumar    Evercore ISI    Analyst Hey  guys  Thanks for taking my question  So  Mike  maybe one follow up on the guidance  and then I had one for Dan  On the guidance  the comments around the cadence  first half versus second half  If I recollect  last year  you had the days impact in second half  I mean  I appreciate all the comments on structural heart  but shouldn t structural heart cadence be similar to last year  The real incremental for new products  which should step up in second half  is that the right way to think about  Rick  And just on the range itself  six and a half to eight and a half  Are you comfortable at the midpoint of the range  or    and I appreciate the wider range just given Q4 and market factors  but just want to get a sense whether you re comfortable at the midpoint Dan Brennan    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Sure  This is Dan  Vijay  So on the structural heart piece  I think that s fair that as you look at the Lotus launch  that s obviously a very controlled rollout that we ve had  and that should gain momentum over time  as should Sentinel  Mike mentioned that neo2 comes out in the second half  So I think that s fair relative to structural heart  We obviously wouldn t give a specific number within the guidance range of six and a half to eight and a half organic for the full year  but as you heard in Mike s commentary  that our goal is to accelerate in 2020 off 2019 Vijay Kumar    Evercore ISI    Analyst That s helpful  Dan  And then one on the margins here  Dan  I think I heard you mention in a China tender  Japan biannual price cuts  What specifically is the impact from those factors on gross margin  And on the operating lineup  does it have any impact on the mix just given BTGs coming in because it looks like you re implying 60 basis points margin expansion Mike Mahoney    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  Actually  on that prior question from my Watchman team friends here  I want to make sure I include Watchman FLX in the US as well because that s a huge launch for the Watchman team who has done a fantastic job since inception  On the price impact  as I look at it  the summary would be we just have a little bit more price across the enterprise this year in a couple of those areas  as we mentioned  the biannual Japan price cut and the China  that will not allow the normal manufacturing cost improvements to poke their head above that and have gross margin go north  The normal equation is you have your manufacturing cost improvements  then you have pricing and mix  and the net of those three normally has gross margin increasing  This year  the pricing is a little bit higher with China and Japan and potentially some acceleration on the DES front there  as Mike mentioned  So that really just all netted out where margin    gross margin should be in that approximately 72  range we said  That s not a surprise to us  It s what we ve been saying all along for the last two years  is that gross margin which has paid a lot of the builds over the last five or six years  would slow in terms of its ability to contribute to operating margin improvement  and then SG A and R D would pick up that slack  You saw that in 2019  and you should see the same thing in 2020 Vijay Kumar    Evercore ISI    Analyst Thanks  guys OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo  Please go ahead Larry Biegelsen    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst Good morning  Thanks for taking the questions guys  One on Complex PCI  one on neuromodulation  So your Complex PCI business continues to do really well  but that s a business that we don t have a lot of visibility on  So my question for you  Mike or Dan  is how are you feeling about the sustainability of growth in that business in 2020  And what are the drivers  And I have one follow up Mike Mahoney    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure  That business  as we ve mentioned  is larger than DES and continues to do very well around the globe  and it s really maybe our most important business in Asia Pac  So that strategically is a very big business for us  It requires more clinical orientation  which is also helpful and more in our sweet spot and also is under less pricing pressure I would say compared to drug eluting stents  So the innovation there is really important  and you see a big focus on our IDAs and rural beta platform  as well as Wolverine  and maybe you can touch on some other key products  But it s really a key cadence of new products that we have  as well as the big focus on Complex PCI training that we have around the globe and how our portfolio matches that Dan Brennan    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah  I think you ve said most of it  Mike  I think  the thing I d say  Larry  that s most important is the population is aging  And so the burden of the disease is appearing later  And so  we re seeing more patients with more complex due to the later age  more co morbidities  less suitable for surgery  So just the sheer demographic change is actually driving the burden of complex current disease in late age  so it requires more complex interventions Larry Biegelsen    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst OK  that s helpful  And just under modulation  Mike and Dan  you gave a lot of helpful color on the different businesses for 2020  but I wasn t sure if I heard your expectations for neuromodulation for 2020 relative to 2019  So how do you see that business in 2020 relative to 2019 on an organic basis Mike Mahoney    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure  Yes  We re hopeful that we aim for that business  I would say  to accelerate versus  19  If you look at  19  our SBS business was slow  the market was slow  and we had extremely difficult comps the prior year  And so  we would expect our global SCS business to improve over  19 and 2020  And also  you heard at NAND  as well as detail out in some of the script  some of the clinical benefits we have with that portfolio  So  I think truly  on a comp basis and expectations for the market to improve somewhat  we would expect that to improve  And in DBS  we just have a lot of really good momentum there  Excellent share taking place in Europe and in the US  and you ll see some additional clinical studies being presented with that platform  We touched on some of the product differentiation there  And then you have Vertiflex  which will go organic in the second half of the year so we think  broadly speaking  Neuromodul will grow faster in  20 than  19 Larry Biegelsen    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst Thanks for taking the questions  guys OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen  Please go ahead Josh Jennings    Cowen and Company    Analyst Hi  good morning  Thanks  And just two questions  First  on China  I understand the nice details around the 1Q potential headwind  But can you help us get a little bit more granular  and any help just in terms of your exposure in China by business unit  I mean  it s cardiovascular interventional cardiology most exposed  Or is it more broad based  And then on the second question  just Watchman FLX  many comments today just on it being a driver  Can you help us understand the boost that you ll get from Watchman FLX launch  Is that premium pricing  Are there accounts out there that are waiting for Watchman FLX to get over the hump to start a Watchman program  or is it just deeper penetration to current accounts as Watchman FLX will open up kind of more procedures in different risk categories of patients Dan Brennan    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Sure  Josh  I can start on the first one  and I think Mike can take the second one  The good news is we do have  as you mentioned  a very well diversified portfolio in our China business  It s not reliant on one particular business within the mix but as our team reflects on all of what s going on there  It s pretty clear that a vast majority of the healthcare resources in China are focused on diagnosing  treating and preventing the spread of the coronavirus  and that all of the procedures are at risk of being delayed  So as we look at it  we don t say it s one particular division or another  and that 10 to 40 contemplates the whole market basket of Boston Scientific business and the impact that we could see here in the first quarter Mike Mahoney    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  And on Watchman FLX  Ian or Dr  Stein can comment on it as well  But I think in terms of what we ve seen in Europe  it s been more of a share taking capability that we have in Europe  And in the US  we haven t seen    center is not opening because we don t have Watchman FLX  so we don t think it s going to drive the sort of new center openings that we ve been already received with current Watchman  I think it s    and they can speak to the safety profile and the confidence that physicians have with FLX  which will give them more confidence to continue to increase our utilization rates  which are    so maybe metric for Watchman broadly is utilization rates  We ll continue to open some more centers in the US We re expanding in Japan  We re expanding in other countries  But in the US  it s all about turning on and continue to ramp up utilization  which we re seeing or we believe Watchman FLX will further enhance that Dan Brennan    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer I d just add to that  I d say the key drivers of utilization or our awareness  and we re driving that through education strategies and direct to patient  direct to physician education strategies  which is highly effective  And then procedural enhancements actually increased utilization  and Watchman FLX is a substantial procedural enhancement in terms of being simpler to use  easier to recapture and physicians immediately recognize the procedural enhancements  And the third part of increasing utilization is building evidence  And I think the fact that we ve announced the champion trial  a major DOAC versus Watchman FLX trial  helps to build the awareness  and therefore  the utilization  so I think things will be very positive Susie Lisa    Vice President of Investor Relations Great  With that  we d like to conclude the call  Thanks for joining us today  We appreciate your interest in BSX  Before you disconnect  Greg will give you all the pertinent details for the replay Operator Operator signoff  Duration  61 minutesCall participants Susie Lisa

200243,421759,BSX,Boston Scientific  BSX  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Boston Scientific  BSX  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 5  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This medical device manufacturer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 44 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  12 8  
Revenues are expected to be  2 92 billion  up 14 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Boston Scientific 
For Boston Scientific  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Boston Scientific will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Boston Scientific would post earnings of  0 38 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 39  delivering a surprise of  2 63  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Boston Scientific doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/boston-scientific-bsx-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200502765,200502765
200244,421760,BSX,HRC Vs  BSX  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Medical   Products stocks have likely encountered both Hill Rom  HRC  and Boston Scientific  BSX   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Right now  Hill Rom is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Boston Scientific has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that HRC is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
HRC currently has a forward P E ratio of 19 65  while BSX has a forward P E of 24 50  We also note that HRC has a PEG ratio of 1 77  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  BSX currently has a PEG ratio of 2 15 
Another notable valuation metric for HRC is its P B ratio of 4 51  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  BSX has a P B of 6 32 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to HRC s Value grade of B and BSX s Value grade of C 
HRC is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that HRC is likely the superior value option right now ",2020-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hrc-vs-bsx-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200503213,200503213
200245,421761,BSX,Boston Scientific  BSX  Q4 Earnings Top Estimates,opinion,"Boston Scientific  BSX  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 46 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 44 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 39 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4 55   A quarter ago  it was expected that this medical device manufacturer would post earnings of  0 38 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 39  delivering a surprise of 2 63  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Boston Scientific shares have lost about 5 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 2 1  
What s Next for Boston Scientific 
While Boston Scientific has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Boston Scientific was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 41 on  2 85 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  1 79 on  12 08 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

200275,421791,BSX,PETQ Vs  BSX  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Medical   Products sector might want to consider either PetIQ  PETQ  or Boston Scientific  BSX   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
PetIQ and Boston Scientific are sporting Zacks Ranks of  1  Strong Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that PETQ has an improving earnings outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
PETQ currently has a forward P E ratio of 22 48  while BSX has a forward P E of 26 07  We also note that PETQ has a PEG ratio of 0 90  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  BSX currently has a PEG ratio of 2 43 
Another notable valuation metric for PETQ is its P B ratio of 2 27  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  BSX has a P B of 6 01 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to PETQ s Value grade of B and BSX s Value grade of D 
PETQ sticks out from BSX in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that PETQ is the better option right now ",2019-09-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/petq-vs-bsx-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200469596,200469596
200276,421792,BSX,Boston Scientific  BSX  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Boston Scientific  BSX  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This medical device manufacturer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 38 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 6  
Revenues are expected to be  2 64 billion  up 10 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 51  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Boston Scientific 
For Boston Scientific  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Boston Scientific will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Boston Scientific would post earnings of  0 38 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 39  delivering a surprise of  2 63  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Boston Scientific doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/boston-scientific-bsx-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200474072,200474072

200289,421805,BSX,Earnings Preview  Boston Scientific  BSX  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Boston Scientific  BSX  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This medical device manufacturer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 38 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 3  
Revenues are expected to be  2 64 billion  up 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 32  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Boston Scientific 
For Boston Scientific  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Boston Scientific will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Boston Scientific would post earnings of  0 36 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 35  delivering a surprise of  2 78  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Boston Scientific doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-boston-scientific-bsx-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200440791,200440791

Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Boston Scientific  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Products industry  posted revenues of  2 63 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 30   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 49 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Boston Scientific shares have added about 21 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 9  
What s Next for Boston Scientific 
While Boston Scientific has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Boston Scientific was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

This medical device manufacturer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 4 17  
For the most recent quarter  Boston Scientific was expected to post earnings of  0 37 per share  but it reported  0 39 per share instead  representing a surprise of 5 41   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 34 per share  while it actually produced  0 35 per share  a surprise of 2 94  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Boston Scientific  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Boston Scientific has an Earnings ESP of  0 76  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on April 24  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Right now  VAREX IMAGING is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Boston Scientific has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that VREX is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
VREX currently has a forward P E ratio of 19 94  while BSX has a forward P E of 24 50  We also note that VREX has a PEG ratio of 1 99  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  BSX currently has a PEG ratio of 2 25 
Another notable valuation metric for VREX is its P B ratio of 2 32  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  BSX has a P B of 5 73 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to VREX s Value grade of A and BSX s Value grade of C

200318,421834,BSX,VREX Vs  BSX  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Medical   Products stocks have likely encountered both VAREX IMAGING  VREX  and Boston Scientific  BSX   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Currently  VAREX IMAGING has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Boston Scientific has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This means that VREX s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
VREX currently has a forward P E ratio of 20 61  while BSX has a forward P E of 23 43  We also note that VREX has a PEG ratio of 2 06  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  BSX currently has a PEG ratio of 2 14 
Another notable valuation metric for VREX is its P B ratio of 2 46  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  BSX has a P B of 6 15 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to VREX s Value grade of B and BSX s Value grade of C 
VREX stands above BSX thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that VREX is the superior value option right now ",2019-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/vrex-vs-bsx-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200380471,200380471
200319,421835,BSX,Boston Scientific  BSX  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Boston Scientific  BSX  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This medical device manufacturer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 37 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 8  
Revenues are expected to be  2 56 billion  up 6 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 45  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Boston Scientific 
For Boston Scientific  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Boston Scientific will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Boston Scientific would post earnings of  0 34 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 35  delivering a surprise of  2 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

On the upcoming fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call  scheduled on Feb 1  2018  the company now expects to provide a further update on the status of the LOTUS Edge Valve 
Also  a dull defibrillator sale within the core Cardiac Rhythm Management continues to be a drag for overall growth  Additionally  the woes of a challenging economy as well as a competitive landscape persistently burden the stock

200388,421904,BSX,Boston Scientific Looks Promising,opinion,"My Holding
If you ve been following my articles on Boston Scientific  NYSE BSX   I ve been trading this to the upside since  13 23 as BSX has been producing biggest  in my portfolio since early 2015 
After closing all of my call positions at  24 40 in early September  I ve waited about 2 months for a re entry as I was anticipating the corrections 
Through my long term analysis I came to a conclusion that even after the correction  I believed that Boston Scientific is ready to resume back up well above the  24 level 
So  I patiently waited for my entry at around  20  price level as I ve tweeted out back in November 1st 
After my re entry at   20 49   the stock initially dipped as low as  19 70 before bouncing back up 

Uptrend Development
You can see in the chart below that we are now cultivating a brand new uptrend as the  20EMA  is now rising back up 
As long as we stay above the  20EMA  on this daily chart  I do believe that the trend may continue to the upside and we may retest  20EMA  as it moves higher 


Current Resistance
This is the current resistance buyers must overcome for BSX to continue to move higher  however  if we see a pullback in this vicinity  I would watch the  20EMA  on the daily for a possible bounce 
And if we see a further decline below the  20EMA   I would say 20 price level will be an important level for a support 
 My next two targets are  23 50ish    24 40ish

200389,421905,BSX,5 Trade Ideas For Boston Scientific  Bonus Idea,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Boston Scientific  NYSE BSX   moved higher out of a Cup and Handle pattern in late January  stalling well short of the price objective  The slow shallow pullback met the 50 day SMA in March and started to roll back higher last week  The Cup and Handle target to 27 75 still stands  The bullish engulfing candle Friday is a show of strength and suggest more upside to come  as does the tight Bollinger Bands  
Momentum is turning back higher as well  The RSI is turning up just like price does  The MACD is crossing up  its own buy signal  at the zero line  There is a natural support level to trade against at 24  Below that support shows up at 23 40 and below that you really do not need to be involved  Resistance stands at 25 10 and 25 50  You then need to look back 2005 to find it at 26 60 and 29  with 31 and 34 from 2004  The peak was 46 10 in 2004  So this consolidative pullback around 25 has been at a 50  retracement of the full move lower  Short interest is low at 1 2  and company is expected to report earnings next on April 27th 
The April options chain shows large open interest at the 25 call strike and the half the size at the 23 put strike  April options suggest a 75 cent move in the stock price over the next 3 weeks  The May options  which encompass the earnings report  also show the biggest open interest at the 25 call strike  But they also have big open interest above that at 26 and 28  On the put side the open interest is spread from 23 to 25  At the money straddles in may suggest a  1 65 move in the stock by expiry 
Boston Scientific
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock now  over 24 75  with a stop at 24 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock now  over 24 75  and add a May 24 23 Put Spread  29 cents  for protection through earnings and sell an August 28 Covered Call  36 cents  to fund it 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the April 25 Call  34 cents  
Trade Idea 4  Buy the May 25 26 Call Spread  47 cents  and sell the May 23 Put  22 cents  
Trade Idea 5  Buy the April May 25 Call Calendar  52 cents  
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which with the first Quarter in the books  saw equity markets trying to brush off the recent pullback and start higher 
Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate in the short run while Crude Oil continues higher  The US Dollar Index looks better to the upside for the coming week while US Treasuries remain in their consolidation range  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue to drift higher  trying to separate with long term levels and Emerging Markets continue to move higher 
Volatility looks to remain at abnormally low levels keeping the wind at the backs of the equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts look constructive on the short term  and bullish for the QQQ  while longer term in consolidation  Perhaps the short term will spill over into the longer term  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

200390,421906,BSX,Boston Scientific s Emerging Markets Grow Amid Currency Woes,opinion,"On Apr 11 2016  we issued an updated research report on leading medical devices company  Boston Scientific Corporation   NYSE BSX    The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  
Boston Scientific s shares gained 4 45  in the past three months  However  it remained below the Zacks categorized  industry s gain of  5 68  

While Boston Scientific s inorganic means to strengthen its core businesses  including the latest decision to buy Switzerland based Symetis   investment in new technologies and global markets buoy optimism  foreign exchange headwinds and sluggish defibrillator performance continue to pose challenges 
Although  in the last reported fourth quarter  the company witnessed a rebound in the defibrillator s performance  sustainability of this growth is doubtful owing to the dull worldwide sales which inched up 0 9  year over year  
In the fourth quarter of 2016  foreign exchange headwind adversely impacted the company s top line by  20 million and gross margin by 120 basis points  With the trend likely to linger  in 2017 as well  Boston Scientific expects unfavorable foreign exchange headwind of  125 million on revenues and 700 basis points or 8 cents per share on earnings  Adjusted gross margin for the full year assumes a negative foreign exchange impact of 50 basis points 
On a positive note  we are looking forward to the company s newly implemented global restructuring plan  The company has already chalked out several key activities under the program which include strengthening global infrastructure through evolving global real estate and workplaces  developing global commercial and technical competencies  enhancing manufacturing and distribution expertise in certain regions  and continuing implementation of the  plant network optimization  PNO  strategy 
These activities are expected to be completed by the end of 2018  The company expects that the program will reduce gross annual pre tax operating expenses by approximately  115 million  150 million by the end of 2020 as program benefits are realized  Boston Scientific also expects a portion of the program s savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives 
The company is also gaining strong ground in the emerging market  In the fourth quarter of 2016  business from the emerging markets registered 17  organic growth rate  much ahead of the company s target of reaching 15  of sales by 2017 from 8  in 2013  This encouraging performance was driven by 21  growth in China  The company expects to perform better in China in the long run  banking on the recent approval of SYNERGY

Needless to say that factors like the recent exemption of the Medical Device Excise tax for the next two years has come in as a much needed breather for these Medical instrument stocks  We believe this exemption  albeit temporary  has boosted the positive sentiment in the medical device investment world  as most analysts believe it to be adequate for companies to address pressing issues such as a lack of opportunity for R D  innovation  pipeline development  and to make investments needed to accelerate patient and provider access to innovative health care products 
Apart from this catalyst  other remarkable breakthroughs include information technology  utilization of smart devices cloud connectivity and personalized medicine  which remain major growth drivers in the medical instrument subsector

Although the next report is yet to be released  the unofficial talk is that the full year target of  100 billion of M A valuation was effortlessly reached with the legacy continuing into 2016  In fact  per a recent report on ey com  the billion dollar deal pipeline indicates that many such mega consolidations are lined up  with a strong outlook over the short term Making the Right Choice

200420,421936,BSX,Magnify Your Portfolio Returns With These GARP Stocks,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks that are available at discounted prices and also have solid growth potential may easily count on growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy  This strategy is best suited for an environment where major benchmarks are witnessing a strong rebound in the latter half of a particular time frame after plunging in the first half  Rather than investing in both value and growth stocks like blend investors do  investors following GARP love to invest in undervalued stocks that offer solid growth prospects too 
GARP Strategy in Detail  
Though investors following GARP consider popular metrics of both value and growth investing  the ideal range of these metrics is different from what is considered by value and growth investing  GARP investing employs popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  and price to book value  P B  ratio   to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued or not 
In case of P E ratio  investors following the GARP strategy look for a higher value of the ratio compared to value investors  However  they avoid picking companies with extremely high price to earnings ratios  On the other hand  like value investors  GARP investors give precedence to low P B ratios  A ratio less than the industry average is preferred by GARP investors for choosing undervalued stocks 
The other metrics that are borrowed by GARP investors from the growth investing strategy are strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings growth prospects for the coming years  Unlike growth investors  GARP investors look for stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate instead of choosing those with extremely high growth rates  Growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal per the GARP strategy 
Return on equity  ROE  is another growth metric used in GARP strategy  Here  those stocks that have higher ROE compared with the industry average are considered as strong ROE is an indicator of superior stocks   
In order to make the GARP strategy more profitable  we have only considered those with a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Screening Parameters
  Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2 Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through  
  Last 5 year EPS   projected 3 5 year EPS growth rates between 10  and 20   Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business  
  ROE  over the past 12 months  greater than the industry average  Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  
  P E and P B ratios less than X industry average  P E and P B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued  
The use of these few criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only 12 
Here are five stocks from the 12 that made it through the screen

Magnify Your Portfolio Returns with These GARP Stocks

	Investors looking for stocks that are available at discounted prices and also have solid growth potential may easily count on growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy  This strategy is best suited for an environment where major benchmarks are witnessing a strong rebound in the latter half of a particular time frame after plunging in the first half  Rather than investing in both value and growth stocks like blend investors do  investors following GARP love to invest in undervalued stocks that offer solid growth prospects too 

GARP Strategy in Detail 

	Though investors following GARP consider popular metrics of both value and growth investing  the ideal range of these metrics is different from what is considered by value and growth investing  GARP investing employs popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  and price to book value  P B  ratio   to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued or not 

	In case of P E ratio  investors following the GARP strategy look for a higher value of the ratio compared to value investors  However  they avoid picking companies with extremely high price to earnings ratios  On the other hand  like value investors  GARP investors give precedence to low P B ratios  A ratio less than the industry average is preferred by GARP investors for choosing undervalued stocks 

	The other metrics that are borrowed by GARP investors from the growth investing strategy are strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings growth prospects for the coming years  Unlike growth investors  GARP investors look for stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate instead of choosing those with extremely high growth rates  Growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal per the GARP strategy 

	Return on equity  ROE  is another growth metric used in GARP strategy  Here  those stocks that have higher ROE compared with the industry average are considered as strong ROE is an indicator of superior stocks 

	In order to make the GARP strategy more profitable  we have only considered those with a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or Zacks Rank  2  Buy  

Screening Parameters

  Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2
	 Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through  

	  Last 5 year EPS   projected 3 5 year EPS growth rates between 10  and 20  
	 Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business  

	  ROE  over the past 12 months  greater than the industry average 
	 Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  

	  P E and P B ratios less than X industry average 
	 P E and P B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued  

	The use of these few criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only 12 

	Here are five stocks from the 12 that made it through the screen

200430,421946,BSX,Abaxis  ABAX  Q1 Earnings Miss Estimates  Sales Up Y Y,opinion,"Abaxis  Inc    NASDAQ ABAX     a global provider of point of care blood analyzers  reported its first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings per share  EPS  of 30 cents  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 1  
The quarter s EPS also dropped by a penny from the year ago comparable figure 
The downside in the bottom line results can primarily be attributed to a double digit increase in operating expenses  a result of management s decision to increase investments in research and development  R D  and international sales and marketing  S M  

Total Revenue
In the fiscal first quarter  Abaxis delivered revenues of  57 7 million  reflecting an 8 7  year over year increase  The top line however missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  59 million  
Notably  the mid single digit growth witnessed in its medical market segment and the double digit growth in veterinary market segment collectively drove the high single digit growth in Abaxis  overall revenue during the first quarter 
Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had almost negligible impact on Abaxis  top line growth  as currencies reduced total revenue growth by only 0 3  in the quarter ABAXIS INC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    
Segments in Detail
In the quarter  on a geographic region basis  revenues from North America  accounting for 81 1  of total revenue  grew 11  to  46 8 million  while revenues from the international market  accounting for the rest  rose 1 3  to  10 9 million 
Abaxis operates under three main segments  namely Veterinary  Medical and Other  In the reported quarter  Veterinary sales comprised 82 7  of total sales  Medical sales contributed 15 8  while the remaining 1 5  was generated from Other 
Veterinary market revenues improved 10  year over year to  47 7 million  driven by a 6  growth in veterinary consumable revenues and 27  growth in veterinary instrument revenues  Revenues from medical market segment grew 5  year over year at  9 1 million  on account of 11  increase in medical rotor revenue while Piccolo instrument revenues dropped 19   Revenues from the Other segment increased 6 2  to  0 87 million 
Abaxis also exhibited a strong consumable growth  up 7  year over year to  44 7 million  accounting for approximately 77 5  of the company s total worldwide revenues in the quarter  Total Instruments sales  also  increased 5  to  11 1 million 
Operational Updates
Fiscal first quarter gross profit rose 9  to  32 million  However  gross margin expanded only 10 basis points  bps  to 55 5   affected by sales mix during the quarter 
 R D expenses increased 10 8  year over year to  5 2 million  while S M expenses rose 11 7  to  11 8 million  General and administrative expenses also rose 21 5  to  4 2 million  Although the resultant operating income came in almost flat at  10 7 million for the quarter  operating margin declined 140 bps to 18 6  owing to higher operating expenses 
Financial Update
Abaxis exited fiscal first quarter with cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments of  153 million  up from  129 8 million in the prior quarter 
Meanwhile  Abaxis  management has approved a  30 million increase to its existing share repurchase program  making the total amount available for repurchase to  54 million at present 
Our Take
Abaxis  first quarter fiscal 2017 results disappointed us  with the company squarely missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  on a year over year comparable basis a strong outcome was observed  with global sales improving across all Abaxis  segments as well as in geographical bases  Moreover a specific rebound in Europe s veterinary rotor units  sales is encouraging as Abaxis had displayed a dreary performance in this space in the past two quarters 
Abaxis faced a challenging year over year comparison in the Asia Pacific region this quarter   But for the remaining quarters of fiscal 2017  management offered an improved outlook anticipating increased sales of veterinary rotors in the region   Besides  the strong cash position of Abaxis is evident from management s decision to increase the share repurchase fund  which all the more buoys our optimism for this stock 
Zacks Rank 
Abaxis currently holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked medical stocks are Boston Scientific Corp    NYSE BSX    NuVasive  Inc    NASDAQ NUVA   and Lonza Group Ltd   OTC LZAGY     All these stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  ",2016-07-22,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/abaxis-(abax)-q1-earnings-miss-estimates,-sales-up-y-y-200143591",200143591

Tap These 5 Momentum Stocks for Big Profits

What in basketball we call a  hot hand   a player making a few shots in a row  in finance parlance  we have a word for it  It s called  momentum  

Momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks  i e  stocks that have outperformed the market in recent times  to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction than move against the drift 

At the core  momentum investing calls for investors to  Buy High  Sell Higher  

Momentum vs  Other Styles

It is worth pondering over how the momentum strategy compares to other styles of investing over time  Recent research indicates that the size premium for small cap stocks has shrunk dramatically since the 1980s  value premium has also declined dramatically since the1990s  Academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums  like size and value  become known to the public  the investment world catches on and the premium is gradually eroded 

However  unlike other investment styles  the momentum premium has remained remarkably robust and persistent ever since it was identified by financial academics in the 1990s 

But Why Does Momentum Strategy Work 

There s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit  and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works  For instance  we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses  and hence hold onto losing stocks for too long  hoping that they will come back to their original prices  On the other hand  investors sell their winners way too early 

Furthermore  investors initially tend to under react to news  events or data releases  However  once things become clear  they tend to go with the herd and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions 

These behavioral issues extend trends  and thus open up a huge opportunity for momentum players to make profits  So  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future 

Momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again 

Chase the Alpha

Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over long periods of time and across markets  So obviously  this strategy is quite tricky to implement  as detecting these trends is no child s play 

Here  we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers and make handsome gains  Our screen will help you to take advantage of both long term price momentum and a short term pullback in price  which would reflect some profit taking in the stock

200440,421956,BSX,Will AmSurg s Merger With Envision Healthcare Drive Growth ,opinion,"On Jul 11  2016  we issued an updated research report on Nashville  TN based AmSurg Corp    NASDAQ AMSG     a leading operator of single specialty practice based ambulatory surgery centers  ASCs   The company develops  acquires and operates practice based ASCs in partnership with physician practice groups throughout the U S 
To further expand its footprint in the huge and fast growing fragmented physician outsourcing market  AmSurg recently agreed to merge in an all stock deal with Envision Healthcare Holdings  Inc    NYSE EVHC    This huge tax free merger of two healthcare industry biggies is expected to create one of the largest providers of physician services in the U S dealing in specialties including emergency  hospitalist  anesthesia  radiology and pediatric 
Also  the combined enterprise will have an expanded customer base with respect to ambulatory surgery  post acute care and medical transportation solutions 
Earlier  AmSurg acquired Sheridan Healthcare   a prominent multi specialty outsourced physician services provider  for a transaction value of  2 35 billion  in Jul 2014 with the same objective to expand its base in the physician outsourcing market  By this buyout AmSurg expects to capture substantial shares in the radiology and emergency medicine services spaces  wherein Sheridan holds a strong position 
ASCs depend upon third party reimbursement programs  including governmental and private insurance programs  which primarily pays for all of the services rendered to patients  In July  CMS announced the final payment rule for ASCs for the year 2016  Based on this proposed rule  AmSurg expects an average increase of 1  or  2 million in revenue across its specialties 
 The calculation of this final rule indicates that AmSurg will see a 0 5  increase   1 million  in revenues across all specialties in 2016  Surely this surge will benefit AmSurg in days ahead 
 On the flip side  AmSurg continues to face escalating operating expenses for the past few quarters  which in turn has been affecting the company s margin growth  Widespread macroeconomic turmoil as well as constrained hospital spending has the potential to reduce demand for ASCs like AmSurg

200444,421960,BSX,GNC Holdings  Overseas Prospects Robust Amid Market Woes,opinion,"On Jun 30  2016  we issued an updated research report on Pittsburgh  PA based GNC Holdings  Inc    NYSE GNC    a leading global specialty retailer of products for health and wellness  including vitamins  minerals and herbal supplement  sports nutrition and diet  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
On a brighter note  GNC Holdings  international business has been a key growth driver in recent years  As of Mar 31  2016  the company had 2 059 international franchise stores across more than 50 countries 
The company also made substantial progress in its retail segment during first quarter 2016 and also opened eight new stores  In this quarter  the company opened 8 new company owned stores  GNC Holdings is a global specialty retailer with a network of more than 9000 locations worldwide  which will help the company eventually overcome the adversities it faced in the beginning of 2016 in the retail segment  in the quarters ahead  The company also holds a strong cash balance position  which is a major positive 
However  GNC Holdings  business is particularly subject to changing consumer trends and preferences  The company s failure to respond in a timely or commercially appropriate manner to such changes may adversely affect customer relationship and product sales 
Moreover  the nutritional supplements industry is characterized by rapid and frequent changes in demand for products and new product introductions  If GNC Holdings fails to predict these demand trends and provide the stores with the latest products  it can harm customer relationship and the company s market share 
The U S  nutritional supplements retail industry is large and highly fragmented  In the U S   GNC Holdings competes for sales with heavily advertised national brands manufactured by large pharmaceutical and food companies  as well as other retailers  In addition  as certain products become more mainstream  the company is subjected to increased price competition with more participants entering the market

200449,421965,BSX,Buy These 5 Stocks With Explosive Earnings Growth,opinion,"From CEOs to research analysts  everyone is fascinated with a metric called earnings   But  what exactly do earnings represent and why do they draw so much attention  This is simply because earnings indicate how much money a company makes  Take a company s revenue over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and  there it is  you have earnings 
This metric significantly influences a company s share price  Upbeat earnings results generally lead to an uptick in the share price  However  in addition to actual earnings  expectations of earnings also play a significant role in influencing the share price 
Earnings Estimates and Their Impact on Stock Prices 
On numerous occasions we have seen a company s shares falling in spite of generating earnings growth  This happens because of missing estimates  Here  earnings estimate revisions come into play  These are analysts  expectation of the future earnings power of the firm that helps in determining the stock price movement  But what exactly do earnings estimates represent 
Earnings estimates embody analysts  opinions of factors such as sales growth  product demand  competitive industry environment  profit margins  expenses and cost control  So  while zeroing down to buy stocks with solid earnings growth  it is also important to figure out whether its earnings estimates are on the rise or not 
We have selected stocks that not only possess historical earnings growth but are also seeing an increase in quarterly and annual earnings estimates 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions  we added the following parameters 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only Zacks   Buys  and  Strong Buys  are allowed  With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there  this is a great way to start things off  
5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry  Stocks that possess strong EPS growth history 
  Change EPS F 0  F  1  greater than or equal to 5  Companies that witnessed year over year earnings growth rate of 5  or more in the last reported fiscal year 
  Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero  Stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks

  Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero  Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks

200464,421980,BSX,Boston Scientific Continues To Be A Hot Stock,opinion,"On my previous article   Hot Stock To Watch  Boston Scientific  NYSE BSX     we talked about the long term perspectives of how this stock has been well cultivating primary term uptrend  About five months later today  we can see that the stock is still respecting the primary term uptrend and moving higher Historical Perspective  Monthly  Above chart featured on my Part 1 of Original Post When it comes to this monthly chart  it s pretty simple as to where this stock is currently heading and it s sentiment  which is bullish upside  We have well cultivated uptrend while following respecting rising monthly 20SMA  Benefit of the doubt continues to go to the buyers at this point 
Primary Term Uptrend  Weekly Chart 
First we can see that rising uptrend support  yellow dotted  is well established and respected  meaning primary term uptrend is healthy as of today  I have circled  in red  the points of breakout after it hits the resistance level  Stocks will pullback and see volatile sideways movement  but as long as it cultivates healthy uptrend  stock is heading higher like the movement we ve been seeing since the year 2013 on this stock  It looks like  21  22 is where its headed 
Our Holdings  Daily As you can see the stock sharply pulled back in early part of 2016 as the overall market shook  but we held through our positions because we understood the long term perspective of this stock as I have shared monthly   weekly charts on this post  Once we ve found support at  16ish in early February  stock started to head back up  and today we are making new highs  As of today  we have plan on holding until it reaches our next target   21  22  ",2016-04-04,Kay Kim,https://www.investing.com/analysis/boston-scientific-continues-to-be-a-hot-stock-200123910,200123910
200472,421988,BSX,This Healthcare Play Is Ready To Move,opinion,"Many stocks have a rhythm to them  They move in repeated patterns over and over   until they don t any more  When you find one that exhibits that kind of price behavior it s worth noting and stalking for a potential trade  One that I uncovered recently is Boston Scientific  NYSE BSX   The stock has a lot going for it  It s in a hot sector  healthcare  and crosses over into another hot sector  technology  
What interests me though is the chart of the stock s price action over the last 6 months  The chart below shows that 3 things stand regarding price action  The first is that every time the price has touched the 20 day SMA it has lead to a new leg higher in the price  Second  the Bollinger Band  squeezes have also preceded a break to the upside  Finally  when the stock has consolidated for more than a month it takes another step higher 

All three of these things are occurring in the chart right now  Is it a perfect storm for the next leg up  The RSI is bullish while the MACD has reset lower  These suggest it could be prepping for a move as well  And if it does move over resistance at 18 10 the prior history would target a Measured Move to about 19  Have you been waiting to get into this stock  This may be your chance ",2015-04-15,Gregory W.

200473,421989,BSX,Hot Stock To Watch  Boston Scientific,opinion,"Historical Perspective
Since late 2014  we ve been involved with Boston Scientific  N BSX  as one of our long term strategy positions 
As you can see the chart from the late 2014  Boston Scientific was attempting to cultivate uptrend  since the 2005 crash  as it was holding above the recent pivot  see arrows  at around  12ish  At this time  we ve concluded  that there is a good probability which the price action could continue to resume to the upside to establish that uptrend with our next target price of  18ish  this was when the stock was trading at early 13 s in early 2012  
Price pulled back after hitting the  18 level  May of 2015  to retest the monthly 20SMA as I have annotated in the charts below  In late August  we saw a sharp decline  but just a few months later  today   stock bounced back up resuming to it s primary term uptrend 
With a well established  higher lows and higher highs  in this monthly chart  trend is healthy looking at things in a big picture


Primary Term Uptrend
Boston Scientific loves to rest in a  falling consolidation  formation before resuming back up as you can see in the chart below 
We would get a good bullish move higher  and then the buyers will rest by pulling back to the old resistance level to test as new support  if the retest is successfully exceeded  that s what we call a  HIGHER LOW  which means the uptrend  cultivation of higher lows and higher highs  is still valid 
 Trend is assumed to be in effect until it gives us clear signal s  that it has been reversed     Charles Dow  Looks like we will have another swift bullish move to the upside looking at this primary term uptrend perspective as we are now well above the resistance level  red dotted  with healthy cultivation of an uptrend 
This stock is now starting to cultivate strong bullish uptrend  which that could last for years as long as the cultivation continues with well established  HIGHER LOWS  and  HIGHER HIGHS  


 Our Holdings
After positive ER reaction just several trading sessions ago  the stock soared confirming that bounce  also confirming the breakout from that  falling consolidation  formation we ve been in for about 7 months  Currently  the stock is making new highs trading at  18 87ish  this is a good sign for the buyers confirming the price action print for the cultivation of the  HIGHER HIGH  
We ve decided to go back long on this stock at  17 95ish last week for the next target price of  23 00ish",2015-11-02,Kay Kim,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hot-stock-to-watch:-boston-scientific-270019,270019

200482,421998,BSX,Boston Scientific May See Higher Prices,opinion,"Boston Scientific Corporation  NYSE BSX  has been a mechanical stock  It has been pumping along in a channel through the fall before a leap higher  And since February in another channel  But  recent activity gave an initial diagnosis for higher prices  Take a look 

Two weeks ago it hit the bottom of the channel and printed a Hammer  a reversal candle  That Hammer went through the 100 day SMA  a place it had not touched since just before the last jump higher  The price confirmed the Hammer by moving higher  and is now back at the top of the channel  with the Bollinger bands opening higher  A break up would target an eventual move to 15 50  The MACD is supportive of a move higher and the RSI is near a move into the bullish range  over 60  Look for the break higher to confirm this diagnosis 
I have a long position in this stock
