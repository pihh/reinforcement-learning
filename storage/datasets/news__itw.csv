130819,352334,ITW,Navigating the trade war  How to invest during turmoil,news,"By David Randall
NEW YORK  Reuters    The start and stop progress of negotiations between the United States and China aimed at ending the trade war between the world s two largest economies is souring Wall Street playbooks and increasing market volatility as investors seek to profit during the uncertainty 
Investors are now focused on Sept  1  when the first stage of U S  tariffs on  300 billion worth of Chinese goods is scheduled to go into effect  In response  China unveiled tariffs on U S  products ranging from soybeans to autoparts to small aircraft that are set to go into effect the same day 
Global stock markets rallied Monday after President Donald Trump said he expects to see a trade deal  then fell Tuesday after China s foreign ministry said it had not received any recent phone calls from the United States on trade 
Here are how some on Wall Street are navigating the trade dispute 
1  Phil Orlando  portfolio manager and chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York  said the prospects of drawn out trade discussions prompted him to lower his equity overweight from 8  to 3  in July 
 To some degree Trump is using Chinese trade issues as a means of trying to extract additional cuts from the Fed to bring interest rates down  believing that at some point in the future he has the ability to sit down with the Chinese and pull a deal together   he said 
If that were to occur  Orlando would move into an overweight into sectors like auto parts and agricultural that have been the focus on Chinese tariffs 
2  Jack Ablin  chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago  said his firm reduced risk earlier this year 
 We are feeling pretty good about our reduced risk position  obviously the risk is we have some sort of a market melt up  But the likelihood of a market melt up seems small given where valuations are  where yields are and where expectations are  
3  Mark Haefele  global chief investment officer  global wealth management  at UBS AG  wrote in a research note this week   Downside risks are increasing for both the global economy and markets  As a result  we are reducing risk in our portfolios by moving to an underweight in equities to lower our exposure to political uncertainty  
4  Strategists at JP Morgan say they are  nearing the time to add back risk  as they see a chance that the latest tariffs will not be implemented 
 While we have been advocating a consolidation call during August  we continue to expect that the pullback will not extend for longer than the May one did  and still believe that the market will advance into year end  starting with a September upmove  as originally envisaged  
Among the positives expected are  with respect to tariffs  with a chance of the latest ones not being implemented after all  
5  Derivatives strategists at JP Morgan suggested using equity options as a way to benefit from either an improvement or further deterioration in trade tensions 
 Current weak positioning and sentiment could turn around quickly on positive trade developments  and drive significant market upside   strategist Bram Kaplan said in a note on Tuesday 
Kaplan recommended buying S P 500 options that make money in the event of a market rebound  He also recommended buying call options on stocks and sector exchange traded funds  ETFs  hardest hit by trade escalation to benefit from a possible rebound 




For companies that have so far largely escaped a hit from tariffs but remain vulnerable to a fresh round of tariffs in December  the strategists recommended buying December put options  These companies include  Nike   N NKE    Estee Lauder   N EL  and Illinois Tool Works  N ITW   according to JP Morgan ",2019-08-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/navigating-the-trade-war-how-to-invest-during-turmoil-1964868,1964868
130822,352337,ITW,Is Illinois Tool Works Stock a Buy ,news,"Illinois Tool Works  NYSE ITW   often known as ITW  is one of those brands that you may not have heard of despite it being all around you  Consumer products like zippers in clothing  resealable food packaging  multi pack ring carriers for beverages  components for automobiles  and fastening systems for construction are just a few of the markets and products that make up this over 100 year old company s portfolio  Despite 2019 being the largest one year gain in the stock market since 2013  ITW outperformed both the S P 500 and the Industrial Select Sector S P Depositary Receipt Exchange Trade Fund  or SPDR ETF  NYSEMKT XLI   Is the run over  Or is Illinois Tool Works stock still a buy 

80 20
You ve probably heard of the expression that 80  of a company s revenue comes from 20  of its customers  It s generally a good rule of thumb and one of the many reasons why companies invest so much of their time and money increasing business from existing customers  Reward systems  memberships  and subscription models are all techniques that support this business model  ITW s strategy takes it a step further through a principle it calls  80 20 enabled   According to the company  they  draw deep insights from our key customer relationships  and then focus our efforts on designing and patenting new products and components that solve their specific challenges   It s a mindset that seems to be working  as ITW has amassed around 20 000 patents in total 
Three reasons to buy
There are three main reasons why ITW is an attractive stock  To begin  the company yields 2 3  and has raised its payout to shareholders for 47 years in a row  making it a worthy dividend stock  Third quarter 2019 operating income was  868 million  free cash flow was  830 million  and cash dividends payable was  344 million  meaning the financial health of ITW is strong enough to be able to afford its current payout 
The second reason is that ITW has seven main business segments  all of which are sizable but not dominant  This is attractive because ITW s success isn t tied to one product or segment  rather  a diverse portfolio of businesses offers different ways to grow and insulate the company during tough times 

Data Source  Illinois Tool Works 
Third  ITW s quarterly operating margin is an impressive 25   up from a Q1 margin of 23 6  and a Q2 margin of 24 1   Operating Margin is a profitability indicator that is simply operating income divided by total revenue  Operating income is the result of subtracting the cost of goods and services  also known as the cost of revenue  from total revenue  as well as subtracting selling  administrative  and general expenses like research and development for ITW  ITW also subtracts amortization and impairment of intangible assets 
Operating margin varies significantly from industry to industry  Low margin businesses like Costco  and Walmart  have operating margins less than 5   whereas tech giants Microsoft  and Facebook  have operating margins around 35  

ITW Operating Margin  TTM  data by YCharts
ITW s 25  operating margin is excellent for an industrial manufacturer and supplier  In fact  it s one of the highest operating margins of any of its main competitors and higher than all top ten holdings in the XLI except for Union Pacific  railroads tend to have higher operating margins  
Reasons not to buy
There are a lot of attractive reasons to buy ITW but there are some concerns as well  For example  year over year declines in revenue and negative organic growth rates in all but one business segment are concerning  That said  ITW s ability to grow the bottom line 7   year over year between Q3 2019 and Q3 2018 despite problems with organic growth is a testament to efficiency 

ITW data by YCharts
Another concern is that ITW s stock price has been outpacing earnings growth  leading to a rising P E ratio which makes the company less attractive as a value stock 
The verdict
ITW is a premium industrial and a tenured member of the coveted  Dividend Aristocrat  cohort  Although declines in organic growth are concerning and the stock isn t as cheap as it used to be  it s hard to argue against buying ITW for the long term for a balance of growth and income ",2020-01-10,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pgewx,2056823

EPS growth of 9   operating margin of 23 7  and after tax return on invested capital of 28 9  in the quarter For the full year  against the backdrop of an industrial demand environment that went from decelerating in the first half of the year to contracting in the second half of the year  we re continuing to execute well on the things within our control  As a result  despite revenues that were down  700 million or 4 5  year on year  we delivered record GAAP EPS of  7 74  expanded operating margin to 24 4  excluding higher restructuring expenses and group free cash flow by 9   In addition  we were able to raise our dividend by 7  and returned  2 8 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases Equally important  in 2019  we continued to make solid progress on our

the growth and profitability performance of our core businesses  In addition  each of our divisions continued to make progress in executing well defined and focused plans to achieve full potential

to continue to deliver differentiated performance across a range of economic scenarios in 2020 and beyond And now I ll turn the call over to Michael  who will provide you with more detail on our Q4 and full year 2019 performance  as well as our guidance for 2020  Michael Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Scott  and good morning  everyone  In the fourth quarter  organic revenue declined 1 6  year over year in what remains a pretty challenging demand environment  The strike at GM reduced our enterprise organic growth rate by approximately 50 basis points and Product Line Simplification was 60 basis points in the quarter By geography  North America was down 2  and international was down 1   Europe declined 1   while Asia Pacific was flat  Organic growth in China was broad based across our portfolio and up 7  year over year  As expected  our execution on the elements within our control remained strong in the fourth quarter  Operating margin was 23 7   including 40 basis points of unfavorable margin impact from higher restructuring expenses year over year  Excluding those higher expenses  operating margin was up 10 basis points to 24 1  Enterprise initiatives contributed 130 basis points and price cost was positive 30 basis points  GAAP EPS was up 9  to  1 99 and included an  0 11 gain from three divestitures and  0 06 headwind from higher restructuring expenses year over year and foreign currency translation impact  The effective tax rate in the quarter was 22 8   Free cash flow was 114  of net income  And as planned  we repurchased  375 million of our own shares during the quarter  Overall  Q4 was another quarter characterized by strong operational execution and resilient financial performance in a pretty challenging demand environment Let s move to Slide 4 and operating margin  Overall  operating margin of 23 7  was down 30 basis points year over year  primarily due to higher restructuring expense  Excluding those higher restructuring expenses  margin improved 10 basis points despite a 3  decline in revenues  Enterprise initiatives were once again the highlight and key driver of our margin performance  contributing 130 basis points  the highest levels since the fourth quarter of 2017  The enterprise initiative impact continues to be broad based across all seven segments  ranging from 80 basis points to 200 basis points  And the benefits of the restructuring activities that we initiated earlier in the year are being realized  The majority of these restructuring projects are supporting enterprise initiative implementation  specifically our 80 20 front to back execution Price remained solid with price well ahead of raw material costs and price cost contributed 30 basis points in the quarter  Volume leverage was negative 30 basis points  In Q4  as we always do  we updated our inventory standards to reflect current raw material costs  As raw material cost in the aggregate have declined over the course of the year  the annual mark to market adjustments to the value of our inventory that we do every fourth quarter  this year had an unfavorable impact of 30 basis points versus last year  We also had a favorable item last year that didn t repeat this year for 40 basis points  And finally  the other category  which includes typical wage and salary inflation was 50 basis points  So overall  solid margin performance again for the quarter and the year Turning to Slide 5 for details on segment performance  As you know  2019 was challenging from an industrial demand standpoint  And you can see that the organic growth rate in every one of our segments    seven segments was lower in 2019 than in 2018  At the enterprise level  the organic growth rate swung from positive 2  in 2018 to down 2  in 2019 with the biggest year on year swings in our capex related equipment offerings and automotive Speaking of automotive  let s move to the individual segment results starting with Automotive OEM  Organic revenue was down 5  as the GM strike reduced revenues by approximately two percentage points  Taking a closer look at regional performance  North America was in line with D3 builds  down 13   Europe was essentially flat versus builds that were down 6  and China organic growth was 11  compared to builds  up one  The continued significant output in China reflects increasing penetration  particularly with local OEMs Moving on to Slide 6  Food Equipment had a good quarter with organic growth up 2  year over year despite a tough comp of 5  organic growth last year  The service business was solid  up 4  in the quarter  Equipment growth of 1  reflects double digit growth in retail and modest decline in institutional and restaurants  against tough year over year comps for both of those  Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 27 5  with enterprise initiatives the main contributor Test   Measurement and Electronics had a very strong quarter with Test   Measurement up 6  with 13  growth in our Instron business  This segment also experienced a meaningful pickup in demand from semiconductor customers  Electronics was up 2   Margin was the highlight as the team expanded operating margin 330 basis points to a record 28 1   the highest in the company this quarter with strong contributions from enterprise initiatives and volume leverage  Also in the quarter  we divested Electronics business with 2019 revenues of approximately  60 million Turning to Slide 7  Welding organic revenue declined 4  against a tough comparison of 8  growth last year  North America equipment was down 3  against a tough comparison of up 7  last year  The lower demand is primarily in the industrial business  while commercial  which includes smaller business and personal users was pretty stable  Oil and gas was down 2   Operating margin was 25 4   down 150 basis points  primarily due to higher restructuring expenses  In the quarter  we divested an installation business with 2019 revenues of approximately  60 million  which reduced Welding s organic    which overall growth rate by 150 basis points in the quarter Polymers   Fluids  organic growth was down 2  versus a tough comp of plus 4  last year  Polymers was flat  Automotive aftermarket was down 1   Fluids was down 6   Operating margin was strong  up 150 basis points  driven primarily by enterprise initiatives Moving to Slide 8  Construction organic revenue was down 1  with continued softness in Australia New Zealand  which was down 4   Europe was down 3  with the U K  down 14   North America was up 2  with residential remodel up 2  and commercial up 5   Operating margin was 22 2  down due to the inventory mark to market adjustments and higher restructuring expenses In Specialty  organic revenue was down 3   which on a positive note  is an improvement from the past couple of quarters  As in prior quarters  the main drivers are significant PLS and the relative performance of the businesses we have identified as potential divestitures  Excluding these potential divestitures  core organic growth was down 1 7   By geography  North America was down 4  and international 3   We also divested a business in this segment with 2019 revenues of approximately  15 million  And these divestitures reduced Specialty s growth rate by almost eight percentage points Now let s quickly review full year 2019 on Slide 9  In a challenging industrial demand environment  organic revenue was down 1 9  with total revenues down 4 5  as foreign currency translation impact reduced revenues by 2 3  and divestitures by 30 basis points  GAAP EPS was  7 74 and included  0 09 of divestiture gains  as well as  0 32 of headwinds from foreign currency and higher restructuring expenses year over year Operating margin was 24 1     24 4  excluding higher year on year restructuring expense as enterprise initiatives contributed 120 basis points  After tax return on invested capital improved 50 basis points to 28 7   Our cash performance was very strong with free cash flow up 9  and a conversion rate of 106  of net income  We made significant internal investments to grow and support our highly profitable businesses  increased our annual dividend by 7  and utilized our share repurchase program to return surplus capital to our shareholders A quick update on our various divestiture processes that overall remained on track  As a reminder  we re looking to potentially divest certain businesses with revenues totaling up to  1 billion and are targeted to complete the effort by year end 2020  The strategic objective with this phase of our portfolio management effort is to improve our overall organic growth rate by 50 basis points and improve margins by approximately 100 basis points  Not counting potential gains on sales  the plan is to offset any EPS dilution with incremental share repurchases  In the fourth quarter  we completed the sale of three businesses with combined 2019 revenues of approximately  135 million  generating a pre tax gain on sale of  50 million or  0 11 a share  In 2019  these businesses were a 20 basis points drag to our organic growth rate and 10 basis points to our margin rate In summary  a challenging demand environment    in a challenging demand environment  the ITW team executed well and delivered strong financial results  made solid progress on our enterprise strategy agenda  including our organic growth initiatives and positioned the company for differentiated performance in 2020 and beyond On Slide 10  we wanted to give you a quick update on the progress that we re making on our organic growth initiatives  We estimated the aggregate market growth rate or decline for each one of our segments and compared it to the segments actual organic growth rate in 2019  We also included Product Line Simplification by segment  As you know  full potential steady state PLS is expected to be about 30 basis points  As you can see overall  we ve made some good progress  as our segments are all outgrowing their underlying markets  except for Specialty Products  At the enterprise level  we estimate that we outpaced our aggregate blended market growth rates by approximately one percentage point So overall good progress on our organic growth initiatives  And by completing our Finish the Job agenda over the next several years  we expect to generate one to two percentage points of additional improvement in ITW s organic growth rate  As Scott mentioned  we look forward to providing a full progress update at our Investor Day in March Now let s talk    let s turn the page and talk about 2020  starting with Slide 11  First  we expect GAAP EPS in the range of  7 65 to  8 05 for 2020  Using current levels of demand adjusted for seasonality  organic growth at the enterprise level is forecast to be in the range of 0  to 2  for the year  At current exchange rates  foreign currency translation impact and the revenue associated with our 2019 divestitures are each of    one percentage point headwind to revenue  PLS impact is expected to be approximately 50 basis points  We expect to expand operating margin from 24 1  in 2019 to a range of 24 5  to 25  in 2020 with enterprise initiatives contributing approximately 100 basis points  After tax ROIC should improve to a range of 29  to 30   And as usual  we expect strong free cash flow with conversion greater than net income We have allocated  2 billion to share repurchases with core share repurchases of  1 5 billion  an additional  500 million to offset the EPS dilution from the three completed divestitures  Additional items include an expected tax rate in the range of 23 5  to 24 5   which represents a 10      0 10 EPS headwind and foreign currency at today s rates is also unfavorable  0 10 of EPS Just a quick word as it relates to the Coronavirus situation in China and we re obviously in the same position as everyone else  At this point  we ve baked into our guidance a last week of production  assuming that we all return to work in China on February 10  But obviously it s too early to tell and we ll continue to monitor the situation closely Overall  ITW is well positioned for differentiated financial performance across a wide range of scenarios as we continue to execute on the things within our control and make meaningful progress on our path to full potential performance through the implementation of our Finish the Job enterprise strategy agenda Finally  we re providing an organic growth outlook by segment for full year 2020 on Slide 12  And as always  these are based on current run rates adjusted for seasonality and are obviously influenced by year over year comparisons as we go through the year  It s important to note that there is no expectation of demand acceleration embedded in our guidance  You can see that every segment is forecast to improve the organic growth rate in 2020 relative to 2019  The same is true for margins  as every segment expects to improve the margin performance in 2020 With that  Karen  I ll turn it back to you Karen Fletcher    Investor RelationsAll right  Thanks  Michael  Julianne  we re ready to open up the lines for Q A Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi  Your line is open Andrew Kaplowitz    Citi Research    AnalystHey  good morning  guys Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Andrew Kaplowitz    Citi Research    AnalystScott and Mike  you had a big tick up at Instron in the quarter and in Food Equipment which are capex businesses that you ve tended to watch over the year  So while recognizing all the uncertainty that s out there now because of the various  maybe still some trade uncertainty  did you actually see some movement in capex decisions from your customers  What does it tell you about 2020 Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerWell  I think Q4  certainly the growth rates in our businesses were better than what we saw in Q3  Part of that was a number of orders in Q3 that were deferred into Q4  And so I think in our view it s a little too early to talk about a pickup in demand here in those businesses  Certainly encouraging  but a little too early to tell  Andy Andrew Kaplowitz    Citi Research    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  And then if I look at your enterprise strategy program  your margin benefit seems to be accelerating here  As these programs get mature  you would think that may be they level off or decelerate  So I know you have your Analyst Day coming up  you will talk about this  Maybe just continuing to get better on 80 20 as you evolve enterprise strategy  Is that really what this is  And do you expect your tailwind from enterprise strategy to be at least 100 basis points through that target date of 2023 Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerWell  I mean I think let s take one year at a time here  I think the fact that we are eight years into this current enterprise strategy and still generating 100 basis points of margin expansion is    in 2020 is certainly encouraging  We ve talked about before why that is  80 20 today is significantly more powerful than when we began this journey  We ve continued to learn and gotten better from an execution standpoint  The raw materials that we re working with in terms of the quality of the businesses is significantly higher after all the work we ve done in the portfolio  And so I think we re really encouraged by the continued progress  We are highly confident that we will reach our 2023 performance goals  80 20 will be a big    continue to be a big part of that  But it s a little too early to tell what those contributions might be in 2021 and 2022  But you can rest assure that we are highly confident in achieving those margin objectives we ve put out there Andrew Kaplowitz    Citi Research    AnalystThanks  Mike  I appreciate it guys OperatorYour next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research  Your line is open Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystThank you  Good morning  everyone  Good to see the divestiture activity picking up  Is it just that some things kind of fell in place or do you expect actually the pace to be accelerated here  And can you remind us how many individual businesses are left  So these are all kind of one at a time transactions  I would take it Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So I think this is    the cadence here was in line with the process that we ve laid out  We ve got a number of businesses  So three divestitures completed  I think when we file the 10 K  you ll see that there are another three at this point that are in that held for sale category  And then there will be a number of businesses beyond that  So we re making good progress in a little bit more challenging macro than what we had expected maybe going into this  But the most important   E  Scott Santi    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerWhich has slowed the process down a bit Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think    I was going to say it s probably slowed things down maybe a little bit  I think the really important thing is we are    we re still on track to achieve the 50 basis points of structural improvement in our organic growth rate and 100 basis points of margin improvement  Current expectation  we re targeting    targeting to get those done by the end of 2020  And we certainly have a shot at that  But as Scott said  I mean  just given the macro backdrop that might get pushed out a little bit  But overall  these processes are on track Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystNow on the flip side of that  obviously you ve been hunting for deals given that you re kind of cash rich strategic buyer  Do you see things kind of getting easier  Is the pipeline filling up  Like what the    would you really expect to happen here in 2020 on the acquisition side E  Scott Santi    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerWell  I think we have certainly been more active from the standpoint and we talked about it before in terms of our willingness to consider adding to the portfolio the right kind of assets  And we re certainly  let s just call it  knocked up  Phonetic  our activity in that regard in 2019  As is obvious  we didn t hit on anything yet in that regard  And it s a combination always of sort of the fit in terms of strategy and also sort of the valuation environment  And I would say the overall color in 2019 is that  we looked at some things that we re interested in strategically that from a valuation standpoint didn t hit the screen  didn t meet the criteria and we will continue to be active in assessing opportunities to add to our portfolios as we have talked about in the past  But we re going to remain a very disciplined posture in that regard  I have no doubt that we will very successfully add to our portfolio as we go Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystGreat  Thanks for the color OperatorYour next question comes from Mig Dobre from Baird  Your line is open Mircea Dobre    Baird    AnalystGood morning  everyone  Just a quick question on the margin guidance  Have you factored in any restructuring at this point Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So at this point  Mig  we re guiding to margins for 2020 in that 24 5  to 25  range  which includes restructuring  So on a year over year basis  at this point  we re assuming that restructuring will be flat  And obviously  we ll see how the year plays out and adjust accordingly Mircea Dobre    Baird    AnalystFlat in dollar terms or in terms of margin drag Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerFlat in dollar terms and margin drag  And therefore  EPS neutral Mircea Dobre    Baird    AnalystOkay  Then my follow up  I m just trying to kind of wrap my mind on the buckets here  So if I m looking at the low end of your guidance  the 24 5   I m presuming that that s consistent with the low end of the revenue guidance for the volume that you re providing  And I m comparing it to sort of what you ve done in the prior year  Can you maybe help me with a bit of a bridge here  Obviously  you ve got    enterprise initiatives were 100 basis points that helped  but there are some other items too  price cost  maybe some other things that you re doing  How do we get to the high end and the low end here Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerSo Mig  are you talking EPS or margins  What would you like to view Mircea Dobre    Baird    AnalystJust margin  Not EPS  just margin Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So I think for 2020  we ve provided quite a bit of information already  And it would be one way to think about it is  the initiatives contribute 100 basis points  We have positive volume leverage baked into our guidance  If you look at historically based on your organic growth rate what the impact might be there  Price cost  we re assuming neutral at this point  may be slightly positive  We ll see how that plays out  The divestitures that we completed in 2019 that is a little bit of favorability to margins  And then I d say the remainder here is  we re going to continue to invest to support our organic growth initiatives  We re going to invest in our people and we re going to invest to sustain our core businesses as we always have  And so if you kind of look at the remaining buckets  2020 may be expected to be similar to what we had in 2019 Mircea Dobre    Baird    AnalystGot it  That s helpful  And lastly  if I may  As you look at your segments into 2020  are there one or two that stand out to you as having more margin potential than    margin expansion potential than average  Thanks Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think  Mig  this is really across the board  As I think I said in my comments  we expect every one of our segments based on our bottoms up planning process  based on what they have told us really at the division level on up  We expect every segment to continue to make progress in 2020 over 2019 E  Scott Santi    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerAnd I d say the other delta is as we ve talked about before  which is the volume leverage component  right  The more growth we get  the more accretion in the margin we re going to get Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And I think you saw a good example of that this quarter  If you look at just the performance in Test   Measurement  margins up 330 basis points  Two thirds of that was the volume leverage on the enterprise initiatives  So you can see what happens in these businesses when we get a little bit of volume  a little bit of organic growth coming through  so Mircea Dobre    Baird    AnalystAll right  Fair enough  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from Ann Duignan from J P  Morgan  Your line is open Ann Duignan    J P  Morgan Securities    AnalystHi  Good morning E  Scott Santi    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Ann Duignan    J P  Morgan Securities    AnalystGood morning  Just looking at your segment organic growth forecast  Could you just walk us through the various segments and where you see the upside versus the downside risks Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerWell  I d say  these are all first of all based on kind of current run rate  And so I think there are a couple of segments here that have a slightly wider range  Automotive OEM  Welding  which reflects maybe a little more market uncertainty in those  I think Food Equipment has a measurement  those look pretty solid  Food Equipment in that 2  to 4  range  Test   Measurement  1  to 3   And then you can see the rest  Polymers   Fluids  Construction  Specialty kind of in that low single digit at the midpoint  So that s kind of I think how we d characterize  I mean  as you know  Ann  this is a pretty uncertain environment  right  I mean this is    2019 was a challenging year  2020  we ve got to    we have to see how this China situation plays out that we just talked about  And so as we sit here today  this is kind of our current forecast using the current levels of demand that we re seeing in these businesses Ann Duignan    J P  Morgan Securities    AnalystYeah  And in that context  I mean you re much closer to these businesses than we are  obviously  But then Polymer   Fluids  I think of that business as being more consumer driven  And so can you just talk about what is causing the guidance for on the downside  the negative one Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerWell  I think the    so Polymers   Fluids  about half of the business is    when you say consumer driven  you re pointing I think to the automotive aftermarket business  If you just look at kind of where retail numbers are in that space  they are probably down slightly  We ve had some challenges this year on the MRO side  particularly   E  Scott Santi    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerWhich is more B2B Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerWhich is    now it s more B2B  the Fluids business on the MRO side  particularly in Europe  And then you also have a couple of other end markets that are not exactly very favorable at this point  including there is some petrochemical exposure  there is some marine exposure  And so overall  we d say  Polymers   Fluids flat in 2019  And you know  slightly positive here in 2020 Ann Duignan    J P  Morgan Securities    AnalystOkay  I appreciate the color  And then I ll get back in queue  Thank you Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerAll right  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities  Your line is open Andrew Casey    Wells Fargo    AnalystThanks  Good morning E  Scott Santi    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Andrew Casey    Wells Fargo    AnalystA little bit of a clarification  On the margin walk  you called out several things  inventory restructuring  non repeat of an item  Would those in the past typically be included in other Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYes  That is correct Andrew Casey    Wells Fargo    AnalystOkay  Thanks  Michael Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerSo the inventory adjustment    so just    sorry  Andy  to interrupt you  But the inventory adjustment  it s one that we make every year  And it s just that this year because raw material costs have come down throughout the year that adjustment is a little bit larger than prior years as we mark to market inventory  And so we decided to call it out as a separate item to kind of give you the transparency  the detail around that Andrew Casey    Wells Fargo    AnalystOkay  Thank you  And then a few questions on the divestitures  On your earlier comment about the slower pace than expected due to the macro  is that purely timing or are you encountering hesitancy from potential buyers of the assets because of the overall uncertainty  And then for the three in the for sale category  you mentioned in the K  are they excluded from 2020 top line guidance  And what was their impact on 2019 margin performance Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So those    let me start with that one  So the ones that you ll see that are held for sale  we are assuming in our guidance that we are going to own those in 2020  So 2020 numbers exclude any further divestitures  as well as any acquisitions  So this is really    think of it as all in as we    the businesses that we own today I think on your first question  I think it s a little bit of both  I mean  I think some of these  it s an element of timing  And I also think   E  Scott Santi    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerJust the process is taking longer Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerProcess is taking a little bit more longer  maybe that has to do with the desire to do maybe more due diligence  And then I think the other piece  the macro backdrop  there is some uncertainty  And so I think we ve seen some of both of those  But    and then I ll just say finally  I mean we re going to be disciplined as we divest these businesses  And if this is not    if this isn t the right time to do it from a valuation standpoint  we might defer some of these processes into next year  So we ll keep you posted as we go through the year and get on these earnings calls  And we ll give you an update on the processes E  Scott Santi    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I m just going to add  These are all high quality businesses  certainly on a relative basis  They are not businesses that we think are the right fit for us long term  But these are not distress businesses by any stretch  So these are quality assets that have certainly a lot of appeal  And as Michael said  to the extent that the macro environment creates a situation where we don t think we re able to trade at fair value then we re going to wait to cycle out and we ll get there eventually Andrew Casey    Wells Fargo    AnalystOkay E  Scott Santi    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerWe re able to do three so far  we got another   Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerCompany reworks  Phonetic  E  Scott Santi    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYeah Andrew Casey    Wells Fargo    AnalystOkay  thanks  Just as a follow up on that  The three that are mentioned in the K  should we expect those to have a similar type margin performance to the three that you have already been able to sell Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think they re all pretty similar  I mean there is a range  The average is maybe is the way to think about it is in that high single digits EBIT percentage  So that s one way to think about it Andrew Casey    Wells Fargo    AnalystOkay  OK  Thank you very much Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerSure OperatorYour next question comes from Ross Gilardi from Bank of America  Your line is open Ross Gilardi    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHey  good morning guys  Thank you Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Ross Gilardi    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystI was just wondering like clearly we re in a very choppy challenging demand environment  but    and you guys are continuing to expand margins even with that  But how do we    how the company is thinking about the 3  to 5  organic objectives  And at some point this becomes counterproductive to even be shooting for that in this type of environment  And can you remind us where do you get to in margins over the long term in just sort of a flattish environment like we re in right now versus the plus 3  to 5  E  Scott Santi    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerWell  I think from the standpoint of our core growth rate objectives  what we are really saying essentially is that this is a business that should grow    outgrow the underlying growth rates of the markets we re in from    anywhere from say 2  to 4  on an average basis over time  We re in a situation right now where the market in our estimation of the blended market rate  these are sort of using our best assumptions was down 2 5  last year  So in a normal  let s call it a normal average GDP world of you pick whether it s 2  or 3  on a long term basis and that s where the 3  to 5  essentially comes from in terms of the overall expectations that we have for this company  And there is nothing in this  call it  industrial recessionary environment that would in any way change the view of what we think our long term potential is  This is a highly differentiated portfolio  We ve talked before  and again  we ll get into a lot more depth on this at the Investor Day  But we ve got the ability to generate at least a point of incremental growth from innovation and other point from penetration is the simple math  That s the bottom line standard that we re working to position ourselves to execute consistently on  And we ve got a lot of businesses that are already there and then some So last thing we d want to do is take a point in time  set the market conditions and ultimately get us off of our long term view of what we think the potential of this company is  I think from a margin standpoint  we ve got  I ll let Michael jump in here  but we ve got a set of performance objectives out into the future that we ve laid out in the past that we expect to continue to make progress against Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think nothing has changed in terms of our view on the margin targets  as I said earlier  I mean I    Ross  it might be helpful    the 3  to 5   we know that we re not going to grow 3  to 5  every year  This is over a five year period  We d expect kind of in a normal macro that s the performance that we should be able to deliver  And with that comes the margins in that 28  range and EPS growth in the low double digit  everything that we ve laid out for 2023  So our views on those haven t changed just given the macro that we re in today Ross Gilardi    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThanks  Thanks guys  No  I realize you re still outgrowing your end markets  I wasn t trying to pick on you for that at all  I was just trying to    with respect to your long term margin target  really just to remind me how much of that    getting there was coming from your ability to hit the 3  to 5  versus if we re just in a flattish environment for the next several years Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I mean again  I think the biggest driver here remains the continued strong execution on the enterprise initiatives  And then there is a reasonable assumption of some volume leverage that comes with that  And you saw that    like I said earlier  if you look at Test   Measurement is a great example this quarter  You got a little bit of volume leverage  We get a normal macro environment  we re going to get there very quickly  I think that s what we re trying to say here  And over any five year period  we expect that we ll average in that 3  to 5  range  But if we get a couple of really good years  we ll get there faster than that Ross Gilardi    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  Since you mentioned  you reminded us of the semiconductors  and I realize you weren t factoring any pickup into your guide  But just ITW is obviously a great barometer for capital spending in general in the global economy  Are you seeing any signs of capex picking up anywhere or percolating where it feels like discussions are getting a little bit more optimistic in any of your businesses E  Scott Santi    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerNo  not at this point  I think Q4 was really more of the same  This remains a pretty challenging environment  so Ross Gilardi    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  Got it  And then just the last thing I want to ask about is  you ve seen a return of the outgrowth in your European and China auto businesses  China now for a couple of quarters  Do you feel like you re back to the point where that is firmly kind of set to continue or does it feel kind of quarter to quarter at this point  just given the weakness in the end market Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerNo  China is very solid  I mean I think we have a long track record  The team has a long track record of outgrowing the underlying market there by a wide margin  And as I think we said in the prepared remarks  big driver is our continued penetration with local OEMs and there is a lot of runway still  And if you just look at the projects that have been locked in for the next two to three years  we re confident that that outperformance will continue E  Scott Santi    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think    on the question of Europe and North America  I think the issues now are we re sort of using in a very gross number in terms of builds  And the underlying issues are given the volatility OEM to OEM in those builds and what s going on quarter to quarter  it s kind of a bit of a choppy comparison  I think on a full year basis  it s a better way to look at our relative performance in Europe and North America  We ll be in a position to provide an update on that 419 at the Investor Day So some of that    my only point is  we have a big pipeline of penetration projects in Europe and North America and fully expect on a sort of  let s call it  even a medium term that we will outgrow those markets by a minimum of two to four points  But some of the last    things that have gone over the last six quarters  both from the standpoint of how different individual OEMs are reacting to some of the current environment and how the supply chains react to those OEMs reacting  There is some sort of real volatility there that I think sort of mucks up some of the ability to see through the underlying progress  But we track our penetration on a per vehicle basis with each of the OEMs  And on that basis feel really good about our ability to continue to penetrate at a rate well above market all around the world Ross Gilardi    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGot it  Thanks guys OperatorYour next question comes from John Inch from Gordon Haskett  Your line is open John G  Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystGood morning  everybody E  Scott Santi    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerHey  John John G  Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystHi guys  Michael  just a quick clarification  The repo is going from 1 5  to 2   Is that delta of 500 to offset the 135 of the divestitures you announced or   Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYes  that s correct  yeah John G  Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystOkay Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So that s    so let me just spend a second on that  So kind of the    our estimate for surplus capital for the year is  1 5 billion  That s currently allocated to share repurchases  Think of those as kind of the core share repurchases  And then there is an incremental  500 million to offset the EPS or the earnings that went away with those three divestitures  And to the extent that there are    and hopefully there are further divestitures this year  we will adjust that share repurchase number accordingly  So we could end up at a number that s higher than what s on the page today John G  Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystGot it  Michael  has overall demand growth presumably begins to come back once we get past some of these China issues this year and you re spending probably dollars up a little bit consistent with what other companies might be doing  How are you feeling about your confidence level of maintaining  Or how should we think about say the 100 basis points of enterprise initiatives  That actually came in the past when growth was better in the environment  Does it    is it one of those things where maybe the    you get better improvement because of the contribution benefits from improved growth  but enterprise initiative benefits sort of dials back a little bit because of the spending  Or how would you think of the mix of that  I suppose on an improving   E  Scott Santi    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I ll sort of piggyback on part of what Michael said earlier  which is the enterprise initiative visibility that we have was really about one year forward  So those are discrete projects certainly underneath a broader strategy that s largely around two things at this point  strategic sourcing and continued improvement and the quality of our practice of 80 20 across the company  And so what we are saying now is we ve got another point in front of us in 2020 that certainly I can say with confidence that that s not the end of it  But we will continue to have that as some additional sort of fuel to the profitability story here for a while The other thing I could tell you is on sort of the incremental contribution from organic growth as it accelerates  The best  I think the way I can frame that is  I don t see any way we don t generate somewhere in the range of 30  to 35  incremental contribution from every dollar of organic growth over and above enterprise initiatives John G  Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystThat s helpful E  Scott Santi    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerDoes that help John G  Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystYeah  No  it definitely helps  So just lastly  Scott and Michael  What are your    what would you say your top personal priorities are for ITW will be to accomplish maybe as we look back in a year on 2020 if there s a way to sort of frame that out E  Scott Santi    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerWe ll have to go individually  Michael is going to say he is going to want to upgrade the quality of the CEO  I think we re on it  I think the biggest thing that we ve got to continue to do is the thing we ve been    certainly have been the largest part of our focus for the last I d say two years now is really continued to accelerate our focus  not just our focus  but our execution on organic growth  And I    you know in this kind of environment it s certainly hard to see the underlying progress  But I can tell you that all of us get up every morning thinking about    our Vice Chair  Chris O Herlihy  Michael and I and every one of our EVPs get up every morning thinking about what we re going to do today to help continue to get this company toward our full potential from an organic growth rate standpoint I think the other activities around the enterprise initiatives are there is a lot of potential there  Those are certainly things that needs some level of attention to continue the momentum for sure  But ultimately  I feel really good about both the structural and strategic things we re doing from the standpoint of organic growth acceleration  And I don t think that changes in 2020 regardless of what the macro is doing at the moment  Michael to give you his answer Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerNo  Mine is exactly the same  I would just add  John  that at Investor Day we re obviously going to spend a lot of time on this topic of organic growth  including we ll give you a progress update  If you recall on the number of divisions that are in that ready to grow and growing category to find that s consistently growing above market  We re not going to    and we ll share those numbers with you and you ll see we made steady progress in 2019  And we expect to  as we execute on some really focused plans in 2020 to continue to make progress on that  So we ll share those metrics with you and we ll also give you some real divisional examples because that s really where this work is taking place To give you kind of some insights to what Scott is talking about  the whole company is focused on getting the organic growth rate going  And we ll give you a lot more detail on that when we get together in March John G  Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystI mean  the way you talked about Instron last time was very helpful  So yeah  very much looking forward to it  Thank you very much  Bye  bye E  Scott Santi    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerGood OperatorYour next question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse  Your line is open Jamie Cook    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  I think most of my questions have been answered  just clarification    or I guess two questions  One  on the Welding side  I appreciate your guide  Just wondering how you think about your organic growth guide relative to sort of what we saw in the  15   16 time period and why we shouldn t be concerned  What you re seeing in the market to give you confidence that it couldn t be worse than that  And then my second question  just given all the restructuring that you guys have done and obviously done a great job improving your margins  But assuming the markets were weaker  is there any change of your sales declined on how we should think about decrementals  Thanks Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I mean  I think on the restructuring  maybe I ll start with that  I think we ll see how the year unfolds  And we re    if market conditions deteriorate similar to what we did last year  we will pull forward some of these enterprise initiative projects specifically related to our 80 20 front to back pipeline  I expect we ll play at the same way in 2020 Welding  I think you know difficult comps  I ll start there  That s a business    this is a business that was up 10  in 2018  It s slightly down in 2019  At current run rates  we re estimating down 2  to plus 2  and that s really as much as we know at this point  We know that in all of our businesses regardless of what the environment throws at us  we will react accordingly and manage the cost side of the equation as we always do  like we did in 2019 and 2020 will not be different  But I don t have a better    we don t have a better crystal ball than you in terms of what Welding might look like other than we re using current run rates  And   E  Scott Santi    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerAnd the underlying activity start from terrible in terms of the amount of   Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think   E  Scott Santi    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerAn assumption going on  We saw a pretty big pullback in cap spending in Welding and in other places in  19  But I think our assumptions for  20 are certainly not for an improvement in the capex investment side of that  But I think steady state is a reasonable assumption given the underlying input we re getting from our customers and we re seeing in terms of the actual sort of consumption  Welding consumables  etc Jamie Cook    Credit Suisse    AnalystThanks  I ll let someone ask a question  Thank you Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorYour next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs  Your line is open Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThank you  Good morning  everyone  Happy Friday Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystSo my first question  I guess  I m trying to understand what comprises the low end of your guidance since it would imply deceleration in earnings at a time when you re expecting growth to be a little bit better and for margins to still be there Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerWell  I mean  I think that like I said earlier  we are in a pretty challenging demand environment  And in the guidance range what we try to do is account for a wide range of possible scenarios  I think the biggest swing factor here will be the overall demand environment  And so if things remain where they are  we ll be likely closer to the midpoint  If things accelerate from a demand standpoint  we ll be at the high end or above  And if things slow further  we ll be at the lower end  So I think that s really the best answer I can give you The remainder of the items  the initiatives  those are    we ve got clear line of sight  as I think Scott said earlier to all the projects and activities that will generate those savings  We know what the share repurchase program in terms of share count will do  Currency tax we re using    the rates that we gave you  And so I think those are    there is a lot less variation around those  The swing factor here is within the overall demand environment  And in the near term  this situation in China that we    that needs to be sorted out  And so we re keeping a close eye on that  So that s probably the best I can give you Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  Michael  And maybe my just    my quick follow up here is  I m thinking about the cadence  both from a growth and from a margin perspective  Is the expectation as we kind of start 2020 that growth remains negative and then turns positive as the year progresses  And then specifically on margins  you guys front end loaded your restructuring last year  How do we    how should we think about that 40 basis point impact in 2020  You re going to front end load 2020 as well Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerNo  that s not the current plan  On the restructuring  I think it will be more kind of equally spread throughout the year  If the demand environment deteriorates  we can obviously adjust  I think on your first question  so as you appreciate  we don t provide quarterly guidance anymore  I think if you look at kind of historically at how organic growth and margins and EPS kind of plays out through the year  If you look at historical averages  you can get pretty close to a reasonable scenario here I think in Q1 we had this added uncertainty around China  So we ll have to see where the organic growth rate ends up  And then I think on margins  typically what you see in Q1 is some margin improvement year over year  And then sequentially  Q2  Q3 gets better and then Q4 is slightly lower  So if you look at these historical trends  Joe  I think you can    I think that s pretty informative as you think about 2020 Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from Steven Fisher from UBS  Your line is open Steven Fisher    UBS    AnalystThanks  Good morning  I know that the commercial construction piece of your construction business is not the biggest  but you ve had some helpful and interesting perspectives on that in recent quarters  Just curious what your view is at this point and what you re seeing and assuming going forward on a commercial piece Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So the commercial business can be a little lumpy on a quarterly basis  Really that is related to the timing of project  So up 5  in the quarter was certainly one of the better numbers from that business  I think if you look at the full year  the business  construction  the commercial side is actually down low single digits  And so I think we expect at current run rates it will be similar to that in 2020  So I wouldn t expect a significant acceleration in 2020  And again  the Q4 number at 5  is at the high end of what this business typically does Steven Fisher    UBS    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  And then just to follow up again on Welding  Where does the current run rate of business puts you within that range of minus 2  to plus 2   I know you said you re    it s one of the businesses where you re assuming a wider range of outcomes  So just curious where that    where it puts you in that range because it does seem like there could be some additional headwinds there  So I m also wondering if within that consumable piece that s keeping it relatively steady overall  are there some of the drivers that are more positive and some that are more negative Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerI think to answer your questions  So what we try to do is bracket kind of the midpoint of what the run rate would suggest for 2020 adjusted for typical seasonality  So that s probably the best I can give you for Welding  so E  Scott Santi    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerSo our capital goods to consumable ratio in Welding is 65 right now Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So I think as you know  our product mix  our geographic mix is quite different than some of our peers in this space  So we are more weighted on the equipment side  That s where the technology is  that s where the higher margins are relative to the consumable side  And we re more weighted toward the North American market  which represents almost 80  of our business Steven Fisher    UBS    AnalystAnd there is no    within that segment  the end markets that are driving the demand there  any that are up and any that are down or you re all seeing them kind of moving in the same direction Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerNo  I think the industrial side  so think more heavy equipment  There is certainly some contraction in demand there  down low single digits  I think the commercial side  which is more of the smaller businesses  personal users  that s more flattish at this point  And I think we gave you  oil and gas earlier was I think down 2   And so that s probably as much color as I can give you on Welding Steven Fisher    UBS    AnalystOkay  Thanks very much OperatorOur last question will come from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research  Your line is open Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystThanks guys  Good morning  Thanks for taking me in  Obviously we ve covered a lot of ground here  so I want to keep this kind of very high level  So I think we re now in the eighth year of    maybe seventh or eighth year of the enterprise initiatives and obviously it s been very successful  It seems like most of the benefits really come through on the SG A line in the last three  four years  You talked about strategic sourcing as a big kind of driver this year  Scott  and one or two other things as well  But do you think that we re now at a level where the benefits will come more in the gross margin line  And maybe on top of that  do you think there is more scope to take down SG A below 16  going forward Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerWell  I think  Nigel  I think so far the contributions from 80 20 and sourcing have been fairly equally divided  I think on a go forward basis  we may see a little bit more impact on the VM side  But I think overall the important thing is what we talked about earlier  another solid 100 basis points this year from enterprise initiatives  What the exact geography will look like  we ll see as the year unfolds  maybe a little bit more  like I said on the bearable side of things  But overall  what s really encouraging is every segment continues to execute unidentified projects  just look at Q4  The range of contribution here is from 80 basis points to all the way to 200 basis points and overall 130 basis points in the fourth quarter  So that s probably as much as   E  Scott Santi    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think the only thing I would add is the way this gets executed  we re not going after some ratio on the P L  We re simplifying business processes  we re improving how we execute in terms of    certainly from the standpoint of productivity and efficiency  but also benefits around how we serve our customers  So none of it is that says  OK  this project    or the focus now is SG A  The focus is how do we better support sort of the quality pieces of each of these individual businesses  And so it s hard for me to even think about your question in the sense of sort of where in the geography and the P L this is  We re simplifying and improving the effectiveness of the overall performance of the business and it certainly is going to adjust the ratios on the P L as a result  But it s    I m sitting here kind of trying to think about your question  And it just is kind of outside of how it actually happens  We improve our practices and we generate outcomes in terms of    and we focus on the top line and the bottom line  And ultimately to improve the bottom line  those ratios all have to get better in terms of margin  But ultimately it s not really focus that in particular slice of the cost structure  So maybe that mucks it up even further  but that s all I can    that s all I can offer Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystYeah  No  the ratios are not coming on input  so I think I understand that  And then just a quick follow on  and this is    I think it s definitely for Mike on the inventory  So the 40 bps adjustment  that s a LIFO charge  is that correct Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I mean it s really    it s the mark to market of the inventory given that raw material costs have come down  So as we adjust the standards lower to reflect the lower raw material costs  that s the impact that you re seeing Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystOkay  I ve got a CPA  but inventory accounting is the way scape me Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerSo I can promise we ll provide a lot of detail in the 10 K that should satisfy even the most advanced CPAs among us Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystYeah  I m certainly not an advanced CPA  but just conceptually the lower raw materials close through the price cost line and then we ve got a mark to market at year end  Is that    does that sort of    doesn t it a very simple way to think about it Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerIn very simple terms  that s how it works  Yes Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystYeah  great  Thanks  Mike Michael M  Larsen    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerAll

What s Next for Illinois Tool Works 
While Illinois Tool Works has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Illinois Tool Works was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

130851,352366,ITW,This Is Why Illinois Tool Works  ITW  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Illinois Tool Works in Focus
Headquartered in Glenview  Illinois Tool Works  ITW  is an Industrial Products stock that has seen a price change of  2 59  so far this year  The equipment manufacturer for the transportation  power  food and construction industries is paying out a dividend of  1 07 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 45  compared to the Manufacturing   General Industrial industry s yield of 0 68  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 81  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  4 28 is up 3 4  from last year  Illinois Tool Works has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 19 81   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Illinois Tool Works s payout ratio is 56   which means it paid out 56  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  ITW expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 is  7 91 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 2 06  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  ITW is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2020-02-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-illinois-tool-works-itw-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200504009,200504009

130885,352400,ITW,Illinois Tool Works  ITW  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Illinois Tool Works  ITW  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 26  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This equipment manufacturer for the transportation  power  food and construction industries is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 98 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  0 5  
Revenues are expected to be  3 74 billion  down 2 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 75  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Illinois Tool Works 
For Illinois Tool Works  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 34  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Illinois Tool Works will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Illinois Tool Works would post earnings of  1 80 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 81  delivering a surprise of  0 56  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Illinois Tool Works doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/illinois-tool-works-itw-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200441938,200441938

Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Illinois Tool Works  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier

130911,352426,ITW,Earnings Preview  Illinois Tool Works  ITW  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Illinois Tool Works  ITW  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This equipment manufacturer for the transportation  power  food and construction industries is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 80 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 3  
Revenues are expected to be  3 64 billion  down 2 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 22  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Illinois Tool Works 
For Illinois Tool Works  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 02  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Illinois Tool Works will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Illinois Tool Works would post earnings of  1 82 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 83  delivering a surprise of  0 55  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Currently  Wolseley PLC has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Illinois Tool Works has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that FERGY likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than ITW has recently  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
FERGY currently has a forward P E ratio of 13 08  while ITW has a forward P E of 16 12  We also note that FERGY has a PEG ratio of 1 59  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  ITW currently has a PEG ratio of 1 63 
Another notable valuation metric for FERGY is its P B ratio of 3 52  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  ITW has a P B of 12 17 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to FERGY s Value grade of A and ITW s Value grade of C 
FERGY is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that FERGY is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fergy-or-itw-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200376107,200376107

to Drive Better Than Expected Q4 ResultsIngersoll believes that the prospects in its end markets are bright  The company expects the commercial Heating  Ventilation and Air Conditioning  HVAC  business to continue gaining from strong demand across North America  Europe as well as China  As a matter of fact  the company expects to maintain the sustained growth globally in both bookings and

Section 232 and Section 301 tariff implementation  will continue to escalate its costs  in turn  affecting its profitability in the quarters ahead  It is worth mentioning that although the company s

and 37 9   respectively  Its Gross Domestic Product  GDP  expanded roughly 1 5  in 2016 and 2 3  in 2017 The International Monetary Fund s  IMF  growth projections are also encouraging  In its January 2018 report  the IMF predicted that the global output will expand 3 9  in both 2018 and 2019  The U S  economy is projected to grow 2 7  in 2018 and 2 5  in 2019  These estimates reflect an improvement of 0 4  for 2018 and 0 6  for 2019 from its earlier growth forecasts Our in house projections indicate roughly 18  growth in earnings and a 5 6  increase in revenues for the S P 500 companies in 2018  The earnings projection compares favorably with a growth rate of 9 7  recorded in 2017 We believe that advancement in the global economy and a strengthening domestic market will prove beneficial for demand of industrial machinery  Technological advancement in agriculture and mining industries will require upgraded farming and mining machineries  while growth in demand for packaged foods and beverages across nations will raise need for highly sophisticated food processing and packaging equipment  Further  the need for better infrastructure and residential and non residential spaces will raise the demand for heavy construction machinery Industrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for industrial machinery stocks  It measures the level of output of manufacturing  mining and utilities sectors in a country  A brief discussion on the machinery industry in different nations is given below Industrial Machinery by NationThe United States  Many factors are currently working in favor of industrial machinery companies here  Encouraging job data  with an unemployment rate of 4 1  in February versus 4 7  in the year ago month  infrastructural improvement plans of the government and strengthening housing markets are some tailwinds Some other key economic indicators are pointing toward healthy operating conditions in the industry  The country s industrial production grew 4 4  year over year in February  This marked the highest increase on a year over year basis since March 2011  Mining sector expanded 9 7   utilities 10 5  and manufacturing 2 5  Also  new orders for U S  manufactured machinery in January 2018 grew 11 4  year over year while the ISM Purchasing Managers  Index or manufacturing index for February expanded 1 7 percentage points from the previous month  The improvement in the ISM Purchasing Managers  Index suggests expanding economic activities in the manufacturing sector   the key highlights being healthier business conditions  favorable export orders and production  solid backlog and employment growth Also  the implementation of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act in December 2017 lowered taxes for many corporations  enabling them to invest the free resources in growth projects  However  the government s tariff imposition on import of steel and aluminum jolted the market somewhat  with fears of possible increase in competitive threats from international players  hike in production costs and retaliatory measures by affected nations Japan  The country s economy is still struggling with internal issues  including an aging population and a huge public debt  However  strengthening exports driven by a rise in automobile shipments  improvements in domestic demand induced by healthy growth in private investments and improving employment and wage rates will be beneficial  The country s GDP grew 1 5  year over year in the fourth quarter of 2017 while registering a 0 5  rise over the previous quarter According to the report from Japan s Cabinet Office  core machinery orders  an indicator of capital spending by companies in the next six to nine months increased 8 2  in January 2018  However  this is predicted to decline 1 5  in the first quarter of 2018 while total machinery orders are predicted to fall 6 9  The IMF increased its growth projection for the country by 50 basis points  bps  to 1 2  for 2018 and by 10 bps to 0 9  for 2019 China China s GDP grew 6 8  year over year in the fourth quarter of 2017 while it expanded 6 9  in 2017  higher than the government s target of 6 5   Healthy export demand  flexible property market and rising manufacturing activities were the prime growth drivers The country s industrial production improved 7 2  year over year in both January and February 2018  Electricity  gas and water production as well as manufacturing sectors flourished while the mining recovered during the period For 2018  the government of China anticipates economy to grow roughly 6 5   We believe that robust investment for the development of infrastructure and transportation will boost the economy and spur demand for industrial machinery  Also  the country s efforts to lower its debt burden will be advantageous  However  the possibilities of a trade war with the United States  triggered by its imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum  might be a concerning factor for the both the countries  trade relations The IMF projects economy of China to grow 6 6  in 2018 and 6 4  in 2019  up roughly 10 bps from the respective previous estimates India  The country s major economic decisions   including demonetization and goods and services tax   along with other strategies to make the country a prime manufacturing hub for all nations across the world are expected to drive its economic growth  Also  favorable domestic job market  low interest rates allowing easy accessibility to cheap loans  infrastructure investments  healthy export demand and better monsoon conditions are additional factors that can make the country a favorable investment destination The country s industrial production grew 7 5  year over year in January 2018 versus a 7 1  gain recorded in December  Manufacturing output expanded 8 7   electricity production jumped 7 6  while mere 0 1  growth was registered in mining According to the IMF  the country is projected to grow 7 4  in 2018 and 7 8  in 2019 Brazil The country is grappling with uncertainties on the political front that has over time adversely affected the country s growth opportunities  General elections are due this October with high probability of abandoned initiatives to reform the country s pension system becoming a major topic of discussion  Moreover  inadequate infrastructure and a still high unemployment rate of 12 6   in three months ended February 2018  are other major hurdles Partially negating these  growth in export demand  strengthening spending in the housing markets and rise in consumer confidence are currently strengthening hopes of a turnaround in the Brazilian economy  Also  falling inflation has prompted the country s Central Bank to ease interest rates  Notably  the interest rate has been lowered 25 bps in March 2018  this being its 10th consecutive rate cut since 2017  The country s GDP in 2017 grew 1  after 3 5  decline in both 2015 and 2016 and is predicted to grow 3  in 2018 In addition  the country s industrial production has been encouraging  with year over year growth of 5 7  recorded for January 2018  This compares favorably with 4 5  growth in December 2017 and 4 7  in November 2017 The IMF expects the country s output to grow 1 9  in 2018  reflecting a 40 bps increase from the previous forecast  Also  growth projections for 2019 have been increased 10 bps to 2 1  Eurozone  The region  amidst all the political uncertainties  is showing improvements in export demand and labor markets  The region s GDP improved 2 7  year over year in fourth quarter 2017 while advanced 2 3  in 2017  Industrial production improved 2 7  year over year in January 2018 The unemployment rate was 8 6  in January 2018  down from 9 6  in the year ago month but stable compared with December The IMF raised output growth estimates by 30 bps both for 2018 and 2019 to 2 2  and 2   respectively Sector and Industry

130965,352480,ITW,Will Solid Order Levels Drive Milacron s  MCRN  Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Milacron Holdings Corp    NYSE MCRN   is slated to report first quarter 2018 results before the market opens on Apr 26 In the last reported quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of nearly 20 5   Notably  Milacron surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the last four quarters  resulting in an average surprise of 9 4  Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Milacron Holdings Corp  Price and EPS Surprise
    Key Factors to ConsiderMilacron s orders increased 9  year over year to  1 3 billion in 2017  It also ended the year with a solid backlog of  287 million  This was driven by strong order levels in the aftermarket business in North America  China  and particularly in the hot runner business and India based equipment business  This robust backlog will drive the company s first quarter performance On the equipment front  the company s India business delivered double digit top line growth in 2017  The India manufacturing facility is undergoing another round of expansion in order to meet market demand  Thus  Milacron believes the country is an important element of equipment growth strategy  where business will continue to expand In addition  the company expects its profitability to be supported by revenue growth and margin expansion in the near term  Its focus on sales of aftermarket services and parts  execution of corporate buying agreements with select customers  geographic expansion of certain product lines  and incremental share gain from new products will drive revenues Notably  Milacron s Advanced Plastic Processing Technologies  APPT  segment will benefit from rising demand in the plastic processing machinery industry  backed by the overall estimated increase in plastic processing  increasing equipment age and continuing advancement in technology  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment sales is pegged at  163 million for the first quarter  reflecting 3 8  year over year improvement In the Melt Delivery and Control Systems  MDCS  segment  the hot runner market is predicted to grow faster than the overall global economy based on macro economic drivers involving product life cycles  demographics  technology conversion and growing demand of plastic  Our consensus estimates indicate that sales of Milacron s MDCS segment will reach  106 million in the to be reported quarter  reflecting 6  year over year growth Further  its fluids segment will grow on elevated demand for technology fluids  driven by environmental and health concerns  and increasing prevalence of exotic metals  We expect that quarterly sales for the segment will likely be  31 million  up around 6  year over year Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Milacron s earnings per share is pegged at 39 cents for the first quarter  underlining year over year growth of roughly 21 9   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales of  299 million also indicates nearly 5  growth from the prior year quarter However  the company stated that the first quarter equipment sales volume is typically the lowest of the year due to timing of customers  capital spending programs  Furthermore  input cost inflation  particularly steel  will continue to be a headwind and impact margins in the quarter to be reported Milacron s shares have underperformed the  it belongs to over the past year  affected by the prevalent headwinds  The stock has gained around 10  compared to nearly 23  growth recorded by the industry Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Milacron is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive   and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Milacron is  2 33   This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 40 cents comes in higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents   A favorable Earnings ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Milacron currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings Conversely  stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement The combination of Milacron s Zacks Rank  3 and Earnings ESP of  2 33  makes us confident of a likely earnings beat Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Alarm com Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ ALRM    with an Earnings ESP of  5 44  and a Zacks Rank  1  The stock has appreciated 29  in a year s time  You can see  Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT    with an Earnings ESP of  4 07  and a Zacks Rank  2  Its shares have rallied 58  in the past year Illinois Tool Works Inc    NYSE ITW    with an Earnings ESP of  1 02  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company s shares have been up 13  during the same time frame Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6   and  67 1  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably

130966,352481,ITW,Illinois Tool  ITW  Earnings Likely To Beat Estimates In Q1,opinion,Illinois Tool Works Inc    NYSE ITW   is scheduled to release first quarter 2018 results on Apr 26  before the market opens The industrial products and equipment manufacturer s financial performance in the last four quarters was impressive  Illinois Tool Works pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 4 16   In the last reported quarter  its earnings of  1 70 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 62 by 4 94  However  its share price movements have not been impressive  In the last six months  the company s shares have declined 0 6   below 1 2  gain recorded by the it belongs to Let us see how things are shaping up for Illinois Tool Works this quarter  Factors to Affect Q1 ResultsBased on available data for few economic indicators  we can ascertain that operating conditions were quite favorable for industrial machinery companies in the first quarter of 2018  Industrial production in the quarter grew at an annual rate of 4 5   Also  ISM Purchasing Managers  Index for March pointed toward an expanding manufacturing sector   reflecting growth in new orders  production activities  employment  new export orders and inventories  New orders of U S  made machinery increased roughly 9 2  year over year in the first two months of 2018 Besides these  favorable growth in the U S  housing markets  as well as growing domestic and world economy  might have proved beneficial for industrial machinery stocks  In the first quarter  housing starts increased roughly 4 9  compared with the previous quarter  Also  the implementation of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act in December last year will have its positive impacts in forms of lower tax rates Narrowing down to the company level  we believe that Illinois Tool Works  greatest strength is its diversified business portfolio  It operates through seven business segments  which lowers risks of losses due to weakness in one or more segments  Rising production of cars in the U S  in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter will support growth of the Automotive OEM segment  Also  the company s efforts to increase content per vehicle  as well as content demand from international buyers and growing acceptance of electric vehicles globally  will be a boon The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Automotive OEM segment s revenues stands at  893 million for the first quarter  above  828 million and  828 million reported in the previous quarter and the year ago quarter  respectively  Also  the segment s average sales surprise for the last four quarters was a positive 2 88  For the Construction Products segment  the first quarter might be a surprise  Its sales in the quarter are predicted to be  434 million  above  412 million and  395 million reported in the previous and the year ago quarter  respectively  Likewise  the Polymers   Fluids  Specialty Products and Welding segments are set for a likely sales surprise in the first quarter In the first quarter of 2018  Illinois Tool Works anticipates organic revenue growth to be 3 4   Tax rate is anticipated to be 24 5 25 5  However  we remain cautious of the Food Equipment segment  Its sales are forecasted at  526 million  below  548 million reported in the previous quarter but above the year ago tally of  497 million  The major concerning factor is the average sales surprise of  1 93  in the last four trailing quarters  Also  price cost headwind might be an issue  as the company predicts 30 40 basis points of price cost headwind for 2018  Earnings WhispersOur proven model provides some idea about the stocks that are about to release their earnings results  Per the model  a stock needs a combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for a likely earnings beat  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  The case with Illinois Tool Works has been provided

130967,352482,ITW,Machinery Stocks  Apr 26 Earnings Roster  ITW  PH  AIT  MCRN,opinion,The first quarter earnings season is rapidly unwinding with 87 members of the S P 500 index already having released results  By the end of this week  more than half of the S P 500 members will have reported financial numbers  The trajectory so far indicates that growth of earnings and revenues are treading materially above historical levels Per the latest   total earnings for the companies who have reported are up 25  year over year on 10 7  higher revenues  The beat ratio is impressive with 82 8  companies surpassing bottom line expectations and 67 8  outperforming on the top line front  In fact  62 1  of companies have topped both EPS and revenue estimates Clearly  the first quarter of 2018 is projected to register better earnings growth and revenue momentum than what we have witnessed in the previous quarters  Overall earnings for all the S P 500 are expected to be up 18 3  on 7 7  growth in revenues  This represents an improved growth projection from the previous quarter and is likely to be driven by a corporate tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data In fact  we expect double digit year over year earnings growth for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors  The  sector  placed at the top 6  out of the 16 Zacks sectors  is one of the sectors expected to record double digit earnings growth  mainly driven by the U S  tax reforms After struggling with soft commodity prices  reduced investment in the energy sector and dismal economic conditions in some developed and developing nations in the last few years  the sector seems to have regained its momentum in 2017  The turnaround was primarily driven by higher infrastructure spending and other growth friendly policies of the new administration  Rise in manufacturing and mining activity also played a crucial role Industrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for industrial stocks  For first quarter 2018  industrial production   a measure of output at factories  mines and utilities   rose at an annual rate of 4 5   Also  the Purchasing Managers Index  PMI  tally was 59 3  in March  This indicates strong growth in manufacturing  led by continued expansion in new orders  production activity  employment and inventories According to our latest projections  the sector is projected to log an earnings growth of 25 8  in first quarter 2018 on the back of 12 8  rise in revenues However  this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space  A company s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management s ability to implement operating and strategic plans  Notably  our research shows that when a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  stock is combined with a positive   the chance of beating earnings estimates is high It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell

130994,352509,ITW,A O  Smith  AOS  Tops Q4 Earnings  Posts Record 2017 Sales,opinion,A  O  Smith Corporation   NYSE AOS   reported fourth quarter 2017 earnings per share of 60 cents  ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents  thereby continuing its earnings beat streak of 24 straight quarters  which the company broke just once as it reported in line earnings last quarter The earnings figure improved 27 7  from the year ago tally of 47 cents  The bottom line improvement mainly came on the back of robust sales growth For 2017  the company generated adjusted net earnings of  378 3 million or  2 17 per share  up 16  from the prior year figure Inside the HeadlinesNet sales in the quarter were up an impressive 10 1  year over year to  768 6 million  The figure also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  767 1 million by a whisker  A thriving water heater industry in the United States  strong demand for Lochinvar branded boilers  and robust consumer product demand in China fueled the top line growth For the full year  the company posted record sales of  3 billion  up almost 12  from the 2016 tally Coming back to the fourth quarter  A O  Smith s sales in the North America segment  comprising U S  and Canadian water heaters and boilers  grew 6  year over year to  460 8 million  Higher volumes of commercial water heaters  strong sales of boilers  and pricing actions related to elevated steel costs proved conducive to the sales performance of this region  Water treatment products contributed about  9 million to revenues  thus supplementing the segment s growth Segmental operating earnings rose an impressive 17  year over year to  104 9 million  The segment s profit was favorably influenced by higher sales of commercial water heaters and boilers and pricing actions  However  the benefit was partially offset by flared up steel costs  Consequently  operating margin expanded 230 basis points  bps  to 22 8  on a year over year basis Smith  A O   Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Quarterly sales at the Rest of the World segment  including China  India and Europe  were up 17  year over year to  313 8 million  The improvement came largely on the back of consistent solid customer demand for A O  Smith s premium water heating and water treatment products  particularly in India  up 40    Also  favorable pricing actions added to the top line Operating earnings at the segment climbed a whopping 33  year over year to  50 8 million in the quarter  The favorable impact of excellent sales in India and China  along with favorable pricing actions  was partially offset by escalating steel and installation cost  Operating margin advanced 200 bps to 16 2  year over year Share RepurchasesDuring 2017  A O  Smith repurchased around 2 5 million common shares for  139 1 million  At the end of the year  the company has approximately 2 4 million shares remaining under the existing discretionary repurchase authority Liquidity   Cash FlowExiting the year on Dec 31  2017  A O  Smith s cash and cash equivalents totaled  346 6 million compared with  330 4 million a year back  Cash generated from operations during the year came in at  326 4 million  lower than  446 6 million recorded last year  as higher earnings were more than offset by higher outlays for working capital At the end of the reported quarter  long term debt was  402 9 million compared with  316 4 million witnessed at the end of Dec 31  2016 Also  earlier this month  A O  Smith announced a 29  hike in its quarterly cash dividend  The new dividend of 18 cents per share will be paid on Feb 15 to shareholders on record as of Jan 31 This translates to a dividend of 72 cents per share on an annualized basis  and marks the 13th consecutive year in which the company has increased its quarterly cash dividend GuidanceConcurrent with the fourth quarter results  the company released optimistic guidance for 2018  and expects adjusted earnings to lie in the range of  2 50 2 58 per share  The mid point of the range reflects impressive year over year growth of 17   The buoyant guidance reflects the company s robust growth momentum  backed by solid demand Our TakeA O  Smith wrapped up 2017 with solid momentum  with double digit sales growth driven by continued strong demand for its consumer products in China  and positive end markets for the company s water heaters and boilers in North America  A O  Smith s continued sales and earnings growth over the past several quarters highlight the company s underlying strength We believe stellar prospects in China and the U S  end markets will continue to accelerate growth in the near future  Also  dominant foothold in the North American water heater market  along with thriving prospects in the residential and commercial boiler markets  is likely to stoke growth However  over the past few quarters  this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company s SG A expenses in China  including elevated steel costs and higher fees paid to installers  have been quite high  which is creating pressure on the company s operating margins  Furthermore  transition of the Chinese economy to a consumer driven one might impact A O  Smith s sales in the region Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the same space include Illinois Tool Works Inc    NYSE ITW    Parker Hannifin Corporation   NYSE PH   and RBC Bearings Incorporated   NASDAQ ROLL    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Illinois Tool Works has a solid earnings surprise history for the trailing four quarters  having beaten estimates each time for an average of 4 2  Parker Hannifin also has an impressive earnings surprise history  with an average beat of 16 6  over the preceding four quarters  beating estimates all through RBC Bearings generated

130996,352511,ITW,Should You Buy Lincoln Electric  LECO  At This P E Multiple ,opinion,"Lincoln Electric Holdings  NASDAQLECO  trades at a P E multiple of 24 7x  which is higher than the Industrials sector median of 22 9x  While this makes LECO appear like a stock to avoid or sell if you own it  you might change your mind after gaining a better understanding of the assumptions behind the P E ratio  In this article  I will break down what the P E ratio is  how to interpret it and what to watch out for 
Understanding Valuation Multiples and the P E Ratio
A Multiples Valuation  also known as a Comparable Companies Analysis  determines the value of a subject company by benchmarking the subject s financial performance against similar public companies  Peer Group   We can infer if a company is undervalued or overvalued relative to its peers by comparing metrics like growth  profit margin  and valuation multiples 
A P E Multiple is a valuation ratio that indicates the multiple of earnings investors are willing to pay for one share of a company 
P E Multiple   Stock Price   Earnings Per Share
The P E ratio is not meant to be viewed in isolation and is only useful when comparing it to other similar companies  Since it is expected that similar companies have similar P E ratios  we can come to some conclusions about the stock if the ratios are different  I compare Lincoln Electric s P E multiple to those of Colfax Corporation  NYSE CFX   Illinois Tool Works   NYSE ITW   Kennametal  NYSE KMT  and Crane Company  NYSE CR  in the chart below source  finbox io Benchmarks  P E Multiples
Since Lincoln Electric s P E of 24 7x is lower than the median of its peers  30 3x   it means that investors are paying less than they should for each dollar of LECO s earnings  As such  our analysis shows that LECO represents an undervalued stock  In fact  finbox io s P E Multiple Model calculates a fair value of  109 34 per share which implies 16 6  upside Note that the selected multiple of 29 0x in the analysis above was determined by comparing Lincoln Electric s current P E multiple with its peer group 
Understanding the P E Ratio s Limitations
Before jumping to the conclusion that Lincoln Electric should be added to your portfolio  it is important to understand that our conclusion rests on two important assumptions 
 1  the selected peer group actually contains companies that truly are similar to Lincoln Electric  and
 2  the selected peer group stocks are being fairly valued by the market 
If the first assumption is not accurate  the difference in P E ratios could be due to a variety of factors  For example  if you accidentally compare Lincoln Electric with higher growth companies  then its P E multiple would naturally be lower than its peers since investors reward high growth stocks with a higher price  However  the company s growth and profit margins actually look attractive relative to its peers as illustrated below source  
Now if the second assumption does not hold true  Lincoln Electric s lower multiple may be because firms in our peer group are being overvalued by the market 
What This Means For Investors
As a shareholder  you may have already conducted fundamental analysis on the stock so its current undervaluation could signal a potential buying opportunity to increase your position in LECO  However  keep in mind the limitations of the P E ratio when making investment decisions  There are a variety of other fundamental factors that I have not taken into consideration in this article  If you have not done so already  I highly recommend you to complete your research on Lincoln Electric by taking a look at the following 
Valuation Metrics  how much upside do shares of Lincoln Electric have based on the Ben Graham Formula  Take a look at our Ben Graham Formula data explorer which also compares the company s upside to its peers

This is a stable  high quality company that has consistently beaten both earnings and revenue estimates that pays a nice  2 01  dividend yield   Further  ITW is considered a dividend aristocrat  a company that has increased their annual dividend for at least 25 consecutive years   so we should expect to see a bump in the dividend over the next 12 months as well  
McDonald s  MCD  holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and over the past several quarters their international reach has been a strong tailwind for the company which has driven sales above expectations in four of the last five quarters   The new meal options and innovation have been a large part of their sustained success  and people across the globe are visiting the famous chain more and more   This was reflected in their recent same store sales  SSS  data  High Growth Markets  China   6 2   Foundation Markets  Japan   10 2    International Lead Markets  Europe  Canada   5 7  and even at home as SSS were up  4 1

131074,352589,ITW,Why Lincoln Electric s Stock May See A 20  Correction Soon,opinion,"Lincoln Electric  NASDAQ LECO  is expected to report earnings on Tuesday  April 18th before the market opens  The stock s valuation is becoming stretched as shares have appreciated over 50  within the last year and currently trade near an all time high 
Finbox io fair value data implies that the stock is approximately 25  overvalued  The estimate is calculated by applying Wall Street projections to eight separate valuation analyses as shown below  This compares to Wall Street s consensus price target of  79 50 implying nearly 10  downside 
The manufacturer and reseller of welding and cutting products has beat its earnings  EPS  estimates three out of the last four quarters  This positive trend suggests that the stock should be trading near its high  However  this is a misleading statement when analyzing the company s true operating performance 
Lincoln Electric s  and  has generally declined over the last twelve quarters as shown in the chart below  In Q4 14  the company generated  122 million of EBITDA on  684 million of revenue  This is well above its Q4 16 EBITDA of  100 million on  564 million of revenue 

While financial performance has deteriorated  the stock has traded higher  Is it because Lincoln Electric is expected to outperform going forward 
Projected Performance vs Peers
Lincoln Electric s projected revenue and EBITDA growth is middle of the road when compared to its publicly traded peer group  Crane Company  NYSE CR   Colfax  NYSE CFX   Kennametal Inc  NYSE KMT  and Illinois Tool Works  NYSE ITW  
When applying Wall Street s consensus forecast for each company  Lincoln Electric s projected 5yr revenue CAGR of 3 3  is slightly above CR  3 1    CFX  3 0    KMT  2 0   and below ITW  3 9    Additionally  the company s projected 5yr EBITDA CAGR of 7 4  is only above ITW  5 5   and below CR  18 4   and CFX  12 8   
Valuation Multiples vs Peers
Typically  higher growth stocks will trade at higher valuation multiples but this is not the case for Lincoln Electric  The company s projected growth is mediocre at best but trades at higher valuation multiples relative to its peers 
Lincoln Electric s forward EBITDA multiple of 14 8x is above all of the comparable companies  CR  9 3x   CFX  12 5x   KMT  13 2x  and ITW  13 6x   Furthermore  the company s forward P E multiple of 25 2x is above CR  16 8x   CFX  24 4x  and ITW  21 4x  and only below KMT  28 5x  

According to S P s CapitalIQ  Lincoln Electric s forward EBITDA and forward P E multiple has averaged 10 3x and 17 7x over the last 5 years  respectively  That s a 4 5x EBITDA multiple expansion and a 7 5 P E multiple expansion  The company s valuation has stretched to an unreasonable level which is not supported by underlying earnings and is getting ready to snap 
Shares May See A Correction Soon
On April 8th   recommended that investors take profits and sell Lincoln Electric  The independent equity research firm gave the company its lowest fair value rank while suggesting the stock is 20  overvalued 
Finbox io s valuation analyses imply that Lincoln Electric has even more downside purely on a fundamental basis  So what could be the catalyst that causes the stock to fall to a more reasonable level 
An earnings misstep might just do it  Value investors may want to stay clear of LECO before the company reports on Tuesday ",2017-04-11,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-lincoln-electric’s-stock-may-see-a-20-correction-soon-200182347,200182347

131080,352595,ITW,3 Reasons To Be Bullish On Illinois Tool Works  ITW  Ahead Of Earnings,opinion,"In the midst of Q2 earnings season  Illinois Tool Works   NYSE ITW   prepares to release its second quarter 2017 report on July 24  Illinois Tool Works manufactures and markets a variety of products and systems that provide specific  problem solving solutions for a diverse customer base worldwide 
Illinois Tool Works possesses a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   and it has beaten its earnings projections in each of its past fourteen operational quarters dating back to 2014  Due to the company s impressive Zacks Rank and Earnings ESP of 1 84   Illinois Tool Works appears to be on the cusp of surpassing its earnings estimates once again 
If that s not sufficient  check out these three additional reasons to view the security with optimism as we approach its earnings report date 
1        Development via acquisitions
Illinois Tool Works remains committed toward making acquisitions for the development of its core segments  as well as the creation of new platforms for expanding long term growth  Recently  the company acquired the Engineered Fasteners and Components business from ZF TRW  which has expanded the company s product offerings under its automotive segment 
In the first quarter of 2017  acquisitions added 3 8  to total revenue growth and also helped the company achieve higher operating margins  better capital efficiency  and solid return on invested capital 
2        Superb growth prospects
Illinois Tool Works excels in several growth categories because the company features strong metrics that influence expansion  For instance  the stock sports an RoE of 46 48  and net margin of 15 24   both of which demolish the industry averages of 11 15  and 4 55   respectively 
Additionally  Illinois Tool Works is projected to real in  3 62 billion in revenue  which would signify year over year growth of 5 37   Also  the company is expected earn  1 63 per share  which would represent growth of 11 80   These measures are especially solid considering the company s massive size  as it s always encouraging to see the existing giants deliver consistent growth 
3        Growth in key segments
Illinois Tool Works is projected to report year over year increases in several key segments of its business model  For example  the company s Automotive sector reported sales of  670 million for Q2 2016  However  according to our exclusive consensus estimates for Q2 2017  Illinois Tools Works  Automotive business is expected to earn  811 3 million  which would mark an impressive 21 1  year over year growth in unit revenue 
Further  Illinois Tool Works reported revenues of  484 million for its Specialty Products unit in the prior year quarter  The company is projected to earn  498 5 million for Q2 2017  which would represent almost a 3  year over year growth in revenue 
These important stock drivers are from our exclusive non financial metrics consensus estimate file  These estimates are updated daily and are based on the independent research of expert stock analysts

131096,352611,ITW,DJIA Today  Healthiest Of All The Indices ,opinion,"My Trading Journal for the DJIA Today 
Nasdaq still doesn t look so bad  Russell Index does look pretty rough  the S P 500 is giving up all of Wednesday s market rally  but the DJIA today managed to hold that 10 day moving average with a three day pullback that was quite shallow in nature  If it holds tomorrow  who knows  maybe a 3x Dow ETF could come into play and provide a nice risk reward opportunity for traders  But it will need to show a clean bounce off of the 10 day MA for that to happen 
I ve been harping on this indicator quite a bit lately  but it bears mentioning  the T2108 is looking disastrous  It broke through key support at 50  which was established on multiple occasions in January and February  This time it didn t work and it broke through to the downside and now only 49  of stocks are trading above the 40 day MA  I m not going to post a chart on it tonight  because I plan on doing a full dedicated post on it tomorrow 
But the T2108 is acting in a manner that is very similar to August of 2015 when the market spent much of the year trading sideways while the indicator deteriorated rapidly under the surface  This has me questioning the further legitimacy of the bull rally  but at this point  I will not rule out the rally continuing still for a time going forward  Just be aware of the deteriorating conditions

Okay so the headline might be a bit of an exageration but the past two trading days  when 3 30pm eastern typically triggers an end of day run  the exact opposite has happened where stocks start to slide out of absolutely nowhere 
Perhaps it is just a temporary thing  but one can t deny that the past two days has been quite different  where instead of retail money pouring into managed assets at the end of day  it appears that retail might be booking some recent gains of their own 
That doesn t mean we need to get net short on this market but you need to make sure you are managing risk by not getting to heavy on tilled on your  and maintaining the flexibility to flip net short if need be 
On  and you need to read up on the  on this indicator and what you can do to prepare 
Make sure to keep an eye on oil and its ETF counterpart United States Oil Fund  NYSE USO  which had a massive sell off today and should be a concern going forward  as oil is clearly trying to push back toward the November lows once again

Talked  and that is exactly what happened  Practically as perfect of a test as you could possibly have on a moving average  we then saw a hard and fast bounce into the close  I bought UPRO off of the MA for a day trade and made a quick 1 2  profit on the trade  Easy  Wish every trade was that easy 
Now we got non farm payrolls out this morning  The numbers don t really matter  what does matter is how the market reacts to it  and so far the market is in love with it  So  we are going to have a double digit gap up this morning  Maybe we run in similar fashion to what we saw last Wednesday  I doubt it though  Careful in the first 30 minutes of trading as well  market may tip its hand early on whether it wants to gap and crap this market move 
For an update on the T2108 indicator  get this  only 39  of stocks are trading above their 40 day moving average  That will improve notably today if we get a rally  but still  that is insanely low for the kind of price action we are seeing

Banks may pop on the news but in the past week  they have shown no signs of it with price stalling considerably   especially among the regional banks 
Volume on SPDRs S P 500  SPY  NYSE SPY   been solid the past two days  which is unusual considering the price action of late  Friday s action represented a breakout of the bull flag on SPY as well  but once again the intraday price action was nothing to get thrilled about

131100,352615,ITW,S P 500 s Lethargic Chart,opinion,"The S P 500 is holding true to the rising trend line and is also holding its 20 day moving  The FOMC is also upon us  This is the week that it is likely to raise rates and if you remember  I ve been saying for a couple of months now that the Fed will raise rates because with the market soaring and jobs still coming in strong  it has no other choice but to take advantage of the strength the market is showing and raise rates  especially if it wants to appear credible at year s end with its projected three rate hike projection 
Banks may pop on the news but in the past week  they have shown no signs of it with price stalling considerably    especially among the regional banks 
Volume on SPDR s S P 500  NYSE SPY  has been solid the past two days  which is unusual considering the price action of late  Friday s action represented a breakout of the bull flag on SPY as well  but once again  the intraday price action was nothing to get thrilled about 
T2108    of stocks trading above their 40 day moving average  bounced on Friday by 5 3  and managed to climb back above 42  
Finally  keep an eye on oil    It has been on a hard 5 day pullback  It has been a while since we have seen considerable weakness in the commodity  but if it persists  eventually it will effect the broader markets more directly

131101,352616,ITW,Stock TA Keeps Diverging While Large Caps Hold Strong ,opinion,"Stock TA Diverging Hard from Market Price Action
The price action is dull in the overall market  and while the price on the indices still hovers at the all time highs  the TA of stocks  technical analysis  continues to falter under the surface  Breadth is dismal  and without a catalyst to continue pushing the market higher at this point  profit taking continues to gain momentum under the surface 
There are plenty of stocks whose TA suggests they ll breakout and they aren t hard to find  but the majority of stocks at the moment are languishing  Some are getting hit by downgrades  and others still trying to recover from their earnings reports  And the T2108 is showing that only 2 out of every 5 stocks are trading above their 40 day moving average 
And all of this is masked right now because the Volatility Index  VIX  is getting hammered on a daily basis  I mean  today alone  the index  on the 30 minute chart  only had  2  30 minute periods where it actually traded higher from open to close  The other 11 periods all traded lower  This kind of behavior is masking the gradual erosion of stock s TA that not many people are talking about at this point 
Just because that is happening though  doesn t mean you get short  because the market isn t giving you a good edge to get short just yet  Heck  this kind of erosion can continue for another few months  Do you really want to keep shorting stocks during a dull market period  Of course not  Wait for the indices to start showing what plenty of stocks are already showing beneath the surface  And be ready for it at any time

Do I think we ll go this whole year without such a pullback  No  There will be a pullback and there will be a point at which this rally is completely called into question and doubted by the media and masses as a whole 
But for now  the play is to continue trading this Fed Up Trump Rally  Short plays are likely to lose you money  thought not on my recent American Airlines Group  NASDAQ AAL  trade   and the long positions are likely to be more forgiving than what you expect them to be  However  We are only working with knowledge and understanding up to the moment  At any point everything can change and that is when you ll want to find yourself managing risk all along  It always happens and will happen again  Just always be one step ahead of the crowd

131132,352647,ITW,Stock Market Today  Weak Underneath  Strong Up On Top,opinion,"SPX did what it does best following a morning sell off  and that is  to buy the freakin  dip    BTFD  for those looking to add another acronym to their life    identified this as a potential bounce area  I played it likewise by buying UPRO near the lows of the day and closing it with about 10 minutes left in the trading session as a simple day trade 
But overall  I chose not to buy any additional swing trades until I can see how this market wants to perform tomorrow 
Did you notice the volume on SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   Only 55m shares traded  That is incredibly light and unexciting for us traders  The market traded that way to with very dull price action throughout the duration of the day  Notice too how well the 10 day moving average held up on the charts  Three times in the last seven trading session  price has bounced off of the 10 day moving average like a champ  and right now you could say it is trying to form somewhat of a bull flag pattern 
VIX of course had a nice spike higher to start the day  but it only takes a quick glance at the chart to realize that we are reaching a stage of euphoria that hasn t been seen since in this market since 2007 or before the dot com bubble ended  I haven t talked much about oil of late  but notice the candle in today s trading session in relation to the rest of the candles on the chart and you ll see how the chart does appear to be rolling over  particularly on the United States Oil Fund  NYSE USO  chart 
The T2108 continues to drop hard and did so yet again today with an 8 7  decline all the way down to 52   We are right near all time highs for the stock market and barely over 50  of the stocks trading over their 40 day moving average  That is an unheard of bearish divergence 
So keep an open mind to what the market may want to do and plan according to the risk parameters that you will want to use going forward

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Efficient Stocks Poised to Fetch Significant Returns 

Companies with a favorable efficiency level have always been on investors  radar due to their potential to perform better than others  A company that is capable of converting its input into outputs efficiently generally attracts investors  attention  Thus investing in efficient companies is likely to provide solid yield in any market conditions 

Key Efficiency Ratios

In order to measure the efficiency level of a company  one must consider the efficiency ratios  The popular ones are 

Inventory Turnover  The ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a 4 quarter average inventory is considered as one of the most popular efficiency ratios  It indicates a company s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position  While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS  a low value indicates that the company is suffering from weak sales  which resulted in excess inventory 

Receivables Turnover   This is the ratio of 12 month sales to four quarter average receivables  It shows a company s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit  A high receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or the  debtor s turnover ratio  is desirable as it signals that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers 

Asset Utilization  This ratio indicates a company s capability to convert its assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level  It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last 4 quarter average of total assets  Like the above two ratios  high asset utilization may also indicate that a company is efficient 

Operating Margin  This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period  It measures a company s ability to control its operating expenses  Hence  a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers 

As efficiency level varies across different industries  it is best to select those stocks that have higher ratios compared to their industries  Along with higher ratios  we have considered only those stocks that have either a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  in order to make the strategy more profitable 

Screening Parameters

Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average   The value of these ratios higher than industry averages indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2   Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through 

The use of these very few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7 700stocks to only 22 

Here are five of the 22 stocks 

Lantheus Holdings  Inc      is involved in developing  manufacturing  selling and distributing diagnostic medical imaging agents and products for diagnosis of cardiovascular and other diseases  This Zacks Rank  1 company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of more than 100  

The Home Depot  Inc      is one of the world s largest home improvement retailers  The company offers a level of service unprecedented among warehouse style retailers  This Zacks Rank  2 company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 4 2  

Neenah Paper  Inc      is a leading global specialty materials company  focused on premium niche markets that include advanced filtration media  specialized substrates and premium printing and packaging papers  This Zacks Rank  2 company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 9 8  

Illinois Tool Works Inc      manufactures and markets a variety of products and systems that provide specific  problem solving solutions for a diverse customer base worldwide  This Zacks Rank  2 company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 2 6  

Apogee Enterprises  Inc      is a leader in technologies involving the design and development of value added glass products and services  This Zacks Rank  2 company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 9 8  

While backtesting over a two year timeframe  Aug 1  2014 to Aug 5  2016   considering a four week holding period  a portfolio following this strategy provided a total return of 15 9  compared with the S P 500 s return of 9 3   Thus this strategy may prove to be profitable for investors seeking healthy returns

131209,352724,ITW,PNR  A Cheap Aristocrat With 40 Straight Years Of Dividend Growth,opinion,"Pentair  N PNR  is a lesser known dividend aristocrat that most recently boosted its dividend by 5   representing its 40th consecutive year of dividend increases 
Weak energy markets  slumping commodity prices  and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates are wreaking havoc on the company  which has seen its stock price plummet by more than 30  over the last year 
However  two of the company s four segments delivered organic growth last year  and a third is poised to return to growth in 2016  Three of its businesses have also delivered healthy margin expansion  and a well known activist investor took a 7  stake in the company in mid 2015  the stock has since sold off by nearly 40   
Perhaps there is a buying opportunity here for our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio Business OverviewPNR was formed in 1966 and is a diversified industrial manufacturing company that sells a wide range of products including valves  water system products  actuators  switches  pumps  filters  enclosures  heat management systems  and more 
By end market  PNR generated 33  of its 2015 sales in the residential and commercial construction  25  in industrial  23  in energy  10  in food   beverage  and 9  in infrastructure markets 
By geography  PNR generated 49  of its 2015 sales in the U S   18  in Western Europe  14  in China   SE Asia   India   Middle East  13  in the Rest of the World  and 6  in Canada Business AnalysisWhile PNR has a number of technologically advanced products  R D is not a major competitive advantage  the company spends 1 5 2 0  of its sales on R D  which amounted to  117 million in 2014  
Instead  the company s advantages primarily come from its long standing customer relationships  PNR has 50 years of operating history   focus on profitable niches  reputation for quality  wide assortment of products  technical know how  and sizable distribution network 
PNR also has a large global installed base  which provides meaningful aftermarket revenue  This business generates less volatile cash flow that can be used for acquisitions  PNR s markets are highly fragmented  so it has plenty of opportunity to continue consolidating the industry 
Like many other industrial companies  PNR also has its own management system grounded in lean methodologies  PNR began its initial lean deployments in 2005 and believes lean operations are now part of its DNA  driving productivity throughout the enterprise 
The company expects to significantly rationalize its footprint over the next five years by reducing its number of factories and distribution centers by at least 30   When global growth is slow  these are the levers that industrial companies have to pull to protect their earnings and position themselves for the next upturn 
Management is doing everything they can to pull costs out of PNRs Valves and Controls business  which is experiencing mid teens sales declines  There is not much more PNR can do  but management has shown a willingness to shed non strategic  lousy businesses in the past if it cannot generate a good return Pentair s Key RisksPNR s diversification by product  end market  and geography help protect the company from being decimated by any single macro factor  but the business will always be sensitive to broader trends in global economic growth 
PNR s exposure to energy  23  of sales  and industrial  25   markets is hurting its results today  Oil and gas customers are spending less and pushing back hard on pricing  which is compressing PNR s profits  Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates are also impacting the company s growth 
We believe the rest of 2016 will remain challenging  but some of PNR s other markets are performing better  e g  food and beverage   Over the long run  we expect the macro environment to revert to the mean 
The greater risk to PNR s earnings power would be if its products were increasingly commoditized or the company makes a foolish acquisition that endangers the company s health  We view these risks as being unlikely events Dividend Analysis  PentairWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
PNR s Dividend Safety Score is 41  indicating its safety is close to average  The company s dividend has consumed 50  of its earnings and 39  of its free cash flow over its last four quarters  which is reasonably healthy for a macro sensitive business  PNR s free cash flow payout ratio has also remained mostly stable around 30  during its last 10 fiscal years  giving us further confidence in the business Source  Simply Safe Dividends
As we mentioned earlier  PNR s business is sensitive to the economy  While the company s sizable aftermarket sales base reduces some of its volatility  PNR s revenue still dropped by 20  in 2009  and its stock fell by 31  in 2008  This isn t the best business to own in the event of a recession Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Compared to other high quality industrial companies such as Illinois Tool Works  N ITW  and Parker Hannifin  N PH   PNR s return on invested capital is relatively disappointing  ITW and PH generate returns on capital that are roughly twice as high as PNR s returns  indicating that they are in more profitable niches and have been superior allocators of capital 
Trian  the activist investor involved with PNR  probably believes PNR is under earning and can improve its returns with the right acquisitions and productivity initiatives  Source  Simply Safe Dividends
While PNR s returns on capital are more mediocre than we like to see  its cash flow generation has been excellent  As seen below  PNR has delivered free cash flow in nine of the last 10 years and has more than doubled its annual free cash flow generation over the last decade  Consistently generating free cash flow gives PNR flexibility to pursue acquisitions and sustainably grow its dividend Source  Simply Safe Dividends
PNR s balance sheet is the biggest factor weighing on the company s Dividend Safety Score  As seen below  PNR has just  126 million of cash on hand compared to  4 7 billion in debt  Its dividend payments last year also exceed the company s current cash balance  putting pressure on the company to generate enough cash flow to keep funding its dividend and operations  If it weren t for PNR s consistent free cash flow generation and large aftermarket business  this would be a bigger issue Source  Simply Safe DividendsDividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
PNR plans to raise its dividend by 5  in 2016  marking its 40th consecutive dividend increase  The company is a dividend aristocrat and will also join the dividend kings list in 10 years  PNR s Dividend Growth Score is 68  which indicates that the company has above average long term dividend growth potential 
While macro headwinds will restrict near term earnings and dividend growth  we can see that PNR s dividend growth rate otherwise accelerated over the last decade  Assuming macro conditions eventually normalize and PNR returns to a 9 11  earnings growth rate  we expect the company s dividend to resume growth at a high single digit rate Source  Simply Safe DividendsValuationPNR trades at 11x forward earnings and has a dividend yield of 3 1   which is significantly higher than its five year average yield of 1 9  
Management also believes PNR can deliver 2 4  organic sales growth and 9 11  annual earnings per share growth over the long term  which would imply 12 14  annual total return potential even if PNR s earnings multiple remains depressed  The market must think that PNR s business trends are going to get worse before they get better 
We think the stock is starting to look attractively priced for investors with a time horizon of at least five years  However  we think the company s balance sheet and high exposure to energy markets are two factors that could inflict even more damage to the stock over the next 6 12 months  We would prefer to stick with some other blue chip dividend stocks that are also going on sale in today s market ConclusionWith major energy companies calling for even deeper spending cuts by the day  it s hard to get too excited about PNR at the moment  There is very little the company can do to combat the slump in commodity prices and the slow growth rate of economies around the world 
While we believe these headwinds will ultimately prove to be transitory  they could persist longer than investors expect  The company s levered balance sheet adds further risk to an investment in PNR today  We will remain on the sidelines for now ",2016-02-11,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pnr:-a-cheap-aristocrat-with-40-straight-years-of-dividend-growth-384298,384298
