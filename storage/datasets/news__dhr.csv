His comments came as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U S  is open to facing  repercussions  if it doesn t live up to its commitments in a potential trade deal with China  a sign that the two sides are edging closer to an accord to end their nine month trade and tariff war 
 There s a politically expedient resolution relative to trade numbers  a big order here  a big order there   Culp said at the Harvard College China Forum   Substantively  our sense is that both governments should like to advance the conversation  maybe not once and for all  but in a meaningful way with respect to access and intellectual property  
He s also concerned that pulling back from China  where GE started doing business as early as 1906  would open up a void that its competitors in Japan and Europe would be  very quick  to fill  China is GE s biggest market by revenue after the U S   he said 
 If you look at our supply chains  the way our design footprints  operate today they are very much integrated global networks   Culp said   To pull a piece of the puzzle like China out would impair those supply chains and those design networks  
The U S  and China are discussing whether to hold more in person meetings  The IMF cited trade tensions as a risk in the past week as it cut its outlook for global growth to the lowest since the financial crisis a decade ago

147258,368774,DHR,Are There Hints Danaher Will Have a Better Than Expected 2020 ,news,"Life sciences and diagnostics company Danaher  NYSE DHR  had a great 2019  and if the early indications for 2020 are anything to go by  investors can expect the same this year  The company has strong earnings momentum  and its stock should be considered as an option for investors looking for a defensive growth option  Let s take a closer look at what s going on 

Why Danaher is doing well
Here are three reasons  

CEO Tom Joyce s recent presentation at the J P  Morgan Healthcare Conference saw him upgrade expectations for full year 2019 growth and earnings 
The deal to buy General Electric s  NYSE GE  biopharma business looks like a great value  
The ongoing evolution of the company s business model and the GE biopharma addition will enhance its growth potential and the quality of its earnings 

Recent commentary
Joyce s recent presentation was a continuation of a profitable trend in 2019    revenue and earnings have come in ahead of management s expectations  Management started its fiscal 2019 predicting full year core revenue growth of 4   only to raise expectations to 5 5  to 6 6  at the time of the third quarter earnings in October  However  the guidance for only 4 5  core revenue growth in the fourth quarter was somewhat disappointing  
No matter    the update at the conference in January saw Joyce forecasting that Danaher s core revenue growth in the fourth would come in at around 5 5  and earnings per share at  or above  the high end of its guidance range of  4 74  4 77  In Joyce s words  Danaher had a  very good finish  to the year  driven by its life sciences and diagnostics  with particular strength at Pall  life sciences  and Cepheid  diagnostics   Note that these two businesses are relative newcomers to the company    Pall was acquired in August 2015 and Cepheid in November 2016    and their operational outperformance is testimony to Danaher s ability to improve the earnings potential of its acquisitions 
Indeed  Joyce also outlined that Cepheid s revenue had grown from around  600 million at the time of the acquisition to around  1 billion today  with operating margin up to 20  from low single digits previously  a hugely impressive result  
The GE biopharma deal will add growth
Investors will be hoping that Danaher s management can continue its golden track record of success in integrating acquisitions  Beckman Coulter  life sciences   diagnostics   Cepheid  and Pall have all been big winners for the company  
Provided the GE biopharma deal gets approved    Joyce expects it will be completed by the end of March    there s good reason to believe it will substantially enhance Danaher s prospects  For example  Danaher is currently generating around  3 3 billion in free cash flow  and GE s biopharma business generated  1 1 billion in 2018 alone  
The deal makes good sense  and at a price of around 18 times free cash flow  it looks like a very good value for Danaher shareholders 
Danaher s business evolution
The two businesses are also a good complementary fit  with Danaher s strength in filtration being augmented by GE biopharma s chromatography  single use equipment  and resins  Given that 70  of Danaher s sales now go directly to the market    meaning the company has much more opportunity to interact with the end user     the company has the opportunity to offer a single source of solutions to bioprocess customers 
Not only is Danaher increasingly selling to customers on a direct basis  but it s also increasing the amount of its revenue from high margin recurring sources  During the recent conference  Joyce outlined how Danaher was only generating 45  of its revenue from recurring sources five years ago  Now  that ratio is closer to 70   This is good news  because it means the healthcare company s earnings are likely to be much more stable in an economic slowdown 
The GE biopharma segment is only going to help in that regard because its share of recurring revenue from consumables is actually higher than Danaher s  at around 75   Throw in Danaher s proven ability to improve the profitability of the businesses it acquires  and the future looks bright for the company 
Danaher is on a good track
All told  Danaher is ending 2019 on a strong note and the likelihood is 2020 will be another good year  The life sciences and diagnostics market has demonstrated it can continue to grow at a mid single digit clip during a slowdown in the industrial economy  and there s no reason why it can t do the same in 2020 ",2020-01-27,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pne1d,2068363
147259,368775,DHR,With GE Deal Complete  Danaher Becomes The Leader in Bioprocessing,news,"Since September 2016 to the start of 2020  Danaher s  NYSE DHR  stock price has doubled  going from below  80 a share to now sitting at  160 a share  In 2019 alone  the stock increased over 45  in value  
This past year  the company announced a deal to buy General Electric s  NYSE GE  biopharma unit for roughly  21 billion  This deal has largely been seen as a very good move by Danaher that will position the company for expanding growth  Will Danaher continue to see massive growth on par with the last three plus years 
What has fueled Danaher s success 
Danaher is a conglomerate based in Washington D C  The company operates three core divisions  environmental and applied solutions  life sciences  and diagnostics  

The company s strategy has been to acquire businesses in growth sectors and then apply its operating model  the Danaher Business System  to those businesses  The success of this model is proven by the enormous growth the company has seen 
Two recent acquisitions of Danaher underscore the success of this model  In August 2015  Danaher acquired the Pall Corporation  a company operating in the life sciences and industrial sectors  Since the acquisition  Pall has seen revenue growth  an increase in gross margins of 5  to 55   and increased operating margins over 10  to 25   Cepheid  a molecular diagnostics company  was acquired by Danaher near the end of 2016  Since the acquisition  the company has grown by double digits each year to almost  1 billion in revenue and seen its gross margins increased 10   while the company s operating profit margins went from zero to 20  
GE s biopharma business makes Danaher a major bioprocessing player
Against this backdrop of success of increasing the performance of new acquisitions  Danaher announced last year that it would acquire GE s biopharma unit  GE s biopharma segment is a manufacturer of products and equipment that allow pharmaceutical companies to test and produce cellular therapies and drugs 
Much has been written about how good of a valuation Danaher got for GE s biopharma business and how it is the growth leader of GE s healthcare segment  One aspect of the deal  however  has not gotten quite as much coverage the fact that the deal will make Danaher the key player in the bioprocessing field  This field is forecast to see a compound annual growth rate of 17 5  over the next four years 
Bioprocessing involves cultivating and developing cells into a biomass which is then purified and distilled into a final product  The end result is a therapeutic product with quality controls that are equivalent to pharmaceutical drugs 
The bioprocessing industry is made up of products in five general areas  filtration  fluid management  fermentation  purification  and cell culture media  Without GE s biopharma company  Danaher was a key player in filtration and had a presence in fluid management  fermentation  and purification  The acquisition of the biopharma business fills in the gaps Danaher has in the bioprocessing field and instantly makes Danaher the major player in bioprocessing 
Danaher will now have the Xcellerex line of mixers which elevates its presence in fluid management  The acquisition will give Danaher the Wave product line of bioreactors and makes it a leader in fermentation  Akta chromatography systems and Hyclone cell culture media products instantly make Danaher the leaders in purification and cell culture media processing 
Becoming a complete end end supplier of bioprocessing tools and equipment to users will allow Danaher to better compete with Sartorius  the current leader in the field  In 2018  Sartorius saw revenue growth over 13  in its bioprocess solutions division and offers guidance of 8  to 12  growth in the current year  Gaining market share will now be easier given that Danaher is now able to supply customers with all the products necessary to cultivate and develop cells as well as to distill and purify the end product 
Good news for Danaher investors
This is all very good news for Danaher investors  Given Danaher s track record  there is little doubt the company will capitalize on the GE biopharma deal which will position itself as the leader in the growing bioprocessing market  I see Danaher as growing 10  or more in the coming year and is still a good health stock to buy for investors who want a solid company with proven results ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pohu3,2070774

OfficerThanks  Matt  Good morning  everyone  Our fourth quarter results wrapped up a tremendous 2019 for Danaher  For the full year  we delivered 6  core revenue growth as we continued to capture market share in many of our businesses through new product innovation and enhanced commercial execution  We also delivered 100 basis points of core operating margin expansion and  3 billion of free cash flow  But the numbers only tell part of Danaher s transformative story in 2019  We continue to evolve into a higher growth company as we announced the GE Biopharma acquisition and completed the IPO and subsequent split off of our Dental segment into an independent publicly traded company called Envista GE Biopharma which will be called Cytiva after we close  had a very good 2019 as core revenue growth of approximately 10  accelerated relative to the businesses performance over the past couple of years  We continue to be very impressed with this talented team  an extraordinary group of passionate and highly engaged associates who provide customers with innovative solutions used in the development and production of biopharmaceutical drugs During the fourth quarter  we achieved several important milestones related to the acquisition  which we continue to expect to close in the first quarter of this year  First  as part of the regulatory approval process  we announced that we signed an agreement to sell certain of our businesses to Sartorius  The annual revenue to be divested is approximately  170 million and consists of businesses that are currently part of our Life Science platform  Secondly  we received conditional clearance for the acquisition from the European Commission in December  While the timing around meeting certain closing conditions can be uncertain  we continue to work constructively with the regulators and remain encouraged by the progress we re making  And lastly  we raised approximately  4 billion of US denominated debt in October  which essentially completes the financing needed to fund the acquisition Overall  financing costs have come in materially better than expected as we were able to take advantage of favorable credit market conditions  particularly in Europe  When we announced the transaction last year  we anticipated financing  18 billion of debt and cash at a blended interest rate of approximately 2 75   resulting in a total annual interest cost of  500 million  The actual blended interest rate on this  18 billion will be less than 1  for a total annual interest cost of  150 million  As a result  we now believe GE Biopharma will be approximately  0 60 accretive to non GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per share in 2020  This assumes an end of first quarter close  and includes the impact of the lower financing costs and the business is better than 2019 core revenue growth  partially offset by the lost earnings related to the pending divestitures  while not included in our formal 2020 guidance  we wanted to provide you with an update given these recent developments Now turning to our fourth quarter results  Sales grew 5 5  to  4 9 billion as the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by approximately 1   while acquisitions increased revenues by 50 basis points  Core revenue increased 6   Geographically  high growth markets increased at a high single digit rate led by China and India  In the developed markets  the US remains strong delivering high single digit growth while Western Europe was up mid single digits Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 55 5  and operating profit margin was 19 8   Core operating margin increased 175 basis points in the quarter  bringing full year core operating margin expansion to 100 basis points  a testament to the team s terrific execution across the portfolio  The Danaher Business System continues to be the primary driver of our strong core operating margin performance  and 2019 marked the fifth consecutive year that we expanded core operating margins by 70 basis points or more  Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share of  1 28 were up double digits year on year  bringing full year adjusted diluted net earnings per share to  4 42  All in all  a strong finish to a very important year Now let s take a more detailed look at our fourth quarter results across the portfolio  In Life Sciences  reported revenue increased 7  and core revenue increased 6 5  for the quarter  Operating profit margin of 21 2  was up 150 basis points with 190 basis points of core margin expansion  For the full year  Life Sciences achieved 7  core revenue growth and delivered operating margin expansion of 145 basis points  Core growth at Beckman Life Sciences was up mid single digits with strength across most major geographies and product lines  This finished off another great year for Beckman as the business grew high single digits and surpassed  1 billion in annual revenue for the first time  New product introductions have been a key driver in Beckman s success and contributed more than 250 basis points to core growth each of the last two years SCIEX core revenue was up low single digits versus a high single digit prior year comparison  Performance improved sequentially with particular strength in the pharmaceutical  food and environmental end markets  Geographically core growth in the quarter was led by North America and Asia  which was particularly offset    which was partially offset by softness in China At Pall  the team achieved its second straight year of high single digit core revenue growth with nearly 10  core growth in the fourth quarter  Strong momentum in our biotech and aerospace businesses was partially offset by expected weakness in microelectronics IDT achieved double digit core revenue growth  led by synthetic biology and next generation sequencing product lines  where newly launched products are gaining market share  Since joining Danaher in 2018  the IDT team has embraced the Danaher Business System and made excellent progress  both operationally and commercially  Using DBS growth tools  they ve enabled cross functional teams to collaborate more effectively during the product development process to improve quality and reduce time to market  With this more focused approach to innovation  IDT has increased their cadence of new product launches and expanded their best in class offering to further customers research across a number of genomic applications Moving now to Diagnostics  Reported revenue increased 7  in the quarter with core revenue growth of 8   Reported operating profit margin was 19 5  with reported and core operating margins up 70 basis points  Over the last few years  we ve made significant strategic investments  both organically and inorganically to better position our Diagnostics platform and oriented toward higher growth opportunities  We re seeing the impact of these initiatives as the Diagnostics team delivered 7  core revenue growth in 2019  a continuation of the market share gains we ve achieved over the last few years Turning to Beckman Diagnostics  While core revenue was up only low single digits in the quarter  on a difficult prior year comparison  2019 was a great year for Beckman  as the team achieved mid single digit core revenue growth  Their best annual core growth rate since we acquired the business in 2011  China continued to perform well and positive results across all major product lines were led by double digit growth in automation  We ve approved Beckman s growth trajectory over the last few years by focusing on impactful new product development and improved commercial execution  Our launch of the DxH series of new hematology analyzers has been a key contributor to improvement in core revenue growth  And on the commercial side  our North American sales teams effective implementation of DBS growth rooms has helped drive double digit gains in our customer retention rate Radiometer achieved double digit core revenue growth in the quarter to close out their 15th consecutive year of mid single digit or better core growth  a remarkable achievement  Results were strong across both the developed and high growth markets as we believe Radiometer continue to gain share relative to the market At Leica Biosystems  double digit core revenue growth was driven by positive results across all major geographies and product lines  In addition to continued strength in core histology and advanced staining  pathology imaging also had a strong quarter driven by demand for new products like the Aperio GT 450  The GT 450 is a new automated high capacity digital pathology slide scanner that enables extensive biopsy databases to be digitized  making them more accessible for researchers around the world Core revenue at Cepheid was up more than 20  for the quarter  with broad based strength across all major geographies led by North America and Western Europe  The business surpassed  1 billion in annual revenue in December  and we couldn t be happier for the team to hit this major growth milestone  Since the 2016 acquisition  core revenue has compounded annually at a rate of approximately 20   The team has done a terrific job incorporating DBS commercial tools and processes to enhance their go to market strategy as well  With an installed base of more than 20 000 instruments and the largest molecular test menu available on the market today  Cepheid is poised to continue taking share in this highly attractive fast growing space Moving now to our Environmental   Applied Solutions segment  Reported revenue increased 2   with 2 5  core revenue growth  Reported operating margin increased to 25 3  with 265 basis points of core margin expansion  In Product Identification core revenue grew at a low single digit rate  At Videojet core revenue was up low single digits while performance accelerated sequentially  Strength in North America and Western Europe was partially offset by softness in the high growth markets  By end market consumer products and food and beverage led the way Our packaging businesses which includes Esko and X Rite was up mid single digits  We had a particularly good quarter at Esko  where growth rate was led by demand for our brand owner software including BLUE  a business we acquired 18 months ago  BLUE provides label and artwork management software that enhances Esko s offering in the packaging development and production workflow  As a result  the Esko team is helping customers reduce the time it takes to bring new products to market  while improving cost and quality across their packaging value chain Finally  turning to Water Quality  Core revenue for the quarter increased at a low single digit rate  Core revenue at Hach increased low single digits  However  the fourth quarter represented the last period of tough prior year comparisons driven by China s surface water monitoring regulation  Policy 61  Excluding the Policy 61 impact  Hach s core revenue increased mid single digits for the quarter and full year  Hach has been a consistent mid single digit growth business throughout its 20 year tenure as a Danaher operating company and this success has been largely driven by the team s commitment to solving challenging customer problems through innovative applications and workflow solutions One example  is the recently launched CL17 FC  Hach s new online chlorine analyzer  which is easy to use and is equipped with Claros  Hach s water intelligence software  This combination of innovative hardware and software solutions helps customers more effectively manage their connected instruments  their processes and data  ultimately lowering their operating costs  increasing compliance and reducing risk At Trojan  core revenue declined in the quarter due to the timing of certain large projects  but the team delivered impressive double digit core growth for the full year  Trojan s growth acceleration in 2019 was driven by a combination of recent new product launches and commercial initiatives focused on expanding field service capabilities  And lastly core revenue at ChemTreat was up mid single digits with particular strength in the chemical and food and beverage end markets So to wrap up  2019 was an outstanding year for Danaher and marked our 35th anniversary as a company  Over the course of that time through a combination of organic and inorganic initiatives  we have transformed into a higher growth  higher margin and higher recurring revenue company  With a resilient portfolio it s built for the future and the Danaher Business System is our consistent driving force  we feel well positioned to continue to deliver long term shareholder value We re initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of  1 06 to  1 09  This assumes core revenue growth of 6  to 6 5   and reflects the impact of three additional selling days versus the first quarter last year  We re also initiating full year 2020 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance in the range of  4 80 to  4 90  which implies double digit growth year over year at the midpoint and as mentioned earlier  does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of GE Biopharma Matthew E  Gugino    Vice President  Investor RelationsThanks  Tom  That concludes our formal comments  Crystal we re now ready to take questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan Thomas P  Joyce    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Tycho Tycho Peterson    JP Morgan    AnalystGood morning  I ll start with Pall  For Life Sciences  you had previously baked in a slowdown for the fourth quarter  Obviously that didn t happen  So  just curious if you could talk a little bit about why you thought things might slow  why they did not  And I guess what s embedded in the guide for Pall Life Sciences going forward and as we think about kind of capacity supply demand dynamics and adding GE Biopharma to the portfolio  how are you feeling about the sustainability of the platform of business Thomas P  Joyce    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Tycho  We re really  really very pleased with how Pall performed in the quarter  Double digit core growth in the quarter that I mentioned was led by biotech and aerospace  and if you sort of break that down and go in specifically into the Life Science side of Pall  double digit core growth in Life Sciences  we ve talked in the past about single use technologies  That s certainly was a portion of that growth  Single use continues to grow at better than 20   And so I think the combination of just looking at Life Sciences overall  breaking it down into biotech and then  looking specifically at that high growth area of SUT  all combined give us a tremendous amount of confidence both in terms of Pall s positioning in that market  but also the end market strength  And so  I think we feel very good about that Now  we tried to be prudent here early in the year in terms of how we embed different segments of the business into our overall guide  And so  I think  we sort of look into 2020 and think about the overall biopharma market and our position there is perhaps a little bit more normalized at high single digits in 2020  But overall  that s not to suggest that we think this is about a market slowdown or there s any overcapacity issues  it s really about just saying that  hey this 2019 was a great year  We re probably a little prudent going into 2020  but this is absolutely a fantastic market to be a part of We don t really see any issues relative to what we ve been asked about in terms of overcapacity in the market  We continue to track the volumes of individual drugs that are being produced and that really is the indicator and we continue to see just tremendous progress  both in terms of the drug development pipeline and the volume ramps of individual biopharmaceuticals where essentially we are integrated into the process Relative to GE Biopharma  that obviously improves our position in the overall market  It gives us broader exposure specifically to the biopharmaceutical market  large molecules and those more advanced technologies  given GE s exceptional position in chromatography and so we re looking forward to closing that transaction here in the first quarter and we think it will be just a tremendous addition to the overall portfolio  albeit as a separate stand alone operating company  distinct from Pall Matt McGrew    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHey Tycho  This is Matt  Just to kind of clarify  from a planning assumption perspective for Biopharma for this year  we re kind of thinking low double digits versus the mid teens that we saw sort of last year  So just kind of clarify where we think that will be here Tycho Peterson    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  And then one follow up on China  up high single digits  Can you maybe just talk about what s embedded in guidance for China and then obviously with Coronavirus  just curious how you re thinking about that as it relates  particular for your Diagnostics business over there Thomas P  Joyce    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  It was overall a very good  very good quarter in China Tycho  up high single digits in the fourth quarter and that was across all four of the platforms  And we saw high single digits in Dx  and that was  that was broad based in terms of the strength that we saw  Within Life Science  you know as well as we do there is some policy and regulatory noise around the food and to some extent the pharma market around 4 by 7 that had some impact on SCIEX but generally  we expect continued good performance from both of those platforms and both of those markets  Even PID was up high single digits and that was largely Esko and Videojet  and in Water Quality  I think I commented on X Policy 61  terrific  So  I think as we look forward in China  we see continued good growth opportunities there Specific to the Coronavirus situation  obviously  it s a very challenging situation to get a clear handle on in terms of what its overall impact is  We have not seen any specific impact to this point on our business  but that was before everyone left for the New Year and as you know  certain provinces are extending the Chinese New Year at this point  And that s obviously a little bit of a wildcard here in the first quarter  So  losing potentially an extra week could have an impact on both sales and the supply chain  but given that it s early in the quarter  we ll be working to offset that certainly here in the first quarter and see some impact moving into the second that we continue to work to offset  So we haven t incorporated any of that into any guidance  but it s just too early to tell  We re hoping for the best We have businesses by the way Tycho that are actively involved in taking on this challenge  both Cepheid and IDT are engaged in    with outside parties on a global basis  both public and private  including the CDC  to support their efforts  particularly at CDC supporting the CDC efforts around releasing just in the last couple of days a panel of two PCR probes and primers that are designed specifically to detect the virus  So we are in the fight here  but the impact of this both in terms of the overall Chinese market  our business and any of our specific businesses it s just far too early to tell Tycho Peterson    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  Thank you Thomas P  Joyce    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Thomas P  Joyce    President and Chief Executive OfficerHi Derik Derik De Bruin    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHi  Hey  good morning  Hey  could you sort of talk about the embedded margin assumptions for the standard    the business ex GE right now as sort of what s embedded in the guide  Just sort of want to walk through now that Dental is out  what you re sort of thinking about the margin expansion and gross margin expansion would be in 2020 Matt McGrew    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  So kind of embedded  Derik  it s Matt  Kind of embedded in our guide here is sort of a 5  core growth  which we talked about  And kind of the typical 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion on that is sort of how we get to the range  4 80 to  4 90 Derik De Bruin    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGreat  And the    I    the    when GE comes into that  I mean it s obviously the margins are higher than that  Would you expect incremental boost to that immediately  I m just sort of thinking about through how it rolls through Matt McGrew    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell  I mean it s going to roll through and we talked about the initial accretion and kind of what we updated here today  So that would have obviously included the fact that is a higher margin business than what we have  So I think the way to think about that rolling through is  it is in that  0 60 and then as we go forward we sort of talked about that business being    even though those high margin business  I don t think is going to have much of an impact on our 50 to 75 basis points of core margin expansion every year  Higher margin businesses tend to kind of not necessarily have the best margin expansion at the highest size than given the given the VCM in the fall through they already have  So I still think going forward using 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion even post GE is the right way to think about it and you ll capture the uplift in the margin in that  0 60  if you will in 2020 Derik De Bruin    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGreat  And just a quick follow up to Tycho s question on the China situation  Have you embedded anything into your organic core growth guide for any sort of slowdown in the market at all Matt McGrew    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAt this point we have not  We kind of    as Tom said  it s    we know as much as you guys know and we ve sort of kind of    if everything is back to normal very quickly here  it s still early enough that we think we probably be able to offset that largely  So too early to tell and we have not put anything into either Q1 or the full year at this point Derik De Bruin    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGreat  Thanks  I ll get back in the queue OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI Vijay Kumar    Evercore ISI    AnalystHey guys  Congrats on a nice print here  Thanks for taking my question  Tom maybe one big picture question on the Biopharma  I think the comment for you on the assumptions around 2020 growth low double digit that was helpful  And GE  that business has been running double digits in  19  So just curious  your thoughts around the growth of the GE Biopharma assets and why 6  to 7  is still the right way to think about the outlook for that business Thomas P  Joyce    President and Chief Executive OfficerHey  thanks  Vijay  I appreciate the question  You re right  We had initial planning assumption of 6  to 7  for that business  As I mentioned in my remarks  they performed better than that here in 2019  We just need to get the business closed and we need to get in underneath the covers and really understand at a deeper level kind of the order rate trajectory  the backlog and those kind of things to make sure that we re comfortable as we go through 2020 at rates higher than our original projection  So we re excited about getting inside and getting with the team and trying to understand those opportunities  Obviously  if we were closed in the business a year ago and had this visibility that we would normally get to 2019  we would have had a higher view  but we ll need a little time to get inside and see what 2020 ultimately might look like Vijay Kumar    Evercore ISI    AnalystThat s helpful Tom  And Matt one quick on the guidance  Margin execution during Q4 are really strong  Was this because core revenues came in better  Was this volume related leverage  Or I m just curious on what drove margin execution  And when you think about the context of three extra days in Q1  any assumptions on what the contribution is to the top line in Q1 from extra days  Thank you Matt McGrew    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Maybe start with the second question first  So I think the three extra days in Q1 is probably worth  it s sort of hard to tell  it s inexact science  but I think it s probably 50 to 100 basis points in Q1 would be probably what s worth  And then kind of talking to the Q4 fall through  I mean  gross margins were up 50 bps year over year  which was helpful  price was OK here in the quarter and the rest was good  it was kind of running the Danaher playbook  SG A was down  gross margins were up  And the volume coming through at 6  was a little bit better than we thought  and that led to a pretty good finish here to the year with 100 basis points margin expansion  So I think that s probably the way to think about it Vijay Kumar    Evercore ISI    AnalystThanks guys Thomas P  Joyce    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Vijay OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen Thomas P  Joyce    President and Chief Executive OfficerHi Doug Doug Schenkel    Cowen and Company    AnalystHey guys  good morning Thomas P  Joyce    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Doug Schenkel    Cowen and Company    AnalystHow does the favorable financing outcome    we knew about  but you described very well in your prepared remarks  How does that impact your flexibility on capital deployment  specifically  I m really thinking about M A  maybe more near term than we might have thought a quarter or two ago  And related to that based on your forecasts for free cash flow this year  it appears you can delever to about 3 5 times EBITDA by the end of 2020  Am I doing the math the right way there Matt McGrew    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI mean it s going to close to that I suppose  I mean  yes  I think that s probably a pretty good spot  As far    I m sorry that s on the second question on free cash flow  As far as any impact  I think on your first question  does that change in a material way the interest  does it change in a material way anything in the near term  I don t think it s going to have a big difference on what we    how we think about M A here in the near term  I think we ve talked about  we re still going to be active and in the market for sure  We will probably be focusing more on some of the bolt on activity in smaller deals  but also like we ve said if something was of interest and strategically out there for us  we also have talked in the past that if we had to issue equity  we would  So I think    I don t think the financing necessarily changes anything in the near term here Doug Schenkel    Cowen and Company    AnalystOkay  Thank you for that  In your prepared remarks as well as in the press release you called out market share gains as a driver of revenue growth  I m wondering if you d be willing to elaborate a little bit more on that and maybe be a bit more specific on where this most    this is most evident based on what you re seeing recently  And how we should think about the sustainability of the share gains moving forward Thomas P  Joyce    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  absolutely  I d be happy to Doug  I ll pick a couple of examples  looking across the portfolio  I mentioned in my prepared remarks about some terrific performance at Beckman Life Science  So to give you an example of what s driving the share gains there  If you think    if you look about our    the cadence of new products  we ve introduced over 20 new products in the last three years at Beck LS  In the three years pre acquisition that business launched three new products  So we re  7x the cadence of new product introductions and specifically  those are going into higher growth applications like biologics and genomics obviously  Our CytoFLEX product line and flow cytometry and the reagents associated with that  the new automation products in the Biomek Series that I ve talked about  the buy sell products in particle counting all those things are really contributing from a product    new product innovation standpoint to share gains at Beck LS  and that s why we re seeing that meaningful step up in growth at Beck LS which by the way was virtually a flat growth business when we acquired it If I look over at    in the Diagnostics  a couple of businesses that again are clearly gaining share  you got to have a look at Cepheid as one really good example and menu expansion continues to be a part of that  certainly the menu expansion in flu and strep  but really good commercial execution expansion into IDNs or integrated delivery networks has made a big difference  I think if you look at that installed base that we ve now grown from 13 000 systems at acquisition to 23 000 in the installed base  over 40 major health systems that have been converted  11 new assays and three point of care system  I mean  these are the things that I think underpin our confidence and our belief in the share gains at a place like Cepheid If I look at a business that has been with us certainly a lot longer  but where the performance continues to be terrific  I talked about the 15th consecutive year of good performance at Radiometer and their share gains  We ve seen a 50  increase in blood gas competitive takeaways in 2019 alone  So we track every competitive situation and we can be clear about where we have in fact displaced a competitive instrument  So I mean good examples there One last one  maybe I ll turn it over to Water Quality where Hach has really improved their new product cadence  A lot of terrific products beyond the CL17 that I talked about in my prepared remarks  but part of what s driven their cadence is  they have cut their new product development time by 50  in the last two years  and at the same time they have driven ideation and improved the nature of what s in the funnel I think substantially  And so  again we track our installed base as we track competitive win rates and I think those trackers clearly give us confidence in the areas where we re gaining share Doug Schenkel    Cowen and Company    AnalystThat s great  Thanks for taking the questions guys OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research Thomas P  Joyce    President and Chief Executive OfficerHi  Steve Matt McGrew    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHey  Steve Steve Beuchaw    Wolfe Research    AnalystHi  Good morning and thanks for the time  Just a couple of easy ones here from me  One is  as we go into 2020 and you ve laid out the 5  core objective for the broader company pre GE  Can you just speak to the expectations for growth within the different businesses around that 5  Matt McGrew    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Steve  I think maybe the simple kind of at a high level  the way to think about it is that we re expecting Life Sciences and Diagnostics both to be kind of in the 5  to 6  range  sort of versus the high single digits that they were last year  And that EAS is kind of continues in    call it the 3  to 4  range Steve Beuchaw    Wolfe Research    AnalystOkay  great  Much appreciated  And then over the course of the year  I wonder if you could speak to a couple of points just within the non op  So we ve got our models with many moving parts subsequent to the changes in the last several months and those still coming as tight as we can  I wonder if you could speak to how you would imagine corporate expense plays out over the course of the year relative to that 1Q starting point  and maybe relative to 2019  And then  I wonder if over the course of the year  how you would imagine share count playing out  Of course there have been a lot of moving parts  but is where we are for 1Q just a good benchmark for the full year  Thanks a bunch Matt McGrew    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Yes  sure  a lot of moving parts  we appreciate that  So corporate expense Steve  I would probably think about  60 million to  65 million per quarter is a good place to start from a modeling perspective  And from a share count perspective in Q1  it s going to be call it 718 million shares  719 million shares  I would model in sort of kind of our typical share creep of maybe 1 million shares to 2 million shares a year and maybe for a full year that 718 million shares  call it 720 million shares  721 million shares at the end  I think I d ramp it that way Steve Beuchaw    Wolfe Research    AnalystGot it  Just what we needed  Thank you so much Matt McGrew    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes Thomas P  Joyce    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Steve OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with UBS Dan Brennan    UBS    AnalystGreat  thanks Thomas P  Joyce    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Dan Dan Brennan    UBS    AnalystGood morning  Good morning  thanks for the questions  I was hoping to dig into a little bit on the Diagnostic front  Beckman obviously a nice year in 2019  What do you see for 2020 there  Can you comment on some of the competitive launches and in particular  you mentioned a lot of the new product introductions there in hematology for Beckman  kind of what s on the horizon for Beckman Diagnostics Thomas P  Joyce    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  Dan  Thanks  You know  as I mentioned in my remarks  we re really pleased with how Beckman performed  Beck Dx performed in 2019 at a mid single digit core growth and as I think  you know well  that s a 100 basis points higher than where we were two years ago  And a number of things have combined here  The new product launches that we talked about in the last year or so  automation being one  the DXA 5000  we ve always had a competitive advantage we believe in the higher volume environments and the DXA 5000 and our automation capabilities take us I think to an even more important level You mentioned hematology  Hematology the DxH 900  with the early sepsis indicator as well as the 500 series  both big upgrades to that product line and those are making a difference without a doubt  and they will continue to because it s still early days in terms of the penetration of those new products into the market  So we re expecting as we go forward  we ll continue to see solid mid single digit growth from that business  And I think that will come from some of the things I just mentioned  but also I think some important product launches that are in the funnel  closing the menu gaps around infectious disease and blood virus and ensuring that we are architecting the hardware side of the house in a way that positions us well at lower volumes Relative to competitive launches  obviously this is a business where every competitor cycles through a new product launches over a five  seven  10 year period  There have been    there certainly is  I wanted two out there right now  At this point we haven t really seen any material impact to us on our retention or our win rates  but it s always a competitive market and we ll be keeping pace in terms of the competitiveness of our product line and I think some of the things I ve talked about already are what underpinned that Dan Brennan    UBS    AnalystGreat  Thanks for that Tom  And then maybe switching gears over to Pall bioprocess  obviously terrific growth there and you ve commented early    on some of the outlook earlier to Tycho s question  I m just wondering  with regards to gene therapy  obviously you have nice exposure there as well  but are there any opportunities to maybe expand the portfolio whether internally or externally to kind of capture the expected growth rate in gene therapy  Thank you Thomas P  Joyce    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  Well it s certainly early days as you know in gene and cell therapy  And there is a lot going on  and Pall is working very closely with a number of customers in that area  But given the nascent nature of those    the development of those therapies right now  it will be a while  it will be measured in years before the impact of that may very well become sort of material to Pall in the aggregate  So a very exciting space for us  one that we think we re really well positioned to support  but one that will take a while to evolve Dan Brennan    UBS    AnalystExcellent  thanks a lot OperatorYour next question    your last question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi Thomas P  Joyce    President and Chief Executive OfficerHey  Patrick Patrick Donnelly    Citi    AnalystHey  Doug  Great  thanks  Maybe just one on Cepheid  that s been as you kind of noted a 20  grower since the deal  Margins obviously moved significantly higher as well  How should we think about that asset going forward  I mean it seems like there is still significant opportunities  you talked about the menu expansion  areas like China  obviously still under penetrated  I think you guys have still talked about kind of that low double digit growth  Now that we ve been three years here at 20  plus  What s the right way to think about that one Thomas P  Joyce    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Patrick  When we first acquired Cepheid  we were very confident in it sustaining a double digit core growth rate  and obviously since that acquisition it s 20  or better  That s been higher than we ve expected  and it s    there is a number of factors there  a lot of which I think    a couple of which you might say are somewhat a function of the nature of that business being impacted by flu  We ve just come through I think at least two years in a row here with a particularly strong flu season  We don t bank on that obviously  That s something that we could have a strong season  which is unfortunate for patients  but obviously good for that business  And you can have businesses where or season where that s not the case  And so we tend to be somewhat prudent in terms of how we anticipate those seasonal factors to play out That said  the growth of the business has been certainly sustained by more than just flu  The work they have done in expanding the menu and driving that installed base  the numbers that I quoted earlier have been a big part of that  So I think you put all that together and you say  plan prudently relative to an uplift from something like a flu season but have confidence that we can sustain that at least the low double digit growth rate for sure if not better  and based on the fact that they continue to innovate effectively and have really stepped up their commercial execution Patrick Donnelly    Citi    AnalystThat s helpful  And maybe just a quick follow up on Europe  pretty solid  mid single digit growth there  Obviously continued to get some mixed data points around that region  You guys always have a pretty good handle given your diverse exposure  Can you just talk through the trends you ve seen their  expectations into 2020  visibility would be really helpful Thomas P  Joyce    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I mean  Patrick we re not a great sort of macro proxy  but relative to our end market  Europe in some respects has been a pleasant surprise in terms of  it being relatively solid in the last couple of quarters  So I m not sure that gives me a lot of optimism in terms of anything that might improve substantially in Europe right now  but I think it s certainly been a solid market for us  If you look across how each of our four platforms are performing there  each of them are doing quite well  But it s obviously a little bit weaker than the other parts of the world Matt McGrew    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Patrick  maybe just put some numbers to that  That has been a pretty solid 3  to 4  grower for us for probably six  eight quarters now  And looking forward  I think that s about where we still think it will be  As Tom said  it s probably not as good as some of our other markets like China and the US  which are more mid to high single  But I think that 3  to 4  is a pretty good place to source then and I think it s sort of where we ll be Patrick Donnelly    Citi    AnalystAll right  Great  Thanks  Matt  I appreciate it OperatorAnd presenters  that does

147293,368809,DHR,Here s Why Danaher Stock Surged Nearly 49  in 2019,news,"What happened
Shares of Danaher  NYSE DHR  rose a whopping 48 8  in 2019  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence  It marks another year of strong progress from the company  and the reasons come down to a combination of its operational success  its quality of earnings  and a game changing deal to buy General Electric s  NYSE GE  biopharma business  The three points can be summarized as follows 
First  Danaher s underlying performance has exceeded expectations  For example  the company started the year expecting core revenue growth of 4  for 2019  but CEO Tom Joyce now thinks it will be something in the region of 5 5  to 6 5  

Second  Danaher s outperformance needs to be put in the context of a year when many other companies with an industrial focus have disappointed due to slowing industrial production growth and the fallout from the trade conflict 
Third  the agreement to buy GE s biopharma business is increasingly looking like a great deal for Danaher shareholders   Not only is the deal at a discount to the valuations that Danaher and its peers trade at  but the biopharma business also appears to be outperforming the expectations of Danaher s management at the time the deal was announced in the spring  
So what
The developments in 2019    which include the successful spinoff of the company s underperforming dental business Envista  NYSE NVST     help to underscore the excellent work Joyce has done in recent years in continuing the company s excellent track record of acquisitions and restructuring the portfolio of the business   In the last few years  Joyce has spun off a collection of industrial businesses  now listed as Fortive  NYSE FTV   and the previously mentioned Envista 
As you can see below  all three businesses trade at valuation premiums compared with what they did before the spinoffs took place    a testimony to the potential for managements to create value for shareholders through corporate actions  For reference  enterprise value  market cap plus net debt  to EBITDA is a commonly used valuation metric  

DHR EV to EBITDA data by YCharts 
Now what
Trading at more than 25 times earnings estimates for 2020  Danaher s valuation certainly isn t cheap on a superficial basis  But the company s increasing exposure in life sciences and diagnostics means it s the sort of stock that investors will go to in uncertain times  Meanwhile  the GE biopharma acquisition will boost earnings in the future 
All told  it s hard to see the stock repeating its performance of 2019  but it remains an attractive option for long term investors looking for a defensive growth stock ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pflv7,2055471

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Danaher 
For Danaher  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 14  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Danaher will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Danaher would post earnings of  1 15 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 16  delivering a surprise of  0 87  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Danaher doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-danaher-dhr-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200501139,200501139

147339,368855,DHR,The Truth About Market Timing   February 07  2020,opinion,"Being that unique investor who has the power to consistently time the market and always make a profit is the dream for most people who trade their own accounts 
Even among those who don t aspire to be the perfect market timer  many think they can call a top and act accordingly  It s at these times when investors choose to sit on the sidelines and wait for a  perceived  better opportunity to invest in the market 
Missed investing opportunities by exiting at the first sign of trouble is a common pattern among many self directed investors  Case in point  How many investors have missed huge opportunities waiting for the Conglomerates stocks listed below to correct  only to see them reach new highs  climb higher and drive the bull market to record levels  China Resources Enterprise Ltd   CRHKY   Carlisle Companies Incorporated  CSL   General Electric Company  NYSE GE   Griffon Corporation  GFF   Danaher Corporation  NYSE DHR 
Fear and greed often lead investors into behavioral traps since most investors are followers who react  rather than anticipate market moves 
Accomplished market timing requires three key components  1  A dependable sign of when to get in and out of stocks  2  The capacity to act upon signals quickly and accurately  3  Have the stomach to act on market signals  no matter how counterintuitive the move may be 
The popular image of market timing is that it calls for making drastic  all or nothing moves at the precise  exact market top or bottom  There is a less well known  rather simple market timing approach that has been used successfully by savvy investors like Warren Buffet for decades 
Rule 1  Why trying to time the tops and bottoms of the market is a dead end 
Abandoning the goal to time the tops and bottoms precisely gives you the flexibility to profit  thereby increasing your chances to lock in built up profits even if your calls aren t exactly right 
Rule 2  Don t sell during minor crashes   instead  have the patience to weather the storm  or even better  milk the opportunity to buy low 
Warren Buffett has made an incredible piece of his fortune because of this basic standard  He warns not to sell during small crashes  and weather the storm by focusing on the long term 
There is a noteworthy distinction between a complete market meltdown and a common 10  market correction  If the companies you own are established and successful  they are likely to return to their pre   crash price before long  making holding on the wisest decision  Warren Buffett takes this thought a notch higher and frequently goes on a buying binge when markets turn  purchasing additional shares of his favorite stocks at a major markdown and tuning in to his own recommendation of being greedy when others are scared  and being scared when others are greedy 
When It Comes to Trading Your Retirement  A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed
It s only human that many succumb to greed and try and game the system by timing the market  But consider this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would have to be accurate 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Chasing alpha  outsized  short   term returns through market timing and other high   risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources  however for your long   term retirement assets a  risk adjusted  investment discipline is what largely bodes well

The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise

This industrial and medical device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 15 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 6  
Revenues are expected to be  5 04 billion  up 3 9  from the year ago quarter

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Danaher 
For Danaher  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 10  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Danaher will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Danaher would post earnings of  1 15 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 19  delivering a surprise of  3 48  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Danaher appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/danaher-dhr-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200474655,200474655
147368,368884,DHR,Danaher  DHR  Q3 Earnings Surpass Estimates,opinion,"Danaher  DHR  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 16 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 15 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 10 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0 87   A quarter ago  it was expected that this industrial and medical device maker would post earnings of  1 15 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 19  delivering a surprise of 3 48  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Danaher  which belongs to the Zacks Diversified Operations industry  posted revenues of  5 04 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 06   This compares to year ago revenues of  4 85 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Danaher shares have added about 34 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 9  
What s Next for Danaher 
While Danaher has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Danaher was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 37 on  5 62 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 78 on  20 70 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Diversified Operations is currently in the bottom 37  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-10-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/danaher-dhr-q3-earnings-surpass-estimates-200477342,200477342
147378,368894,DHR,UPDATE 1 J J in talks to buy Synthes for  20 bln source,news,"  Would be J J s largest acquisition
   Devices and diagnostics were 40 pct of 2010 sales
   Adds background about J J  M A in industry  comments from
analyst 
 By Jessica Hall
 BOSTON  April 16  Reuters    Johnson   Johnson is in
preliminary talks to acquire Swiss medical device maker Synthes
for a price which could be about  20 billion  a source familiar
with the situation said on Saturday 
 A deal at that price would mark an 11 percent premium over
Synthes  current market capitalization of about  18 billion  It
would allow healthcare conglomerate J J to further diversify
its healthcare business 
 However  talks could still break down  said the source  who
declined to be named because the talks are not public 
 The medical device sector has been consolidating as
pharmaceutical companies look to diversify away from drugs
going off patent  Other recent medical device deals include the
 5 8 billion acquisition of Beckman Coulter by Danaher Corp
  announced in February 
 Synthes shares closed up 6 2 percent in Switzerland  with
traders citing market talk that the diversified healthcare
company or U S  medical device maker Medtronic Inc could be
interested in buying the company 
 J J  which holds about  19 billion in cash  could not
immediately be reached for comment on Saturday   As a matter of
policy we don t comment on speculation   J J spokesman Bill
Price said when asked on Friday  Synthes was not immediately
available to comment 
 News of the talks was first reported by the Wall Street
Journal 
 J J owns some 250 separate companies under its corporate
umbrella and a Synthes purchase would be its largest ever
acquisition  The company attempted to acquire U S  medical
device maker Guidant several years ago  but was outbid by   
Boston Scientific Corp 
 J J s biggest previous deal to date was its 2006
acquisition of Pfizer Inc s consumer health business for  16
billion 
  J J has developed a strong war chest of cash  They have
the ability to do a deal like this from a size and strategy
standpoint   Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said on
Friday 
  This is an area where J J would like to build strength  
Conover said of Synthes  which makes spinal products and screws
and plates to repair broken bones 
 Medical devices and diagnostics accounted for 40 percent of
J J s  61 6 billion in 2010 sales but the business has been hit
by competition and recalls 
 An acquisition of Synthes makes sense but not necessarily
by J J and not at this price   a banker not involved in with
the deal said on Friday   There s other companies it would fit
better with  J J has been looking at acquisitions for a while 
It s odd that they settled on this target  I m not sure the
deal gets done  
 J J s Cypher  the first drug coated stent to reach the U S 
market  has been eclipsed by Abbott Laboratories Xience  which
is by far the market leader in the devices used to prop open
arteries cleared of blockages 
 The company s hip and knee replacement division has been
hampered by product recalls 
 J J has also been plagued by a series of recalls in its
consumer health division with hundreds of millions of bottles
and packages of Tylenol  Rolaids  Motrin and other widely used
products being pulled from store shelves 
 Its consumer products manufacturing practices were deemed
to be such a shambles that some of its plants have been placed
under government supervision 
 Prior to the Synthes report  there had been recent
speculation that J J was interested in buying British
orthopedics company Smith   Nephew 
  There have been rumors before that J J might have been
interested in other orthopedic companies   Conover said 
  Synthes is more involved in trauma so the overlap might
not be as much as with other companies  like those more focused
on hips and knees   Conover said  adding that such a deal would
raise fewer antitrust issues 
 The potential deal is the latest in a string of
international mergers in the healthcare sector  which recently
saw France s Sanofi Aventis  acquire U S  biotech company
Genzyme and Canada s Valeant Pharmaceuticals International make
a hostile bid for Cephalon Inc 
 Synthes  Chairman Hansjorg Wyss is the second richest
person in Switzerland with a net worth of  6 4 billion

147380,368896,DHR,U S  stocks struggle as ISM service sector activity hits 6 year low,news,"Investing com   Wall Street struggled near the unchanged level Tuesday after weak service sector data took a toll on investor sentiment and strong gains achieved in oil during the Labor Day holiday vanished into thin air 
At 11 33AM ET  15 33GMT   the Dow 30 lost 11 points  or 0 06   the S P 500 slipped 1 point  or 0 05   while the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite edged forward 7 points  or 0 14  
Though U S  service sector activity grew for a 79th consecutive month  it still dropped to its weakest level since January 2010 with seven out of 18 industry sectors registering a contraction 
Specifically  the Institute of Supply Management  ISM  said its non manufacturing purchasing manager s index fell to 51 4 last month from 55 5 in July  Analysts had expected the index to drop to 55 0 
That followed the ISM manufacturing survey published last week  which showed a shocking contraction in activity 
Tuesday s bad news was the first in a string of data coming out after last Friday s jobs report in the run up to the Federal Reserve s  Fed  policy decision at the end of the two day meeting on September 21 that could affect the path of future tightening 
The read on the ISM non manufacturing index caused markets to cut bets for a possible rate hike at the next meeting to just 15   down from 27  ahead of the data and 30  a day earlier 
In fact  according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool  Fed fund futures narrowly kept the chance for a December hike on the table with odds at just 50 7  
Eyes were also focusing on oil on Tuesday as crude tumbled in midday trade  erasing all of the prior day s strong gains as an agreement between Saudi Arabia and Russia to stabilize the market stopped short of delivering imminent action to tackle a supply glut 
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London  Brent oil for November delivery sank  0 79  or 1 66   to trade at  46 84 a barrel by 11 33AM ET  15 33GMT  
Brent spiked by more than 5  on Monday to touch an intraday peak of  49 40 after Saudi Arabia and Russia pledged to work together to support the market 
But prices pared gains later in the session to end well off the highs as details of the agreement underwhelmed traders who had been hoping for a production freeze
Meanwhile  crude oil for October delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange was at  44 37 a barrel  down 7 cents  or 0 1   from its last settlement on Friday 
Nymex prices surged more than  2 00  or 5   on Monday to hit a daily peak of  46 53  U S  crude did not settle on Monday due to the Labor Day holiday

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Danaher lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Danaher currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 10   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-danaher-dhr-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200470380,200470380
147393,368909,DHR,Danaher  DHR  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Q3 Release,opinion,"Danaher  DHR  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This industrial and medical device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 15 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 6  
Revenues are expected to be  5 04 billion  up 3 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 12  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Danaher 
For Danaher  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 10  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Danaher will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Danaher would post earnings of  1 15 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 19  delivering a surprise of  3 48  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

a source familiar with the situation said on Saturday 
 A deal at that price would mark an 11 percent premium over

would allow healthcare conglomerate J J to further diversify

 However  talks could still break down  said the source  who
declined to be named because the talks are not public 
 The medical device sector has been consolidating as
pharmaceutical companies look to diversify away from drugs
going off patent  Other recent medical device deals include the
 5 8 billion acquisition of Beckman Coulter by Danaher Corp
  announced in February 
 Synthes shares closed up 6 2 percent in Switzerland  with

147416,368932,DHR,Danaher  DHR  Upgraded To Buy  Here s What You Should Know,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Danaher  DHR   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Danaher is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Danaher imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Danaher
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this industrial and medical device maker is expected to earn  4 79 per share  which is a change of 6  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Danaher  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 4  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Danaher to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-09-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/danaher-dhr-upgraded-to-buy-heres-what-you-should-know-200463735,200463735

What s Next for Danaher 
While Danaher has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

147459,368975,DHR,Is Danaher  DHR  A Solid Growth Stock  3 Reasons To Think   Yes  ,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Danaher  DHR  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this industrial and medical device maker a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Danaher is 3 5   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 5 5  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 4 7  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Danaher is 10 5   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 8 4  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 6 6  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 4 3  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Danaher  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Danaher has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

147460,368976,DHR,CR Vs  DHR  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Diversified Operations sector might want to consider either Crane  CR  or Danaher  DHR   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Both Crane and Danaher have a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
CR currently has a forward P E ratio of 13 33  while DHR has a forward P E of 29 68  We also note that CR has a PEG ratio of 2 13  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  DHR currently has a PEG ratio of 2 56 
Another notable valuation metric for CR is its P B ratio of 3 21  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  DHR has a P B of 3 38 
These metrics  and several others  help CR earn a Value grade of B  while DHR has been given a Value grade of C

147461,368977,DHR,Top Analyst Reports For UnitedHealth  Citigroup   Honeywell ,opinion,"Monday  July 22  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including UnitedHealth  UNH   Citigroup  C  and Honeywell  HON   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
UnitedHealth s shares have gained  2  in the past year  outperforming the Zacks Medical Insurance industry  which has increased  1 7  over the same period  UnitedHealth Group s earnings surpassed expectations by 4   and were up 15  year over year  The Zacks analyst thinks the company stands apart in the industry by virtue of healthcare services  technology and innovations offered by its unit Optum  
Numerous acquisitions made by the company have broadened its business profile and provide benefits of diversification  Its solid balance sheet and consistent cash flow generation has enabled investment in business which will drive long term growth  Also  capital management through dividend payments and share buybacks is another positive  
However  slowdown of growth in international operations and underperformance of the Medicaid business are some concerns  An increase in leverage and substantial interest burden raises financial risk 
 You can   
Shares of Citigroup have outperformed the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry in the past six months   14 3  vs   3 3    The Zacks analyst thinks the company has an impressive earnings surprise history  beating expectations in all the trailing four quarters  
The company s second quarter 2019 results reflected expense control and higher revenues driven by consumer banking  However  lower fixed income  investment banking and equity market revenues amid challenging trading environment are acting as drags on the stock  Citigroup s restructuring and streamlining efforts  along with strategic investments in core business  bode well for the long term  
Also  the company s declining costs base supports its bottom line improvement  Steady capital deployment activities of the company are also commendable  However  pending litigation issues might keep legal expenses elevated 
 You can   
Honeywell s shares have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry in the past three months  gaining  0 4  vs  a  3 4  decline  In second quarter 2019  Honeywell s earnings grew 8 8  year over year and exceeded expectations by about 1   
The Zacks analyst thinks strength in its commercial aerospace  warehouse and process automation s businesses as well as solid demand for its commercial fire and security products will boost revenues in the quarters ahead  Stronger sales volumes  increased productivity and ongoing commercial effectiveness actions will improve near term profitability 
For 2019  Honeywell raised earnings guidance from  7 90  8 15 to  7 95  8 15 per share  However  the stock looks overvalued compared to the industry for the past three month period  Also  the company is experiencing softness in its productivity products business

147485,369001,DHR,Can Danaher  DHR  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Danaher  DHR   which belongs to the Zacks Diversified Operations industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This industrial and medical device maker has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 3 36  
For the last reported quarter  Danaher came out with earnings of  1 07 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 01 per share  representing a surprise of 5 94   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 27 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 28 per share  delivering a surprise of 0 79  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Danaher  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Danaher currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 22   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on July 18  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-danaher-dhr-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200437081,200437081
147486,369002,DHR,Danaher  DHR  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q2 Release,opinion,"Danaher  DHR  is expected to deliver flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 18  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This industrial and medical device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 15 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  5 09 billion  up 2 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 63  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Danaher 
For Danaher  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 22  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Danaher will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Danaher would post earnings of  1 01 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 07  delivering a surprise of  5 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Danaher appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/danaher-dhr-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q2-release-200438999,200438999

147533,369049,DHR,Danaher  DHR  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Danaher  DHR  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 18  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This industrial and medical device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 01 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2  
Revenues are expected to be  4 79 billion  up 2 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Danaher 
For Danaher  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Danaher will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Danaher would post earnings of  1 27 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 28  delivering a surprise of  0 79  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Danaher doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/danaher-dhr-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200405965,200405965

147686,369202,DHR,Conglomerates Down 10 8  YTD  4 Stocks That Beat The Odds,opinion,"First quarter 2018 earnings growth is expected to be in double digits on a year over year basis for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors  In all the sectors  the  space is among the handful whose earnings are expected to contract year over year in the to be reported quarter 
Ongoing tariff issues  which will likely impact major U S  industrials  have clearly weighed on investors  minds in recent times  On an average  the Conglomerates space has declined 10 8  year to date 
Let s discuss some economic factors and events which will have a bearing on these diversified companies in the near future 
The Tariff Proposal
The proposal of tariffs on steel and aluminum  announced by the U S  administration last month  has already left companies across multiple sectors apprehensive about higher input costs and contracted margins  The move has forced investors to consider increasing raw material prices and inflated manufacturing costs  which might make these industry players less competitive 
If enacted  the tariffs will create uncertainties across the supply chain  which is likely to have further adverse impact on margins 
ISM Manufacturing Reading for March
The ISM index for national factory activity in March came in at 59 3  comparatively lower than 60 8 recorded in February  which had marked the highest level in 14 years 
Although a reading of above 50 suggests that the sector is expanding  tariffs proposed by the U S  administration on steel and aluminum and against Chinese imported products in fields of aerospace  machinery  information and communication is likely to hurt business confidence domestically as well as internationally  Moreover  higher prices  coupled with trade disputes between the United States and China might hamper demand for U S  manufactured products globally and in turn can harm U S  economic growth 
Despite these formidable headwinds  there were a few companies in the Conglomerates space that defied broader negative trends and enjoyed investor optimism amid economic uncertainties  These companies also boast a strong earnings profile  which indicates operational strength  Investors interested in this sector might consider four such stocks  as discussed below

147689,369205,DHR,Buy This Water Stock ETF As  Zero Day  Approaches For Cape Town,opinion,"Water is seemingly everywhere  covering about 70  of our planet  Yet  fresh water is extremely scarce   accounting for a mere 3  of the world s supply  Of that amount  the vast majority is either locked up in glaciers or reside in inaccessible subterranean pockets 
And the fresh water that is accessible is not evenly distributed around the planet  For example  there is plenty of water in Siberia  But few people live there 
Of the amount of fresh water that is available  roughly 70  of that goes to agriculture to feed the world s population  The enormous amount of water needed to grow the crops and livestock needed to feed and clothe the world s growing population is creating a dire global situation 
The U S  media tends to ignore events in the rest of the world  but there is a scary situation developing in South Africa s second largest city  Cape Town  with its four million residents 
Countdown to Day Zero
Cape Town is best known as a tourist haven and the center of South Africa s wine industry  But now population growth and a record drought in the region have combined to push the city to the brink   to being very close to  Day Zero  when its water reservoirs run dry 
Historically  despite the arid climate  Cape Town s Table Mountain had trapped onshore breezes coming from warm ocean waters  creating rain locally that powered rivers and filled underground aquifers  But that has not happened the past two years thanks to unusually low rainfall   only 153 5mm  about 6 inches  of rainfall was recorded at Cape Town s airport in 2017  That compared to more than 500mm in 2014  Climatologists say that another year of drought cannot be ruled out 
Of course  people acting stupid are to blame also  The well to do suburbs with water hungry lawns and swimming pools are not conserving water despite pleas from local government officials  City officials asked residents to consume only 50 liters  about 13 gallons  a day of water  which is less than one sixth what a typical American family uses 
And it s not like city officials were sitting on their hands doing nothing  they were proactive  Over the last 20 years  the city made strides in reducing water use from its six major reservoirs  which hold up to 230 billion gallons of water  Per capita consumption declined  the city reduced leaks from water pipes  it forced large users to pay more  and generally promoted water efficiency  Cape Town even won several international water management awards  And currently  they are building their first water desalination plants 
But those efforts have not been enough  In 2014  its six dams were full  But then came three straight years of drought the worst in more than a century  Now  according to data from NASA satellites  the reservoirs stand at 26  of capacity  with the single largest reservoir  it provides half the city s water  in the worst shape  City officials plan to cut off the taps when the reservoirs hit 13 5   which is known as  Day Zero  
Residents of Cape Town are finding out the truth contained in this quote from Benjamin Franklin   When the well is dry  we know the worth of water  
Other Major Cities at Risk Too
Up until now  a shutdown of such a major metropolitan city would have been unthinkable  But as over development  population growth and climate change have changed the balance between water supply and demand  urban centers all over the world may face the threat of severe water shortages 
In other words  other of humankind s major cities are also at risk of severe water shortages 
Already  many of the 21 million residents of Mexico City only have running water part of the day  while one in five get just a few hours from their taps each week  Several major cities in India don t have enough as poorer regions cut off the water flowing downstream to the  rich  cities 
Water managers in Melbourne  Australia  reported last summer that they could run out of water in about a decade  And Jakarta is actually running so dry that the city is literally sinking as residents suck up groundwater from below the surface 
In 2015  Sao Paolo Brazil faced a crisis similar to Cape Town with only 20 days  worth of water left in its reservoirs  They were so low that pipes drew in mud instead of water  emergency water trucks were looted and homes only had access to water for a few hours twice a week  Only last minute rains salvaged the situation there 
In Barcelona  Spain in 2008 tankers full of fresh water from France had to be imported into the city 
The bottom line is that 14 of the world s 20 megacities are now experiencing water scarcity  And as many as 4 billion people  half of which are located in India and China  are living in areas where there is water stress for at least one month a year  according to a 2016 study in the journal Science Advances 
The Water Investment Opportunity
The current water crisis is driven both by climate and poor water infrastructure  In Jakarta Indonesia  for instance  water management is very poor with unsanitary water  lots of leaky pipes  heavy metals pollution and an inadequate number of pipes 
Even from an economic perspective  water is critical  As Pictet fund manager Arnaud Bisschop told Bloomberg   There is a 100  correlation between water availability and GDP growth  If there s no water  there s no growth  
That means there needs to be trillions of dollars spent on water and water infrastructure projects around the world in the coming decades  Even here in the U S   estimates are than a trillion dollars needs to be spent over the next two decades to upgrade our deteriorating water infrastructure 
Water is emerging as an investment class  So much so that the CEO of the French water services firm Suez  PA SEVI   Jean Louis Chaussade  says it will be more valuable than oil someday  Even if that doesn t happen  water should be a must own part of your portfolio 
So how can you invest in water  The broadest way is through an exchange traded fund  There are five such ETFs that are available to you  The one I like the most is the former Guggenheim S P Global Water Index ETF  which is now controlled by Invesco and is called the PowerShares S P Global Water Index Portfolio  NYSE CGW  
This is nicely balanced geographically with about 43  in the U S  and the rest overseas  However  Wall Street is apparently still unaware of the water problem because this fund gained only 11 5  over the past year 
Its top five positions are all well known names  American Water Works  NYSE AWK   Xylem  NYSE XYL   Danaher  NYSE DHR   Veolia Environnement  PA VIE   OTC VEOEY  and Pentair PLC  NYSE PNR   One of these stocks is my top water recommendation and is available to subscribers of my  newsletter  It is up more than 10  since the November 29 recommendation date despite the turbulent stock market we ve had in 2018  And I expect much more upside in the years ahead due to the water situation globally

147789,369305,DHR,4 Trade Ideas In Danaher,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Danaher  NYSE DHR   moved higher out of consolidation in January  It continued until it topped in March almost 13  higher  From there it fell back and then bounced off of resistance several times before a decline under the 200 day SMA in July  It bottomed in August and has been moving higher ever since  Last week it made a higher high and then pulled back to that prior resistance zone now acting as support 
Friday it printed a bullish engulfing candle  and should it continue higher there is a target to 96  The RSI has reset from an overbought condition  remaining bullish  The MACD is pulling back but looking like it may avoid a cross down  There is resistance at 87 and then 88 25 and nothing above that  Support lower sits at 86 25 and 85 25 followed by 84  Short interest is low under 1   The stock begins to trade ex dividend on September 28th and the company is expected to report earnings next on October 19th 
The October options chain shows the highest open interest at the 85 and 90 Call Strikes  bracketing the price  It also implies an expected move in the price between now and expiry of over  4 00 or a range of 82 50 to 91  The December options have large open interest at the 87 50 Call 
Danaher  Ticker   DHR
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 87 with a stop at 85 50  
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock on a move over 87 with an October 85 82 5 Put Spread  60 cents  for protection through earnings  Sell an October 90 Covered Call  25 cents  to cover most of the cost 
Trade Idea 3  Buy a November 82 5 90 bullish Risk Reversal  5 cents  
Trade Idea 4  Buy the October December 90 Call Calendar   1 05  and sell the November 80 Put  65 cents  
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which as the calendar turns to fall sees the equity markets continuing to look strong on longer timeframes but with some short term rotation out of the Nasdaq 100 and into the Russell 2000 as the end of the 3rd quarter approaches 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue its pullback while Crude Oil pauses in its uptrend  The US Dollar Index also is moving sideways but in its downtrend while US Treasuries see their uptrend at risk  The Shanghai Composite is marking time in its uptrend while Emerging Markets slowly grind higher 
Volatility looks to remain at very low levels keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   The IWM is leading the charge now  disregarding the old adage to sell Rosh Hashanah  with the SPY consolidating and the QQQ looking a little tired  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

147848,369364,DHR,The Fed Reacts To Higher Rates  It Does Not Lead Them Higher,opinion,"Some ideas remain market lore because so many in the rush to adjust investments in the context of long held beliefs do so simply because they do not believe one can do otherwise  That the Fed controls interest rates is one of these beliefs  The mystery behind Fed rises in the Fed Funds rate has been a market focus for many decades  The data comprising Fed Funds  T Bill and 10 Year Treasury rates tells a far different story  Fed Funds rate is adjusted to fit shifts in T Bill rates  The only exceptions to this pattern occurred when Chairman Volcker acted unilaterally to quash run away inflation in the early 1980s  If one examines the daily data available  there will be seen that there is no doubt that the Fed moves only after T Bills have shifted in response to market forces 
The Fed responds after the fact to T Bill rate shifts to keep the Fed Funds rate higher  Chairman Volcker  once he had put an end to the 1970 s inflation spurred consumer spending psychology  kept Fed Funds  1 00  higher than T Bill rates with a 1mo 3mo lag  Chairman Greenspan did the same with Fed Funds  0 40  higher as did Chairman Bernanke  It appears that Chairperson Yellen is tracking T Bill rates with Fed Funds  0 25  higher  Recent Fed Funds adjustments support this observation 

I think it is unfortunate that markets are constantly surprised by Fed Funds rate adjustments  Many believe that the Fed controls our economy when the Fed actually has little influence beyond setting bank capital levels and regulations  The Fed no more causes economic peaks with higher rates than they spur economic recovery with lower rates  Rates are set by market behavior within rules set by Congress and the Fed seeking to keep lending within prudent guidelines  Historical data provides considerable guidance months and even years ahead  I think it is unfortunate when most investors make decisions based on myths for which there is no historical evidence  The Fed does not control rates  Rates are set by millions of individual spending and investment decisions  Rates are controlled by you and I  Nonetheless  markets are human systems and strongly influenced by market psychology of what things are worth and perceptions of what they are likely to be worth months and years ahead 
If we have an environment favoring bank lending  then bank lending expands resulting in economic expansion  The widening spread between T Bills 10yr Treasury favors expansion of bank lending and economic activity  This spread has widened from the July 2016 1 09  level to 2 11  this morning  It expands as investors shift capital to areas though to offer better returns  For investors it is more productive to identify corporate cultures which have the skills to take advantage of economic expansion rather than spend the effort to identify sectors  industries and countries  I focus on identifying highly skilled management and invest when I think the pricing is favorable  Over time  one can build a naturally diversified and portfolio of well managed companies  Danaher  NYSE DHR  is a good example of a well managed company 
Danaher  DHR  is the  poster child  of  lean business practices  in the US  Their specific approach  driven by Steven and Mitch Rales  began with Art Byrne in 1985 and is the American version of the famous Toyota Business System TBS   Many Danaher trained managers have left the company since the early 1990 s to develop similar  lean  practices throughout US corporations   Lean  is now practiced at Ford  GE  United Technology  Medtronics  EOG and many smaller companies   Lean  is what keeps US corporations globally competitive  Bringing  lean  into an underperforming situation can have dramatic positive impact on the stock price  Fundamental to  lean  is a focus by every employee on meeting customer needs with every employee sharing in the profits of the company  When management learns and applies this approach  corporations have significantly improved financial performance over time which investors price into the company s shares  Gross Margins  Operating Margins and Net Income   as shown in DHR s Morningstar data reflect improving trends which one sees with  lean  management The shares reflect investor confidence 
DHR s share price represents management s success   The TTM  Trailing Twelve Month  Operating Margins at 17 5  represent the highest in the past 11yrs  DHR s lower earnings come from recent acquisitions  the expenses involved in the Fortive spinoff and currency translation issues due to the strong USD  I estimate that each of these are temporary situations and the long term rise in Net Income   is likely in the next 12mos  I own this issue personally as well as the spinoff Fortive Corp  NYSE FTV  and a relatively new company Colfax Corporation  NYSE CFX  formed by the Rales brothers in mid 1990s and IPO ed in 2008 

Danaher has a record useful as an example to explain the concept of a good corporate culture  Fortunately  there are many to choose from  It is these well managed companies which one uses to take advantage of periods when there is economic expansion  Every company is priced differently dependent on market psychology  There is only one rule of thumb  If the corporate performance continues at its historical pace  the shares are likely to be priced as they have historically  But  investors must always be aware that market psychology changes with the perception of corporate growth  If market psychology is more pessimistic than actual corporate performance justifies  then Value Investors see a buying situation and vice versa  Investors must at all times be able to judge how market psychology correlates to corporate performance 
As long as economic expansion continues  one can buy any well run corporation  The key element is the quality of the management team  Economic expansion is like an incoming tide  All ships rise  The better managements will get the better returns on capital  One s focus  once it has been established the economy is expanding  is to make sure one has identified a good price for the shares 
If you have done this for 100  decent companies  you get a good sense of the overall economic environment and marketplace ",2016-12-16,Todd Sullivan,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-fed-reacts-to-higher-rates,-it-does-not-lead-them-higher-200169926",200169926
147849,369365,DHR,Still Here And Ready To Rally,opinion,"Given all the doom and gloom that plagued the market last week  you d think a war was imminent and that it might start this weekend  Well  it didn t  We re all still here  and the market can now look towards earnings season to hopefully get stocks back on the right track  It worked on Monday as the market started the week on a high note  
The S P jumped 0 86  today to 2349  while the Dow increased 0 90  to 20 636 9 and the NASDAQ advanced 0 89  to 5856 8  Volume was still extremely low  so it will be interesting to see if stocks can build on today s performance or if it was just a flash in the pan amid an otherwise pessimistic market 
The geopolitical concerns that ruined the market last week are by no means over  but there was no further escalation during the long Easter weekend  Even better  North Korea s most recent missile test was a failure and the U S  saw no need to respond to it  So for now  we can focus on earnings season and hope that tensions cool further

147850,369366,DHR,Danaher  DHR  Up 4 5  Since Earnings Report  Can It Continue ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Danaher Corporation   NYSE DHR    Shares have added about 4 5  in that time frame  underperforming the market 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock s next earnings release  or is it due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers Danaher Q3 Earnings Top Estimates  Revenues Up Y YDanaher reported adjusted earnings of  0 87 a share in third quarter 2016  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 83 by 4 8   Notably  adjusted earnings increased 22 5  on a year over year basis The upside in the company s bottom line can be attributed to its effective Danaher Business System   DBS   that focuses on three critical areas    quality  delivery  and cost   innovation  Moreover  a decent top line performance led to high teens adjusted earnings growth during the quarter Revenues by SegmentDanaher reported total sales of  4 132 1 million  reflecting an increase of 17 7  year over year  However  the sales figure fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 149 million Improvement in third quarter revenues mainly came on the back of positive contributions from acquired businesses  which accounted for 14 5  of growth   Also  core businesses grew 3  year over year  The company s diversified portfolio was conducive to top line growth This is Danaher s first earnings release since it completed the spin off of Fortive Corp  on Jul 2  The spin off was announced in second quarter 2015  Post spin off  Danaher has reorganized its business into four segments  namely Life Sciences  Diagnostics  Dental  and Environmental   Applied Solutions Life Sciences revenues rose 64 6  year over year to  1 325 million  Operating margin for the quarter increased 900 basis points  bps  to 15 4   Robust sales of mass spectrometers particularly in China  India and Western Europe led to the sales growth  Also  strong demand for flow cytometry and particle counting products added to the strength of this segment  It also benefited from increased government investment in China  Impressive growth in operating margin came on the back of higher sales volumes and incremental year over year cost savings associated with restructuring actions and improved productivity Revenues at the Diagnostics segment increased 3 1  year over year to  1 213 million  Also  operating margin at the segment increased 250 bps  year over year to 16 0   Higher sales of consumables in China  Europe  India and North America fueled growth in the acute care diagnostic business  and drove this segment s growth  Also  increased demand for advanced staining instruments and consumables mainly in North America and China favored the top line  Operating margin growth was driven by higher sales volumes  improved productivity and cost savings associated with restructuring actions Revenues at Dental were up 3 7  year over year to  676 million  Also  operating margin increased 20 bps to 15 0  Sales growth for this segment was driven by strong demand for implant systems  particularly in high growth markets  Also  higher sales of orthodontic products  primarily in Western Europe  China and Russia as well as dental equipment in high growth markets beefed up the top line  Growth in operating margin was mainly led by cost savings associated with restructuring actions and other productivity improvement initiatives At the Environmental   Applied Solutions segment  revenues were up 4 3  year over year to  918 million  However  operating margin declined 20 bps to 25 3  on a year over year basis  Impressive performance by the water quality business  product identification businesses  marking   coding equipment  packaging and color solutions and lab chemicals drove sales Also  on a year over year basis  operating profit margin improved 320 basis points to 16 9  Notable Activity during the QuarterDuring the quarter  Danaher Corp  inked a definitive agreement to buy molecular diagnostics company Cepheid for  53 00 per share  Under the deal  Cepheid will become part of Danaher s diagnostics unit  The deal makes strategic sense as Danaher has a huge diagnostics business  but does not enjoy a strong foothold in molecular diagnostics  in which Cepheid is a market leader Cepheid s comprehensive installed base  test menu and pioneering product portfolio will fortify Danaher s presence in this high growth segment  Per Danaher  Cepheid s addition will boost operational efficiencies and expand margins in its  5 billion worth diagnostics unit  Cepheid is likely to generate  618  635 million in revenues this year  which will add to Danaher s  5 billion revenue base This apart  the company has also announced the acquisition of Phenomenex that will bolster its Life Sciences segment  Both of these acquisitions are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016 LiquidityDanaher exited the quarter on Sep 30  2016  with free cash flow of  701 million  a significant increase from  518 million recorded as of Oct 2  2015 GuidanceConcurrent with the earnings release  Danaher provided its guidance for fourth quarter 2016  The company projects adjusted earnings per share in the range of  1 01 to  1 05 Also  Danaher raised its full year 2016 adjusted earnings guidance to  3 57 to  3 61 from the previous range of  3 53 to  3 60

147889,369405,DHR,Will Earnings Streak Be Alive For Danaher  DHR  In Q3 ,opinion,"Danaher Corp    NYSE DHR   is set to report third quarter 2016 earnings results before the opening bell on Oct 20 
Last quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 14 7   Danaher has a decent earnings surprise history  beating estimates three times over the trailing four quarters  The stock has an average positive surprise of 5 1  
This is Danaher s first earnings release since it completed the spin off of Fortive Corp  on Jul 2  The spin off was announced in second quarter 2015  Post spin off  Danaher has reorganized its business into four segments  namely Life Sciences   Diagnostics  Dental  Environmental and Applied Solutions 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Danaher s tried and tested business model   the Danaher Business System   DBS     has proved to be the fundamental growth driver  fueling revenue  margins  cash flow and earnings improvement  This is especially designed to boost business performance in the critical areas  including service quality  delivery  innovation and cost reduction  We believe that DBS will act as a strong catalyst for both Danaher s organic and inorganic business lines  This will supplement the company s key financials during the third quarter 
We perceive that the company s healthcare and dental portfolio  which have been its major profit churners  will be able to pursue meaningful growth opportunities  post the Fortive spin off  Positive industry trends  such as rise in aging population  increased spending on healthcare and fitness as well as favorable regulations from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration  are expected to bolster the healthcare portfolio s growth 
In turn  this will supplement Danaher s top line performance for the quarter to be reported  Brands like Leica Microsystems  CytoFLEX and SCIEX are likely to act as key money spinners 
Danaher s strategic product launches and solid traction of existing products are also estimated to drive sales growth  Some of the notable product launches include the introduction of molecular diagnostic platform  VERIS  new menu additions  including vitamin D and AMH fertility test in the Beckman Coulter business  and TCM5 FLEX launch under the Radiometer business  We believe that product launches in the Diagnostics platforms will boost the company s third quarter figures 
Furthermore  Danaher s acquisitions have acted as another important growth driver  During the first six months of 2016  the company closed six bolt on acquisitions for  105 million  In the second quarter  the previously completed buyouts contributed 15  to Danaher s revenue growth  We believe that strategic acquisitions will aid the company reap significant synergies going ahead 
Despite these positives  Danaher has been grappling with multiple macroeconomic issues that may hurt its third quarter results  For instance  economic weakness across the globe  especially uncertainty in Latin American and some European regions like Russia and the Middle East  pose as major headwinds for the company  Moreover  softness in key industrial markets has been severely affecting the company s business  It can continue to thwart top line growth for the quarter to be reported 
Of late  Danaher has also been facing the heat of channel de stocking in the U S  and the Middle East  This trend is anticipated to continue in the future as well and jeopardize the company s dental business  These apart  foreign currency fluctuations also play a spoilsport for Danaher  In addition  stiff competition and increasing consolidation in the industry add to the company s woes 
Moreover  some of Danaher s leading brands  including Fluke  Qualitrol  Tektronix  Gilbarco Veeder Root  Kollmorgen and Matco Tools  became a part of Fortive during the spin off  Absence of revenues from these brands and other costs of the separation are likely to affect the company s third quarter results significantly 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Danaher will beat earnings estimate in this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for the company currently stands at 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 82 cents 
Zacks Rank  Danaher s Zacks Rank  3  when combined with a negative ESP  lowers the predictive power of ESP and makes surprise predictions difficult 
Note that we caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions DANAHER CORP Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some companies that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Macquarie Infrastructure Corp    NYSE MIC   has an Earnings ESP of  18  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is scheduled to report results on Oct 31 
Live Nation Entertainment  Inc    NYSE LYV   has an Earnings ESP of  6  and carries a Zacks Rank  1  The company is slated to release results on Nov 3 
Amazon com Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   has an Earnings ESP of  6 98  and a Zacks Rank  1  The company is slated to report earnings on Oct 27  You can see

147924,369440,DHR,Crane s Exposure To Headwinds Dims Its Growth Opportunities,opinion,We issued an updated research report on Crane Co    NYSE CR   on Sep 28  2016  The company is renowned globally for its engineered industrial products Crane Co   with  3 6 billion in market capitalization  is facing severe headwinds that are restricting its growth  The discussion below will justify the company s Zacks Rank  4  Sell  We believe Crane s international exposure has raised many concerns related to unfavorable movements in foreign currencies as well as adverse trade regulations and uncertain economic conditions in the foreign nations it serves  The company has operations in many nations  including North and South America  Europe  the Middle East  Asia and Australia On the domestic front  Crane Co  has to comply with many governmental regulations  especially in the Aerospace   Electronics and Fluid Handling segments  Any failure to meet the requirements can attract penalties  denting the company s profitability  In addition  the company faces a complex and competitive environment  Difficulties or delays in research   development or production and services  apart from failure of new products and technologies in the market  may hurt its competitive position For 2016  Crane Co  remains cautious of the adverse impacts from unfavorable foreign currency movements  which is likely to hurt top line by 2   and volatility in commodity markets  Core sales growth is predicted to be within  1 5   to  1 5  year over year  Over the last 30 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock has been lowered by 0 2  for both 2016 and 2017 to  4 15 and  4 41  respectively We believe these headwinds more than offset the positive impacts from Crane Co s diversified product portfolio  large client base and organic and inorganic growth initiatives Other Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the industry include Bunzl  LON BNZL  plc   OTC BZLFY    Barloworld Ltd   OTC BRRAY   and Danaher Corp    NYSE DHR   Bunzl plc  a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock  has witnessed positive revisions in earnings estimates for 2016 and 2017 over the past 60 days  You can see  Barloworld Ltd carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Estimates for the stocks have been revised upwards for fiscal 2016 and 2017  With similar ranking  Danaher Corp  holds a solid earnings surprise history  with an average of 5 12  for the last four quarters  Also  the stocks  estimates have gone up for 2017 Confidential from ZacksBeyond this Analyst Blog  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ,2016-09-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/crane's-exposure-to-headwinds-dims-its-growth-opportunities-200156053,200156053
147937,369453,DHR,What Falling Estimates   Price Mean For Danaher  DHR ,opinion,Similar to wise buying decisions  exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns  Selling off losers can be difficult  but if both the share price and estimates are falling  it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Danaher Corp    NYSE DHR    which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks  and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year  A Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  further confirms weakness in DHR A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions  For the full year  we have seen 5 estimates moving down in the past 30 days  compared with no upward revisions  This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower  going from  4 93 a share a month ago to its current level of  3 74 For the current quarter  Danaher has seen no downward estimate revisions  However  the consensus estimate has trended down to  1 22 a share from  1 23 over the past 30 days   The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately  as the share price has dropped 17 5  in the past month DANAHER CORP Price and Consensus   So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore  at least if you don t have a long time horizon to wait If you are still interested in the Diversified Operations industry  you may instead consider a better ranked stock   Carlisle Companies Incorporated   NYSE CSL    The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and may be a better selection at this time ,2016-07-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-falling-estimates---price-mean-for-danaher-(dhr)-200142136,200142136
147938,369454,DHR,S P 500  What Are Realistic Return Expectations ,opinion,"What returns do you expect from equity markets  What is realistic 
Many think a return north of 10  is what equity markets historically produce  If they are going to invest  they expect to see returns which better the markets  Some see reports that people have achieved returns over 25  and adjust their expectations accordingly 
Actuaries  who set pension plan expectations  have recommended that long term rates greater than 8 75  should be expected  Actuaries are supposed to provide conservative estimates  The data does not support this thinking and is there if one takes the time to review it 


The S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY    performance is 6 1  from 1940 Present  It should be no surprise that S P 500 performance is coupled directly to identical earnings growth of 6 1   The much higher performance expectations of many investors is overly rosy 
This occurs because so few have long term perspectives and even fewer have compared earnings with market performance  Markets are human systems  Whenever the old rules have failed to protect participants from those who took advantage of others  we make new rules to solve the problem  1933 saw such a rule change which substantially improved markets 
That new regulation in 1933 was FDIC  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp    It took the speculation which had been responsible for the elimination of the bank savings of the average and unsophisticated saver every time a bank failed and placed it where it belonged  on investors and speculators  It was about improving the fairness of financial services and how savers differed from speculators 
The impact on the middle class and markets was very positive  We are always making new rules to solve fairness issues as markets evolve  Since 1933  no rule change has had the impact of FDIC  Something else becomes apparent with long term perspective 


During the  Great Inflation  of 1970 1982 P Es fell from 20 to 7  Many equate this period as  stagflation   i e  a stagnant economy with inflation  Many believe today that business growth was slow during this period because markets only grew at an annual pace less than 2   Using inflation adjusted data  the Real Private GDP shows that economic growth remained during the  Great Inflation   What actually occurred was not slower economic growth 
As inflation became recognized as more of an issue  investors valued the earnings at lower P Es to compensate  While S P 500 earnings continued to grow at 6 1   rising inflation lowered SP500 valuations at a negative  4 2  resulting in SP500 growth less than 2  
Even today  most investors refer to the 1970s as a period of very slow growth because of the impact investor revaluation impact had on SP500 performance  The facts are clear that Real Private GDP remained on trend while it was market P Es which changed 
From 1982 to 1997 falling inflation reversed inflation s impact  P Es rose from 7 to 21  S P 500 not only rose on 6 1  earnings growth during this period  it also had an annual average boost of  6 4  as investors readjusted P Es for a total annual performance for the period of  12 5  
Many think of performance only in terms of market prices without taking into account earnings fundamentals and inflation s impact  Actuaries only use market prices when setting future expectations  Investors would be better served having more realistic expectations  Since 1997  inflation has remained relatively stable in a range of 1  3  
Summary
Most investors have unrealistic expectations when it comes to market returns  Thinking that one should be able to achieve unrealistic returns often mentioned as achievable in the media leads to taking much higher risks than most can afford 
What really drives equity prices over time 
Markets are composites of investors of which there are two basic categories  i e  Value Investors and Momentum Investors  Value Investors are long term investors who focus on the details of business operations compared to general economic growth  Momentum Investors believe that market price trends are all one needs to determine what to invest in and how long 
The overwhelming majority of what is heard day to day is that which comes from Momentum Investors  There are many  many more individuals who invest using short term price momentum than there are individuals who invest long term based on the details of business fundamentals 
If one monitors investor media commentary across a market cycle  it becomes quite apparent that Value Investors buy and are optimistic at market lows while Momentum Investors are pessimistic and believe stocks should be shorted  At market tops their outlooks are reversed 
With that in mind  I performed a study to determine how correlated was SP500 stock s Price Growth to their Book Value per Share Growth  BV Shr  from 2002 to 2008 


The study came to center on the 2002 2008 period and on BV Shr  Narrowing to this period and business metric was the result of looking at various metrics  i e  earnings  cash flow  and different periods in the range of 2001 2010  An strong correlation stood out only with BV Shr in the 2002 2008 period 
The regression analysis confirmed by a nationally acclaimed university business school revealed that the correlation between BV Shr and Price growth was  highly significant   The other metrics and periods were not even close  The BV Shr and Price growth correlation is incredibly strong 
Shareholder Equity Shr or BV Shr represents the sum total result of all business activity if accounting has been fair  If a company is growing  after all costs of goods  salaries and income taxes have been paid  at the end of the day BV Shr will be higher 
Buffett has related his experience in his Uncle s grocery store as a youth  At the end of the day  once the inventory had been replenished and bills paid  if one still had more cash in the till than when the day began  the business was growing  Value Investors view equities with this understanding  It is why Value Investors buy at market lows 
The facts are  it is the buying by Value Investors and corporate insiders which create major market lows while Momentum Investors are most pessimistic  The use of BV Shr as a business metric is not taught in business school  Today s analysts dismiss this metric as useless 
In today s markets we see many favoring so called  growth stocks   They have received the acronym  F A N G  stocks   These companies are furiously growing revenue which many use as justification for high market prices  When one looks at BV Shr growth  most do not have much growth at all and many have nothing but losses  They are spending everything they have to generate revenue with no growth in Shareholder Equity 
The Internet stocks did the same in the late 1990s  Most of these do not exist today  Today we have electric vehicle companies  solar panel companies  Internet entertainment  Internet payment systems  Internet banks and lenders and others discussed as growth daily on CNBC  Companies who have histories of BV Shr growth are rarely mentioned  Danaher  NYSE DHR  is one of the least known of good companies 


The chart of Danaher Corporation  NYSE DHR  vs  HP Inc  NYSE HPQ  tells the multi faceted story of market perception vs  business performance from Nov 1990 to April 2015  Danaher is a conglomerate of more than 1 000 companies  just split into Fortive and Danaher July 2  2016  which makes many useful products but does this very  very well 
Hewlett Packard is well known as a high tech firm which makes computers  printers  servers and offers software and business services  DHR has grew from Nov 1990 s  1shr to  16shr in 1999 and then proceeded to grow to  84 in Apr 2015  HPQ grew rapidly early on also from Nov 1990 s  2 92shr to  62shr by Jun 2000  just like many involved in the Internet build out in the 1990s  but gradually fell to  31shr April 2015 and today sits 50  lower at  14shr  Which is the growth company  Which do you hear about weekly as offering growth 
If one looks at the BV Shr growth of DHR vs  HPQ  it will be clear that BV Shr is strongly correlated to Price  Most investors are not aware Danaher even exists 
Summary
There are many misperceptions as to what drives stock prices  The actual driver is BV Shr over the long term  BV Shr as a business metric is not taught in our business schools nor is it thought to have value on Wall Street 
Summary Summary
The range of misperception which characterizes our understanding of Top down markets and economics and Bottom up equity performance can only be categorized and broad and deep  Every day one is exposed to point and counter point in the media each given with identical emphasis  The only solution is to stop listening for a while  collect the data of which there is much and work through it with discipline 
When investing one needs information without the noise  Investors require  noise filters   This is what Value Investors do  Buffett and Munger are famous for saying that they spend most days reading and thinking and thinking and thinking some more 
Markets are simpler if one learns to view them long term  Markets become even simpler once one is able to separate the DHR from the HPQ ",2016-07-25,Todd Sullivan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/realistic-return-expectations-200143773,200143773
147939,369455,DHR,The Week Ahead  Should We Expect September Mourning ,opinion,"The abbreviated week s calendar has little important data  The economic news last week leaves open the timing of the next interest rate increase  As vacationing market participants yawn their way back to their desks and trading floors  what will be the focus  A look at the calendar and the end of summer will have them asking  Should we expect September mourning  
I borrowed the title from Alan Steel s  on this subject  More from him in the conclusion 
Last Week
There was a lot of important economic news  The picture was mixed  but mostly promising  The Fed can move in September or delay until December 
Theme Recap
In my last WTWA  I predicted another weeklong focus on the Fed  I expected every economic data point to get special attention  parsed through the perceived eyes of the Fed  This was the story all week   even on the quiet Friday afternoon  I asked whether the Fed would get a signal to hike rates  At the end of the week  most were answering  no   I have had a good streak going on guessing the theme  but the week ahead is really a challenge 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this  of the S P 500 from Doug Short  The overall range  once again  is very narrow  Doug s take is that the market liked the slightly weaker than expected report  observing as follows 

The  bad news is good news  syndrome once again reaffirms the market s primary dependence on Fed pampering via low rates  The index hit its 0 65  intraday high about 30 minutes into the session  Profit taking sent the index to its 0 13  intraday low in the early afternoon  But the buying returned  and the 500 ended the session with a 0 42  gain 

Doug has a special knack for pulling together all of the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read his entire post where he adds analysis and several other charts providing long term perspective 

Please Watch  
 for some upcoming events that might be interesting to WTWA readers 
It is Labor Day weekend  Like you  I am enjoying some family time  Because the employment report is so important to markets  I will publish a little quiz to test your Jobs IQ  It will not be easy  You may keep your results secret or else boast about your knowledge 
I am joining an outstanding group of fellow advisors in a webinar this week  It will be on Wednesday  September 7th at noon EDT  We meet regularly for our own benefit  This time our leader  Rob Martorana  felt that other might learn from the interchange  The subject is how to interpret financial news  The material is great  and I am looking forward to participating  If you miss it    If investors find this to be useful  we will do more 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too  
The Good 
Initial jobless claims remained very low at 263K and beat expectations    

Hotel occupancy remains at near record levels     
Withholding tax collections remain strong     

As the total dollar amount of Federal withholding taxes continues to increase  we should expect to see retail sales and sentiment continue their improvements  This has resonance for GDP as well as the  


Factory orders rebounded nicely  Up 1 9   the    offers a sharp dissent to the headline figure 
Earnings revisions have improved  There is a regular pattern of decline in over optimistic estimates  Few are experts in studying the pace of these changes and how it is likely to impact the market  That is why we read the work of earnings expert Brian Gilmartin  whose  which explains about this difficult question 
Personal income rose 0 4  in addition to positive revisions  Consumer spending also increased 0 3  
Consumer confidence reached an eleven month high  See  for background  comparisons  and the best charts on the subject 
 Bullish sentiment remains low  a near term positive for stocks   this chart 


The Bad 
Auto sales fell to an annualized rate of 17 million  This was not far from expectations for most companies  but a decline nonetheless 
Rail traffic continues to decline  Steven Hansen    does his typical comprehensive analysis 
ISM index moved into contraction  registering 49 4 compared to 52 6 last month  Steven Hansen    has a comprehensive analysis including comparisons to the Markit PMI measure  It helps to consider the  internals  of the index calculation 

Employment gains disappointed  I am listing this as  bad  even though most see the overall story as pretty neutral      I am listing the specifics  but all are within their normal sampling error bands  The bond market reaction was also neutral   said a  decent  report  which captured mainstream sentiment 
The net increase in payroll jobs was 151K  While this still represents reasonable growth  it was significantly below the last two months and also below expectations of 180K
Private hours worked declined and hourly earnings increased less than expected 
Unemployment remained at 4 9  and labor force participation was stable 


ADP reported private sector employment gains of 177K   reasonable but also a bit below expectations 
The Ugly 
EpiPens   gets to the heart of it  Saving lives isn t Mylan s  NASDAQ MYL  business  maximizing profits is  The story has widespread implications  We all want to save lives  To do this there must be an incentive for drug development  When does this cross into exploitation  Should U S  prices subsidize foreign drugs  It is an important issue on many fronts 
The Silver Bullet 
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  This week s award goes to   who takes on the apparently compelling statistical link between the Fed and stock performance  Since 2008 more than half of the increase in the market comes on days of FOMC meetings  He notes that this argument was featured in the WSJ  but it shows up in various places 
What happens if you change the starting date of the analysis 

Ben points out that the relationship is mostly a result of 2008 
The Week Ahead 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar 
We have a light week for economic data  While personally I watch everything on the calendar  you do not need to  I highlight only the most important items in WTWA  Focus is essential 
The  A  List 
ISM services  T   Continuing strength in the service sector 
Fed Beige book  W   Anecdotal evidence adds color to the data for the next FOMC meeting 
JOLTS report  W   The Fed uses this to analyze labor market structure  It is less useful for employment growth 
Initial claims  Th   The best concurrent indicator for employment trends  but less attention during  employment week  
The  B  List 
Wholesale inventories  F   July data but relevant for revision of Q2 GDP 
Crude inventories  W   Often has a significant impact on oil markets  a focal point for traders of everything 
There will be some FedSpeak  There may also be news from the G20 conference  See  at Brookings for a preview 
Next Week s Theme 
Last week brought us more quiet trading with no clear message from the data  As people slowly return from vacation  it is a natural time to review events  We will see plenty of stories about how September is the worst month for stocks  Everyone will be asking  Will September bring a market correction  
Michael Brush  writing at MarketWatch  has a typical example    Expect more such predictions and advice to do something or other to avoid this kind of decline  This week s  was similar 
Most expect the record streak of low volatility to end  Here are the top worries 
The calendar  This chart from   who does not present this as a trade  makes the point 

The Fed  Some are worried that rates will rise  Others are worried that the Fed will keep rates too low 
Energy prices  Some worry about a sharp rebound  Others are concerned about another crash 
China 
Europe  The current focus is Italy  The last hot spots  Greece and Great Britain  are OK for now 
The US election  You can worry about either candidate or just the uncertainty 
Congress is back in session  see conclusion    Note the shaded area of the VIX chart  marking the recent seven week recess  perfectly coinciding with the record lows in volatility 

Feel free to add your own thoughts in the comments  including anything I have missed 
As always  I ll have a few ideas of my own in the conclusion

After running 5  to 10  higher over the next few days  you re left in the dust with no position and tear in your beer 

Insight for Investors 
Investors have a longer time horizon  The best moves frequently involve taking advantage of trading volatility 
Best of the Week 
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be  at The Motley Fool  He has been the best advice choice many times  His work is consistently helpful to investors  He promises that he will keep writing in his new gig  and I hope that is true  This week s article reviews some of his key lessons  They are all worth careful study  but I especially like this one 

Progress happens too slowly to notice  setbacks happen too quickly to ignore  The market quickly lost 38  in 2008  and it was huge deal  Books were written about it  and Congressional hearings were held  We ll be talking about it for decades  The market then slowly tripled from 2009 to 2015  and barely anyone flinched  You had to sit down and show people the numbers to get them to believe you  This is common  Recessions take place over months  recoveries take place over years  It can take decades for companies to become valuable  but bankruptcies happen overnight  Pain hurts more than the same level of gain feels good  but the duration differences between progress and setbacks helps explain why there are so many pessimists amid a backdrop of things getting better over time 

And also this one  

There has never been a better time to be an investor  Ever  in history  More people have access to first class services than ever before  It s so important  and we don t spend enough time realizing how good it is

Energy
With a new trading range for oil prices there is renewed interest in energy stocks  Dan Dicker     subscription required  recommends waiting until oil is closer to  40 bbl  He includes an interesting chart showing how some of the Bakken shale drilling sites developed  He writes as follows 

Oil wells cost money to drill and inevitably run dry  They need to be constantly replaced with fresh drilling to maintain output  Those drilling and maintenance costs sometimes overwhelm the returns of the oil being sold  as is the case this year and the previous two  and sometimes the returns greatly outpace the costs  as was the case before the bust in 2014  We know that most of the independent U S  oil companies operating in shale have bypassed this current cash burn problem in the short term by raising efficiencies   which lowers costs   and by slashing capex  which sacrifices the ability of potential future replacement 




Personal Finance 
Professional investors and traders have been making Abnormal Returns a daily stop for over ten years  The average investor should make time  even if not able to read AR every day as I do  for a weekly trip on Wednesday  Tadas always has first rate links for investors in his  There are several great choices worth reading  but my favorite is this   He explains that people are living longer and must take that into account in setting an investment horizon  He notes as follows 

 your time horizon may extend beyond your own life expectancy  Suppose you are age 80 and you have money you plan to bequeath to your 20 year old granddaughter  who will then use the inheritance to pay for her own retirement  The investment time horizon for this money might be 50 years  over which the stock market will likely clock dazzling gains 

 Jeff  I agree with this analysis  but I always start by securing enough of a portfolio to assure against life changing market results  One good place to start is with another source from Tadas  Tim Maurer  He warns against taking

Strategy 
Michael Batnick  MarketWatch  has a helpful article about what investors could learn from horse bettors  There is a list of ten great ideas  especially for value investors  I especially liked this one 

There is always the temptation to abandon your strategy when it s out of favor 


 If you begin espousing this approach  you are sure to suffer abuse from your fellow horseplayers  When one of them asks you who you like in a race and you say   I think the 4 is a bigger price than he should be   the likely response is   So what  Who do you like   Your cronies are apt to tell you that you should be betting on horses  not on prices  and after an inevitable stretch of watching some of their underlays win  you will begin to doubt yourself  

I wrote on a similar theme last week  You might enjoy  
 the importance of rebalancing  If you do not regularly review and execute this strategy  you are missing out on a natural way of selling high and buying low  You are also taking too much risk 
Final Thoughts 
Volatility will eventually increase  but there is no reason to expect it right away  Most of the reasons have been recycled all year  Let me comment on the new ones 
The calendar  One pundit stated that the reason for weak Septembers was that people were worried about October  Alan Steel covers this topic in a witty fashion  He deals with  the hordes of deviant scribblers who have made single variable correlations into a media business   His  has plenty of good advice  and you definitely won t stop reading after the first line about the prune juice and Viagra diet  Take some time to read his other helpful and entertaining posts 
Rate increases   has a nice analysis of the concurrent moves of other economic indicators during rate increase periods 

These 4 episodes have several things in common  First the inflation rate rose during each of these episodes and was on average above the Fed s 2  target  a key reason the Fed moved as it did  Second  the unemployment rate declined during each of these episodes and ended below the Congressional Budget Office estimate of the natural rate of unemployment  again consistent with an economy that was starting to overheat  Third  the nominal interest rate on a 10 year Treasury security rose during each of these episodes  consistent with an expanding economy and rising aggregate demand 



Congress back in session  While the information is accurate  this point is a joke  Mrs  OldProf said that I should footnote and include this line so that everyone would know to laugh  I told her that readers of WTWA know a silly bivariate chart when they see one
