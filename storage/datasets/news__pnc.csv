to turn the call over to Bill William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Bryan  and good morning  everybody  You saw today that we reported full year 2019 results with net income of  5 4 billion or  11 39 per diluted common share  For the full year  we increased earnings per share  achieved record revenue  improved our efficiency ratio and generated positive operating leverage Overall  it was an excellent year for PNC capped by another solid quarter  We reported fourth quarter net income of  1 4 billion or  2 97 diluted per share  During the quarter  we grew loans  deposits and revenue  and while our provision increased  overall credit quality remained strong  Rob is going to take you through the full details of our financial results in just a second  And we remain dedicated and diligent on our continued investment in our businesses and technology to drive long term growth Along these lines  I was very pleased with the continued progress we made this quarter on our key strategic initiatives including the national expansion of our middle market and retail banking efforts  We remain committed to growing our business  but also maintaining an efficient organization capable of achieving positive operating leverage  I d like to spend just a minute to thank our employees for all of their efforts to make 2019  a successful year  We achieved a great deal this past year for our customers  shareholders and the communities we serve and none of it would have been possible without the combined efforts of our more than 51 000 employees working toward our common goals As 2020 begins  we expect to face uncertainty in the year to come from the economic environment to the ramifications of international trade disputes  the geopolitical situation and the presidential election    election campaign in the US  But we re excited about the momentum with which we ve entered the year  and along with our increased capital flexibility as a result of the tailoring rules  we believe our strategy  focus on our    our strategy and focus on our customers positions us well to continue to deliver for all of our constituencies And with that  I ll turn it over to Rob  and then we ll be happy to take your questions Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerGreat  Thanks  Bill and good morning  everyone  As Bill just mentioned  we reported full year net income of  5 4 billion or  11 39 per diluted common share  And fourth quarter net income was  1 4 billion or  2 97 per diluted common share  Our balance sheet is on slide 4 and is presented on an average basis Total loans grew  1 2 billion to  239 billion linked quarter  Compared to the fourth quarter of 2018  growth was  13 billion or 6   Investment securities of  83 5 billion decreased  1 7 billion or 2  linked quarter  due to portfolio run off primarily in treasuries  Year over year  total security balances increased  1 4 billion or 2   Our cash balances at the Federal Reserve averaged  23 billion for the fourth quarter  up  7 7 billion linked quarter  and  6 6 billion year over year  primarily as a result of strong deposit growth  Deposits grew  8 7 billion or 3  linked quarter and  21 3 billion or 8  year over year As of December 31st  2019  our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated to be 9 5  compared to 9 6  at September 30th  For the full year 2019  we returned  5 4 billion of capital to shareholders  This represented a 22  increase over 2018 and was comprised of  1 9 billion in common dividends and  3 5 billion in share repurchases  Of note  the tailoring rules became effective January 1st  2020  and as a result will provide us increased flexibility in managing both our capital and liquidity levels going forward As we announced earlier this morning  we ve received approval from the Federal Reserve to repurchase up to  1 billion in common shares through the end of the second quarter of 2020  which is in addition to the share repurchase programs of up to  4 3 billion approved by the Fed as part of PNC s 2019 capital plan  This will provide us the ability to repurchase additional shares over the next two quarters  the level of which will depend on market conditions Our return on average assets for the fourth quarter was 1 3   our return on average common equity was 11 5  and our return on tangible common equity was 14 5   Our tangible book value was  83 30 per common share as of December 31st  an increase of 10  compared to a year ago  Slide 5 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail  Average loan balances of  239 billion in the fourth quarter were up  1 2 billion compared to the third quarter  The growth was driven by consumer lending  which increased  1 9 billion or 3  reflecting higher residential mortgage  auto and credit card loan balances Commercial lending decreased  738 million linked quarter as growth in our corporate banking business was more than offset by declines in our real estate business  primarily due to a  1 1 billion decrease in our multi family warehouse balances  Compared to the same period a year ago  average loans grew 6  to  13 billion  Commercial lending balances increased  8 6 billion  and consumer lending balances increased  4 4 billion  each growing by 6  As the slide show  the yield on our loan balances declined in the fourth quarter  primarily the result of lower LIBOR rates  Importantly  the rate paid on our deposits also declined 15 basis points linked quarter  an acceleration in the pace of the decline from the third quarter of 2019  Deposits of  288 billion increased in both the year over year and linked quarter comparisons  The year over year increase of  21 3 billion or 8  reflected strong customer growth  Linked quarter deposits increased  8 7 billion or 3  due in part to seasonal growth in commercial deposits Notably  non interest bearing deposits grew  1 5 billion or 2  in the fourth quarter  Both comparisons benefited by  3 4 billion increase related to the new sweep deposit product program  we began offering our asset management clients in September As you can see on slide 6  full year 2019 revenue was a record  17 8 billion  up  695 million or approximately 4   driven both    by both higher net interest income and non interest income  Expenses increased  278 million or 2 7  and remained well controlled  Importantly  we generated positive operating leverage of 1 4  in 2019 Our full year provision was  773 million  an increase of  365 million compared to 2018  which was driven by strong loan growth and continued credit normalization in our loan portfolio  Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 15 1  down from the third quarter as a result of lower state income taxes and tax credit benefits  For the full year  our 2019 effective tax rate was 16 4  and reflected the lower fourth quarter tax rate  Now let s discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail Turning to slide 7  you can see our total revenue has grown consistently over the past several years  driven by our diverse business mix  Full year 2019 net interest income was approximately  10 billion  a record for PNC and an increase of  244 million or 3  compared with 2018  as higher loan balances and yields were partially offset by higher funding costs Our net interest margin decreased in 2019 to 2 89   down 8 basis points compared to 2018  driven by the declining rate environment throughout the year  For the fourth quarter  net interest income of  2 5 billion was down  16 million or 1  from the third quarter  Lower loan and securities yields were substantially offset by lower funding costs  Net interest margin decreased 6 basis points to 2 78  in the fourth quarter  mostly due to the effect of lower interest rates primarily LIBOR  Although lower rates reduced our borrowing costs  that benefit was more than offset by the downward impact of LIBOR in our commercial loan yields Full year 2019 non interest income was up  451 million or 6   and increased  132 million or 7  in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter  Importantly  we continue to execute on our strategies to grow our fee businesses across our franchise  and those efforts helped to drive record fee income of  6 4 billion in 2019  During 2019  fee income increased  183 million or 3  reflecting strong customer growth in our legacy and new markets  Growth was across all categories except service charges on deposits  The  12 million or 2  decline in service charges on deposits was reflective of our ongoing efforts to simplify products and reduce transaction fees for our customers  Fourth quarter fee income of  1 7 billion increased  18 million or 1  compared to the third quarter Taking a more detailed look at the performance in each of our fee categories  asset management fees increased  40 million  driven by higher earnings from PNC s investment in BlackRock  Consumer service fees declined  12 million or 3  reflecting seasonally higher credit card activity that was more than offset by a full year true up of credit card rewards  Corporate service fees grew  30 million or 6  across various categories and included growth in our treasury management product revenue  Residential mortgage non interest income decreased  47 million    decreased by  47 million driven by a lower benefit from RMSR hedge gains as well as lower loan sales revenue  Service charges on deposits increased  7 million or 4  reflecting seasonally higher customer activity The final component of our revenue  other non interest income increased  114 million compared with the third quarter  The growth was primarily driven by higher revenue from private equity investments and a gain of  57 million related to the sale of our proprietary mutual funds  Partially offsetting this was a negative Visa derivative valuation adjustment of  45 million Turning to slide 8  our full year 2019 expenses were  10 6 billion  an increase of  278 million or 2 7  compared with 2018  as we continue to invest in our strategies  technology and employees Taking a look at the fourth quarter  expenses grew by  139 million or 5  linked quarter  Personnel increased  68 million due to higher benefits including a special year end grant to more than 51 000 of our employees  mainly in the form of health savings account contributions  totaling  25 million  Personnel also reflected higher incentive compensation associated with business activity in the fourth quarter Equipment expense increased  57 million largely due to  50 million of technology related write off  These write offs primarily resulted from the benefit of the tailoring rule which now allows us to decommission compliance and regulatory systems that are no longer required  Our efficiency ratio for the full year 2019 was 59  improving from 60  last year  As you know  expense management continues to be a focus for us  We had a 2019 goal of  300 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program and we successfully completed actions to achieve that goal Looking forward to 2020  our annual CIP will once again be  300 million  which we expect to contribute to the funding of our business and technology investments  Our credit quality metrics are presented on slide 9 and remained historically strong  Full year provision for loan losses totaled  733 million and net charge offs were  642 million in 2019  reflecting our strong loan growth and some credit normalization in our portfolio  On a linked quarter basis  provision increased  38 million in the fourth quarter due to both consumer lending and reserves attributable to certain commercial credits  Net charge offs increased  54 million to  209 million in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter  Commercial charge offs accounted for  24 million of the increase driven primarily by a few specific credits  And consumer charge offs grew  30 million  mostly related to our credit card and auto portfolios Reserves to total loans remained stable year over year at 1 14  compared to 1 16  at year end 2018  Annualized net charge offs to total loans was 35 basis points in the fourth quarter and while up  this is still well below our through the cycle average  Notably the leading indicators for credit quality continue to perform well  Non performing loans were down  59 million or 3  compared to year end 2018 and year over year total delinquencies were up  19 million or 1  As you know we adopted CECL  the new accounting standard for credit losses  effective January 1st  2020  Based on our expectation of forecasted economic conditions and portfolio balances as of December 31st  2019  the adoption will result in an overall increase of approximately  650 million or 21  to our allowance for credit losses at December 31st  2019 The increase is driven by the consumer loan portfolio as longer duration assets require more reserves under the CECL methodology  Our consumer reserve will increase approximately  900 million or 95   and our commercial reserve will decrease approximately  250 million or 12   These metrics include reserves for unfunded commitments  We plan to include a full description and transition details in our upcoming 10 K disclosure  As we move forward under CECL  it is a new accounting standard with many variables  And as a result  we expect more volatility in our quarterly provisioning Our allowance for credit losses will be determined using various models and estimation techniques utilizing for example historical losses  borrower characteristics  economic conditions  reasonable and supportable forecasts as well as other relevant factors  For expected losses in our reasonable and supportable forecast period of three years  we will use four macroeconomic scenarios and their estimated probabilities Given the multiple variables impacting provision expense under CECL  during 2020 will shift from our current practice of providing a quarterly provision guidance range to providing forecasted charge off level  However  in order to establish a context for the level of change in provision expense under CECL  for this upcoming quarter  we ll provide a range for expected provision expense based simply on expected charge offs level plus CECL reserve rates for net new loans  This guidance will assume our economic scenarios and weights remain constant  and should any of these variables change either favorably or unfavorably  our actual provision expense may also vary possibly materially In summary  PNC reported a successful 2019 and we re well positioned for 2020  Throughout 2020  we expect continued steady growth in GDP  and we expect interest rates to remain relatively stable  Taking these assumptions into consideration  our full year 2020 guidance compared to full year 2019 results is as follows  We expect loan growth to be in the range of 4  to 5   We expect total revenue growth to be in the low end of the low single digit range  which includes approximately 1  of net interest income growth  We expect expenses to be stable and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 17 5   Based on this guidance  we believe we ll generate positive operating leverage of approximately 1  in 2020 Looking at first quarter 2020 compared to fourth quarter 2019 results  we expect average loans to be up approximately 1   We expect total net interest income to decline approximately 1  reflecting one less day in the quarter  We expect fee income to be down approximately 3   We expect other non interest income to be between  300 million and  350 million  excluding net securities and Visa activity  We expect expenses to be down in the mid single digit range  and we expect provision to be between  225 million and  300 million With that  Bill and I are ready to take your questions Bryan K  Gill    Executive Vice President and Director of Investor RelationsDina  can we have the first question  please Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore  Please go ahead John Pancari    Evercore    AnalystGood morning Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerHey  good morning  John John Pancari    Evercore    AnalystOn the provision guidance  the  225 million to  300 million for the quarter  can you give us a little bit more color  I know  going forward  you re going to guide more on charge offs as you said  but   Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerYeah John Pancari    Evercore    AnalystBut regarding the quarter  can you give us a little more color behind that  225 million to  300 million  How much of that is the CECL day 2 component and then how much of that is reflecting underlying credit trends  Thanks Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  sure  Yeah  sure  John  So for the first quarter guidance  I kept it simple  and we re just going to take forecasted charge offs  which we expect to be at the same level that we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2019  And then add to that  the CECL loan loss rates of the fourth quarter of  19 to our projected loan growth  And that s the simple math John Pancari    Evercore    AnalystOkay  Okay  So  and that is carrying forward like you said  or assuming that fourth quarter charge off level of 35 basis points which was up a fair amount from last quarter and from the year ago  so that s the normalization you re talking about  Where    can you give us a bit more detail around that normalization  I know you mentioned card and auto  but also you ve had several commercial credits come up over the past several quarters that have been impacting  Is there a trend that you re seeing on the commercial side as well  Thanks William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerHey  John  it s Bill  We talk about normalization  and we have for years where our charge off rate is below what we would expect to see through the cycle  But I would tell you  our near term pressure on charge offs is more related to card and auto than anything else  and it s not really related to changing in the economy We dipped our toe into some    the lower end of our credit bucket probably a year ago on those    those vintages are starting to play through  We ve subsequently shut that down six months ago  So it s going to work its way through the snake  Phonetic  here  but I don t actually see personally that charge offs are so much normalizing  because of the economy per se  as we have some elevated consumer stuff that will reverse through time The other thing that we had a big debate internally just on what to guide  is it related to provision going forward  because CECL and the impact to CECL has so many variables on what provision will be  We can reasonably forecast charge offs  but of course outlook on economy  mix of loan growth  pace of loan growth  many other factors ultimately impact how that provision is going to behave beyond charge offs  So we re giving it our best shot  we could be high or low  Then we ll see  yeah Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerRight  Well  it s new    CECL s new  And it s been a lot of work as you know  both in terms of what we ve done as we ran through parallel in 2019 to establish our transition amount  But going forward  we feel good about our framework  We ve got a three year reasonable and supportable forecast  we ve got the four macroeconomic scenarios that will detail in our 2020 disclosures  But to Bill s point  and what I said in my opening comments  there s just a lot of factors  And then on top of that  it s new  So there s just going to be some learning curve aspects to sort of the practical application of CECL real time William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerAnd on the C I side  John  we really haven t seen anything  you ll see some specific credits we re adding to  By the way we ve been doing this for five years  What s changed is the recoveries that we ve gotten through time Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  That s right William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWay back from the crisis are gone  So it s not so much that our new stuff is elevated in any given point as our recoveries have dropped John Pancari    Evercore    AnalystGot it  Okay  that s helpful  And if I could just ask one more  on the margin side  the    I know you gave the spread income guidance for the linked quarter and for the full year expectation  But how do you think the margin will traject from here  Should we see some stabilization now that we have the pause  Thanks Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  yeah  I think so  I think so  John  We expect rates to be stable  We don t    we don t have NIM guidance  officially that s more of an outcome  But I think we will spend most of it  If everything stays constant  we ll spend the next year pretty much in this range  We could actually go up in a particular quarter as deposit costs are continuing to come down  but not a lot in either direction William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  One of the things that hit us this quarter was just elevated amortization  Speech Overlap  on our premium mortgage securities  which we think has probably hit its peak Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerBut I think we ll be in this range  up or down John Pancari    Evercore    AnalystOkay  great  Thanks  Rob  Thanks  Bill Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerSure William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  sure OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America  Please go ahead Erika Najarian    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHi  good morning William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Erika Erika Najarian    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystJust wanted to ask a little bit more detail  Rob about  on the previous question  So how should we think about one  the opportunity to deploy what seems like an extra  6 billion to  7 billion of cash  What opportunities you see for that cash going forward and also deposit costs trending down sort of balancing what has been a really successful initiative to go beyond your legacy footprint with reflecting lower rates Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerOkay  Well  so the first part of that  in terms of the new LCR requirements  we have and we will continue to work down our cash balances to the new requirement of 85   The first step as we talked about this on the third quarter call is to pay down some short term debt and then take a look going forward in terms of where we would deploy that  Unfortunately securities yields aren t terrific  So I don t think we re going to move quickly in that direction  But   William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThe simplest thing to do is to let some of our wholesale borrowings run off    and that s what we ve been doing   Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerWhich is what we re doing  and we ll continue to do  That s right William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerAnd on the deposits William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I was just going to say  on the deposit side  we have been reasonably aggressive in dropping rates and has still been able to grow balances both interest bearing and non interest bearing  So we re going to continue to pursue that  One of the things that s happening in the background here of course is the Fed over the last two or three months has been injecting cash back into the system through their repo activities  which means the fight for deposits that was pretty intense is letting up somewhat as cash comes back into the system and I m not exactly sure how that s going to play out Erika Najarian    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGot it  And just taking a step back  is there a difference in terms of stickiness in terms of the deposits that you raise through  let s say  a high yield savings account versus a checking account that you are offering a cash incentive to open William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerSo  the national deposits have been much more sticky than we expected  because at least as an individual  Erika  I kind of assume that unless you converted it to a full time account  which we ve had some success in doing  I assume people would shut those rates and move  We actually haven t seen that be the case  even though we have dropped    really far below the competitive band on what we re offering  No  I m sure there is elasticity there  but thus far we haven t seen much movement The upfront money on checking accounts which all of us do  you know  where you opened the account and you swipe your debit card five times and so forth  Speech Overlap  there is    there is a lot of mischief in that  So we ve had the percentage of people who basically are taking the cash going through the motions and never using the account have made that option less attractive to us than some other things we re doing Erika Najarian    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThat s interesting  Okay  Thank you Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerBut I would say    I would just add to that  the deposits  as we worked rates down across the board  deposits have been stickier than what we would have expected William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah Erika Najarian    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThank you William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerAnd you see it in the numbers Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerYeah William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler  Please go ahead Scott Siefers    Piper Sandler    AnalystGood morning  guys  Thanks for taking my question William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Scott Siefers    Piper Sandler    AnalystI just wanted to ask on the  1 billion supplemental authorization  I was definitely glad to see that  but just in terms of how you came up with the  1 billion  I imagine it ended up given the timing and the CCAR cycle being as much art and science  but just given where you sort of flushed out  What does it say about sort of dry powder for the next cycle and or other preferences for capital use at this point William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI mean  Rob can jump in here  but the    as we    as I mentioned at the Goldman Conference  the ask that we put in had nothing to do with tailoring  So it s basically capital that we had in excess from  19 independent of rule change  As to the amount  beyond the fact that  1 billion is a nice round number  you have to remember that our existing program is a pretty big program  So adding to our existing program by much more than we ask for just didn t seem to make a lot of sense Scott Siefers    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  All right   Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerThat was the art of it rather than the science of it Scott Siefers    Piper Sandler    AnalystYeah  fair enough  Fair enough  And then just separately  I guess I can sort of back into it  but Bill  I think you had noted back in  I think it was December when you sort of switched the NII outlook for 2020 given the changing rate profile and had suggested maybe up a percent in 2020  I imagine that still holds true  but any update how you re thinking there  And then just overall balance  which becomes more self explanatory between NII and fees as the year progresses Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think it still holds  What s helping us there is  we are forecasting pretty good loan growth for 2020  Our pipelines look good  So when we do that  we see up approximately 1  as achievable Scott Siefers    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  Perfect  And then maybe main fee drivers as you see them for the year Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerI think on the fees  we re in good shape  we    our fee businesses are big  they re all growing  So I think we ll see consistent trajectory that we ve seen in 2019  Just going through the broad categories  asset management  Asset management  you know BlackRock  the component  the BlackRock component they ll do what they do  The PNC component will have a little bit    will have same store sales growth  will have a little bit of a challenge in 2019 numbers  because we divested those businesses and in fact sold some revenue But corporate services  consumer services  we see staying on the trajectory that they ve been on  Residential mortgage could be off a little bit  but that s pretty small for us  And then service charges on deposit we see as being kind of flat  because we ll see more client activity  But as I mentioned in my comments  we are working toward eliminating a lot of those nuisance fees that our customers have experienced and we want to get ahead of that  So that will kind of offset one another  So fees are good Scott Siefers    Piper Sandler    AnalystGood  All right  Well  thank you very much  I appreciate it Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerSure OperatorYour next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research  Please go ahead John McDonald    Autonomous Research    AnalystHi  guys  Two follow ups  in terms of consumer lending  you have a long term goal to remix toward a little bit higher contribution from consumer lending  Does the CECL or the experienced dipping your toe in the auto and card that you mentioned in some of the lower spectrum  does either of those change your appetite or the degree to which you might be growing consumer loans William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerNo  I would  I mean a couple of comments  the issue    the issue we had by going a little bit down in our risk bucket  by the way  that s not a huge amount  it s kind of flowing through  I    our team is supposed to do that test and learn and see and we learned  we didn t like it  we move on  but we re growing independent of that  if you just look at the balances that we ve grown in card  in auto and in resi and even home equity  I guess this quarter Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerFirst time in a while William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  They re executing really well and that will continue  The issue for CECL of course is in today s environment  it s an easier answer to say yes  we ll keep growing home equity in resi on the balance sheet  because the loss rates  the loss content is so low even in the CECL reserve  the challenge will be in a more pressed economy and environment where charge offs and losses are higher  will you be booking loans that effectively cause negative income in the year  you book them and that s a discussion we ll have at that period of time  I do think  as I ve always said  that CECL in general will hurt consumer lending  particularly when it s needed most as people pull back because of the financial pain from the reserves  But in today s environment I don t see   Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And to your question  John  we have no change in terms of our strategies for growth because of CECL John McDonald    Autonomous Research    AnalystYeah  Great  And the experience like you had  you re just fine tuning where you re targeting based on the experience of what you had last year William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  That s right Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerThat s right John McDonald    Autonomous Research    AnalystOkay  And then in terms of the CET1 that you ultimately target  does tailoring effect how you think about what you should run out over time  and if you need any kind of fine tuning on that and just kind of remind us that target range  Rob Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  sure  The    so tailoring is obviously going to add some flexibility to our capital ratios  In terms of tailoring alone  we see our capital ratio  CET1 ratio going up about 60 bps  That s including opting out of AOCI which hurts by about 20 basis points  And then with CECL  CECL will affect CET1  that s another 19  20 basis points  So net net net  tailoring CECL  we see our capital ratio going up about 40  to    that s where we are today  So that adds a lot of flexibility    basis points  I m sorry  40 basis points  99 ish  from 95 to 99 ish  So that s a lot of flexibility  We ve talked about a target in the 8  to 8 5  range  So we ve got room John McDonald    Autonomous Research    AnalystGot it  Okay  great  Thanks very much  guys Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerSure OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC  Please go ahead Gerard Cassidy    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystHi  Rob  Hi  Bill Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerHey  Gerard Gerard Cassidy    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystCan you guys give us some color    I jumped on the call late  so I apologize if you touched on this  Rob  you mentioned the outlook for loan growth this year is actually one of the better numbers that we ve heard from your peers  Can you share with us  some of your peers have told us that  there seem to be a change in business confidence if you will or sentiment in the fourth quarter with these trade deals looking like they re coming together  Can you guys share with us what your customers are telling    your commercial customers are telling you about how they feel about business for 2020 William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  as it relates to trade  I think there is a lot of wait and see as to what s really there and how it impacts people  So I don t know that people have really changed  They ve been and you ve seen it in manufacturing and capex  they ve been a bit on the sidelines  eventually they re going to have to spend simply to replace dated stuff  But I don t know that we ve seen that yet Our growth on the C I side continues to come from specialty businesses and our geographic expansion  And probably one of the things that makes us a bit of an outlier just in terms of growth is  once we turn consumer positive  which we ve done  the totality of the loan book is growing and we just haven t had that  Speech Overlap  Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  That s right  And it s pretty balanced in terms of our outlook  and the pipelines look good Gerard Cassidy    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystVery good  In fact that was going to be my second question  Bill  can you guys kind of share with us how much of the projected growth or what you think you ll see in 2020 is coming from your existing footprint versus what s coming from these new markets that you ve penetrated William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI ve seen that statistics  I don t remember it Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Well  it s  I mean  the new markets are accretive to our loan growth in terms of percentages  but they re working off pretty small    small basis William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerBut they are a healthy percentage of our growth Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  yeah William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerFar outpacing that legacy books and they add  I m not going to guess a percentage  but I ve seen it  They add to the total Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerThey do  no question Gerard Cassidy    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystAnd I guess lastly on that  other than you guys being handsome  good guys  what s getting    how are you guys winning these customers in these new markets  Is it just better products that you have at the    that your competitors don t have for the customers that you re targeting William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerIt s a number of factors that start with really good people  It includes bringing to our new markets  the totality of PNC with a regional president model  with our community involvement  And yes  it s dependent on our products  We show up in a market  we get embedded in the community and centers of influence  We go in with our foundation and grow grade  We pick the clients we want to cover and bank long term and we re very patient  We will call on them for two and three years before we get a shot on goal  and when we get that  our products are very good  particularly in comparison to some of the smaller in market players We ve been doing this going all the way back to the RBC acquisition and it works  We use the same playbook in each market that we go into  we talk about breaking even inside of three years  we ve been able to do that with all the vintages and we ll keep going Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  and Gerard  I just want add to that  I ve said that  before this    this is a great receptivity of these corporate clients and prospects for the PNC calling effort and once that dialog goes as Bill said  then we compete well William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThe other thing that I would just remind you and this is important  The potential criticism that somehow we are out just participating in other loans is not at all accurate  When you look at our cross sell rates in those markets  they re pushing 50  fees of total revenue  which is not wildly off what we do in our legacy markets Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerAnd signifies the relationship  rather than just purchasing loans William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah Gerard Cassidy    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGreat  Very insightful  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies  Please go ahead Ken Usdin    Jefferies    AnalystHey  thanks guys  Just a question on the expense side  Rob  we heard you say that  you re kind of reupping the 300  Phonetic  CIP  And also kind of continuing to move that overall expense growth down to flattish  right  which is a nice change over the last couple of years  And I m just wondering underneath that  are some other things also starting to taper down in terms of  I wouldn t dare say that you guys are changing your investment pace  but what else is helping underneath the surface kind of clampdown on that overall rate of expense growth  that gets it closer to flattish  Thanks Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerWell  sure  I mean it s  it is that  We re not backing off of our investments or anything along those lines  We just think that the continuous improvement program that we have in place is a strength of the Company that we can achieve in essence  3  cost savings to fund these investments on a annual basis  And that s    that s something that we ve been very good at and that will continue  So I don t think there s a whole lot that s changing under that Ken Usdin    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  got it  And then just one more follow up on the kind of the balance sheet mix sense  So you mentioned that the low rate environment doesn t have a lot of right now interested in the securities portfolio  Right  So you re growing loans a lot which    and you re able to pay down wholesale debt  So does the mix of earning assets continue to push more toward higher yielding loans  And you just kind of keep the portfolio in check  How do you balance the left side of your balance sheet Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerA little bit  but that s a little bit in that direction  but it s not    it s not that dramatic William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  The    I mean at the end of the day  we are under invested today  we re certainly going to invest run off  we ll probably grow  One of the things going on in the background here is on the receive fixed swap side  because the curve steepened out while we had largely gotten out of or lowered our position  we re back into that  So you can t just look at the securities book in terms of the way we re actually investing against the yield curve  You can think about it in terms of cash  but it s not necessarily the sole tool we use to manage the balance sheet Ken Usdin    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  And that means that you re back into it meaning that you re more protected against lower from here  Right  Given those    getting back into it William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerYeah Ken Usdin    Jefferies    AnalystRight  Okay  I get it  Understood  Thank you Operator Operator Instructions  And your next question comes from the line of Matt O Connor with Deutsche Bank  Please go ahead Matt O Connor    Deutsche Bank    AnalystHi  guys  There s obviously a lot of commentary  just on the strong capital and you generate a lot of capital  Just as we think about like various uses of that capital besides buybacks  dividends  maybe you could talk about some of other potential users  I mean  we ve been pretty clear  how you feel in bank deals  but what about loan portfolios  We ve seen some branch divestitures from other people doing deals acquiring technologies  fee deal opportunities  just kind of a whole portfolio of options  Thanks William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI mean  it s a fair question  and you should assume that we look at loan portfolios will continue to do so  We look at a lot of stuff  We look at product add ons  and you ve seen us do that in small size  in terms of capabilities in the C I space things we would do in retail  and we ll continue to be rational actors in terms of how we spend the capital  We have been pretty clear on our thoughts on depository institutions and that hasn t really changed  So we ll let this play out  It s nice  If you think about the environment that we are going into notwithstanding the strength of the economy  the volatility of kind of what comes in an election year  I think having a lot of capital and being able to generate a lot of capitals are really good thing  simply because of the opportunities that are likely to present themselves here Matt O Connor    Deutsche Bank    AnalystAnd then just long term  I mean you ve talked about trying to boost growth on the consumer side and obviously over the years there have been either asset generators available or big credit card portfolios  and you haven t done any of those  But if you look out kind of the next five plus years  I mean it does seem like that could be an opportunity for you  you ve got always deposit  I know you re not a huge fan of holding a ton of securities  If there is other options  But any change in thinking of that  Again like looking out long term  maybe now is not the right time in the cycle  but that is how one big difference between your balance sheet and say USBs and   William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  look  you never say never  but my experience is  the consumer asset generators that come up for sale are broken  number 1  And number 2  we aren t the house to fix them  right  We are a prime lender in consumer that s focused on customer experience  We aren t a sub prime lender which typically most of these people play in  We don t understand it  we don t want to be that person  The fact that if they are for sale  they blew up  they didn t understand it either suggest to me that all else equal  you won t see us    you won t ever see us do that  Now  you never say never  but that is my likely guess Matt O Connor    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  Thank you very much Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerWe said that for some time  That s not a new view William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYou know the flip side of that by the way  on the C I side  we re really good at fixing busted C I  right  So big portfolios that are troubled or lenders that are troubled show up with big portfolios  that is something we pursue  That s in our wheelhouse Matt O Connor    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGot it  Thank you William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS  Please go ahead Saul Martinez    UBS    AnalystHey  guys  good morning  Question on provisioning and CECL  So you re    I think your reserve ratio is about  I think ended the quarter at about 1 15  or 1 16  I think  And with CECL that    you  on January 1st  that gets trued up  show up in the first quarter results  but it will get trued up based on the fourth quarter to 1 4   As I think about provisioning going forward and some of the dynamics around that reserve ratio  how do I think about growth and sort of the marginal growth of your portfolio versus that 1 4   Are you growing in loans that have materially high on average  have materially   higher loss content than 1 4  and how do we think about that mix change in terms of  how to think about provisioning versus charge offs and ALLL ratio evolution William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYou will drive yourself and say  I mean  I can tell you think through   Saul Martinez    UBS    AnalystAll else equal William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  but you know  the issue is  if we grow to the    in the same categories  today you wouldn t necessarily have the same loss content  because for example we shut off the lower FICO scored consumer Saul Martinez    UBS    AnalystYeah William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerIf we shift to secured products and C I versus unsecured products  it shifts  If we do more card than we do resi mortgage  it s    this thing is going to be really hard to predict  And what we have to do and we will do is give you an effect  a provision attribution each quarter so that you understand  Speech Overlap  Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerWhich is part of the disclosure  That s right Saul Martinez    UBS    AnalystAll right  And look  like the loss content   Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerI think to remember is  we have more reserves right here  day one   William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerSo  that 1 14  is now going to 1  Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  yeah  We got lot of reserves Saul Martinez    UBS    AnalystGot it  Not  fair  But like  to the extent mix is changing and there is no change in our strategy in the trajectory  which has seen auto cards grow disproportionately you ll be it from a lower base  I would think that if that trend continues  Your loss content and your expected losses over time  Assuming all else equal  which I know is unrealistic  I mean shouldn t we assume that your ALLL  given current trends should move higher from here William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThe challenge with that is the assumption that the absolute growth in consumer will somehow keep pace with the absolute growth in C I which it weren t  simply because C I is disproportionately larger  So  yes  consumer will grow  but you got to remember that that s balanced by a larger C I book  growing just past Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerRight  That s right Saul Martinez    UBS    AnalystRight  So the balance growth is much bigger just from    OK William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah Saul Martinez    UBS    AnalystGot it  Okay  All right  That s very helpful  Thanks Robert Q  Reilly    Chief Financial OfficerSure William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorThere are no further questions William S  Demchak    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerAll right  well thank you everybody  And we ll see you in the first quarter Robert Q  Reilly    Chief

125700,347215,PNC,U S  Fed signals lighter touch on bank supervision  foreign bank oversight,news,"By Michelle Price
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Federal Reserve on Friday signaled it would take a lighter touch when supervising banks  in another win for the industry which has long complained that the regulator s closed door supervisory process is opaque and capricious 
In particular  foreign lenders  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn   Credit Suisse  UL CSAG   UBS  and  Barclays   L BARC  should no longer be held to the same supervisory standard as big U S  banks after shrinking their combined U S  assets by more than 50  over the past decade  said Fed governor Randal Quarles 
 We have been giving significant thought to the composition of our supervisory portfolios and  in particular  to whether and how we should address the significant decrease in size and risk profile of the foreign firms   Quarles  who is also vice chair for Fed supervision  told a Washington conference 
His comments come as the Fed pivots from rewriting a raft of rules introduced following the 2007 2009 global financial crisis  to reviewing the way it puts them into practice 
While regulation draws bright lines on what lenders can and cannot do  Fed supervisors have discretion as to how those often highly complex rules are interpreted and implemented daily by each institution depending on their business profile 
Banks have complained that the Fed s supervisory process  which is confidential  is too inflexible and applied unevenly and have lobbied for greater transparency and predictability 
The Fed supervises institutions according to different buckets  with the eight riskiest U S  banks and UBS  Credit Suisse  Deutsche and Barclays  subject to the strictest scrutiny 
On Friday  Quarles said it no longer made sense to hold those foreign lenders to the same standard as the likes of  Wells Fargo   N WFC  and  Citigroup   N C  because their riskiness has declined  He suggested supervising them in line with regional banks such as PNC  N PNC  or  Capital One   N COF   potentially changing the competitive landscape for firms in that bucket 
In addition  Quarles outlined a number of  incremental  changes to the broader supervisory system that he said should  increase transparency  accountability and fairness  
These include allowing banks to share confidential supervisory information with third parties  such as consultants  to make it easier for them to fix issues  limiting the number of written slaps on the wrist the Fed dishes out to banks for minor lapses  and increasing the transparency of models it uses to test banks  resilience to potential economic shocks ",2020-01-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-fed-signals-lighter-touch-on-bank-supervision-foreign-bank-oversight-2062293,2062293

Earnings per share of  1 45 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 36  Further  the bottom line improved 11 5  from the prior year quarter Results reflect decline in expenses and rise in non interest income  Also  strong capital position  along with higher loan and deposit balances  was a supporting factor  However  increasing provisions and lower net interest margin  NIM  hurt results to some extent The company s net income came in at  58 1 million  up 7 8  from the prior year quarter For 2019  earnings of  5 56 per share improved 6 3  from the prior year s figure  Also  the same

6 million in the quarter  However  the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  173 million For 2019  total revenues were  681 1 billion  up 3 9   However  the top line missed the consensus estimate of  682 million The bank s net interest income was  123 9 million  marginally down year over year  NIM shrunk 15 basis points  bps  to 2 95  Non interest income came in at  47 7 million  up 13 3  year over year  This upsurge primarily resulted from rise in components including trust and asset management  mortgage banking and service charges on deposit accounts The bank s non interest expenses declined 2 9  year over year to  93 1 million  This fall reflects lower salaries and benefits  net occupancy  data processing and other expenses Efficiency ratio came in at 54 26  compared with 57 75  recorded in the year ago quarter  Notably  a fall in the efficiency ratio reflects higher profitability As of Dec 31  2019  total loans and leases balances grew 1  from the end of the prior quarter to  11 billion  and total deposits improved 2 9  to  15 8 billion Credit Quality  A Mixed BagAs of Dec 31  2019  allowance for loan and lease losses increased 3 1  year over year to  110 million  and non performing assets surged 55 6  to  20 1 million  In addition  the company recorded provision for credit losses of  4 8 million  significantly up from the prior year quarter However

additional  100 million  On Jan 24   120 4 million was left under the buyback authorization ConclusionRising loan and deposit balances are likely to continue supporting Bank of Hawaii s top line  In addition  controlled expenses are likely to keep stoking the bank s bottom line growth  Furthermore  the company s profitability ratios indicate solid returns  However  increasing provisions pose a

125735,347250,PNC,Why The PNC Financial Services Group  Inc  PNC  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
The PNC Financial Services Group  NYSE PNC   Inc in Focus
Based in Pittsburgh  The PNC Financial Services Group  Inc  PNC  is in the Finance sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of  3 48   The company is paying out a dividend of  1 15 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 99  compared to the Banks   Major Regional industry s yield of 2 65  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 75  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  4 60 is up 9 5  from last year  The PNC Financial Services Group  Inc has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 21 68   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  The PNC Financial Services Group  Inc s current payout ratio is 41   This means it paid out 41  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
PNC is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 is  11 85 per share  with earnings expected to increase 4 04  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that PNC is not only an attractive dividend play  but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2020-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-pnc-financial-services-group-inc-pnc-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200499432,200499432

125758,347273,PNC,U S  October job growth beats expectations despite GM strike,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  job growth slowed less than expected in October as the drag from a strike at General Motors  N GM  was offset by gains elsewhere and hiring in the prior two months was stronger than previously estimated  offering some assurance that consumers would continue to support the slowing economy 
While the Labor Department s closely watched monthly employment report on Friday showed the unemployment rate picking up from near a 50 year low of 3 5  last month  that was because of an influx into the labor force in a sign of confidence in jobs markets 
The report came on the heels of data this week showing a further slowdown in economic growth in the third quarter as a trade tensions induced slump in business investment deepened 
Manufacturing s struggles appear to have persisted early in the fourth quarter  with a survey on Friday showing a measure of factory activity remaining in contraction territory for the third straight month in October 
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Wednesday for the third time this year  but signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008 
 The current economic expansion looks set to continue at least through the first part of next year despite the trade war drag   said Gus Faucher  chief economist at PNC Financial  NYSE PNC  in Pittsburgh   Today s solid jobs report means that the Fed  after cutting its policy rate three times since the summer  is likely to keep rates steady in the near term  
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 128 000 jobs last month  with manufacturing shedding 36 000 positions   the most since October 2009  the government s survey of establishments showed  Striking workers who do not receive a paycheck during the payrolls survey period are treated as unemployed  The strike by about 46 000 workers at GM plants in Michigan and Kentucky ended last Friday 
Job growth last month was also held back by the departure of 20 000 temporary workers hired by the government for the 2020 Census  Excluding the strike and these temporary hires  economists estimate payrolls increased by about 190 000 
The economy created 95 000 more jobs in August and September than previously estimated  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by only 89 000 jobs in October 
The dollar was little against a basket of currencies on the employment report  while U S  Treasury prices fell  U S  stocks were trading higher 
Job growth is slowing this year  averaging 167 000 per month compared with an average monthly gain of 223 000 in 2018  in part because of the nearly 16 month trade war between the United States and China  which has undermined business investment 
The U S  China trade war continues to cast a pall over the longest economic expansion  now in its 11th year 
The Institute for Supply Management  ISM  said its index of national factory activity rose to a reading of 48 3 last month from 47 8 in September  which was the lowest level since June 2009 when the recession was ending  A reading below 50 indicates contraction and October marked the third straight month that the index broke below the 50 threshold 
The index had declined for six straight months  Though the ISM s forward looking new orders sub index increased last month  in remained in contraction territory  The survey s factory employment index rose to 47 7 in October from 46 3 in September 
LABOR MARKET OPTIMISM
There are fears the business investment malaise could spill over to the labor market  which is underpinning consumer spending  Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he did not see this risk as the labor market remains healthy 
Solid consumer spending blunted some of the drag on the economy from weak business investment to limit the slowdown in growth to a 1 9  annualized rate in the third quarter  The economy grew at a 2 0  pace in the April June quarter 
With the labor market steadily pushing up wages  consumers are likely to continue carrying the economy  Average hourly earnings increased six cents  or 0 2  last month after being unchanged in September  That kept the annual increase in wages to 3 0  in October  Wage growth peaked at 3 4  in February 
The one tenth of a percentage point rise in the unemployment rate to 3 6  last month also reflected 325 000 people streaming into the labor force  The smaller household survey from which the unemployment rate is derived also showed a moderation in employment after adding 1 57 million jobs in the five months prior to October 
A broader measure of unemployment  which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment  rose to 7 0  last month from 6 9  in September  which was the lowest level since December 2000 
The labor force participation rate  or the proportion of working age Americans who have a job or are looking for one  increased to 63 3  last month from 63 2  in September 
October s plunge in manufacturing employment reflected a strike driven 41 600 tumble in payrolls in the auto sector  Manufacturing payrolls fell by 5 000 in September  Manufacturing is struggling under the weight of trade tariffs  which the White House has argued are intended to boost the sector 
Construction employment rose by 10 000 jobs in October  Hiring in the sector has slowed from a peak of 56 000 jobs in January  There were increases in professional and business services  healthcare  leisure and hospitality  financial activities  retail and wholesale trade employment last month 




Government employment fell by 3 000 jobs in October as 20 000 temporary workers hired for the 2020 Census completed their work ",2019-11-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/general-motors-strike-looms-over-us-october-job-growth-2009562,2009562

1  JPMorgan  Wells Fargo  Kick off Earnings for Banks
The first quarter earnings season has started already with Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL  report today  but things get a lot of heavier on Friday when three big banks report results before the bell 
Banks have been dealing with lower interest rates  which are squeezing profit margins  and their stocks have trailed the market rebound that set in after the Christmas 2018 slump 
JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  is the biggest U S  bank by assets  Analysts polled by Investing com see the bank earning  2 36 a share in the quarter  down a penny from  2 37 a share in the year ago quarter 
Revenue is forecast at  28 5 billion  essentially flat from a year ago  The shares are up about 8 8  this year  but that gain comes after the 13 5  decline in the fourth quarter of 2018 and an 8 7  decline for the year 
 Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  will report  1 12 a share for the period  according to analysts  unchanged from a year ago  Revenue is likely to come in at  20 97 billion  down 4 3  from a year ago 
The stock is up just 3 6  this year after falling 12 3  in the fourth quarter and 14 2  for all of 2018 
Wells Fargo is still struggling to get its management problems under control  Tim Sloan resigned as CEO on March 28  pummeled by regulators  Congress and even his own board  The bank is searching for a new CEO 
And PNC Financial  NYSE PNC  is expected to earn  2 61 a share in the first quarter  up from  2 43 a share a year ago  Revenue is projected at  4 27 billion  up 3 9  from  4 11 billion in the year ago period  The shares are up 9 8  this year after falling 14 2  in the fourth quarter and 18 9  for all of 2018 
In all  this earnings season is expected to be a disappointment  FactSet expects earnings for companies in the S P 500 to decline 4 2   which would be the first year over year decline since the second quarter of 2016 
2  Michigan Sentiment Seen Dipping
The health of the U S  consumer dominates the economic calendar tomorrow 
The University of Michigan will release its preliminary measure of April consumer confidence at 10 00 AM ET  14 00 GMT  
The Michigan consumer sentiment index is expected to edge down to 98 1  following two straight months that saw gains above expectations  according to economist forecasts compiled by Investing com 
The consumer expectations component is also expected to drop slightly  falling to 88 5 
3  Will Rig Count Ramp up Again 
The weekly installment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes comes tomorrow after data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the U S  rose by 15 to 831 
That was the first increase in seven weeks adding to fears that U S  energy producers are set to ramp up production  which remained at a record 12 2 million barrels a day  the EIA said on Wednesday 
Drilling activity had been on the wane in recent weeks as energy firms ditched big exploration and production spending to focus on earnings growth rather than increased output 
A second consecutive gain in rig counts will likely add credence to the EIA s expectations that U S  energy companies will continue to raise output this year 
U S  crude oil production is expected to rise by 1 43 bpd in 2019 to average 12 39 million bpd  the EIA said on Tuesday  up from its previous forecast for a rise of 1 35 million bpd

During the month of March  China s imports from the U S  fell by 21   while Chinese exporters sent 10 6  more of their products to American consumers  Although some analysts commented that Chinese exports may have been affected by seasonality  the numbers give the impression that the current state of trade may not be coming out in favor of the U S ",2019-04-12,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-friday-1834496,1834496

million recorded in the prior year quarter Revenues Rise  Loans   Deposits Go Up  Costs EscalateTotal revenues  net of interest expense  jumped 5 7  year over year to  272 5 million in the quarter  driven by higher net interest income  partly offset by lower non interest income  Furthermore  revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  262 1 million Texas Capital s net interest income was

interest margin  however  contracted 54 basis points  bps  year over year to 3 16  Non interest income declined 20 4  year over year to  20 3 million  This downside  primarily resulted from decreased

125908,347423,PNC,U S  third quarter growth unrevised  headwinds increasing,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  economy slowed in the third quarter as previously reported  but the pace was likely strong enough to keep growth on track to hit the Trump administration s 3 percent target this year  even as momentum appears to have moderated further early in the fourth quarter  Gross domestic product increased at a 3 5 percent annualized rate  the Commerce Department said on Wednesday in its second estimate of third quarter GDP growth  That was unchanged from its estimate in October and well above the economy s growth potential  which economists estimate to be about 2 percent  The unrevised third quarter GDP reading reflected a faster pace of inventory accumulation and more business spending on equipment than initially thought that was offset by downward revisions to consumer spending and exports  The economy grew at a 4 2 percent pace in the April June quarter   Strong growth last quarter likely keeps the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates in December for the fourth time this year  despite an escalation of criticism from President Donald Trump that tighter monetary policy is slowing down the economy  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a Economic Club of New York luncheon on Wednesday that he expected solid growth  low unemployment and inflation near the U S  central bank s 2 percent target    There is a great deal to like about this outlook   Powell said  The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies  while U S  Treasury prices rose  Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher   Growth is being driven by the Trump administration s  1 5 trillion tax cut package  which has given consumer spending a jolt and supported business investment  The fiscal stimulus is part of measures adopted by the White House to boost annual growth to 3 percent on a sustainable basis  An alternative measure of economic growth  gross domestic income  GDI   increased at a rate of 4 0 percent in the third quarter  quickening from the second quarter s 0 9 percent pace  The average of GDP and GDI  also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity  increased at a 3 8 percent rate in the July September period  up from a 2 5 percent growth pace in the second quarter  The income side of the growth ledger was buoyed by after tax corporate profits  which increased at a 3 3 percent rate last quarter after rising at a 2 1 percent pace in the April June period  But dark clouds are gathering over the economic expansion that is now in its ninth year and the second longest on record  The goods trade deficit widened further in October  pressured by declining exports of soybeans  capital goods and automobiles  the Commerce Department said in another report on Wednesday  WEAK HOUSING MARKET New home sales tumbled in October  the latest indication that the housing market was softening because of higher interest rates  a third report showed   Data released last week showed business spending on equipment weakening in October and it could remain tepid with Brent crude oil prices slumping by more than 30 percent from a four year high above  86 in early October  Cheaper oil tends to hurt investment in the energy sector because of reduced profits  General Motors Co  N GM  said on Monday that it would cut thousands from its North American workforce  slash production and eliminate some slow selling car models  which could have ripple effects on the domestic economy  Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are currently around a 2 5 percent pace  Economists expect GDP growth to slow further in 2019 as the fiscal stimulus fades and the effects of a bitter trade war with China as well as a strong dollar take their toll   Growth will slow in the near term   said Gus Faucher  chief economist at PNC Financial  NYSE PNC  Services in Pittsburgh   A trade war remains the biggest downside risk   The third quarter growth slowdown mostly reflected the impact of Beijing s retaliatory tariffs on U S  exports  including soybeans  Farmers front loaded shipments to China before the tariffs took effect in early July  boosting second quarter growth  Since then  soybean exports have declined every month  increasing the trade deficit   Imports increased a bit faster in the third quarter than previously estimated while the drop in exports was much sharper  The resulting larger trade gap sliced off 1 91 percentage points from GDP growth in the third quarter  instead of the 1 78 percentage points reported last month  That was the most since the second quarter of 1985  Imports were driven by strong domestic demand and a rush by businesses to stockpile before U S  import duties  mostly on Chinese goods  came into effect late in the third quarter  Imports subtract from GDP growth  But some of the imports likely ended up in warehouses  adding to the stockpile of inventory  which contributed to GDP   Inventories increased at an  86 6 billion rate  instead of the  76 3 billion rate estimated in October  Inventory investment added 2 27 percentage points to GDP growth  That was more than the 2 07 percentage points reported last month and was the biggest contribution since the fourth quarter of 2011  Growth in consumer spending  which accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic activity  increased at a 3 6 percent rate in the third quarter  down from the 4 0 percent rate estimated in October  
Business spending on equipment rose at a 3 5 percent rate  instead of the previously reported 0 4 percent rate  That was still the slowest pace in two years  The moderation in business spending has been blamed on the import tariffs  which are increasing manufacturing costs for companies ",2018-11-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/us-thirdquarter-gdp-growth-unrevised-at-35-percent-1703204,1703204

125931,347446,PNC,U S  Bancorp and Capital One Poised to Get Rules Relief From Fed,news," Bloomberg     Big regional U S  banks such as U S  Bancorp   Capital One  Financial Corp  NYSE COF   and PNC Financial Services Group Inc  NYSE PNC   are about to get more relief from regulators appointed by President Donald Trump 
The Federal Reserve and other agencies    responding to legislation that s meant to soften rules for smaller lenders    are set to propose this week that a series of complex capital demands only apply to Wall Street megabanks  according to a person familiar with the regulators  plans 
Freeing regional banks from the requirements probably wouldn t have much of an impact on their overall capital levels  but it would ease their compliance burdens and potentially make it easier for them to grow 
Read More  1 000 Cuts to Dodd Frank  Tracking Trump s Wave of Deregulation
At issue is a framework known as  advanced approaches  that sets out a number of complicated benchmarks that the largest banks must use to determine how much of a capital cushion they need to protect against losses 
Current rules say an advanced approaches bank is one with at least  250 billion in assets or  10 billion in foreign exposure    a measure meant to include the biggest and most internationally active firms 
But the new standard  set to be discussed by the Fed at an Oct  31 meeting  would raise the threshold to  700 billion in assets and  75 billion in international activity  said the person who requested anonymity to provide details on the proposal  The advanced approaches label also subjects banks to stiffer leverage and liquidity requirements  though it couldn t be determined how the proposal might impact those demands 
In addition  the Fed is expected to release a broader plan this week that establishes new ways of determining which lenders deserve particular regulatory demands  the person said 
Instead of categorizing the industry based mostly on banks  assets  the agencies plan to use a series of added measures  including how much each firm depends on short term funding  what its off balance sheet exposures are and how much business it does outside the U S   said the person  Those factors will help regulators put the lenders in tiers  and each tier would face different demands 
Spokesmen for the Fed  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp     the three agencies said to be involved    declined to comment 
Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles  the agency s point man on regulation  has been clear that he wants to ease up on banks that don t pose the same threat to financial stability as Wall Street lenders 
In a July speech  he said requirements the Fed was considering dialing back for mid sized banks included stress tests  liquidity demands and living wills    the plans firms must prepare that outline how they would go bankrupt without hurting the broader financial system 
Washington has been a much friendlier place for banks with Trump in the White House and Republicans in control of Congress  That s been particularly true for regional and community lenders  which faced a number of post crisis constraints even though politicians didn t blame them nearly as much as Wall Street for causing the 2008 meltdown 
In May  lawmakers passed an overhaul of the Dodd Frank Act that called for relaxing demands for regional banks  The new law gave regulators 18 months to revamp how they oversee banks between  100 billion and  250 billion in assets  This week s Fed meeting is a response to that bill ",2018-10-29,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-bancorp-and-capital-one-poised-to-get-rules-relief-from-fed-1663358,1663358

125938,347453,PNC,PNC Financial Services  PNC  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
PNC Financial Services in Focus
PNC Financial Services  PNC  is headquartered in Pittsburgh  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 13 69  since the start of the year  Currently paying a dividend of  1 15 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 3 46   In comparison  the Banks   Major Regional industry s yield is 3 08   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 99  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  4 60 is up 35 3  from last year  Over the last 5 years  PNC Financial Services has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 18 08   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  PNC Financial Services s current payout ratio is 34   This means it paid out 34  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for PNC for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  11 29 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 5 42  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  PNC is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-08-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pnc-financial-services-pnc-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200451405,200451405

Several banks have tested or deployed xCurrent  which uses  bi directional messaging  that can eventually plug them into distributed ledgers  but that  is not a distributed ledger  itself  Ripple s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz told Reuters in June  He added banks were unlikely to use distributed ledgers for payments for now 
Ripple is among the most well known startups that builds blockchain technology  or the software that first emerged as the system underpinning cryptocurrencies 
Ripple also champions the use of a cryptocurrency called XRP  of which it holds a large share  and which it hopes will be used by financial firms for payments in conjunction with its payment platform xRapid 
PNC Bank will not be using XRP or xRapid to carry out payments for now  Asheesh Birla  Ripple s senior vice president for product management  said in an interview 
 Banks aren t going to be the first adopters of xRapid   Birla said  He added xRapid was more targeted towards emerging markets than the United States 
XCurrent uses an immutable  interledger  protocol which Ripple said improves on existing payment networks because it offers instant settlement 
Getting banks to use xCurrent is a first step towards adoption of its other product  Birla said 
 It s a way to get their toe into the water   Birla said  He added that the next step would be  how do you get them to use xRapid which is our liquidity product  ",2018-09-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/blockchain-startup-ripple-signs-up-pnc-as-a-customer-for-its-payment-tech-1616114,1616114

125957,347472,PNC,This Is Why PNC Financial Services  PNC  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
PNC Financial Services in Focus
Based in Pittsburgh  PNC Financial Services  PNC  is in the Finance sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 19 48   The regional bank operator is paying out a dividend of  0 95 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 72  compared to the Banks   Major Regional industry s yield of 2 77  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 89  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  3 80 is up 11 8  from last year  Over the last 5 years  PNC Financial Services has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 18 07   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  PNC Financial Services s current payout ratio is 35   This means it paid out 35  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  PNC expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  11 32 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 5 70  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  PNC is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-pnc-financial-services-pnc-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200441285,200441285

125963,347478,PNC,PNC expects small rise in quarterly loan growth  shares fall,news," Reuters    U S  regional bank PNC Financial Services Group Inc  NYSE PNC  on Friday reported disappointing quarterly loan growth and said it expected only a small improvement in lending for the final three months of the year  sending its shares down 5 percent 
The company s performance comes against the backdrop of heightened expectations for business borrowings as companies take advantage of lower taxes to boost investments 
However  PNC s loan growth rose a meager 2 percent in the third quarter  slower than the 4 percent increase it generated in the second quarter  The bank s loan growth was also well below JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM    Co s 6 percent rise and  Citigroup   NYSE C  s 4 percent 
 Investors want to see the benefits of tax reform and a strong economy materialize into loan growth at the banks  In that regard  we didn t see that happen for PNC this quarter   Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders said 
The bank said loan growth was likely to be up modestly  with increase in both its net interest income and fee income coming in low single digits 
Besides competition from bigger banks  regional lenders are also battling online lenders  asset managers and insurers for a piece of the lending business  Sanders said 
To counter the threat  the bank has been spending heavily to boost its online banking business  while trying to attract customers with reward schemes 
That drove a 6 2 percent jump in PNC s total non interest expense  also pressured by higher employee wage bill 
A number of brokerages had previously said they were expecting roughly no change in the company s non interest expenses 
Net interest income rose 2 percent to  2 4 billion  helped partly by higher interest rates  which allow banks to charge more on loans 
The Federal Reserve has raised rates four times since the third quarter last year  bringing the short term overnight funds rate to 2 25 percent 
The bank s net interest margin  a key measure of lending profitability  also rose 
PNC s net income rose 26 percent to  1 32 billion in the quarter ended Sept  30  Earnings per share came in at  2 82  compared with the average analyst estimate of  2 72 per share  according to I B E S data from Refinitiv

125995,347510,PNC,Federal Reserve should ease rules for largest non global U S  banks  official,news,"By Michelle Price WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Federal Reserve should consider formally easing the regulatory framework for U S  banks that have more than  250 billion in assets but are not global players  a top Fed official said on Wednesday  The comments by Fed Vice Chair Randal Quarles will be cheered by the country s three super regional lenders PNC  N PNC    Capital One   N COF  and U S  Bancorp  N USB   which worried they would be hurt by a rewrite of the 2010 Dodd Frank law passed by Congress in May that helped their smaller rivals  That legislation eased oversight of U S  banks with less than  250 billion in assets but did little for the largest U S  lenders  Super regional players were concerned that the changed regulations put them at a disadvantage by lumping them in with the global behemoths while giving their slightly smaller competitors a leg up  They lobbied successfully for the law to direct the Fed  the country s top banking regulator  to tailor regulations for firms above the  250 billion asset threshold but that are not globally systemically important banks or  G SIBs   In a speech on Thursday  Quarles said the regulator should quickly act on that direction and review the rules for super regional banks  with the aim of devising a framework that clearly differentiates them from G SIBs  Quarles said the Fed should move to an expedited rule proposal that could  for example  require less frequent  stress testing  of super regional banks  allow more flexible models for capital calculations and more finely calibrated liquidity requirements    The supervision and regulatory framework for these firms should reflect that there are material differences between those firms that qualify as U S  G SIBs and those that do not   Quarles told a banking conference in his home state of Utah    For example  we know that non G SIBs with more than  250 billion in assets are generally less complex and less interconnected than U S  G SIBs and thus pose relatively less risk to financial stability   he added  Under the administration of President Donald Trump  who has pledged to cut red tape in order to stimulate bank lending  the Fed has made several proposals to change bank rules so as to make them more sensitive to banks  individual risk profiles  
 We have a unique opportunity to further tailor our supervision and regulation framework for large banks in a manner that allows us to be more risk sensitive while still meeting our core goals of promoting safety and soundness   Quarles said ",2018-07-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/federal-reserve-should-ease-rules-for-largest-nonglobal-us-banks-official-1535458,1535458

125997,347512,PNC,U S  retail sales slow  but exhibit underlying strength,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  retail sales recorded their smallest gain in six months in August as consumers cut back on purchases of motor vehicles and clothing  but upward revisions to July data kept intact expectations of strong economic growth in the third quarter   Other data on Friday showed the biggest drop in import prices in more than 1 1 2 years in August amid a decline in the cost of fuels and a range of other goods  The weak import price data came on the heels of soft inflation readings in August  Signs of cooling consumer spending and inflation did not change views that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates later this month  The U S  central bank has increased borrowing costs twice this year    The seas are calm for the economy with enough wind in the sails to keep the expansion on track and not enough inflation pressures out there to halt the economy s forward progress   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG in New York   The Commerce Department said retail sales edged up 0 1 percent last month  the smallest rise since February  Data for July was revised higher to show sales rising 0 7 percent instead of the previously reported 0 5 percent gain  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales increasing 0 4 percent in August  Retail sales in August advanced 6 6 percent from a year ago  Excluding automobiles  gasoline  building materials and food services  retail sales nudged up 0 1 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0 8 percent jump in July  These so called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product  Core retail sales were previously reported to have increased 0 5 percent in July  Despite the slowdown in core retail sales in August  consumer spending remains supported by a tightening labor market  which is steadily pushing up wages  Annual wage growth increased at its fastest pace in more than nine years in August and there were a record 6 9 million job openings in July  Spending is also being underpinned by tax cuts and higher savings as well as high consumer sentiment    Consumer spending will continue to increase at a sturdy pace through the rest of this year and into 2019  supporting overall economic growth   said Gus Faucher  chief economist at PNC Financial  NYSE PNC  in Pittsburgh   The dollar rose against a basket of currencies on the data  U S  Treasury prices fell  lifting the yield on the benchmark 10 year note back above 3 percent  Stocks on Wall Street were trading slightly lower   WEAK AUTO SALES The economy is poised for strong growth in the third quarter and this year  but an escalating trade war between the United States and China is casting a shadow on the long term outlook  President Donald Trump last week threatened duties on another  267 billion worth of Chinese goods on top of a  200 billion tariff list that is awaiting his decision  Washington already has slapped duties on  50 billion worth of Chinese imports  provoking retaliation from Beijing   The economy grew at a 4 2 percent annualized rate in the April June period  the fastest in nearly four years and almost double the 2 2 percent pace set in the first quarter   Growth estimates for the third quarter top a 3 0 percent rate  but Hurricane Florence  which crashed into the Carolinas on Friday  could put a dent into output  The hurricane could negatively impact labor market  housing  retail sales and industrial production data for September  For now  the predictions for solid third quarter economic growth prevail  A report from the Fed on Friday showed industrial production increased 0 4 percent in August after a similar gain in July  Industrial production was powered by an acceleration in the output of motor vehicles  utilities and mining    Trade tensions are the biggest risk   said Scott Hoyt  a senior economist at Moody s Analytics in West Chester  Pennsylvania   If tariffs rise globally  it will push up consumer prices  undermine job and therefore income growth  and hurt financial markets   Auto sales fell 0 8 percent in August after slipping 0 1 percent in July  Receipts at service stations surged 1 7 percent  likely reflecting higher gasoline prices  Sales at clothing stores fell 1 7 percent  the biggest drop since February 2017  after accelerating 2 2 percent in July  The plunge in clothing store receipts likely reflects a sharp drop in apparel prices in August  which was the biggest since 1949  Sales at furniture stores fell 0 3 percent and receipts at building material stores were unchanged last month   But there were increases in online and mail order retail sales and Americans also spent more at restaurants and bars  Spending at hobby  musical instrument and book stores rose after declining for several months  In a separate report on Friday  the Labor Department said import prices fell 0 6 percent in August  the largest decline since January 2016  after slipping 0 1 percent in July   The drop in import prices likely reflects the strong dollar  which has gained more than 6 percent this year against the currencies of the United States  main trade partners   In the 12 months through August  import prices rose 3 7 percent  slowing after surging 4 9 percent in July   This signals a slightly smaller inflationary impact from abroad on domestic prices going forward   said Jake McRobie  a U S  economist at Oxford Economics in New York

126011,347526,PNC,Should Value Investors Pick PNC Financial Services  PNC  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The PNC Financial Services  Inc    NYSE PNC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  PNC Financial Services has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 95  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 17 80  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts PNC Financial Services  current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 12 90  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 66  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that PNC Financial Services has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 48  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for PNC Financial Services  stock in the near term too  P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  PNC Financial Services has a P S ratio of about 2 89  This is somewhat lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 20 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  PNC Financial Services currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes PNC a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though PNC Financial Services might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of C  This gives PNC a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days and three lower  while the full year estimate has seen a similar trend in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen 3 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up 0 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below The PNC Financial Services Group  Inc Price and Consensus    The stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term  However  PNC Financial Services is enjoying somewhat bullish analyst sentiment  as indicated by the positive estimate revisions  and this works in the company s favor   Bottom LinePNC Financial Services is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 41  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for broader factors and industry trend to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick This Could Be the Fastest Way to Grow Wealth in 2019 Research indicates one sector is poised to deliver a crop of the best performing stocks you ll find anywhere in the market  Breaking news in this space frequently creates quick double  and triple digit profit opportunities These companies are changing the world

126034,347549,PNC,Rise in U S  inflation puts spotlight on Fed s Powell,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  consumer prices rose more than expected in January as Americans paid more for gasoline  rental accommodation and healthcare  raising pressure on new Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell to prevent a possible overheating of the economy  The report from the Labor Department on Wednesday  however  likely overstates the inflation picture given that some of the price gains  especially for apparel and motor vehicle insurance  are seen by economists as unsustainable  Inflation  which could get a further boost from a tightening labor market and increased government spending  might force the Fed to be more aggressive in raising interest rates this year than currently anticipated  That would slow economic growth   The U S  central bank has forecast three rate hikes for this year  with the first increase expected at its next policy meeting in March  Powell took over the reins of the Fed from Janet Yellen earlier this month   While we have been looking for inflation to firm  we think last month s increase probably overstates the underlying trend   said Michael Feroli  an economist at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  in New York   Today s inflation reading should probably cement in place the Fed s intent to hike rates at the March meeting  We now also think the odds are moving up that they also revise their guidance at that meeting from looking for three hikes this year to four  aligning with our view   The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index increased 0 5 percent last month as households paid more for gasoline  rental accommodation and healthcare  The CPI rose 0 2 percent in December  The year on year increase in the CPI was unchanged at 2 1 percent in January as the large price gains from last year dropped out of the calculation  Excluding the volatile food and energy components  the CPI shot up 0 3 percent  That was the largest increase since January 2017 and followed a 0 2 percent rise in December  The year on year rise in the so called core CPI was unchanged at 1 8 percent in January  Economists had forecast the CPI increasing 0 3 percent in January and the core CPI rising 0 2 percent  The core CPI is viewed as a better measure of underlying inflation trends  The Fed tracks a different index  the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy  which has consistently undershot the central bank s 2 percent target since mid 2012  The dollar  DXY  initially rose against a basket of currencies after the data but later surrendered the gains  Stocks on Wall Street opened lower before erasing losses  Prices of U S  Treasuries fell  U S  financial markets have been on edge after being spooked by a surge in annual wage growth in January   INFLATION BUILDING UP  So called base effects will turn more favorable in March  which economists say would set the course for higher annual inflation readings  Average hourly earnings jumped 2 9 percent on an annual basis in January  the largest rise since June 2009  from 2 7 percent in December  A pickup in wage growth as the labor market hits full employment is expected to contribute to higher inflation this year  Fiscal stimulus in the form of a  1 5 trillion tax cut package and increased government spending are also expected to add to price pressures   The Fed s task is complicated by the recent tax cuts and spending deal  which will stimulate the economy at a time when the labor market is already at  or close to  full employment   said Gus Faucher  chief economist at PNC Financial  NYSE PNC  in Pittsburgh   A weakening dollar is also expected to put pressure on inflation  Rising inflation could hurt consumer spending  which is already showing signs of slowing  A separate report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed retail sales fell 0 3 percent in January  the largest decline since February 2017  after being unchanged in December   Bad January weather could have contributed to the weakness in retail sales as consumers avoided auto dealerships and put home building projects on hold   said Scott Anderson  chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco  The weak retail sales and stronger inflation prompted the Atlanta Fed to slash its first quarter gross domestic product growth estimate by 0 8 percentage point to a 3 2 percent annualized rate  The economy grew at a 2 6 percent pace in the fourth quarter     Inflation last month was driven by gasoline prices  which rebounded 5 7 percent after falling 0 8 percent in December  Crude oil prices surged in January on strong global demand and a depreciating dollar  Food prices rose 0 2 percent in January  The core CPI was boosted by rising rents  Owners  equivalent rent of primary residence  which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home  increased 0 3 percent after a similar gain in December   The cost of healthcare services increased 0 4 percent  with prices for hospital care jumping 1 3 percent and the cost of doctor visits rising 0 3 percent  Apparel prices surged 1 7 percent  the biggest increase since February 1990   There were also increases in the cost of motor vehicle insurance  which recorded its largest gain since November 2001  Prices of personal care products posted their biggest increase in three years  But consumers got some respite from airline fares  which fell for a third straight month in January

margin expanded 38 basis points  bps  to 3 79  Total adjusted non interest income came in at  246 million  slightly up on a year over year basis  Higher card fees and other non interest income were mostly offset by decrease in mainly fiduciary income and service charges on deposit accounts Further  adjusted non interest expenses totaled  433 million  slightly up year over year  The upswing resulted from higher salaries and benefits expense  outside processing fee expense and other non interest expenses Adjusted efficiency ratio was 50 81  compared with 54 32  in the prior year quarter  A fall in ratio indicates a rise in profitability Solid Balance SheetAs of Mar 31  2019  total assets and common shareholders  equity were  70 7 billion and  7 4 billion  respectively  compared with

including the benefit of short term rate increase and growth in average loans  Notably  higher wholesale funding  as well as lower interest recoveries and change in deposit mix might partially offset the benefit Non interest income is estimated to be 1 2  higher  resulting from growth in fiduciary income and card fees  partly mitigated by reduced derivative income and service charges on deposit accounts Non interest expenses are predicted to be down 3   indicating the end of restructuring charges from the GEAR Up initiatives  reduction in FDIC insurance expenses by  16 million from the

126050,347565,PNC,U S  third quarter economic growth fastest in three years,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  economy grew faster than initially thought in the third quarter  notching its quickest pace in three years  buoyed by robust business spending on equipment and an accumulation of inventories  Gross domestic product expanded at a 3 3 percent annual rate last quarter also boosted by a rebound in government investment  the Commerce Department said in its second GDP estimate on Wednesday  That was the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2014 and a pickup from the second quarter s 3 1 percent rate  The economy was previously reported to have grown at a 3 0 percent pace in the July September period  It was the first time since 2014 that the economy experienced growth of 3 percent or more for two straight quarters   The growth pace  however  likely exaggerates the health of the economy as inventories  goods yet to be sold  accounted for nearly a quarter of GDP growth  Excluding inventory investment  the economy grew at a 2 5 percent rate  When measured from the income side  output also expanded at a 2 5 percent rate    While welcomed improvement  the sustainability of growth has been reliant on pent up demand and stockpiling of goods after grossly depleting inventories   said Lindsey Piegza  chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income in Chicago  Economists had expected that third quarter GDP growth would be raised to a 3 2 percent rate  The brisk growth pace strengthens the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month  The U S  central bank has increased borrowing costs twice this year   Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers on Wednesday  the economic expansion is increasingly broad based across sectors   and that she expected that  the economy will continue to expand   Prices for U S  Treasuries fell on the data and Yellen s remarks  The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies  while stocks were mixed  The economic recovery since the 2007 2009 recession is now in its eighth year and showing little signs of fatigue  The economy is being powered by a tightening labor market  which has largely maintained a strong performance that started during former President Barack Obama s first term  Economists see a modest boost to growth from efforts by President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress to push through a broad package of tax cuts  including slashing the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent   Trump wants lower taxes to lift annual GDP growth to 3 percent on a sustained basis  The fiscal stimulus would  however  come when the economy is at full employment   Corporate and personal income tax cuts will have minimal impact on growth over the longer run   said Gus Faucher  chief economist at PNC Financial  NYSE PNC  in Pittsburgh   In 2019 and beyond growth will settle in to its long run average of 2 percent to 2 25 percent   CORPORATE PROFITS RISE The government said after tax corporate profits surged at a 5 8 percent rate last quarter after rising at only a 0 1 percent pace in the second quarter  Undistributed profits jumped at a 13 9 percent rate after declining for two straight quarters  suggesting that companies were anticipating deep tax cuts  Businesses accumulated inventories at a  39 0 billion pace in the third quarter  instead of the previously reported  35 8 billion rate  As a result  inventory investment contributed 0 8 percentage point to third quarter GDP growth  up from the previously reported 0 73 percentage point   That suggests inventories could be a drag on growth in the fourth quarter  Data on Tuesday showed a drop in wholesale and retail inventories in October  leading economists to slash their fourth quarter GDP growth estimates by as much as five tenths of a percentage point to as low as a 2 3 percent rate   The Fed on Wednesday in its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide described economic activity as having  continued to increase at a modest to moderate pace in October and mid November   Growth in consumer spending  which accounts for more than two thirds of the U S  economy  was revised down to a 2 3 percent rate in the third quarter from the previously reported 2 4 percent pace  Consumer spending increased at a robust 3 3 percent rate in the second quarter   The deceleration in consumer spending likely reflects the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma  which struck Texas and Florida during the third quarter  Spending is also being constrained by sluggish wage growth  which is forcing households to dip into their savings to fund purchases  The government cut its estimate for the increase in second quarter wages and salaries by  26 5 billion  The saving rate decreased to 3 3 percent in the third quarter from 3 7 percent in the April June period   Economists say savings cannot drive consumer spending indefinitely  But they also believe that income growth is being understated  pointing to a 4 1 percent unemployment rate as well as strong business investment  Growth in business investment in equipment was raised to a 10 4 percent pace  the fastest in three years  from the previously reported 8 6 percent rate  Businesses also increased spending on software  But investment in nonresidential structures fell at a 6 8 percent pace in the third quarter  the biggest drop since the fourth quarter of 2015  instead of the previously estimated 5 2 percent rate  That is largely because of a slowdown in spending on mining exploration  wells and shafts   
Growth in government spending was raised to a 0 4 percent rate  Government outlays were previously reported to have declined at a 0 1 percent pace in the third quarter  Government spending had contracted for two consecutive quarters ",2017-11-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/us-thirdquarter-economic-growth-raised-to-33-percent-927266,927266

 We think that Congress in the end is going to have to do more to get to a solution   Quaadman added ",2017-11-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/big-us-banks-in-lastditch-push-on-regulatory-relief-bill-937092,937092

126067,347582,PNC,PNC Financial Services  PNC  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects PNC Financial Services  PNC  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 12  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This regional bank operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 59 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 6  
Revenues are expected to be  4 25 billion  up 3 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 22  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PNC Financial Services 
For PNC Financial Services  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 67  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PNC Financial Services will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that PNC Financial Services would post earnings of  2 77 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 75  delivering a surprise of  0 72  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

126071,347586,PNC,Bank activities  not size  a better guide for systemic risk  U S  analysts,news,By Pete Schroeder WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Congress and regulators should consider changing how they decide which large banks pose the greatest risk to the financial system  focusing more on how a bank acts than how many assets they hold  the U S  government s monitor of financial risk said on Thursday   In a new report  the Office of Financial Research  OFR  charged with monitoring for potential risks that could lead to another major crisis  argues the federal government needs to consider a new approach to regulating banks that focuses on a range of activities rather than the current policy of applying increasingly stricter rules to banks according to their size   The activities approach would more precisely ensure that regulators are closely watching smaller banks whose failures could still threaten the financial system  while easing the compliance burden on banks that may be large  but simpler  the agency said   A multifactor approach is superior to considering asset size alone to assess a bank s systemic importance   said OFR Director Richard Berner in a blog post on the agency s website   The correlation between size and risk is weaker for smaller companies   If the approach presented by the research agency were adopted by Congress and regulators  it could prove a boon to large banks with more conservative portfolios  like U S  Bancorp  N USB  and PNC Financal Services  N PNC   which would be considered less systemic and may perhaps enjoy looser rules  But smaller  more complex banks like Bank of New York Mellon Corp  N BK  and  State Street  Corp  N STT  would climb the rankings of systemically risky firms under the new approach  The 18 page OFR report comes as lawmakers are currently considering whether to alter the existing  50 billion asset threshold for  systemically important financial institutions    That level  established as part of the 2010 Dodd Frank financial reform law  subjects banks to a host of stricter rules  including annual stress testing and a requirement to submit  living wills  detailing how they could be dissolved  Congress is currently mulling a change to that threshold  either by raising the level of the asset threshold or adopting an activities based test  Negotiations are under way among key members of the U S  Senate Banking Committee  But it is not yet clear if any of those changes have the political support to become law  as part of a broader package of tweaks to existing financial rules ,2017-10-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bank-activities-not-size-a-better-guide-for-systemic-risk-us-analysts-548739,548739

126091,347606,PNC,Modest rise in U S  consumer prices may delay Fed rate hike,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  consumer prices rose slightly in July as higher food costs were partly offset by falling prices for a range of other goods  suggesting benign inflation that could persuade a cautious Federal Reserve to delay raising interest rates until December 
But with the labor market near full employment and economic growth accelerating  analysts expect the U S  central bank will announce a plan to start unwinding its massive bond portfolio at its policy meeting next month 
 We believe the Fed will focus on the balance sheet in September  foregoing another rate hike until December   said James Bohnaker  an economist at IHS Markit in Lexington  Massachusetts   The inflation outlook will not change drastically anytime soon  
The Labor Department said on Friday its Consumer Price Index edged up 0 1 percent last month after being unchanged in June  That lifted the year on year increase in the CPI to 1 7 percent from 1 6 percent in June 
Economists had forecast the CPI rising 0 2 percent in July and climbing 1 8 percent year on year 
Stripping out the volatile food and energy components  consumer prices gained 0 1 percent for the fourth straight month  The so called core CPI rose 1 7 percent in the 12 months through July and has now increased by that margin for three consecutive months 
Despite the modest gain in consumer prices  which came on the heels of a drop in producer prices in July  many economists continue to share the Fed s conviction that transitory factors were holding back inflation 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers last month that  some special factors   including prices for mobile phone plans and prescription drugs  were partly responsible for the low inflation readings  Mobile phone prices continued to decline in July  falling 0 3 percent 
Prices of U S  government debt initially rose on the inflation data  but pared gains after Russian Foreign Minster Sergei Lavrov said there was a Russian Chinese plan to defuse tensions between the United States and North Korea 
The dollar  DXY  was trading lower against a basket of currencies  while U S  stocks rose 
FED S CONUNDRUM
The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks a measure that has been stuck at 1 5 percent since May 
Inflation remains tame despite a tightening labor market  a conundrum for the central bank as it contemplates tightening monetary policy further 
The Fed is expected to outline a program to start offloading its  4 2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities at its Sept  19 20 policy meeting 
It is expected to raise interest rates in December  though such a move would depend on future inflation data  The Fed has raised borrowing costs twice this year 
 One time factors that have slowed inflation will gradually dissipate   said Gus Faucher  chief economist at PNC Financial  NYSE PNC  Services in Pittsburgh   Stronger wage growth as businesses compete for scarce workers will also contribute to higher inflation in the second half of this year and in 2018  
Food prices rose 0 2 percent last month  driven by a surge in the cost of meat  fish  eggs  fruits and vegetables  Food prices were unchanged in June  The cost of food consumed at home increased 0 2 percent 
Consumers also paid more for prescription drugs  whose prices jumped 1 3 percent after increasing 1 0 percent in June  Prices for apparel rose 0 3 percent after four straight monthly declines  While gasoline prices were unchanged after tumbling 2 8 percent in June  electricity prices rose 0 4 percent 
Rental costs maintained their upward trend last month  Owners  equivalent rent of primary residence rose 0 3 percent after advancing by the same margin in June 
The cost of new motor vehicles fell 0 5 percent  the biggest drop since August 2009 and the sixth consecutive monthly decline  amid slumping demand 
Low inflation is a relief for many Americans who have seen their paychecks barely increase in recent years  In another report  the Labor Department said inflation adjusted average hourly earnings increased 0 7 percent in the 12 months through July  slowing from June s 0 9 percent gain 

 The Fed may want inflation to pick up  but that would not be good news to households   said Joel Naroff  chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland  Pennsylvania   The only way spending power has increased at all is that inflation has remained below the Fed s target rate  ",2017-08-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/us-consumer-prices-rise-less-than-expected-in-july-517613,517613

quarter  notching its quickest pace in more than two years  and there are signs that the momentum was sustained at the start of the third quarter   Gross domestic product increased at a 3 0 percent annual rate in the April June period  the Commerce Department said in its second estimate on Wednesday  The upward revision from the 2 6 percent pace reported last month reflected robust consumer spending as well as strong business investment  Growth last quarter was the best since the first quarter of 2015 and followed a 1 2 percent pace in the January March period  Economists had expected that second quarter GDP growth would be raised to a 2 7 percent rate  Retail sales and business spending data so far suggest the economy maintained its stamina early in the third quarter  Economists saw a limited impact on growth from Hurricane Harvey  which devastated parts of Texas   The impact on the national economy will be minor   said Gus Faucher  chief economist at PNC Financial  NYSE PNC  Services in Pittsburgh   While some output will be lost in the wake of the storm  most of the difference will be made up in the months ahead   Growth estimates for the third quarter are as high as a 3

economy grew 2 1 percent in the first half of 2017  While that was up from the 1 9 percent reported last month  economists said it was unlikely growth this year would breach Republican President Donald Trump s ambitious 3 0 percent target   Underlying domestic demand in the economy is consistent with near three percent growth but the supply side of the economy is not capable of delivering such a pace of growth at this point   said John Ryding  chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York   The Trump administration is targeting tax cuts  deregulation and infrastructure spending to boost growth  However  it has so far failed to pass any economic legislation and is yet to articulate plans for tax reform and infrastructure   Chances are slim that the Republican controlled U S  Congress will debate and pass tax reform legislation before the end of the year  Touting the second quarter growth pace  Trump said on Wednesday he was ready to work with Congress on tax reform   This is our once in a generation opportunity to deliver real tax reform for everyday hard working Americans and I am fully committed to work with Congress to get this job done and I don t want to be disappointed

SPENDING  Consumer spending  which makes up more than two thirds of the U S  economy  grew at a 3 3 percent rate  the fastest in a year  reflecting more spending on motor vehicles  cellphones  housing and utilities than previously estimated  That was revised up from the 2 8 percent pace reported in July and accounted for the bulk of the pickup in economic growth in the second quarter  But stronger consumer spending came at the expense of saving amid sluggish wage gains  The saving rate slipped to 3 7 percent from 3 9 percent in the first quarter  The second quarter saving rate was previously reported at 3 8 percent   Households cannot  however  continue to rely on savings indefinitely to fund their consumption  This raises doubts on the sustainability of the robust pace of consumer

126095,347610,PNC,Bank of Canada leapfrogs Fed  other central banks on rate hikes,news,"By Andrea Hopkins
OTTAWA  Reuters    The Bank of Canada struck a more confident approach to growth on Wednesday with its second rate hike in three months  pushing to the front of the pack of major central banks including the U S  Federal Reserve 
After years of economic pain in Canada induced by slumping commodity prices  the surprise move has flipped policy divergence on its head  Just months ago  Canada lagged the U S  economic recovery and looked like it would never keep up with the Fed s tightening cycle 
The Canadian dollar jumped more than 2 percent to a two year high against the greenback as the bank decided to raise rates now instead of waiting until October as expected  and as policymakers struck a more hawkish tone   L2N1LN0Z1 
The Fed is the only other major central bank in the world to raise rates this year  The Bank of Canada has distinguished itself as the only central bank willing to raise borrowing costs before inflation has even reared its head  said Shaun Osborne  chief FX strategist at Scotiabank 
 The bank s confidence in its perception of the outlook is in stark contrast to the challenges other central banks are facing with regards to policymaking   Osborne said 
All major global central banks slashed interest rates and several turned to alternative methods to stimulate their economies in the wake of the global financial crisis in 2007 2009  Few have found their way back to more normal levels of borrowing costs 
The Fed began raising rates in 2015  when Canada was cutting rates to counter a drop in oil prices  Now  Fed officials are getting more dovish in the face of weak U S  inflation data  reducing the likelihood of a third rate hike this year   L2N1LM1K2 
Across the Atlantic  the European Central Bank has indicated caution about withdrawing from its asset purchase program and the Bank of England is battling sluggish growth and Brexit risks  On the other side of the world  the Reserve Bank of Australia has said its stimulatory policy remains appropriate 
Canada s economy will pay a price for the rush to raise rates ahead of the pack  The lift to the Canadian dollar will make exports more expensive in the United States  the country s largest market 
 If Canada were to get far out ahead of the Fed in raising rates  that would fuel additional appreciation of the Canadian dollar and that would create new headwinds for non commodity exports   said Bill Adams  senior international economist at PNC Financial  NYSE PNC  in Pittsburgh 
The come from behind economic recovery in Canada may be partly chalked up to fiscal stimulus more easily achieved in Ottawa than in gridlocked Washington  as well as the willingness of banks to lend  said Mark Chandler  head of Canadian fixed income and currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets 
Canada also typically benefits in the later stages of a global economic recovery  as industrial production revives in other countries  spurring demand for Canada s natural resources and putting a floor under commodity prices 
 All those are good developments for a small open trading economy   said Chandler   Typically that would be Canada s role   late in the game  we are out ahead of the pack  ",2017-09-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/bank-of-canada-leapfrogs-fed-other-central-banks-on-rate-hikes-526157,526157

Our Take
BB T remains well positioned for revenue growth through strategic acquisitions  Furthermore  anticipated growth in loans  along with an improving rate scenario  is likely to propel its organic growth in the quarters ahead 
Nevertheless  such acquisitions are likely to escalate costs  which  in turn  may dampen its profitability  The company s significant exposure to risky loans also remains a concern BB T Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

126105,347620,PNC,Why PNC Financial Services  PNC  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
PNC Financial Services in Focus
Headquartered in Pittsburgh  PNC Financial Services  PNC  is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 4 98  so far this year  The regional bank operator is paying out a dividend of  0 95 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 3 1  compared to the Banks   Major Regional industry s yield of 2 9  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 97  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  3 80 is up 11 8  from last year  PNC Financial Services has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 15 64   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  PNC Financial Services s current payout ratio is 35   This means it paid out 35  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for PNC for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  11 33 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 5 79  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  PNC is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-02-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-pnc-financial-services-pnc-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200383216,200383216

This regional bank operator has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 4 36  
For the most recent quarter  PNC Financial Services was expected to post earnings of  2 73 per share  but it reported  2 82 per share instead  representing a surprise of 3 30   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  2 58 per share  while it actually produced  2 72 per share  a surprise of 5 43  
Price and EPS Surprise

For PNC Financial Services  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
PNC Financial Services currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 07   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 16  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-12-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-pnc-financial-services-pnc-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200370262,200370262

The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 16  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 19  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PNC Financial Services 
For PNC Financial Services  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 11  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PNC Financial Services will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that PNC Financial Services would post earnings of  2 73 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 82  delivering a surprise of  3 30  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
PNC Financial Services doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pnc-financial-services-pnc-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200374053,200374053
126128,347643,PNC,Are You Looking For A High Growth Dividend Stock  PNC Financial Services  PNC  Could Be A Great Choice,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
PNC Financial Services in Focus
Based in Pittsburgh  PNC Financial Services  PNC  is in the Finance sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 3 68   Currently paying a dividend of  0 95 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 3 14   In comparison  the Banks   Major Regional industry s yield is 3 17   while the S P 500 s yield is 2 01  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  3 80 is up 11 8  from last year  Over the last 5 years  PNC Financial Services has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 15 64   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  PNC Financial Services s current payout ratio is 37   meaning it paid out 37  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
PNC is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  11 34 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 5 88  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  PNC is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-pnc-financial-services-pnc-could-be-a-great-choice-200376611,200376611

BlackRock published a recent research piece making the case for the Financial sector  and given that clients remain overweight  we would agree  Note Chart 2 and Chart 4   Love BlackRock s research

The Financial sector is still working off the post 2008 restrictions and handcuffs the government and the regulators put on the sector  In the  fighting the last war  mentality  clients still ask me if the relaxed regulation under the current President and Congress might mean another 2008 is around the corner  but my opinion is that we are a long way from something like that happening again  The leverage within the Financial sector not to mention the stronger capital positions should help the sector tremendously 
Here is a quick summary of what is expected from the banks reporting Friday morning  October 12th  2018 
JP Morgan  NYSE JPM    2 26 in EPS and  27 6 bl in revenue for expected y y growth of 27  and 9  respectively  9  y y revenue growth for a bank the size of JPM is pretty nice  Loan growth will be a focus and since JPM is the first big bank to report  looking at capital market activity will give readers good insights into the other brokerage and larger banks results   Long JPM for clients  top 10 holding  
Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC    1 17 in EPS expected on  21 7 bl in revenue for expected y y growth of 15  in EPS on an expected 2    3  drop in revenue  Wells is still fighting the damage to the brand on the extra accounts and what is a never ending onslaught of headlines about Wells  internal controls and internal culture of generating new business   Clients are long the stock through the XLF  
Citi  NYSE C    1 65 in EPS expected om  18 5 bl in revenue for expected y y growth of 29  and 4  respectively  Citi is one of the most oft cited names by the larger firm strategists in terms of its valuation since the stock continues to trade at 1x book value and just a smidge above tangible book value  TBV    Clients are long Citi through the XLF  
PNC Financial Services Group Inc  NYSE PNC   PNC is expected to earn  2 72 on  4 3 billion for expected y y growth of 30  and 6  respectively  Never owned or followed the stock   bank 
Summary   conclusion  The long lasting impact of Dodd Frank and the post 2008 regulation on the banking system was to reduce leverage and force banks to hold more capital  That is was a long term drag on the sector s returns  While the current Administration and Congress have loosened the constraints a little bit  I don t think the sector is anywhere close to revisiting the Perfect Storm that hit in 2007 2008  That being said  the Financial sector is a credit and capital conduit for the US economy in general  so when there are excesses in the US economy  they are likely to occur within the Financial system as well 
The loosening of CCAR  Comprehensive Capital Analysis   Review  will let banks increase dividends  repurchase shares and in general manage capital more effectively for shareholders  Financials are sufficiently capitalized to be able to absorb credit shocks for now  but we don t want to move too far away from the lessons learned in 2008

The whole sector saw a bid this week with yield curve steepening only slightly  so even a modest rise in longer term Treasury yields seems to put a bid under the stocks  However  widening net interest margins  NIM s  will likely be offset by slowing mortgage banking and mortgage   housing business as the rise in the 10 year Treasury yield to the highest yield in over 7 years will likely put a damper on housing  if only temporarily

126156,347671,PNC,What Thanksgiving Cranberries And Bitcoin Have In Common,opinion,"Football is as much a part of Thanksgiving as turkey and family are  and nearly as old as the holiday itself  It was President Abraham Lincoln who proclaimed Thanksgiving a national holiday in 1863  saying that he hoped all Americans would carve out some time to bless the  widows  orphans  mourners or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged  
In 1876  a little more than a decade after the end of that  civil strife   students from Yale and Princeton met in Hoboken  New Jersey  to play what is believed to be the first football game held on Thanksgiving Day  Yale ended up besting its fellow Ivy League competitor  two  goals  to zero 
At the time   football  still more closely resembled rugby than the sport we enjoy today  But a tradition was born  On subsequent Thanksgivings  the Yale Princeton matchups generated so much cash in ticket sales that they funded the two universities  athletic programs for the rest of the year 
The model was such a success that the National Football League  NFL  made sure to carry on the tradition upon its founding in 1920  Professional football has been played on Turkey Day ever since  except for those in the years from 1941 to 1945 
The Cost of Thanksgiving Just Came Down for the Third Straight Year For most families  football comes second to the real Thanksgiving pastime eating  But unlike ticket prices for an NFL game  which have gone up about 50 percent in the past 10 years  the cost of enjoying a Thanksgiving meal got slightly cheaper in 2018 
According to the American Farm Bureau Federation  AFBF   the cost of a typical Turkey Day feast for 10 people deflated about  0 22 from last year to  48 90  That s the third straight year of declines  and the lowest level since 2010 
More affordable energy and an oversupply in the turkey market contributed to lower food prices  as did the trade dispute between the U S  and China  You would think that tariffs on Chinese products would raise prices  but as the Wall Street Journal explains   China s retaliatory moves are having the opposite effect  
 Tariffs on U S  agricultural products have dampened Chinese demand  boosting supplies of some staples of the Thanksgiving table   writes the WSJ s Justin Lahart  Because of the supply glut  cranberry growers in particular have seen prices fall below the cost of production  estimated at  35 per barrel which is bad for the farmers  obviously  but good for American consumers  As much as 25 percent of the U S  supply of cranberries had to be dumped this season in order to support prices 
But Christmas Continues To See Inflation
Cranberries are one thing  a partridge in a pear tree is another 
Every year for the past 35 years  PNC Financial  NYSE PNC  Services has priced out all the items listed in the holiday song  The 12 Days of Christmas   The cost of all 364 gifts  from turtle doves to pipers piping  rose 1 2 percent this year to  39 094 93  That s almost double what the same items cost back in 1984 
Interestingly  just as the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics excludes food and energy from its  core  consumer price index  CPI  because they tend to be more volatile than the other items  PNC excludes the price of swans from its Christmas index for the very same reason 
The gift that rose the most from Christmas 2017 was the six geese a laying  They ll set you back  390 this year  8 3 percent more than last year 
The gift that fell the most  meanwhile  was the five gold rings  They cost  750  down 9 1 percent from  825 in 2017  That s good news for jewelers such as newcomer Men   which prices its merchandise based on the gold and platinum weight value 
Bitcoin Miners Await A Recovery In Prices
Like the cranberry growers  many bitcoin miners are choosing to limit supply as prices right now are lower than operating costs  Bitcoin fell below  5 000 last Saturday  then below  4 000 on Saturday  These are levels we haven t seen in over a year  The average cost of mining a single bitcoin  meanwhile  is estimated to be between  6 000 and  7 000  meaning miners are operating at a loss 
The global bitcoin hash rate  therefore  is rolling over as smaller miners shut down rigs and await a recovery in prices  The hash rate  which measures how much power the bitcoin network is consuming  is now at August levels  It s worth pointing out  though  that the rate is still up sharply this year  even as the world s largest cryptocurrency has struggled to find the momentum that carried it to nearly  20 000 last December This should be good news for the bigger players in the industry  most notably HIVE Blockchain Technologies  since they ll control a larger share of the market 
Vancouver based HIVE  the first publicly listed blockchain infrastructure company  is a pure play blockchain and Ethereum investment for the capital markets  As such  many investors trade HIVE as an easy proxy for those digital coins  In the chart above  you can see that its share price shares a very strong correlation with both bitcoin and Ethereum  For 2018  HIVE had a correlation coefficient of 0 92 with those two coins  A correlation of 1 0 would mean that the two assets trade perfectly in sync  When cryptocurrencies begin to recovery  then  it seems logical to expect that HIVE would follow suit ",2018-11-26,Frank Holmes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-thanksgiving-cranberries-and-bitcoin-have-in-common-200362384,200362384

126164,347679,PNC,Strong U S  job growth  rising wages set stage for Fed rate hike,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  employers hired workers at a robust pace in February  beating expectations  and wages grinded higher  which could give the Federal Reserve the green light to raise interest rates next week despite slowing economic growth  Nonfarm payrolls increased by 235 000 jobs last month as the construction sector recorded its largest gain in nearly 10 years due to unseasonably warm weather  the Labor Department said on Friday  January s employment gains were revised up to 238 000 from the previously reported 227 000  Fed Chair Janet Yellen signaled last week that the U S  central bank would likely hike rates at its March 14 15 policy meeting  Job gains averaged 209 000 per month over the past three months  well above the 75 000 to 100 000 needed to keep up with growth in the working age population   The report seals the deal for a rate hike next week  The labor market is where the Fed wants it to be   said Gus Faucher  deputy chief economist at PNC Financial  NYSE PNC  in Pittsburgh  Last month s brisk clip of hiring was accompanied by steady wage growth  with average hourly earnings rising 6 cents  or 0 2 percent  January s wage growth was revised up to 0 2 percent from the previous 0 1 percent gain  That lifted the year on year increase in wages to 2 8 percent from 2 6 percent in January  The unemployment rate fell one tenth of a percentage point to 4 7 percent  even as more people rushed into the labor market  encouraged by the hiring spree  Economists had forecast employment increasing by 190 000 jobs last month  U S  stocks rose  but gains were curbed by the prospect of higher borrowing costs   The dollar  DXY  fell against a basket of currencies amid disappointment that wages were only growing gradually  The greenback was also hurt by news that the European Central Bank had discussed the possibility of raising interest rates before the end of its quantitative easing program  Prices for U S  government bonds rose  with the yield on the benchmark 10 year Treasury note retreating from a 12 week high   With the labor market near full employment  wage growth could speed up as companies are forced to raise compensation to retain employees and attract skilled workers  A proxy for take home pay rose a solid 0 5 percent in February   The annual wage increase is close to the 3 percent to 3 5 percent range that economists say is needed to lift inflation to the Fed s 2 percent target  Inflation is already firming  in part as commodity prices rise  Rising inflation  together with a tighter labor market  stock market boom and strengthening global economy  has left some economists expecting that the Fed could increase rates much faster than currently anticipated by financial markets  The U S  central bank lifted its benchmark overnight rate in December and has forecast three rate increases for 2017  PARTICIPATION RATE UP  We continue to expect the Fed to raise its policy rate by an above consensus four times this year   said Paul Ashworth  chief U S  economist at Capital Economics in Toronto   Job growth has averaged more than 186 000 per month since January 2010  While Donald Trump s victory in last November s presidential election sparked a stock market rally and jumps in consumer and business confidence  there has been no surge in either business or consumer spending  Data ranging from trade to consumer and business spending suggest the economy slowed further early in the first quarter after growing at a 1 9 percent annualized rate in the final three months of 2016  The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product growing at a 1 2 percent rate this quarter   It s important to remember that President Trump inherited an economy that was already making steady progress towards full employment   said Elise Gould  a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington  The labor force participation rate  or the share ofworking age Americans who are employed or at least looking for ajob  increased one tenth of a percentage point to 63 percent in February  the highest level since March 2016   The employment to population ratio rose to an eight year high of 60 percent from 59 9 percent in January   A broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment fell two tenths of a percentage point to 9 2 percent last month  All sectors of the economy  with the exception of retail and utilities  expanded payrolls in February  Manufacturing employment increased 28 000  the largest gain since August 2013  as rising oil prices fueled demand for machinery   Construction payrolls surged 58 000  the biggest increase since March 2007  as warmer weather pulled forward hiring at building and civil engineering sites  The mining sector added 7 700 jobs last month  led by oil field hiring  Mining employment has risen by 20 000 jobs since October   Retail sector employment fell 26 000  the biggest decline since December 2012  after a gain of 39 900 jobs in January  Retailers including J C  Penney Co Inc  N JCP  and Macy s Inc  N M  have announced thousands of layoffs as they shift toward online sales and scale back on brick and mortar operations   Utilities shed 1 000 jobs last month because of the milder weather  Government payrolls increased by 8 000 jobs  with federal employment rising 2 300 despite a freeze on

126165,347680,PNC,U S  retail sales weakest in six months  inflation firming,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  retail sales recorded their smallest gain in six months in February amid delays in tax refunds  but the biggest rise in the annual inflation rate in nearly five years pointed to rising price pressures that could support further interest rate hikes  The marginal increase in retail sales reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday was the latest sign the economy lost further momentum in the first quarter  Firming inflation and a tight labor market encouraged the Federal Reserve to raise rates on Wednesday for the second time in three months   Should inflation continue to firm and consumer spending remain solid  we expect the Fed will hike again in June  and at least three times this year   said Michael Hanson  chief economist at TD Securities in New York  The Commerce Department said retail sales edged up 0 1 percent last month  the weakest reading since August  amid declines in purchases of automobiles and discretionary spending  January s retail sales were  however  revised up to show a 0 6 percent rise instead of the previously reported 0 4 percent advance  That left retail sales rising 5 7 percent in 12 months through February  underscoring the strength in domestic demand  Excluding automobiles  gasoline  building materials and food services  retail sales rose 0 1 percent after an upwardly revised 0 8 percent jump in January  These so called core retail sales  which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product  were previously reported to have increased 0 4 percent in January  The government delayed the issuing of tax refunds this year as part of efforts to combat fraud    The later than usual processing of income tax refunds may have hampered consumer spending  However  the IRS has now caught up to last year s pace  and so spending could get a bump up in March   said Gus Faucher  deputy chief economist at PNC Financial  NYSE PNC  in Pittsburgh  Tightening labor market conditions  which are steadily lifting wages  continue to underpin consumer spending  Even with retail sales softening in February  domestic demand remains strong enough to generate more inflation in the economy  In a separate report  the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index ticked up 0 1 percent last month as a drop in gasoline prices offset increases in the cost of food and rental accommodation  That was the weakest reading in the CPI since July and followed a 0 6 percent jump in January   In the 12 months through February  the CPI accelerated 2 7 percent  the biggest year on year gain since March 2012  The CPI rose 2 5 percent in the year to January  Inflation is firming in part as the 2015 drop  which was driven by lower oil prices  fades from the calculation   The so called core CPI  which strips out food and energy costs  increased 0 2 percent last month as new motor vehicle prices fell and apparel prices moderated after spiking in January  The core CPI increased 0 3 percent in January  In the 12 months through February  the core CPI increased 2 2 percent after advancing 2 3 percent in January  It was the 15th straight month the year on year core CPI remained in the 2 1 percent to 2 3 percent range  SLOWING GROWTH The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1 7 percent  The U S  central bank raised its overnight benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 0 75 percent to 1 00 percent  The Fed s policy setting committee  however  did not flag any plan to accelerate the pace of monetary tightening this year  with officials sticking to their outlook for two more rate hikes  The Fed lifted rates once in 2016   The dollar fell to a two week low against a basket of currencies  while prices for U S  Treasuries rallied  Stocks on Wall Street rose to session highs  February s retail sales added to January s weak reports on trade  construction and business spending in suggesting sluggish economic growth in the first quarter  The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP rising at a 0 9 percent annualized rate in the first quarter   With the labor market near full employment  slowing growth probably understates the health of the economy and GDP tends to be weaker in the first quarter because of calculation issues that the government has acknowledged and is working to resolve  In February  motor vehicle sales fell 0 2 percent and receipts at service stations slipped 0 6 percent  reflecting lower gasoline prices  Americans also cut back on dining out and spent less on hobbies and sporting goods   Sales at electronics and appliances recorded their biggest decline since December 2011  Sales at clothing stores saw their largest drop in nearly a year  Retailers including J C  Penney Co Inc  N JCP   Abercrombie   Fitch  N ANF  and Macy s Inc  N M  are scaling back on brick and mortar

Though large cap index S P 500 started 2018 on a better footing than the Russell 2000  the game started changing from mid March  President Trump s protections agenda and the resultant trade war fears started weighing on large cap stocks that have a considerable international exposure  And the domestically focused pint sized stocks soared 
Since mid March  there was no looking back for the Russell 2000 index  having outperformed its mid  Russell Midcap index  and large cap  Russell 1000 index  counterparts for the third straight month through May  read    
Apart from its insulation from trade tensions  a fast growing U S  economy  compared with several other developed countries   a stronger greenback  a hawkish Fed  upbeat earnings and geopolitical tensions have favored the segment  read    
The tax reform is yet another tailwind to the segment as it is supposed to favor small caps more  This is because companies in the Russell 2000 pay a higher median effective tax rate than the S P 500  per Thomson Reuters  Now the question that arises is how long the rally will continue  read    
Will the Rally Continue  
The question is coming because many of the tailwinds have been priced in at the current level  The co chief investment strategist of PNC Financial  NYSE PNC   on the small caps  record run  After such a strong rally  profit booking activity is also in the cards  Moreover  there is a glitch in the new tax law that can act as a deterrent to small cap stocks 
There is a provision in the tax law that calls for limiting deductions to 30  of EBITDA  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization  for four years  and 30  of 12 month EBIT   Previously  the law entailed the full deduction of interest paid 
Per  on thestreet com  many small cap stocks are debt reliant for their survival and lack cash  particularly the biotechs  Plus  interests should perk up next year given the Fed policy tightening and Trump bump  The double whammy of reduced interest deductibility and higher bond yields may actually weigh on small cap stocks  read

126180,347695,PNC,Bank ETFs Set To Explode Higher On Fed s Hawkish View,opinion,As expected  the Fed has raised interest rates for the second time this year by 25 bps to 1 75 2   This also marks the seventh rate hike since December 2015  The central bank signaled a hawkish outlook tweaking its language for economic growth to  rising at a solid rate  from  moderate  provided in May  read    It also dropped its word  stayed low  for unemployment and  moderated  for household spending  The Fed now believes that the unemployment rate has  declined  and household spending  has picked up   All these indicate two more lift offs that would translate into four total increases in 2018   The Fed Chair  Jerome Powell  stated that the economy had strengthened significantly since the 2008 financial crisis and is approaching a  normal  level that could allow the Fed to soon step back and play less of a hands on role in encouraging economic activity  This reflects optimism about the health of the economy and a faster than expected rates hike that would shoot up the borrowing cost for cars  home mortgages and credit cards over the next year  read    The Fed also raised its forecast for GDP growth to 2 8  for this year compared with the previous expectation of 2 7  and lowered the expectation for unemployment rate to 3 6  from 3 8   Additionally  inflation forecast rose to 2 1  for this year through 2021 Coming to unwinding of the balance sheet  the Fed will increase the monthly cap of its  4 4 trillion balance sheet shrinkage by  beginning in July  bringing the total monthly reduction of its balance sheet to  40 billion from  30 billion as of June  This move will continue to push long term rates higher A Boon for BanksA rising rate environment is highly beneficial for cyclical sectors like financial  technology industrials and consumer discretionary but banks are in the most advantageous position  This is because they seek to borrow money at short term rates and lend at long term rates  With the steep rise in long term interest rates  banks would be able to earn more on lending and pay less on deposits  This would expand net margins and bolster banks  profits

126183,347698,PNC,Earnings Watch  PNC Looks Good,opinion,"PNC Financial Services Group  NYSE PNC   one of America s top ten banks  is set to report this Friday  July 13  Estimize predicts that both the earnings per share  EPS  and the revenue for the bank this quarter will go up  This is a good sign for PNC  especially since last month the EPS increased  but the revenue decreased by  149 million  Over the past two years  the EPS of PNC has steadily increased  so this current increase is not an outlier  Furthermore  this increase indicates a trend of stable  consistent  and strong banking practices backed by no substantial shocks to the market in general 

Unlike EPS  PNC s revenue did not show a constant increase every quarter  Last quarter marks the only steep decline in PNC revenue in the past two years  Every other quarter has shown growth  Despite the hump  Estimize predicts that PNC will bounce back this quarter with an increase of  159 million over the previous quarter 

There are a couple reasons why these predictions are so high  The first is that the general US economy is doing well  US Real GDP increased by 2 3  last quarter  QoQ   and the unemployment rate is at a low 4   On top of that  PNC has just raised its common stock dividend to 95 cents share from a lower 75 cents share  PNC chairman William S  Demchak remarks   The significant increase to our dividend is a result of PNC s consistent performance  strong capital levels and our board s confidence in our business model as a Main Street bank   With no signs of significant problems presently  despite a decline in revenue last quarter   as well as an optimistic increase in common stock dividends  PNC stands poised for a healthy future

126184,347699,PNC,Yen Retreat In Full Swing,opinion,"Here are the latest developments in global markets 

FOREX  The US dollar index is up by almost 0 1  on Friday  building on the gains it posted in the previous session  The yen  meanwhile  is losing ground against all its major counterparts amid an absence of any worrisome news on the trade front  touching a fresh six month low against the dollar 
STOCKS US markets closed higher on Thursday  buoyed by the absence of an immediate retaliation from China against the latest US tariff salvo  as well as comments from Treasury Secretary Mnuchin highlighting willingness for negotiations  The tech heavy Nasdaq Composite soared by 1 39   posting a new all time high  while the Dow Jones and S P 500 advanced by 0 91  and 0 87  respectively  Note the S P touched its highest level since early February  The positive sentiment seems to have lingered  as futures tracking the S P  Dow  and Nasdaq 100 are all pointing to a higher open today  Asia was a sea of green as well  with Japan s Nikkei 225 and Topix surging by 1 81  and 1 19  correspondingly  buoyed by yen weakness as well  In Hong Kong  the Hang Seng rose by 0 22   Europe looks set to follow suit  as futures suggest all major indices are due to open much higher 
COMMODITIES  Oil prices continued to struggle  remaining close to their lows for the week amid concerns of Libyan output returning to the market soon  as supply disruptions appear to have been resolved  WTI is up today  albeit by less than 0 05   while Brent is down by 0 53   In precious metals  gold is down marginally   0 06    currently trading near the  1 245 per ounce mark  not far above its lows for the year  Buyers remain in short supply  with a lack of any worrisome news on the geopolitical front combined with a broadly strong US dollar  curbing demand for the yellow metal 


Major movers  Markets cheer lack of escalation in trade standoff  yen retreat in full swingRisk appetite remained firm on Thursday  with concerns regarding trade tensions taking a back seat as China refrained from retaliating to the  200bn tariffs the US threatened earlier in the week  Playing into the narrative that things are calming down  US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin told lawmakers in Congress yesterday that he is  available  for negotiations with China  reviving hopes that the situation may be finally resolved through a deal 
US stock markets closed notably higher  with the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite reaching a fresh record high  while most Asian indices also advanced on Friday  Meanwhile  the Japanese yen  which has so far acted as a barometer for trade tensions  continued its recent plunge as investors rotated out of safer assets and into riskier ones  Dollar yen touched a fresh six month high of 112 75  with the yen also posting a two month low against the euro  Focus now shifts to whether the two sides will head back to the negotiating table  something that seems probable considering recent remarks from Chinese officials suggesting they would be open to talks 
The dollar was marching higher early on Thursday but gave back most of its gains following the US CPI data for June  to close the day more or less unchanged against most of its major peers   though it advanced notably versus the yen  While both the headline and the core CPI rates were in line with annual estimates  it seems markets expected something better following the strong PPI prints earlier  hence triggering a knee jerk reaction lower in the dollar on the news 
In the UK  the pound reacted little to the release of the detailed 100 page Brexit plan by Theresa May s administration  As advertised  the plan seeks frictionless access to the single market for goods  but not for services  it repeatedly highlighted service firms would probably have less access to the EU market than they do now  All in all  this plan is unlikely to be accepted by the EU in its current form  which implies that further negotiations  and potentially concessions  may lie ahead  Pound dollar is down by 0 3  today though  following some comments overnight from US President Trump that PM May s latest Brexit plan  will probably kill  a future trade deal with the US 
Day ahead  University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey due  Trump s UK visit also eyedFriday s calendar is rather light  with the most important release being the University of Michigan s survey on US consumer sentiment  In the meantime  Trump s visit in the UK will also be monitored for any market sensitive comments 
At 1230 GMT  data on June s import and export prices will be made public out of the US  while the University of Michigan s preliminary survey gauging consumer morale during July is due at 1400 GMT   the relevant index is anticipated to weaken  though not to a significant extent  Beyond the headline number out of the U of M s survey  other information  such as the sub indexes gauging inflation expectations  will also be attracting interest 
On the trade front  worries appear to have eased a bit after China did not opt to retaliate to threatened US tariff increases on its products  However  things remain fluid and a tit for tat response by China cannot be ruled out 
In terms of policymakers  appearances  Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee member Jon Cunliffe will be giving a speech at 1100 GMT  while Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic  voting FOMC member in 2018  will be participating in a discussion at 1430 GMT  Meanwhile  US President Donald Trump is in the UK  where political uncertainty is on the rise on the back of disagreements within the Conservative party over Brexit  It is also noteworthy that Trump warned PM Theresa May that her Brexit proposal could  kill  any future trade deal with the US Also of interest  especially in light of ongoing NAFTA negotiations  is a visit to Mexico by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  he will be meeting officials  as well as president elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador 
In equities  JPMorgan Chase  NYSE NYSE JPM   Citigroup  NYSE NYSE C   Well Fargo and PNC Financial Services Group  NYSE NYSE PNC  are notable names releasing quarterly earnings today  their results will be made public before Wall Street s opening bell 
In energy markets  the Baker Hughes count of US active oil rigs is due at 1700 GMT 
Technical Analysis  USD JPY touches 6 month high  looks overboughtUSD JPY has risen to a six month high of 112 76 earlier on Friday  while it is currently trading not far below this zenith  The positively aligned Tenkan  and Kijun sen lines are projecting a bullish picture in the short term  though the flattening Kijun sen may constitute an early sign of easing positive momentum  Moreover  the Chikou Span is signaling an overbought market  the implication being that a near term reversal is not to be ruled out 
Abating risks over global trade may push the pair higher  with resistance potentially taking place around the 113 round figure 
On the downside and in case of rising trade tensions that divert safe haven flows into the yen  support could come around the current level of the Tenkan sen at 112 33  before the attention next turns to the 112 handle 
Some movement in USD JPY may occur upon the release of the University of Michigan s survey as well ",2018-07-13,XM Group,https://www.investing.com/analysis/yen-retreat-in-full-swing-amid-signs-of-trade-negotiations-looming-200330707,200330707

126200,347715,PNC,Equities Rebound As Earnings Season Arrives,opinion,"When you look at the role of financial markets in broader society  context becomes quite important  For example  if you are an inner city kid just trying to get a quality education  the relative performance of the Russell 2000 versus the S P 500 means nothing  If you are a Chinese citizen  one of nearly 2 billion  or an Indian trying to navigate a country of over a billion other people  the performance of a stock listed in the US matters little  if at all  to your daily life  Consider the plight of someone undergoing chemotherapy two or three times a week  and well  financial markets might hold very little attraction  The same thing can be said for someone in a nursing home  However  in a larger lens  if you consider the large state run pension funds or higher education foundations that fund all kind of liabilities  including teacher and public employee pensions and potentially donate to inner city projects all over the country  well  their ownership of equities in various forms seems much more important if they are viewed as a funding source for those less fortunate  So  looking at situations with an overall context is quite important  especially when doing rigorous analysis  Let s apply this to individual portfolio management  shall we 
Those who cover finance often mention individual sectors or holdings and discuss their performance over a time frame  In doing so  without listing and giving detail to the overall value of a portfolio and the weight given to a holding  a viewer is receiving incomplete information  If you have a portfolio of ten holdings  and one stock comprises one tenth of one percent of the total value  and it drops by twenty percent  but the overall value of the entire assets goes up by twenty percent  does the portfolio owner flip out because one stock was terrible  In most cases  probably not  If that one terrible stock was the one mentioned by the finance program  it would appear the company was poor  Taking it even further  if the company had a ten year track record of beating the market indexes by many percentage points  think something like an Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  or Facebook  NASDAQ FB   the fact that it dropped 20 percent over a month or two means very little  So  context matters in both life and in finance  and it is worth understanding and taking to heart this valuable lesson  Besides  when did Tom Brokaw ever steer anyone wrong  right 
In the markets this week  Mr  Zuckerberg held his own quite well with the neanderthals that made every attempt to humiliate him during his testimony in front of Congress  The more you watch our Senators and Congressman  the more you realize it is just the same script every time  They prepare this long drawn out speech trying to put whoever is in front of them in their place with some sort of moral outrage  As if our duly elected representatives care about anything other than a campaign contribution and pandering to their constituencies   Sorry for the editorial commentary and back to our scheduled programming  Verifone Systems Inc  NYSE PAY  got taken private  yet again  and late in the week  JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   and PNC Financial Services Group Inc  NYSE PNC  told us they made billions  I know you were worried  In my little world  a situation took place where a value holding that is a turnaround reported mid week and the market hated its guidance  though the financial results were fine  The management communicated in a way which essentially said margins probably won t improve for two years  Great  want to watch investors flee  this was the case  It is unfortunate and disappointing when your leadership does not put their plan into proper context for investors to digest  or in a way which is understandable  Three years from now  it probably won t matter  unless of course  the management team is actually trying to take the company private  which could be their ultimate motivation  You never know  which is why investing is  uh  interesting

126201,347716,PNC,3 Stocks To Buy Ahead Of Earnings,opinion,"Stocks opened higher on Monday as investors seem to think the U S  led air strikes on Syria won t lead to a much larger conflict  The strikes also coincided with the real start of first quarter earnings season  which investors should use as a way to fight off the volatility that has plagued markets recently 
Earnings season kicked into gear last Friday when banking giants  JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  Chase   NYSE JMP    Citigroup   NYSE C    and PNC Financial   NYSE PNC    reported their Q1 financial results  Going forward  investors should use this highly anticipated period to try to recoup any losses they might have suffered during the extended bearish run 
With that said  investors still need to be selective during earnings season and hunt for stocks that look poised to top quarterly earnings estimates  Conversely  investors should stay away from any companies that might disappoint by reporting lower than expected earnings results 
Luckily  Zacks Premium customers can utilize the  in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise  in one way or the other 
This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
Today  we are giving our readers a free look at three stocks that look ready to post an earnings beat this week

126222,347737,PNC,Will Strong Earnings Send Bank Stocks  JPM  C  WFC  Soaring ,opinion,"In the midst of rollercoaster trading that has seen massive one day swings in major stock indexes become commonplace  investors will now be forced to gear up for another busy stretch of earnings announcements with the Q1 report season officially getting underway when several financial behemoths release their latest results on Friday 
Major bank stocks have slightly outpaced the S P 500 over the past year  but interest rate uncertainty has created headwinds for the space recently  Yields on the benchmark 10 year Treasury bond have moved sideways over the last two months  marking a change to the uptrend in treasury yields that had been in place since September 
With that said  the Fed appears poised to continue tightening its policies  with market uncertainty almost entirely related to whether the central bank will announce four rates hikes  or more  this year  News on this front will continue to influence bank stocks as investors in the space clamor for the earnings growth catalyst that is a higher interest rate 
In the meantime  investors will be fixated on the latest quarterly earnings reports from the finance sector s major bellwethers  So what should we expect from the upcoming report season  Let s take a closer look 
The 30 000 Foot View
Based on the latest available estimates  we expect the Finance sector of which the Major Banks industry is the biggest earnings contributor to report Q1 earnings growth of 19 1  on 4 5  revenue growth  This would follow 0 6  earnings growth and 4  revenue growth in Q4 
The previous earnings cycle was complicated by massive one time charges related to tax law changes  which probably explains some of the large uptick in the growth rate  But we also know that 1Q17 saw the Finance sector report earnings growth of 10 5   so year over year comparisons are not exactly soft making a 19   growth rate that much more impressive 
The Major Banks group is actually projected to be the slowest growing industry within the Finance sector  although its estimate 11 1  EPS growth is certainly nothing to scoff at  Still  investors will hope that this group can get off to a great start with better than expected results from its top players  many of whom are reporting this Friday 
First Batch of Bellwether Reports
One key question that will be answered come Friday morning is whether a sharp uptick in market volatility has proved helpful to the markets and trading segments of the big banks  To answer this  investors will look to the reports of JPMorgan   NYSE JPM   and Citigroup   NYSE C   
Based on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates  we expect JPMorgan and Citigroup to report earnings growth of 38 2  and 19 1   respectively  Our consensus estimates are also calling for these companies to post respective net sales growth of 11 6  and 4 5  
Meanwhile  our exclusive non financial metrics consensus estimate file projects that JPMorgan will report total revenue of  7 1 billion in its Markets   Investor Services segment  This would represent growth of 8 9  from the year ago period  which would mark an improvement from the double digit declines this unit has witnessed recently  We do not have comparable estimates for Citigroup  but investors should expect markets activity to be a key catalyst there as well 
Several major banks with little to no exposure to capital markets operation  including Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC   and PNC Financial   NYSE PNC   will also report on Friday  Our Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for these firms to report earnings growth of 7 0  and 23 5   respectively 
Bottom Line
Friday s reports come at an interesting moment for the finance sector and the market as a whole  Both the sector and the broader market are facing headwinds and catalysts  with interest rate uncertainty and trade war woes outweighing the positives recently  Nevertheless  investors could be quick to forget about these challenges if earnings results are powerful

126223,347738,PNC,Can Fee Income Growth Aid PNC Financial s  PNC  Q1 Earnings ,opinion,The PNC Financial Services Group   NYSE PNC   is scheduled to report first quarter 2018 results on Apr 13  before the opening bell  Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year Organic growth remains a key strength for PNC Financial  The quarter witnessed a rise in consumer confidence  which led to loan growth  Also  the rising interest rates came as an added advantage for the bank Moreover  PNC Financial s bottom line is expected to benefit from lower tax rates as it is likely to have retained a remarkable part of its revenues  Also  improved M A and equity underwriting activities during the quarter are likely to drive fee income  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of  4 15 billion indicates a 6 8  year over year improvement Before we discuss the factors that might impact PNC Financial s first quarter results  let s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter PNC Financial s fourth quarter 2017 results improved primarily due to growth in loan balances and higher fee income  These factors also helped it in beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  the positives were partially offset by higher expenses and provision for loan losses Notably  the company delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters  with an impressive average beat of 4 1  The earnings beat translated into improved price performance  Over the past year  shares of PNC Financial have gained 32 7   outperforming the 21 8  growth recorded by the  Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsNet Interest Income to Grow  PNC Financial might report higher interest income as the quarter continued to witness rise in interest rates and improvement in lending scenario  The U S  consumer sentiment reached its highest level since 2004 during the quarter along with the unemployment rate remaining at record low levels  Such factors are likely to have led to upbeat lending activities Also  the company s net interest margin  NIM  is likely to expand with support from two rate hikes since December 2017  Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate  NIM is expected to expand 15 basis points to 2 92   year over year Notably  the consensus estimate for net interest income is projected to be  2 34 billion  up 8 4  year over year Controlled Expenses  The company has a cost saving program in place for the year to keep expenses under control  Also  management expects non interest expenses to be down by low single digits on a sequential basis Lower Mortgage Banking Revenues  The company is likely to continue witnessing lower revenues from this division owing to slowdown in refinancing activities caused by rising interest rates  Per the consensus estimate  residential mortgage revenues are likely to decline 9 7  to  102 million in the first quarter  on a year over year basis Non Interest Income Might Rise  As the first quarter was decent in terms of investment banking and equity underwriting business due to higher volumes of M As  the related fees are expected to increase marginally However  debt underwriting activities during the quarter were not encouraging  so the related fees are likely to remain muted Let s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts Our proven model doesn t conclusively show that PNC Financial will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around  as it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients  Note that a stock with the combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better has significantly higher chances of beating estimates You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for PNC Financial is 0 00  Zacks Rank  PNC Financial carries a Zacks Rank of 3 Nevertheless  with earnings estimates for the first quarter been revised slightly upward over the last 30 days  the company is expected to witness 23 5  year over year earnings growth Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider  as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter  according to our model Comerica Incorporated   NYSE CMA   is scheduled to release results on Apr 17  It has an Earnings ESP of  1 16  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  BB T Corporation   NYSE

126224,347739,PNC,Big Banks Set To Release Q1 Earnings  JPM  C  WFC   PNC,opinion,The first quarter earnings season is already knocking at the doors with big names   JPMorgan   NYSE JPM    Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    Citigroup   NYSE C   and PNC Financial   NYSE PNC     all reporting financial numbers tomorrow  before the opening bell After three straight quarters of muted activities  it appears that volatility is back in the markets  with extremity in February and March  The quarter witnessed investors  anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation  which pulled the benchmark 10 year Treasury bond yields down  This reversed the uptrend experienced by banks since last September Moreover  Trump s trade tariff announcements on Chinese imports and a sharp sell off in the tech sector affected the stock market rally in the quarter  All these activities indicate a favorable momentum on the capital markets aiding trading revenues  primarily for big banks Notably  the first quarter earnings are expected to report decent numbers as compared with the last quarter  impacted by huge one time charges related to the tax reform   with a rising interest rate environment aiding net interest margins   the backbone for banks  top line growth In addition to the benefits from the rising interest rates  a moderate improvement in lending will likely energize interest income for banks  Per the Federal Reserve s latest   loans are predicted to improve slightly on a sequential basis in the to be reported quarter  Particularly  weakness in revolving home equity loans might offset growth in commercial and industrial  C I   consumer and overall real estate loans  to some extent Mortgage business is anticipated to witness a slowdown in the first quarter  With interest rates moving higher  refinancing activities have been slowing down  Therefore  no major help is expected from this source The trend of earning solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt and equity issuance might reverse in the first quarter  as rising rates will limit corporates  involvement in these activities  As debt origination fees typically account for about half of total investment banking fees  this could deal a blow to the banks However  strong equity issuances globally might have got boosted from IPOs and follow on offerings  So  equity underwriting fees are projected to escalate  Also  a potential rise in fees from increasing M As in certain sectors will likely help banks garner advisory fees Further  credit quality is anticipated to remain strong  backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards On the cost front  while the absence of considerable legal expenses since the last few quarters is encouraging  increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might escalate costs moderately Per our latest   overall earnings for the major banks in first quarter 2018 are projected to rise 11 3  year over year Let s take a look at the four major banks scheduled to announce results tomorrow JPMorgan will report the first quarter earnings before the opening bell  Steady rise in net interest income and slowdown in mortgage banking is expected  Investment banking income is projected to remain stable or increase marginally year over year  Furthermore  with increased volatility during the quarter  management projects first quarter market revenues to rise at a mid to high single digit rate  on a year over year basis  Similar to the prior quarters  equity trading revenues are also

126225,347740,PNC,Should You Buy Wells Fargo  WFC  Stock Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,"Shares of Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC   gained as much as 2  in morning trading Thursday as investors gear up for the embattled bank giant s soon to be released earnings report  The firm will join peers like Citigroup   NYSE C    JPMorgan Chase   NYSE JPM    and PNC Financial   NYSE PNC   in reporting Friday morning 
Wells Fargo s report will be another measurement of the company s ongoing effort to regain public trust in the wake of its fraudulent account scandal  and with other major questions lingering around the entire finance sector  investors will want to pay close attention to this earnings announcement  Here s what to expect from the bank s first quarter 2018 report tomorrow 
Industry Trends
Wells Fargo belongs to our  Banks   Major Regional  group  which includes 16 of the largest commercial banks and currently sits in the top 48  of the Zacks Industry Rank  This group has gained nearly 19  within the past 52 weeks  but many of the industry s top stocks have slumped over the past month as new headwinds threaten its strong momentum 
The main concern for investors in this space is interest rate uncertainty  Yields on the benchmark 10 year Treasury note have moved sideways recently a change to the uptrend in treasury yields that had been witnessed since September  The Fed is expected to continue tightening its monetary policy  but now it is unclear whether the central bank will target four rate hikes  or more  this year 
Investors with exposure to the banking industry will continue to monitor this story as they clamor for higher interest rates  which typically serve as an earnings growth catalyst 
Latest Outlook and Valuation
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Wells Fargo s quarterly earnings is pegged at  1 07  This would mark a decline of about 1 5  from the year ago period  Nevertheless  the bank is projected to post revenue of  21 70 billion  an improvement of 7 0  on a year over year basis 
Ahead of its report  Wells Fargo is trading with a Forward P E of 10 7  This is a slight discount to the industry average of 11 8  Over the past year  the stock has traded as high as 15 6x forward 12 month earnings and as low as 10 6x  Its median Forward P E over this time is 12 5 
Earnings ESP Whispers
Investors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that Wells Fargo surprises investors with better than anticipated earnings results  For this  we turn to our Earnings ESP figure 
Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates  This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
Wells Fargo is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and an Earnings ESP of 0 7   This means that the most recent analyst estimates have been higher than the consensus  In other words  our model is suggesting that a beat is likely 
Surprise History
Investors also want to consider Wells Fargo s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these beats have had on share prices  The company missed earnings estimates in the most recent quarter  but before that  it had surpassed our consensus in five consecutive quarters  However  the stock has not always performed well during earnings season 
We judge the price effect of these earnings beats by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report  Over the last six quarters  Wells Fargo has only moved higher once during this window

The new Fed Chairman provided a relatively more bullish outlook of the U S  economy but mentioned balanced risks  Powell highlighted in his first Congressional testimony that the central bank is on its course to raise rates gradually 
As a result  some asset managers started expecting the Fed to raise U S  overnight interest rates four times this year  more than three guided by the Fed policymakers   Though the recently released tepid wage growth  muted inflation and soft retail sales dampened the fears of faster rate hikes lately  some market watchers still believe that this is not expected to keep the Fed from raising the funds rate by  from the current 1 25 1 5  on Wednesday

straight month in July as demand for machinery and a range of other products picked up  offering a tentative sign that a business spending downturn was starting to ease  The economic outlook also was boosted by another report on Thursday showing an unexpected drop in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week  indicating sustained labor market strength  Together  the data support the view that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December  Fed Chair Janet Yellen could give guidance on the near term outlook for U S  monetary policy when she speaks on Friday at a global central bankers  conference in Jackson Hole  Wyoming   This kind of data are consistent with what the Fed is looking for in terms of the labor market and economic growth  If we get more data like this  that will suggest we are likely to see an interest rate increase  most likely in December   said Gus Faucher  senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group  NYSE PNC    The Commerce Department said non defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft  a closely watched proxy for business spending plans  increased 1 6 percent last month  the largest gain since January   These so called core capital goods orders advanced 0 5 percent in June  The rise in July marked the first back to back gain since January 2015  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising only 0 3 percent last month  There were hefty increases in orders for machinery  primary metals  fabricated metal products  computers and electronic products  as well as electrical equipment  appliances and components  U S  financial markets were little moved by the data as investors were focusing on Yellen s upcoming speech  The dollar  DXY  was trading marginally lower against a basket of currencies  while U S  stocks were largely unchanged  Prices for U S  government bonds fell slightly  The U S  central bank raised interest rates at the end of last year for the first time in nearly a decade  but has held them steady so far in 2016 amid concerns over persistently low inflation  Most economists expect another rate hike in December   After contracting since the fourth quarter of 2015  business investment has caught the attention of Fed officials  with some viewing it as posing a downside risk to economic growth  Investment has declined in part as companies slashed capital spending budgets in response to lower oil prices  That in turn put pressure on manufacturing  which has also been undercut by a strong dollar  weak global demand and a U S  inventory correction  July s increase in core capital goods orders followed a rise in oil and gas drilling activity in recent months  SOFT BUSINESS SPENDING  Still  business investment is likely to be tepid in the third quarter amid uncertainty over the global economy after Britain s decision to leave the European Union and ahead of the Nov  8 U S  presidential election  economists say   The solid gains in the last two months set the stage for capital spending to become a net contributor to growth again in the second half of the year   said Anthony Karydakis  chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York   The potential softening in the euro zone economy following the Brexit vote may  at the margin  limit the extent of the comeback of capital spending in the U S    Heavy machinery maker  Caterpillar   N CAT  last month lowered its 2016 forecast  citing sluggish demand in mining and other industries  Weak business spending contributed to holding down economic growth to 1 0 percent in the first half of 2016  With demand for core capital goods orders rising briskly last month  overall orders for durable goods   items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more   surged 4 4 percent in July  Durable goods inventories rose last month after six straight months of decline   Shipments of core capital goods  which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government s gross domestic product measurement  fell 0 4 percent last month after decreasing 0 5 percent in June   But labor market strength should support consumer spending and

126243,347758,PNC,An Early Preview Of PNC s Q1 Earnings Outlook,opinion,"Shares of PNC Financial   NYSE PNC   climbed as part of Wednesday s broader market resurgence  Still  the recent volatility is likely far from over after trade war speculation revved up once again  This means that investors will be on the lookout for stocks that are expected to perform well during the upcoming first quarter earnings season 
PNC had seen its stock price climb 30  over the last year before it slipped in early March  along with many other financial services firms during the tech induced selloff  Luckily for investors  a market driven decline is more manageable than a company specific  fundamental related downturn 
This doesn t mean that investors should just dive back into PNC based on market trends  They should instead focus on some of PNC s most important fundamentals and see how the banking giant is expected to perform in the first quarter   
With that said  let s jump into some PNC projections ahead of its upcoming Q1 financial results  as investors look to find much needed stability 
Latest Outlook 
PNC s first quarter revenues are expected to climb by 7 1  to hit  4 16 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  Meanwhile  the bank is projected to see its quarterly earnings soar by 23 5  to reach  2 42 per share 
PNC s recent earnings estimate revision activity has been mixed  with PNC earning three upward earnings estimate revisions against two downward revisions  all within the last 30 days  However  within the last seven days  PNC has earned two earnings estimate revisions  with 100  agreement to the upside 
As we approach the release of PNC s first quarter 2018 financial results  the firm s Most Accurate Estimate is currently  2 43 per share

PNC is currently trading with a Forward P E of 13 9  This marks a relatively large premium compared to the  Banks   Major Regional  industry  which is currently trading at an average of 11 8x forward earnings 
However  PNC s current valuation marks a discount compared to where it had been trading at during the last few months 
Shares of PNC had dipped more than 5  over the last four weeks  which is a major reason for PNC s newly discounted valuation  Investors should also note that the regional banking industry s decline far outpaces PNC s recent downturn 
Price Performance and Surprise History

Bottom Line
Past performance is no indicator of future success  But investors should remember that PNC s top line is expected to grow  while its bottom line is projected to expand by over 23   Better still  PNC has earned two upward earnings estimate revisions within the last seven days and is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
PNC is scheduled to report its first quarter 2018 financial results before markets open on Friday  April 13

U S  stocks opened mildly higher Tuesday  with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining roughly 30 points as investors sorted through a series of economic data points ahead of the Federal Reserve s highly anticipated two day meeting later this week  Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and policymakers will debate whether to raise U S  interest rates  which would be the first increase in nearly a decade 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  INDEXDJX  DJI  rose 30 70 points  or 0 19 percent  to 16 401 66  The Standard   Poor s 500 index  INDEXSP  INX  edged up 3 points  or 0 15 percent  to 1 956  The Nasdaq composite  INDEXNASDAQ  IXIC  added 3 29 points  or 0 07 percent  to 4 808 65 
Uncertainty surrounding whether the U S  central bank will announce an interest rate hike continued to weigh on global stocks Tuesday  China s benchmark Shanghai Composite index finished down 3 5 percent  while Japan s Nikkei index closed up 0 34 percent 
However  European stocks traded slightly higher following Asia s weak lead  Germany s DAX and France s CAC rose 0 2 percent and 0 6 percent  respectively 
Market professionals eyed a series of retail sales and industrial production data points Tuesday  searching for further clues as to whether the Fed will announce raising rates at its two day policy meeting this week  which kicks off Wednesday  followed by a statement from the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  at 2 p m  EDT Thursday 
Industrial production  a measure of output for the industrial sector of the economy  declined 0 4 percent in August from a 0 9 percent rise in July  below than the expected 0 2 percent drop  the Federal Reserve said Tuesday 
Separately  U S  retail sales rose in line with forecasts in August  suggesting the bout of financial turmoil last month did not have a meaningful adverse impact on consumption 
 Today s release will have little impact on the FOMC s policy meeting  It is roughly in line with expectations  confirming that consumer spending is increasing at a moderate pace   Stuart Hoffman  chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group  NYSE PNC   said in a research note 
Although the headline retail sales increased by only 0 2 percent last month    dragged down by a dip in gasoline station sales    the so called core retail sales  which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product  came in stronger than expected 
Core retail sales  excluding automobiles  gasoline  building materials and food services  rose 0 4 percent after an upward revised 0 6 percent increase in July  the Commerce Department said Tuesday  The overall gain in headline sales was helped by a 0 7 percent increase in motor vehicle sales after auto sales hit a decade high in August 
Economists had forecast retail sales to rise 0 3 percent in August after a previously reported 0 6 percent rise in July  according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters ",2015-09-15,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-stocks-open-flat-361615,361615

U S  stocks opened mildly higher Wednesday  with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up roughly 50 points  despite consumer prices posting their first decline in 7 months  The weaker than expected data comes at a crucial time as the U S  Federal Reserve kicks off its highly anticipated two day meeting Wednesday where Janet Yellen and policymakers will debate whether to raise interest rates  which would be the first increase in nearly a decade 
 In light of the heightened market uncertainty  strong U S  dollar  and worries about the slowdown in China and Emerging Markets  we believe the Fed will delay its rate hike decision to December   Gregory Daco  chief U S  economist at Oxford Economics  said in a research note Wednesday 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  INDEXDJX  DJI  rose 51 points  or 0 27 percent  to 16 644  The Standard   Poor s 500 index  INDEXSP  INX  edged up 5 5 points  or 0 27 percent  to 1 983  The Nasdaq composite  INDEXNASDAQ  IXIC  added 9 points  or 0 18 percent  to 4 870 
Economists are preparing for the Fed s two day policy meeting  which kicks off Wednesday  followed by a statement from the Federal Open Market Committee at 2 p m  EDT Thursday  Fed Chair Janet Yellen will hold a press conference at 2 30 p m  Thursday following that statement  and investors will look for clues to the timing of the Fed s rate hike 
The financial markets are currently only pricing in about a 30 percent chance of a rate hike in September  says Daco  Economists  however  are almost evenly split about the prospects of a U S  rate hike this week  with the Bloomberg consensus poll showing 39 economists looking for no change in the federal funds rate  while 41 economists are looking for a hike of 25 basis points  or a quarter of a percent 
U S  consumer prices unexpectedly fell in August  marking the first decline since January  The drop signals muted inflation  which complicates the Federal Reserve s decision whether to hike interest rates this week  The Consumer Price Index fell 0 1 percent last month after edging up 0 1 percent in July  the Labor Department said Wednesday 
Inflation has been held down by two key issues  the strong U S  dollar and the precipitous drop in energy prices over the last year 
The decline in headline CPI inflation in August was partly due to the renewed decline in gasoline prices  Excluding food and energy  core consumer prices increased 0 1 percent in August  which was a little weaker than what economists were expecting  Part of the weakness was due to another weak reading for medical care prices  which were unchanged last month 
The central bank has a target for 2 percent annual inflation  using the personal consumption expenditures price index  which tends to run below the CPI 
Experts  however  expect the deflationary pressures from low energy prices and a strong dollar will begin to fade early next year   Together with the fact that the economy is already very close to full employment  this suggests that both wages and core inflation will surprise on the upside next year   Steve Murphy  U S  economist at Capital Economics  said in a note 
Some experts argue Thursday s mixed CPI report is unlikely to have much of an impact on the Federal Open Market Committee s decision this week 
 With continued solid improvement in the labor market and inflation set to accelerate  PNC expects the FOMC to raise the fed funds target rate to a range of 0 25 to 0 50 percent when the committee releases its policy statement tomorrow afternoon at 2  although it remains a close call   Stuart Hoffman  chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group  NYSE PNC   said in a note

126259,347774,PNC,Wells Fargo  WFC  To Divest Assets Of Auto Lending Segment,opinion,"Wells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC   has entered into an agreement with Popular   NASDAQ BPOP   to divest certain assets and liabilities of its auto finance business in Puerto Rico  The all cash deal is expected to close by mid 2018 
Wells Fargo s auto lending segment landed in trouble last year when its customers were financially hurt due to issues related to auto Collateral Protection Insurance policies  Per its fourth quarter earnings release  auto loan originations fell nearly 33  on a year over year basis 
Terms of the Deal
The deal has been valued at  1 7 billion which reflects a 4 5  discount on the value of assets that are to be sold 
Reliable Financial Services and Reliable Finance Holding Company  subsidiaries of Wells Fargo  will sell about  1 5 billion in retail auto loans and  340 million in commercial loans to the banking subsidiary of Popular  Banco Popular de Puerto Rico 
Past Divestures
Recently  Wells Fargo divested its Shareowner Services business to Equiniti Group plc for  227 million  Equiniti Group is the leading provider of share registration and associated investor services in the United Kingdom 
Further  in November 2017  the bank completed the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services USA to USI Insurance Services  The motive behind this divesture was to bring banking activities back into focus 
Our Viewpoint
Wells Fargo has been trimming its operations ever since its downward journey started after the fake account scandal in September 2016  Earlier this month  the Federal Reserve put a cap of  2 trillion on its assets  This is likely to further push the bank into concentrating on core operations 
Though litigation costs will continue to be burden in the near term  the bank s cost cutting initiatives might lend some support to its financials  Also  its strong capital position and much attentive management might keep it from falling into trouble again 
Shares of Wells Fargo have gained 13  over the past six months  underperforming 15 4  rally for the  it belongs to

TOKYO  Reuters    Asian shares got off to a rocky start on Monday after mixed U S  jobs data helped sink shares on Wall Street  but trade was thin with many regional markets closed for the Lunar New Year holiday

Japan s Nikkei  N225  pared early steep losses  helped by a weaker yen  but it also was down 0 2 percent by midday 
 We didn t get much clues on future U S  rate hikes from the jobs report  so investors are having hard times deciding their positions   said Takuya Takahashi  a strategist at Daiwa Securities 
 Japanese companies  earnings reports are not helping sentiment  either  so the market may stay sluggish for a while  
U S  nonfarm payrolls increased by just 151 000 jobs last month  falling well short of expectations for a rise of 190 000 
But the unemployment rate fell to 4 9 percent  the lowest since February 2008  and wages rose  indicating some signs of underlying strength in the labour market despite the weak headline figure 
With Singapore  Hong Kong and mainland China all closed for the new year holiday   volumes will be well below average and there tends to be a build up of global leads that is released once Asian investors return to their desk   expect  release valve trading late in the week   Evan Lucas  market strategist at IG in Melbourne  wrote in a note to clients 
Markets in China  a focus of recent market concern  will be closed for the entire week for the holiday 
Data released over the weekend showed China s foreign reserves fell for a third straight month in January  as the central bank dumped dollars to defend the yuan and prevent an increase in capital outflows 
Beijing has been struggling to underpin the yuan  which faces depreciation pressure as China s growth rate slows to its lowest levels in a quarter of a century 
 Just as China s persistent accumulation of foreign reserves in the first decade of the 21st century signalled that its managed currency was undervalued  its persistent loss of foreign reserves signals that the yuan has become overvalued by market criteria   economist Bill Adams at PNC Financial Services Group  N PNC  said in a research note 
 There is a large probability that China s central bank tires of spending its foreign reserves to defend an overvalued currency in the near future  The People s Bank of China will likely widen the currency s trading bank and permit a larger managed slide against the dollar in coming months  
Also over the weekend  North Korea s launch of a long range rocket drew international condemnation

The euro edged down about 0 2 percent to  1 1135   though it remained in sight of Friday s three month high of  1 1250 scaled immediately after the headline figure of the payrolls data led investors to reduce their bets on further Fed rate hikes

126261,347776,PNC,U S  Bancorp To Pay Penalty Of  613M For Money Laundering  ,opinion,"U S  Bancorp   NYSE USB   has agreed to pay about  613 million in penalty to the U S  regulators for deliberate violations of the Bank Secrecy Act by its subsidiary  U S  Bank National Association 
Willful Violations
The bank has been slapped with charges of failing to put together proper anti money laundering  AML  control programs along with intentionally not reporting suspicious activities to the authorities 
For a period of nearly six years  ended 2014   U S  Bancorp was found of using weak AML measures  The bank lowered the number of suspicious activities that could be identified by its monitoring systems due to limited number of employees present to track them 
Also  the bank had hidden this fact from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  OCC   Despite knowledge of these improper practices and repeated warnings from the reviewers of staff levels to be  stretched dangerously thin   U S  Bancorp chose to conceal facts from the minutes of internal meetings 
Further  the regulators also noted the bank s failure to properly track Western Union transactions made by non customers at its branches  Suspicious transactions were allowed to go uninvestigated despite employees raising concerns 
Second allegation on the bank was keeping the wrongdoings of Scott Tucker  a former professional race car driver  from the authorities until it received a subpoena from the U S  attorney in Manhattan in 2013 
The bank allowed Tucker to use accounts under tribal names to conduct fraudulent payday lending scheme  Since 2008  these sham companies had lent millions of loans to the customers and generated profits that he spent to fulfil his lavish needs 
In 2011  investigators reported about these misdoings to which the bank responded by closing Tucker s accounts in the names of the tribal companies but refrained from filing a suspicious report  Moreover  they allowed him to operate through non tribal accounts letting millions from illegal payday business schemes to flow in 
Penalties Imposed
U S  Bancorp has signed a two year deferred prosecution agreement with the U S  Attorney s Office in the Southern District of New York and has agreed to pay a fine of  453 million 
The bank is also liable to pay  75 million to the OCC   70 million to Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and the Federal Reserve will be paid  15 million 
Apart from penalty  the bank will continue to undertake proper modifications of its AML program  only after which charges will be dismissed by the government 
Our Take
Though this settlement might impact U S  Bancorp s financials to an extent  it still remains well poised for growth on the back of its solid business model and diverse revenue streams 
Also  such incidents help instill investors  confidence in regulating bodies and keep banks from engaging in illegal activities 
Shares of U S  Bancorp have gained 6 5  over the past six months  underperforming 20 5  rally for the  it belongs to

Wal Mart Stores Inc   the world s largest retailer  will report earnings Thursday  setting the tone for the retail sector s health during the holiday shopping season  U S  retail spending fell more than anticipated at the end of 2014 despite a steep drop in gasoline prices across the country  Economists view retail sales as a key economic indicator since consumer spending accounts for nearly two thirds of U S  economic activity   The dramatic decline in oil prices since June sent U S  crude oil prices plummeting to a five year low  under  55 per barrel in December  The decline helped send U S  gasoline prices down to an average  2 27 per gallon at the end of 2014  according to Gasbuddy com  But contrary to expectations  shoppers didn t take as much advantage of the boost to spending power from lower gasoline prices at the end of the holiday shopping season   Retail sales haven t been quite as strong as we had been expecting   said Gus Faucher  senior macro economist at PNC Financial Services Group  NYSE PNC   Although critics have pointed to Wal Mart s declining foot traffic as a sign of weakness  analysts say the company has compensated with sales increases in its booming e commerce business  Investors cheered Walmart s previous earnings report after the company posted a 21 percent increase in online sales in the third quarter and recorded a 2 9 percent increase in quarterly revenue   They ve really revamped their e commerce business and pulled back a little bit from brick and mortar  That s certainly paid off   said Christine Short  senior vice president at research firm Estimize  One overriding theme this earnings season is likely to remain unchanged  however  even for Wal Mart  U S  multinationals are facing currency issues due to a strong dollar  Analysts forecast currency fluctuations could limit Wal Mart s earnings growth because a stronger U S  dollar isn t exactly good news when it comes to bottom lines for U S  companies that derive a good portion of sales overseas   I would expect Wal Mart to report the same theme that we ve seen with other retailers  and that s currency headwinds   Short said   Economists expect Wal Mart to report fiscal fourth quarter net income of  4 98 billion  or earnings per share of  1 53  on revenue of  132 36 billion  according to consensus estimates from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters  That compares with a profit of  4 4 billion  or earnings per share of  1 60  on revenue of  129 77 billion during the same period a year ago  The area where economists have seen stronger growth recently is the restaurant industry  Consumers are using some of the money they ve saved from cheap gasoline prices and started using it to go out to eat more often  Faucher said  But economists do expect U S  consumers to spend more in 2015  which is a positive for retailers  particularly for those retailers like Wal Mart who cater to the middle to lower income consumer   Those are the people who are most stretched because they re living pay check to pay check  If it cost them  10 less to fill up their car  then they re going to spend some of that pretty quickly   Faucher said  Wal Mart also expanded its selection of organic foods last year by using Wild Oats  an operator of natural foods stores and farmers markets  as its supplier  The company said in November it plans to sell organic food at the same prices it sells nonorganic food   Wal Mart has tried to cater to the organic and health food space so that lower income consumers can reap the benefits of something similar to a Whole Foods  which they wouldn t otherwise have access to   Short said   Wal Mart is scheduled to report fourth quarter earnings ahead of the opening bell Thursday  Shares of the retailer are currently trading around  85 per share ahead of the company s earnings report  The stock has gained more than 13 percent in the last 12 months to  78 76  according to Reuters data ",2015-02-18,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wal-mart-earnings-to-reveal-strength-of-retail-sector-328623,328623
126283,347798,PNC,Soft U S  data hints at near term hiccup in economic growth,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment aid last week rose to its highest level since May  but economists dismissed the increase as weather related and said the jobs market remained solid 
They were also little perturbed by other data on Thursday that showed factory orders fell in January for a sixth straight month and fourth quarter productivity declined by more than initially thought 
The reports  however  suggested some near term weakness in economic growth 
 The underlying fundamentals of the economy remain solid and there is no reason we won t continue to see the type of economic growth and job growth that we saw in 2014 continuing this year   said Gus Faucher  senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group  NYSE PNC  in Pittsburgh 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose by 7 000 to a seasonally adjusted 320 000 for the week ended Feb  28  the Labor Department said  It was the second consecutive week of increases 
While the Labor Department cited no special factors influencing the data  economists said cold and snowy weather in February and a strike by petroleum refinery workers were likely to blame 
Data for the week ended Feb  21 showed a large number of layoffs in Kentucky because of bad weather 
 We suspect the pattern reflects the weather rather than fundamental deterioration  That said  we will  of course  be on watch for the possibility that the rise in the last two weeks marks a change in the trend   said Jim O Sullivan  chief U S  economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla  New York 
The four week moving average of claims  considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week to week volatility  rose 10 250 to 304 750 last week 
The claims data has no bearing on Friday s employment report for February as it falls outside the survey period 
Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have increased 240 000 last month after rising by 257 000 in January  according to a Reuters survey of economists  The unemployment rate is forecast falling one tenth of a percentage point to 5 6 percent 
The economy added more than a million jobs between November and January  a feat last seen in 1997 
U S  stocks were trading higher on Thursday after the European Central Bank said it would start its new government bond buying program of 60 billion euros a month on March 9 and raised its economic growth forecast for 2015 
Prices for U S  Treasury debt were little changed  while the dollar rose to an 11 1 2 year high against the euro 
SOFT MANUFACTURING
In a separate report  the Commerce Department said new orders for manufactured goods slipped 0 2 percent in January after dropping 3 5 percent in December 
The department also said orders for non defense capital goods excluding aircraft   seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans   rose 0 5 percent instead of the 0 6 percent advance reported last month 
Manufacturing has been hurt by softening demand in Europe and Asia as well as a strong dollar and lower crude oil prices  which have caused some energy companies to either delay or cut back on capital expenditure projects 
A labor dispute at U S  West Coast ports  which has since been resolved  also has weighed on factory activity through disruptions to the supply chain 
There is optimism the sector will regain momentum in the second quarter as some of these factors fade 
 There are some signs that the core capital goods data might be starting to turn the corner after a weak end to 2014   said Daniel Silver  an economist at JPMorgan in New York 
A second report from the Labor Department showed productivity  which measures hourly output per worker  fell at a 2 2 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter as the number of hours worked outpaced output  It was previously reported to have declined at a 1 8 percent pace 
Productivity has been weak for much of the recovery from the 2007 09 recession  helping to boost hiring 
 Of late  job growth has been extraordinary  but it now behooves employers to quickly utilize these new hires as effectively as those already on the job   said Doug Handler  chief U S  economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington  Massachusetts 
In the fourth quarter  hours worked increased at a revised 4 9 percent rate instead of the previously reported 5 1 percent pace  Compensation per hour rose at a 1 9 percent rate  rather than the 0 9 percent pace reported last month

126284,347799,PNC,Home sales vault to 18 month high as supply improves,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  home resales surged to their highest level in 18 months in March as more homes came on the market  a sign of strength in housing ahead of the spring selling season 
The fairly upbeat report from the National Association of Realtors on Wednesday implied the economy was regaining some momentum after hitting a speed bump at the start of the year 
But tepid retail sales and weak factory data suggested the growth rebound will probably be insufficient to convince the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in June 
 It s consistent with strong growth in the second quarter  We should have a solid spring selling season and should see the housing market continuing to improve through 2015   said Gus Faucher  senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group  NYSE PNC  in Pittsburgh 
Existing home sales increased 6 1 percent to an annual rate of 5 19 million units in March  the highest level since September 2013  The percent rise was the largest since December 2010  Last month s sales outpaced economists  expectations for a 5 03 million unit rate 
The outlook for the spring selling season  which runs from April through August  was also boosted by a separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showing applications for loans to purchase homes jumped 5 percent last week to the highest level since June 2013 
It was the fourth time in five weeks that purchase applications rose and economists attributed this to moves by the government to ease credit conditions for first time buyers 
Home sales have been constrained by a shortage of properties on the market  which has pushed up home prices and limited choice for potential buyers  Fewer homeowners are defaulting on their mortgages  meaning fewer foreclosed properties in the pipeline to boost supply 
As such  builders would have to break more ground on new housing units to boost inventories  D R  Horton Inc  N DHI   the largest U S  homebuilder  on Wednesday reported a 30 percent jump in orders 
Despite the sturdy home resales report  the housing index  HGX  fell more than 1 percent  The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while prices for U S  Treasury debt fell 
SUPPLY IMPROVING
In March  the inventory of unsold homes on the market increased 5 3 percent from a month ago to 2 million units  the highest level since last November  However  supply was up only 2 percent from a year ago 
Realtors and economists say insufficient equity and uncertainty about the economy s strength were forcing potential sellers to stay longer in their homes  A recent survey by the Realtors association showed homeowners on average staying in their homes for 10 years instead of the typical seven years 
At March s sales pace  it would take 4 6 months to clear houses from the market  down from 4 7 months in February  A supply of six months is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand 
With supply still tight  the median price for a previously owned home increased 7 8 percent from a year ago to  212 100 
That was the largest percentage gain since February 2014 and suggested that the pace of home price increases  which had been slowing after double digit growth for much of 2013  appears to be reaccelerating 
 It looks like the combination of limited available inventory and a decline in the share of distressed sales in the market continue to put upward pressure on prices   said Daniel Silver  an economist at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  in New York

fastest rate in at least three years in August as domestic and export orders tumbled  hitting global markets and increasing fears that the world s second largest economy may be heading for a hard landing  Even more worrying  China s services sector  which has been one of the lone bright spots in the sputtering economy  also showed signs of cooling  News of deteriorating business conditions set off fresh selling in Chinese shares on Tuesday  with the main indexes tumbling 5 percent at one point before recovering some of the day s losses by the close  World stocks and commodity prices also took a hit   MKTS GLOB  Hurt by soft demand  overcapacity and falling investment  China s economy has been further buffeted by plunging shares and a shock yuan devaluation  in what some have called a  perfect storm  of factors that is rattling global markets and could strain relations with China s major trading partners  Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Tuesday it would be beneficial for this week s meeting of the Group of 20 major economies to discuss what is going on in China s economy   Capital market turmoil has made Chinese businesses and consumers turn more cautious   Bill Adams  a senior economist at PNC Financial  NYSE PNC  Services in Pittsburgh  said in reference to a 40 percent plunge in Chinese shares since mid June  Adams said China s economy could grow around 6 5 percent in the second half of the year  easing to 6 2 percent in 2016  Some analysts believe growth levels are already well below that  putting Beijing s official target of 7 percent at risk  China s official manufacturing Purchasing Managers  Index  PMI  fell to 49 7 in August from 50 0 in July  the National Bureau of Statistics said  That was in line with a Reuters poll  but the lowest since August 2012  and below the 50 point mark separating growth from contraction  New orders   a proxy for domestic and foreign demand   fell to 49 7 in August from July s 49 9  New export orders contracted for an 11th straight month  A private survey by Caixin Markit focusing on smaller factories pointed to an even sharper cooldown  with the PMI dropping to 47 3  the worst reading since March 2009  Both surveys showed manufacturers were laying off workers at a faster rate as their order books shrank  Analysts said the bleak readings affirmed bets that China  which has slashed interest rates five times since November  must loosen policy again soon to avert a sharper economic downturn that could weigh on global growth even as the U S  central bank prepares to raise interest rates  The closure of factories in northern China to clear Beijing s skies for a huge military parade this week likely also hurt output  as did a giant blast in the port city of Tianjin  SERVICES FIRMS LOSING STEAM China s services companies are also showing clear signs of fatigue  to the point where growth in that sector may no longer be enough to offset persistent factory weakness  The official services reading cooled slightly to 53 4  while remaining well in expansion territory  but the private survey PMI fell sharply to 51 5  its lowest level since July 2014  That dragged a composite PMI combining factory and services readings to below 50 for the first time since April 2014  In another sign that economic weakness was spreading to the services sector  the Caixin Markit services PMI showed the labor market deteriorated for the 22nd straight month in August  Employment in the services sector fell to 50 1   We believe further aggressive monetary easing and proactive fiscal policy  along with financial liberalization  are needed to maintain growth at around 7 percent   ANZ economists said  A flurry of earnings reports from top Chinese banks in the past week showed they were struggling with the slowest profit growth in at least six years and a jump in bad loans  and the slump in stock markets in recent weeks is likely to reduce contributions from the financial sector in coming months   Recent volatility in global financial markets could weigh on the real economy  and a pessimistic outlook may become self fulfilling   said He Fan  Chief Economist at Caixin Insight Group  Ning Jizhe  vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission  said the impact of gyrating stocks on the broader economy should be contained   China is a developing country  The invented economy also has a great impact on the real economy  but the impact is not as big as in developed countries   Ning told a news briefing   As for volatility  which industry doesn t have volatility   Several leading Chinese brokerages said on Tuesday they would increase the size of their proprietary stock trading  answering Beijing s call for listed firms to bolster support for struggling stocks  Chinese authorities have launched their most aggressive policy loosening campaign since the 2008 09 global financial crisis to try to put a floor beneath sagging growth

126317,347832,PNC,What s Behind China s Manufacturing Weakness ,news,"By    A key gauge of Chinese manufacturing activity slipped further in February  sparking cautious tones from economists worried about economic slowdown in the world s second largest economy 
HSBC Holdings plc s  LON HSBA  flash manufacturing purchasing managers  index  PMI  fell t a seven month low in February  slipping to 48 3 from 49 5 in January  data from Thursday shows 

A reading above 50 shows expansion in manufacturing activity from the previous month  while readings below 50 indicate contraction 
 New orders and production contracted  reflecting the renewed destocking activities   said HSBC s chief economist Hongbin Qu in a statement   The underlying momentum for manufacturing growth could be weakening  
The indicator extends worrying results from January  when the index also showed a net contraction in manufacturing  The data is widely watched as a leading indicator of the state of China s economy  which is still driven heavily by manufacturing despite an ongoing attempted push for China to become a consumer and services driven economy   
 Conditions in the manufacturing sector continue to deteriorate   wrote Capital Economics  Chian economist Julian Evans Pritchard in a note on Thursday   This was much weaker than most expected   he continued  pointing out that the reading fell far below even the lowest economist estimates 
The timing of the Chinese New Year  which began on Jan  31 this year  may have distorted results  however  said several economists 
The indicator is still  close to where it it spent much of 2013  a year in which real GDP growth averaged 7 7 percent   said PNC Financial Services Group Inc  NYSE PNC  economist Bill Adams after the flash release   After an above trend fourth quarter of 2013  real GDP growth is likely slowing in early 2014  in line with a year of real GDP growth of about 7 5 percent  
Investors worldwide have been concerned about a slowdown in Chinese economic growth  from the double digit clips common in the last decade to figures closer to 7 or 8 percent 
China has consumed vast amounts of natural resources in the past decade  from grains to metals and energy products  as it built up infrastructure and a burgeoning middle class

126318,347833,PNC,HSBC settles U S  fraud charges over foreclosure fees,news,"By Nate Raymond and Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK  Reuters    HSBC Holdings Plc  L HSBA  agreed to pay  10 million to settle U S  government charges that it defrauded taxpayers by submitting inflated bills to process residential foreclosures 
The civil settlement announced Tuesday is the first to result from an investigation by U S  Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan into whether mortgage servicers overcharged the government on foreclosures on federally backed home loans 
According to settlement papers  HSBC admitted and accepted responsibility for having failed in 2009 and 2010 to properly police foreclosure related fees charged by outside lawyers and other service providers 
HSBC would submit inflated fees to the Federal Housing Administration  which is part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development  and government controlled mortgage company Fannie Mae  OB FNMA  for reimbursement  the papers show 
The British lender s inadequate oversight led to millions of dollars of losses for the FHA and Fannie Mae  Bharara said 
 Their lack of controls showed gross neglect and an abject failure to serve their customers  FHA and Fannie Mae  and therefore the taxpayers   Michael Stephens  acting inspector general at the Federal Housing Finance Agency  which oversees Fannie Mae  said in a statement 
HSBC spokesman Rob Sherman said the bank is pleased to settle   Since 2010  we have taken steps to enhance oversight of foreclosure law firms  and put in place a robust law firm management and oversight program even before we received notice of this particular action   he said 
The accord resolves claims under a federal whistleblower law known as the False Claims Act  The identity of the whistleblower could not immediately be determined 
A typical foreclosure can cost  1 000 to  3 000  Much of the sum goes toward legal fees  and other expenses can go toward court filing costs  mailings and title searches 
At least  6 trillion of loans overseen by large servicers in the United States from 2009 to 2012 were delinquent or in foreclosure  the trade publication Inside Mortgage Finance said 
Other companies have also received subpoenas from Bharara s office related to foreclosure fees charged to the FHA  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  OB FMCC  

Among the recipients are Banco Santander SA  MC SAN   MetLife Inc  N MET   PHH Corp  N PHH   PNC Financial Services Group Inc  N PNC  and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc s  L RBS  Citizens Financial unit  according to regulatory filings  None immediately responded on Tuesday to requests for comment

126319,347834,PNC,Smaller banks see regulatory relief after U S  elections,news,"By Emily Stephenson WASHINGTON  Reuters    All but the biggest U S  banks could see relief from some financial reforms after the November elections even if control of the U S  Congress remains divided between Democrats and Republicans 
    Post election committee leadership changes and growing momentum behind bipartisan fixes may lead to tweaks to the 2010 Dodd Frank law for the smallest community banks  larger firms such as PNC Financial Services  N PNC  of Pittsburgh and Regions Financial  N RF  of Birmingham  Alabama  and insurers  lobbyists and congressional staffers said 
    Small banks  make loans to local small businesses  support their communities  and would not threaten our financial system if they defaulted   Senator Sherrod Brown  an Ohio Democrat  said in a statement to Reuters  Brown is a contender for a committee leadership post in the 114th Congress  which begins in January 
    To be sure  President Barack Obama retains his veto power  so there will be no gutting of Dodd Frank  which aims to make banks less risky  end the problem of  too big to fail  institutions  and prevent a repeat of the 2007 2009 financial crisis 
    Instead  the possible changes range from adjusting which banks count as  rural  and are exempted from certain rules  to declaring fewer banks big enough that their failure would threaten markets  a designation that brings extra regulatory oversight 
     I think that it s likely that we will see actually some significant community bank regulatory relief in the new Congress   said Camden Fine  head of the Independent Community Bankers of America  a Washington lobby group for small banks 
    Community institutions have won supporters on both sides of the aisle and in both houses of Congress  in part because most lawmakers represent a small bank  The House of Representatives has approved bipartisan bills to free small banks from Federal Reserve and other rules 
    Banks that describe themselves as regional banks  including PNC  the 11th biggest US holding company with  324 billion in assets  according to U S  regulatory data  and Capital One  N COF  of McLean  Virginia  the 13th biggest with about  291 billion in assets  have banded together to form a coalition that argues they are like community banks  accepting deposits and lending to consumers and local businesses  and shouldn t have to meet the same requirements as Wall Street firms 
     The Regional Bank Coalition believes that it s time to move beyond the simple asset only model to determine systemic risk because it does not match the reality of the U S  banking system   Deron Smithy  treasurer of Regions Bank  said in congressional testimony in May   Rules designed for large  complex firms impose real  burdensome costs when applied to middle market lenders   Regions has  118 billion in assets and is the 26th biggest holding company 
    Under Dodd Frank  banks with more than  50 billion in assets must test their performance in a hypothetical crisis  plan for what would happen if they should fail and meet other rules  A bill in the House to change that threshold now has more than 70 co sponsors 
     We never thought  50 billion was a forever number  and I think it was one of those things we would have looked at again   former Representative Barney Frank  a Democrat and one of the law s co authors  said in an interview 
    Senate Democrats  led by Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson  shied away from changes to Dodd Frank for fear Republicans would try to use the opportunity to weaken the law  But Johnson is retiring  and several of his possible successors support targeted relief for some institutions 
    Johnson s committee has already moved forward with changes for insurers  The Senate in June voted to change the so called  Collins amendment   which governs capital rules for big insurers 
    The adjustment  which would no longer make insurers follow banks  relatively more strict capital rules  was sought by Prudential Financial  N PRU  and MetLife  N MET  
     The minute that we saw the Collins amendment pass     it became very clear that there could be legislative fixes to the Dodd Frank Act in the 114th Congress   said Isaac Boltansky  an analyst with Compass Point Research and Trading 
POLITICALLY DIVISIVE
    Despite limited areas of bipartisan agreement  most banking issues remain politically divisive 
    For instance  Brown  a possible chairman of the banking committee  has scrutinized consumer products such as payday loans  Senators Richard Shelby and Mike Crapo  potential leaders if Republicans take over  are critical of the new agency that oversees those products 
    Neither side can make headway on pet issues single handedly   The Republicans can t get anything done in the Senate without some Democrat support   said Mark Calabria  a former Shelby staffer who is now at the libertarian Cato Institute    
    There is also concern that the House and Senate have struggled to cooperate even on issues they agree on  such as the Collins bill   That doesn t bode well for larger  more complex issues   Brown said 
    House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling wants to ease the Collins amendment  and could still do that before the midterm elections  But he might attach it to other Dodd Frank legislation that Democrats would not support  congressional staffers said 
     When we have tried to forge compromises with the chairman  he has insisted on undermining financial stability and consumer protection by providing carve outs for large banks   Maxine Waters  the top Democrat on the committee  said in a statement to Reuters 
    Hensarling has blamed the Senate  where he has said  good ideas go to languish and fail   for not taking up other relief bills  A committee staffer said the House had passed numerous bipartisan financial bills that the Senate has not taken up  including to exempt small banks from some Fed and consumer bureau rules

126320,347835,PNC,U S  regulators adopt tighter rules for banks  cash needs,news,"By Emily Stephenson and Douwe Miedema WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  regulators on Wednesday issued rules for banks to hold enough easy to sell assets to keep them afloat during a crunch  after many were caught short of cash during the 2007 09 financial crisis 
The rules  adopted by the three main bank regulators  are a new building block in a global effort to make big banks such as JPMorgan Chase  N JPM  and Citigroup  N C  sturdier and head off a future meltdown of the financial system 
 Liquidity squeezes were the agents of contagion in the financial crisis   Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo said   The  new rule  makes such squeezes less likely by limiting large banks from taking on excessive liquidity risk  
The Federal Reserve said big U S  banks would need to hold a total of about  2 5 trillion in highly liquid assets by 2017  and that they would have a shortfall of about  100 billion if that threshold applied today 
The regulators also proposed rules determining how much money   or margin   swaps buyers and sellers must set aside when they do trades outside central clearing houses  which makes them more risky than cleared derivatives trades 
The liquidity rules  which were first proposed in October 2013  will force banks to hold enough liquid assets such as cash  treasury bonds and other securities to fund themselves over a 30 day period during a crisis 
In the wake of the last crisis  regulators have told banks to rely less on borrowed money  and to raise more shareholder equity  But they had yet to address problems with everyday cash needs that came to light during the crisis 
The final rule provided some relief from the proposed version  allowing smaller banks to make their liquidity calculations on a monthly basis rather than every day 
It also exempted companies regulated by the Fed that are deemed to be of systemic financial importance but that are not banks   such as insurer Prudential Financial Inc  N PRU  
Banks with more than  250 billion in assets will still have to tabulate their daily liquidity needs 
The Fed s estimate of the current shortfall is half of what it foresaw in its proposed rule  Bank of New York Mellon  N BK   PNC Financial Services  N PNC  and U S  Bancorp  N USB  are examples of banks that currently do not meet the ratio  according to a note by KBW research analysts 
 Banks have started to narrow the gap   said David Wright  a regulation expert at consultancy firm Deloitte   Some were waiting to find out exactly how the buffer would be defined     but now     banks will be able to go ahead and close the final  100 billion gap  
Fed staff said they want to work on a plan to eventually include the most liquid municipal bonds in the asset buffer  although for now they will not count  something that has frustrated local government officials  who have argued banks will buy fewer of their bonds  and taxpayers will shoulder more costs for projects such as new roads 
U S  cities and states criticized the regulators  tightening of the rules on Wednesday  saying it would raise their borrowing costs and hamper vital infrastructure projects 
MORE RULES
Tarullo  the Fed s top official on financial regulation  said more rules were forthcoming  He said the Fed would write separate liquidity rules for foreign banks that are exempted from the rule that was finalized on Wednesday 
Liquidity standards for the handful of non banks overseen by the Fed would be issued by order  he said 
Separately  the Fed is working on rules to rein in banks that heavily rely on short term funding tools  and it will also need to implement forthcoming global requirements that would force banks to calculate their liquidity needs over a full year  the so called net stable funding ratio 
The Fed also reproposed margin requirements for swap trades conducted outside clearing houses  which function as middlemen by taking on the risk that trading partners cannot deliver on their promises to make them less risky 
Swaps  a form of derivatives  mushroomed during the pre crisis boom when they were only lightly regulated  Now  they must be routed through clearing houses  but some are so complex that they still won t be cleared  and the new rules set out how much money trading partners need to set aside 
Trading counterparties must post enough buffers to give themselves 10 days to unwind any deal going awry  the rules say  For cleared swaps  that period is one to five days 
That makes cleared swaps far cheaper to use  and market parties have said that the margin rules could have a direct impact on how popular these swaps are with clients 
The reproposal largely followed a global agreement released in 2013  and superseded an initial Fed proposal from 2011  The new U S  proposal was somewhat stricter in its definition of large financial end users  agency staff said 

The three agencies adopting both sets of rules are the Federal Reserve  the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

Increase in Revenues Partly Offset by Higher Expenses  For 2017  the company reported revenues of  3 17 billion  up 11 2  on a year over year basis  Results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 16 billion 
Comerica s revenues for the quarter were  830 million  up 15  year over year  Also  the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  819 6 million  The increase in revenues was supported by expanded net interest margin and higher fee income Net interest income increased 19 8  on a year over year basis to  545 million  Moreover  net interest margin expanded 63 basis points  bps  to 3 28  Total non interest income came in at  285 million  up 6 7  year over year  Increased card fees  fiduciary income and service charges on deposit accounts primarily led to the rise Further  non interest expenses totaled  483 million  up 4 8  year over year  The rise was chiefly due to higher salaries  advertising and software expenses  partly offset by lower restructuring expenses Loans Decline  Deposits IncreaseAs of Dec 31  2017  total assets and common shareholders  equity were  71 6 billion and  8 billion  respectively  compared with  73 billion and  7 8 billion as of Dec 31  2016 Total loans were down slightly on a sequential basis  to  49 2 billion  However  total deposits increased marginally from the previous quarter to  57 9 billion

For 2017  the company repurchased 7 3 million shares under its existing equity repurchase program  It returned a total of  724 million to its shareholders in the year Impressive Outlook for Full Year 2018
Comerica provided guidance for full year 2018 assuming continuation of the current economic environment and low rates  along with  270 million of benefits from the GEAR Up initiative 
The company anticipates net interest income to benefit from loan growth and increase in interest rates  Full year benefit from the rate hikes in 2017 is expected to be  110  125 million  assuming a 20 40  deposit beta for the December rate increase   Notably  elevated interest recoveries of  28 million in 2017 are not expected in 2018 
Non interest income is expected to increase 4   benefitting from GEAR Up opportunities  which will drive modest growth in treasury management  card fees  brokerage fees and fiduciary income  This expectation excludes deferred compensation of  8 million in 2017 
Non interest expenses are predicted to be up 1   affected by restructuring expenses of about  47  57 million and an additional  50 million benefit from the GEAR Up initiatives  Also  expenses related to revenue growth such as outside processing expenses are likely to increase  Pressure will also be created from higher technology expenses and inflationary conditions 
Provision for credit losses is expected to reflect continued solid performance in its overall portfolio  Notably  net charge offs are expected to remain low while provisions are expected to be in the range of 20 25 bps Income tax expenses are anticipated to be approximately 23  of pre tax income on the assumption of no tax impact from employee stock transactions Comerica expects average loans to increase in line with the gross domestic product  reflecting rise in most lines of business while remaining stable in Energy and Corporate Banking 
Our ViewpointComerica reported another strong quarter  The company remains well poised to benefit from its ongoing strategic initiatives  Additionally  its strong capital position continues to lend support  Further  the top line continues to benefit from easing pressure on margins  Lower tax rates and improving economic conditions are likely to continue supporting its financials going forward

share  reported loss of  18 3 billion or  7 15 per share Adjusted net income came in at  3 7 billion  up 4  year over year Overall top line strength was reflected  driven by higher banking and consumer banking revenues  along with loan growth  Moreover  expenses dropped on efficiency savings by the bank However  Citigroup s costs of credit for the fourth quarter were up 16  year over year to  2 1 billion  This rise largely reflects net credit losses of  1 9 billion and a net loan loss reserve build of  165 million For full year 2017  adjusted net income came in at  15 8 billion

surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  71 2 billion Revenues inched up 1  year over year to  17 3 billion in the reported quarter  The rise highlights elevated revenues in the global consumer

DeploymentDuring fourth quarter 2017  Citigroup repurchased about 74 million of common stock  Notably  the company returned around  6 3 billion to common shareholders as common stock repurchases and dividends Our ViewpointCitigroup reported impressive results this time around also  though the bank was impacted by non recurring non cash charges related to the tax reform  Furthermore  restructuring efforts  including streamlining moves  will likely continue to ease the bank s burden on the expense base  The company exhibits capital strength which continues to support its dividend and a share buyback program  Also  rise in revenues is commendable One can consider a strong brand like Citigroup to be a sound investment option over the long term  given its global footprint and attractive core

126340,347855,PNC,5 Major Bank Stocks Set To Trump Earnings Estimates In Q4,opinion,"The Q4 earnings season is knocking at the door and investors are keen to see how major banks will perform this time  after reporting impressive results in the first three quarters of 2017 The last year has been a roller coaster ride for banks  Though the year begun on an optimistic note with high expectations from President Trump s electoral promises  it lost some steam in the middle only to regain the bullish trend at the end Banks showed resilience driven by the Fed s hawkish stance  three rate hikes in 2017  and the gradually improving U S  economy  Also  progress on the lesser banking regulation front cheered investors Further  the new tax act drove the banks too  While the act will result in gains for banks over the long term  the to be reported quarter earnings will be adversely affected by huge one time charges related to the changes in the tax law Additionally  factors that weighed on major banks  prior quarter results persisted in Q4 as well  These  including trading weakness  slowdown in mortgage banking and stable net interest margins  will likely hamper profitability of major banks  On top of these  the above mentioned charges add fuel to the fire Also  while the absence of considerable legal expenses is a positive  increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings is expected to escalate costs moderately As such  major banks in the S P 500 index  accounting for nearly 45  of the  stotal earnings  are expected to witness a 6 3  year over year decline in earnings in the to be reported quarter  This compares unfavorably with 6 5  growth recorded in the prior quarter  For detailed look at the earnings outlook for this industry and others  please read our  article  
Nevertheless  strength in investment banking driven by a potential rise in equity issuances  strong rally in the equity market globally  and persistent increase in debt underwriting  mainly on assumption of continuous increase in interest rates  is expected to provide respite to some extent In addition to the benefits from the rising interest rates  a slight improvement in lending  particularly in the areas of commercial and consumer will offer marginal support interest income for banks Further  credit quality is anticipated to remain strong  backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards Choosing the WinnersWhile the upcoming results are not likely to be impressive  there are still a few major banks that are expected to outshine their peers  So  this is the right time for you to select some banking stocks that are well positioned to beat earnings estimates in their upcoming releases Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist  One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold    and a positive  
Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement  It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our

	The major indices started the day on positive ground and then gained steam throughout the session  The Dow climbed 0 81  today  or more than 200 points  to finish at 25 574 7  the index closed above 25 000 just one week ago  The NASDAQ was also up 0 81  to 7211 8 and the S P increased 0 7  to 2767 6  Each of those were fresh all time highs 
	The Russell 2000 also joined the party and had the most impressive advance on a percentage basis  jumping 1 73  to finish at its own record of 1586 8 
	Just as the market returned to making new highs  so too did the editors return to making new buys  Earnings season is the Surprise Trader s favorite time of year  so it made complete sense for Dave to add two new companies that are scheduled to report next week  Meanwhile  regional banks are expected to do well in a rising rate environment  and ETF Investor added a name that should be able to capitalize  Finally  Value Investor added a couple of stocks as well  one from the energy space and the other from retail  Learn all about these moves in the highlights section below Today s Portfolio Highlights Surprise Trader  Earnings season is about to pick up and so is activity in this portfolio  Dave promised a couple of buys before the end of the week  so here they are  Firstly  the editor is bullish on investment managers right now  Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate for eight straight quarters and earnings estimates continue to rise  The stock was added today with a 12 5  allocation ahead of its report before the bell next Thursday 
	The second buy is a vote of confidence in the US economy  GATX Corp  GATX  leases railcars and has an 8 3  Earnings ESP for its upcoming report  The company announces at the same time as MS next week and goes into the portfolio with the same 12 5  allocation  Read more about both of these buys in the complete commentary ETF Investor  It s looking pretty good for regional banks these days  given the improving economy  tax cuts  deregulation and especially rising interest rates  One of the most popular products in this space is SPDR S P Regional Banking ETF  MX KRE   The fund has  4 6 billion in assets under management  but Neena really likes that it is equal weighted among 109 securities  Equal weighting allows for greater exposure to mid  and small cap banks  which should benefit the most from tax reform  Read her complete commentary for more on this new addition Value Investor  Shares of C J Energy Services  CJ  have moved higher the past couple of months  but the stock is still cheap  This well construction company got good reviews from the market in November on its more than  130 million acquisition of oilfield cementing services company O Tex  While it is still likely to lose money in 2017  this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  is expected to make  2 66 in 2018 with a strong demand outlook for 2019  It doesn t report until early February  but Tracey bought it today 
	But that wasn t all  The strong holiday retail numbers convinced the editor to pick up Macy s  M   which she had been looking at for a while  Tracey s been a bit concerned about the department store giant since 2018 estimates are currently lower than 2017 s  but that could change as more analysts get bullish on the company  Plus  M is  still dirt cheap  and currently has a dividend that yields 5 9   Like CJ  the stock is a Zacks Rank  2 that reports in February  Get more specifics on these moves in the full write up

126360,347875,PNC,JPMorgan s Positive Kick off To Bank Earnings,opinion,"JPMorgan  NYSE JPM     is not only biggest player in the banking industry  but it also has a well earned reputation of being properly run  Wells Fargo    had that kind of shining reputation some time back  but that is a thing of the past  at least at this stage  JPMorgan s reasonably good quarterly results reconfirm its leadership position and likely provide read throughs for its peers that are on deck to report results in the coming days As expected  both JPMorgan and Wells Fargo came out with one time charges and gains related to the tax law changes  We will be seeing more of these one time charges from other industry players in the coming days and some of these charges will be really big  Citigroup  NYSE C  is expected to take a  20 billion charge   but we have to look past them and analyze real underlying trends  The tax legislation is producing these charges in the Q4 earnings reports  but we know for a fact that the new tax regime will benefit the profitability of banks  and other industries  directly as well as otherwise These tax related charges and gains aside  the set up for bank earnings is not that different from other recent quarters  Net interest margins remain under pressure as a result of low interest rates  growth in loan portfolios has been decelerating and trading revenues remain weak  We may have been almost a decade removed from the last financial crisis that shook the industry to its roots  but banks have yet to reach their full earnings power JPMorgan did as good as possible in this relatively difficult earnings environment for banks  but we can t say the same about Wells Fargo  JPMorgan s loan portfolio increased  4   with commercial   industrial loans up  6  and credit cards up  5   The  1  decline Wells  loan portfolio partly reflected the impact exit from auto lending  but there was weakness in other areas as well Wells  margins also suffered  with Q4 net interest margin at 2 84  below the preceding quarter s 2 86  level and the year earlier 2 87   JPMorgan s net interest margin was modestly up  both sequentially as well as year over year  PNC Financial    also showed gains in net interest margin as well as loan portfolio  which likely offers a more relevant read through for other regionals on deck to report results this week   In terms of Finance sector scorecard  we have results from only 4 sector companies in the S P 500  out of 97 total  out already  But these 4 companies are some of the largest in the entire index and account for 19 3  of the sector s total market capitalization in the index  Total earnings for these 4 Finance sector companies are down 1 4  from the same period last year on  4 3  higher revenues  with 75  beating EPS estimates and 50  beating top line estimates For the Finance sector as a whole  total Q4 earnings are expected to be up  4 5  from the same period last year  which would follow  7  decline in the sector s earnings due to weakness in the insurance industry as a result of the Gulf Coast hurricanes  Total Q4 earnings for the Zacks Major Banks industry  which accounts for roughly 45  of the sector s earnings  are expected to be down  2 6  from the same period last year on  5 2  higher revenues  This would follow  6 5  earnings growth in Q3 for the industry and  10  growth in 2017 Q2 The table below shows the sector s Q4 earnings growth expectations at the medium industry level contrasted with estimates for the following four quarters and actual results for the preceding three periods 

As you can see above  the sector s earnings growth picture is expected to materially improve in the coming quarters Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard  as of Friday  January 12  2018 Total earnings for the 26 S P 500 members that have reported results already are up  13 6  from the same period last year on  9 1  higher revenues  with 73 1  beating EPS estimates and 80 8  beating revenue estimates The charts below compare the Q4 results thus far from the 26 index members with what we had seen from the same group of companies in other recent periods 

This is still a fairly small sample of results and broad trends are hard to discern at this stage  That said  the momentum on the revenue side that we saw in the preceding earnings season appears to be still in place Expectations for Q4 As a WholeTotal Q4 earnings are expected to be up  9 2  from the same period last year on  7  higher revenues  This would follow  6 7  earnings growth in 2017 Q3 on  5 9  growth in revenues Please note that estimates for Q4 held very favorably since the quarter got underway  unlike the revisions trend that we have been seeing over the last few years  This revisions trend is the most notable positive development on the estimate revisions front in recent years  Q4 estimates for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors have come down since the start of the quarter  with estimates for the remaining 7 sectors going up  The strongest gains have been in the Energy  Industrial Products  Basic Materials and Technology sectors The table below shows the summary picture for Q4  contrasted with what was actually achieved in Q3 

In terms of sector focus  the strongest growth in Q4 is coming from the Energy sector which benefits from easy comparisons  Excluding the Energy sector  the aggregate growth pace drops to  6 5  from  9 2   Three of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have lower earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year  with the Conglomerates sector as the weakest of them all   15 8  lower earnings  The chart below shows Q4 earnings growth expectations contrasted with what is expected in the following three quarters and actual results in the preceding 5 quarters  As you can see in the chart below  the growth pace is expected to pick up in Q4 after dipping in the preceding quarter and continue accelerating going forward 

The chart below shows the weekly reporting calendar for the S P 500 index  As you can see  we have 27 index members reporting results this week  with the earnings season really ramping up the following week

Sentiment At 30 Year High   VIX At 50 Year Low
Our View  There is an old song called  How long has this been going on    The answer is  since March of 2009  Thats nine years of going up  or in S P 500 terms  an over a 300  gain  It s unbelievable  and so is the bullish sentiment  which is on a 30 year high  In  normal times   when sentiment is this high the S P sells off  but there is nothing normal about this  The big institutions are unloading bonds and buying stocks in size  The VIX is at a 50 year low  which seems to be the new normal 
Our view is we lean to lower prices today  Not a big down day  but a pullback  With the ES up 102 50 handles in 8 sessions  we don t think the it can keep going up as it has  According to the S P cash study for the January options expiration  the friday the week before the expiration has been up 15   down 19 of the last 34 occasions

126376,347891,PNC,Can Wells Fargo  WFC  Q4 Earnings Hide Mortgage Weakness ,opinion,"The projected decline in Wells Fargo   Company s   NYSE WFC   mortgage business will likely impact its fourth quarter earnings given significant dependence of its top line on this source  However  this might not lead the company to report dismal results on Jan 12  Benefits of higher rates and loan growth are anticipated to be positive factors Wells Fargo s mortgage banking revenues are expected to be low resulting from seasonality that might be eased due to immaterial negative MSR valuation adjustments  Notably  expectations of a higher rate environment might have encouraged refinancing activities during the quarter under review  Nevertheless  with the refinance boom nearing its end  no major help is expected from this segment Here are the other factors influencing Q4 results Loan Growth  Per the Federal Reserve s latest data  loans are expected to be in line on a sequential basis during the fourth quarter  Particularly  weakness in commercial and industrial  C I  loan growth will likely be offset by rising consumer loans  However  the auto portfolio run off is likely to continue into the near term on tightening of underwriting standards by Wells Fargo  Also  the bank is cutting back its auto lending business amid stressful markets and adherence of more centralized risk controls Rise in Net Interest Income  In addition to higher interest rates  a moderate improvement in lending might perk up interest income  Notably  management projects NII to grow in low  to mid single digits for 2017 Expenses May Trend Higher  Wells Fargo may record escalated costs given its franchise investments in areas  including mobile banking technology  digital lending and brokerage offerings  Wells Fargo anticipates the efficiency ratio to be around 61  in 2017  excluding the  1 billion discrete litigation accrual recorded in third quarter 2017 and any other non recurring expenses  Further  the company is targeting around  4 billion of cost savings by 2019  Of the total cost savings target  21  is expected to be achieved in 2017 Adverse impact of new tax code  The tax reform might result in elevated operating expenses from one time bonus payments  higher charitable contributions and investment losses from securities portfolio restructurings  Also  though the company has not providing any information about the write down of deferred tax assets  DTAs   it might record a significant one time charge in the to be reported quarter Why a Likely Positive Surprise

126377,347892,PNC,Why Earnings Beat Is Likely For PNC Financial  PNC  In Q4,opinion,"The PNC Financial Services Group   NYSE PNC   is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2017 results on Jan 12  before the opening bell  Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year 
Organic growth remains a key strength for PNC Financial  The quarter witnessed a rise in consumer confidence  which led to growth in consumer loan portfolio  Also  the rising interest rates came as an added advantage for the bank  Though  flatter yield curves offset the benefits to some extent  pressure on PNC Financial s net interest margin is likely to ease slightly from the three rate hikes in 2017 
Moreover  President Trump s success in executing the tax overhaul boosted the stock market during the quarter  which would greatly support PNC Financial s fee income  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of  4 17 billion indicates a 7 6  year over year improvement for the to be reported quarter 
Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store  let s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter 
PNC Financial s third quarter 2017 results improved primarily due to growth in loan balances and higher fee income  These factors also helped it in beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  the positives were partially offset by higher expenses and provision for loan losses 
Notably  PNC Financial delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters  with an impressive average beat of 4 6  
The earnings beat translated into improved price performance  Over the past year  shares of PNC Financial have gained 21 8   outperforming the 18 8  growth recorded by the  PNC Financial Services Group  Inc   The  Price and EPS Surprise   Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to PNC Financial s stock  This depends largely on whether the firm is able to deliver a positive earnings surprise 
Here s what our quantitative model predicts 
According to our quantitative model  chances of PNC Financial beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to be reported quarter are high  This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call 
You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for PNC Financial is  0 55  
Zacks Rank  PNC Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which when combined with a positive ESP  increases the chances of an earnings beat 
Though  earnings estimates for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 have been revised slightly downward over the past 30 days  they reflect year over year growth of 11 7  and 15 5   respectively 
Factors to Influence Q4 Results
Net Interest Income to Grow  In addition to higher interest rates  moderate improvement in lending  mostly in the consumer front  is likely to perk up interest income  Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net interest income is projected to be  2 39 billion  up 12 1  year over year 
Management expects its net interest income for the to be reported quarter to increase in low single digits on a sequential basis 
Controlled Expenses  The company had a cost saving program in place during the year to keep expenses under control  However  these efforts are likely to be partially offset by one time restructuring expenses due to the tax reform 
Muted Non Interest Income  The fourth quarter was exceptionally good for the investment banking and underwriting business  which might support the company s fee income 
On the other hand  with overall low volumes of M A during the quarter  the related fees are expected to be lower  Per the consensus estimate  total non interest income is expected to be  1 75 billion  slightly up year over year

126557,348072,PNC,Royal Bank Of Scotland s Remedy Plan Gets Regulatory Nod,opinion,"Royal Bank of Scotland  LON RBS    NYSE RBS   has received the European Commission s  EC  consent for an alternative remedy package it had put forth in July 2017  which promises to make U K  s small and medium sized banking market more competitive 
The package had been proposed as an alternative to the sale of Williams   Glyn  This divesture was part of the conditions that the EC had imposed on the bank for the  45 5 billion bailout it received during the crisis 
What the Remedy Plan Entails
Under the package  Royal Bank of Scotland would establish a  Capability and Innovation Fund  with  425 million  which would be granted to challenger banks in the U K  banking and financial technology sectors in order to encourage them to improve their financial stability 
Further  the bank will also provide another  350 million to  Incentivized Switching Scheme  which shall grant funds to eligible challenger banks to help them incentivize small business customers to move their accounts and loans from RBS  paid in the form of  dowries  to the receiving bank 
Also  if the uptake among customers looking to switch banks is not enough  the bank will provide  50 million more 
In order to administer both the funds  an  Independent Body  will be established that would also coordinate activities between the Royal Bank of Scotland and the challenger banks  A contribution of  20 million would be made to meet the operational expenses 
The package is expected to be launched in the first half of 2018 
The British bank also disclosed that the package is consistent with the  800 million provision it had built in relation to the expected costs 
Our Viewpoint
The bank would now be able to put behind the bailout and look forward to developing its business  Also  it would be able to distribute excess capital to its shareholders  thus enhancing their value

equivalent  for the quarter came in at  2 90 billion  up 3 9  year over year Tax equivalent net interest income rose 1 1  from the prior year quarter to  1 68 billion  Also  net interest margin increased 6 basis points  bps  from the prior year quarter to 3 47  Non interest income increased nearly 8  year over year to  1 22 billion  Rise in almost all fee income components  except mortgage

due to a fall in amortization of intangibles  net merger related and restructuring charges and outside IT services related costs BB T s adjusted efficiency ratio came in at 58 6   down from 59 6  in the prior year quarter  A fall in efficiency ratio indicates a rise in profitability As of Jun 30  2017  total deposits were nearly  157 billion  down from  161 3 billion in the prior quarter  However

126592,348107,PNC,Investors Flee SPDR S P Regional Banking ETF  KRE ,opinion,"There have been some mild outflows in recent sessions in the largest Regional Banking ETF  SPDR S P Regional Banking  MX KRE   NYSE KRE   Expense Ratio 0 35    3 billion in AUM   with approximately  275 million exiting the fund via redemption pressure 
This may be tied to the over  340 million that has vacated the largest U S  Financial Equity ETF  Financial Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLF   Expense Ratio 0 14    during this same timeframe  as it appears that portfolio managers are trimming exposure to the space   especially since XLF recently clipped and failed to hold its 50 day MA 
KRE remains the largest  Regional Banking  focused ETF in the landscape in spite of the recent outflows  and with its north of  3 billion in AUM it is nearly three times the size of its next largest rival in the segment  iShares US Regional Banks  NYSE IAT   Expense Ratio 0 44    658 million in AUM   and the third largest fund in this camp has only  151 million in assets under management  KBWR  PowerShares KBW Regional Banking Portfolio  Expense Ratio 0 35   
Recent volatility in this space amid the outflows does bring into consideration the trading oriented  Bear  products that track the Regional Banks  the lesser known Direxion Daily Regional Banks Bear 3X Shares  NYSE WDRW   Expense Ratio 1 10    5 million in AUM  and ProShares Short KBW Regional Banking  NYSE KRS   Expense Ratio 0 95    1 7 million in AUM  
When breaking down the underlying portfolio in KRE  we see that there are one hundred four individual holdings  and the fund follows a modified equal weighting scheme that is familiar to several other SPDR niche sector funds  Because of this  no individual holding takes up too much of the portfolio from a weighting standpoint unlike a market capitalization weighted ETF such as say XLF  where the two largest names are BRKb  11 26   and JPM  10 71   
Also  when we see flows into or out of KRE we typically think of them as a sector bet more so than anything company specific nor earning related  when on the other hand traders and portfolio managers will often use XLF and XLF options around the earnings reports of the major money center banks that populate the underlying index  The largest KRE holdings are as follows  1  FITB  2 50    2  BBT  2 49    3  PNC  2 46    4  ZION  2 46    5  STI  2 36

Bank Earnings Good  but Fail to Impress

JPMorgan  NYSE       and Citigroup  NYSE        handily beat earnings and revenue estimates whileWells Fargo  NYSE        beat earnings expectations but modestly missed revenue estimates  The market wasn t impressed these results  with all three bank stocks ending the otherwise positive Friday session in negative territory  A big reason for the market s lukewarm reaction to the seemingly positive bank earnings is the soft guidance for the current period  particularly from JPMorgan  This will likely show up in lowered Q3 estimates in the coming days 

	Bank stocks struggled in April and May as treasury yields kept going down  but they came back strong in June on the back of a trend reversal in yields and better than expected  Stress Test  results that opened up outsized capital returns opportunities  Most of the headwinds facing banks in Q2 weren t new  we knew that the capital markets business was soft due to muted volatility and that lower treasury yields would be weighing on margins even as growth in loan portfolios had started decelerating  Estimates had started coming down in the run up to these reports  but not by that much 
	Results from these money center banks and PNC Financial  NYSE        which also reported June quarter results on Friday  offer useful but not very favorable read throughs for the regional banks and investment banks coming out with results this week Finance Sector Scorecard
	It is still fairly early  with results from only 4 Finance sector companies in the S P 500  out of 95 total  out already  But these 4 companies are the some of the largest in the entire index and account for 22  of the sector s total market capitalization in the index  Total earnings for these 4 Finance sector companies are up  6 2  from the same period last year on  2 5  higher revenues  with all 4 beating EPS estimates and 3 beating top line estimates 

	What this shows is that the Q2 earnings and revenue growth pace is below what we saw from the same four banks in the preceding quarter  but is otherwise better than other recent historical periods 
	Total Q1 earnings for the sector as a whole  combining the reported actual results with the still to come estimates  are expected to be up  9 3  from the same period last year on  1 7  higher revenues 

	Please note that the sector s earnings growth expectation has gone up following the better than expected big bank results  It is very likely that the overall growth pace for the sector outpaces the strong showing we saw from the sector in the preceding period 

	The Major Banks industry  of which JPMorgan  Wells Fargo and others are part  accounts for roughly 45  of the sector s total earnings  insurance is the second biggest earnings contributor  accounting for about 25  of the total  Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard  as of Friday  July 14  2017 
	We now have Q2 results from 30 S P 500 members that combined account for 9 3  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these companies are up  13 8  from the same period last year on  6  higher revenues  with 83 3  beating EPS estimates and an equivalent proportion beating revenue estimates 

	This is still a fairly small sample of results  but what has come out already represents an improvement over what we had seen from the same group of index members in other recent periods 
	We have a very busy docket of reports this week  with more than 200 companies reporting results  including 68 S P 500 members  But we can clearly say that the Q2 earnings season is off to a good start  By the end of this week  we will have seen results from almost one fifth of the S P 500 members 

Q2 Expectations
	Total Q2 earnings are expected to be up  6 6  from the same period last year on  4 5  higher revenues  This would follow  13 3  earnings growth in 2017 Q1 on  7 0  revenues growth  the highest growth pace in all most two years

126627,348142,PNC,Why Bank ETFs Fell On Friday Despite Decent Earnings ,opinion,"Financial stocks suffered sell offs on Friday despite upbeat earnings  Bellwethers like JPMorgan   NYSE JPM   and Citigroup   NYSE C   breezed past the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC   missed revenue estimates but beat on earnings  read    
Though there were positive attributes like loan growth and improving net interest spread  the decline in U S  Treasury yields weighed on the sector  Added to this  a somewhat subdued outlook provided by a few industry leaders led to Friday s fall in banking shares 
Decline in Yields
The yield on the 10 year note dropped five basis points to  on July 14 on downbeat inflation number and retail sales data  This once again stirred speculation over whether the Fed will be able to enact one more rate hike this year  In any case  dovish remarks from Fed chief Yellen kept Treasury yields at check  read    
The Fed chair has full faith in the U S  economic growth momentum with a solid labor market  though she remains cautious about subdued inflation and wage growth  Yellen indicated that since the neutral rate   at which economic growth matches its     is currently quite low by historical standards  the federal funds would not have to rise all that much further to get to a neutral policy stance  
Inside Doubtfulness Tied to the Outlook 
J P Morgan expects net interest income to grow by  4 billion this year  down from the prior guidance of  4 5 billion  due to a combination of mortgage adjustments  weakness in markets related income  and an unexpected slump in 10 year bond yields  as per an article published on   Shares of JPM were down 0 9  on July 14 
Reuters went on to explain that Citi Group depends less on deposits from consumers  who have not required higher rates as fast as institutional customers  Notably  a huge portion of Citigroup s loan growth originated from credit cards which are devoid of balances and thus do  not earn interest from those loans   Shares of Citigroup lost about 0 5  on July 14 
Wells Fargo benefited from higher interest rates but   and weaker revenue in areas like mortgage banking  were concerns  Wells Fargo witnessed a slump in car loans and tighter lending standards hurt the segment  going by article published on   WFC lost about 1 1  on July 14 
PNC Financial   NYSE PNC   also came up with an impressive scorecard but dampened  as it did not beef up its guidance  The stock shed over 0 1  on July 14 
Banking ETFs  Performance
The largest financial ETF Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund  lost over 0 4  on July 14  Banking ETFs like SPDR S P Regional Banking  MX KRE  ETF  CO KRE    PowerShares KBW Bank Portfolio ETF    iShares U S  Regional Banks ETF    LON IAT     SPDR S P Bank  MX KBE  ETF  and First Trust NASDAQ ABA Community Bank Index Fund    shed about 0 6   0 8   0 7   0 5  and 0 9   respectively  on July 14  see   
What Lies Ahead 
Overall  the banking sector is on growth path  JP Morgan reported a  year over year increase in total net revenues to  26 4 billion for the second quarter of the year  An 8  jump in interest income spurred by rising rates and an advancement in the number of loans facilitated revenue improvement 
There was also a double digit uptick in J P  Morgan s card sales and merchant processing volumes  Citigroup reported 2  year over year expansion in revenues to  17 9 billion helped by the retail division and investment banking 
Investors should note that major banks are expected to report about 4 5  earnings growth in the second quarter of 2017  Zacks Industry Rank for banks is still in the top 28   Still  the interest rate is the key risk in the space  which is why the Zacks Sector Rank for banks is in the bottom 25

126661,348176,PNC,Etsy  Yamana Gold  HSBC Holdings  ING Group And Reckitt Benckiser Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   July 11  2017   Etsy  Inc   NASDAQ        as the Bull of the Day  Yamana Gold Inc   NYSE        as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on HSBC Holdings  LON HSBA   NYSE         ING Group N V   NYSE        and Reckitt Benckiser  OTCMKTS        

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

   

Etsy  Inc   NASDAQ       is attempting to become profitable for the first time since its IPO in 2015  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  is expected to grow sales and earnings by the double digits in 2018 

	Etsy is the online market place where people make  sell and buy unique goods  Founded in 2005  it is headquartered in Brooklyn and went IPO in 2015 Revenue Rises Double Digits in the First Quarter
	On May 2  Etsy reported first quarter results and met the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 00 
	But while investors have been focused on the lack of earnings growth  sales continue to climb 
	Revenue was up 18 4  to  96 9 million driven by growth in both Markets and Sellers Services  Markets revenue was up 14 1  due to growth in transaction fee revenue while Seller Services jumped 23 9  year over year due to revenue growth in Etsy Payments 
	In the quarter  it launched Etsy Studio  it s first new market since 2005  It is trying to target the craft supplies market and believes it can have an edge in that category 
	For the year  sales are expected to grow 19  with another 17 7  in 2018 

  

Yamana Gold Inc   NYSE       has been riding higher gold prices to bigger profit  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   however  isn t expected to see as great a 2017 as originally hoped 

	Yamana produces gold  silver and copper from its six producing mines in Canada  Brazil  Chile and Argentina  Gold  however  is its primary focus Do Earnings Matter for Commodities Companies 
	On May 3  Yamana reported its first quarter 2017 results and missed the Zacks Consensus by 3 cents  Earnings were a loss of  0 01 versus the consensus of  0 02 
	It has missed four quarters in a row 
	But with miners it s really about what they re getting out of the ground 
	In the quarter  it saw total gold production of 257 533 ounces  silver production of 1 08 million ounces and copper production of 26 5 million pounds Raised Full Year Production
	The good news was that it raised full year production to 940 000 ounces of gold from its original guidance of 920 000 ounces of gold 
	In early 2018  it will be producing from 7 mines  instead of 6  when production starts at Cerro Moro Earnings Estimates on the Decline
	Because there are so many moving parts with miners  including labor costs and fluctuations in the price of the commodity  the earnings estimates can be volatile 
	Two estimates have been lowered for 2017 over the last 60 days  This has pushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate down to  0 07 from  0 13 just 90 days ago 
	These cuts are why you see the Zacks Rank of  5  Strong Sell

Running of the Bulls  Global Week Ahead

	In the Global Week Ahead  the second quarter  Q2  earnings season kicks into a higher gear 

	So far  a strong reporting season is shaping up  The bulls are running  The bears are left feeling a little hungry these days 
	As of Friday  July 7th  5  of S P 500 companies had reported results for Q2  78  of the 25 reporting beat their mean EPS estimate  For comparison  the 5 year average is 68   Add to that  87  beat their mean sales estimate 
	For Q2 2017  the overall S P 500 blended earnings growth rate rests at  6 5   Going into Q1  estimated EPS growth was  9 0   That quarter ended at  14 0  
	While the second quarter estimate is lower  it still should be a strong quarter  and the 4th quarter in a row that shows positive earnings momentum  Remember the  Earnings Recession   That saga ended in the second half of 2016 
	The bears can focus on retailers  Utilities and Consumer Discretionary hold the negatives  The remaining nine of eleven S P 500 sectors expect earnings growth  led by the Energy sector 
	What of current S P 500 valuations  The forward 12 month P E ratio for the S P 500 is 17 3  This P E ratio is above the 5 year average  15 3  and the 10 year average  14 0   That shows a source of sincere concern  Momentum has carried this stock market far  but can it reverse easily  Yes  It can  Tech just showed us how 
	To finish this earnings season review off  covering stock strategists are staying bullish  The bottom up S P 500 price target in 12 months  time sits at 2 650 
	On Friday July 14th  the major U S  financial groups begin reporting before the market opens  BMO   This includes JP Morgan Chase  NYSE JPM   Zacks  3 Rank   Citigroup  NYSE C   Zacks  3 Rank   Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   Zacks  3 Rank  and PNC Financial  NYSE PNC   Zacks  3 Rank  
	Rate hikes can be a bearish catalyst  Away from Q2 earnings season  there are two Fed governor speeches to note 
	On Tuesday  Governor Brainard speaks on normalizing central banks  balance sheets  On Wednesday  and Thursday  Chair Yellen s testimony to both chambers of Congress could carry surprises 
	Next Thursday  a pair of central bank policy decisions will focus on Latin America  From a 4 0  policy rate  Peru may ease 25 basis points  In Chile  the policy rate sits at a lower 2 5   No change is expected there 
	In Asia  the week also offers a monetary policy decision out of South Korea and Malaysia Top Zacks  1 Rank  STRONG BUY  Stocks 
	HSBC Holdings   NYSE        This  188B market cap U K  global bank holding company is looking good  But the long term Zacks VGM score is F ING Group N V    NYSE        This  69B in market cap Dutch banking conglomerate is looking good  too  Again  the Long term Zacks VGM score is F  That means the good news is all priced in on big banks in Europe Reckitt Benckiser   OTCMKTS        This  70B market cap Soaps and Cleaning Materials stock is worth a look  The Zacks VGM score is C

PNC stock is beating the market  and it reports earnings next week  But does that make it a good buy today  To answer this question  we ve turned to the Investment U Stock Grader  Our Research Team built this system to diagnose the financial health of a company 
Our system looks at six key metrics   
  Earnings per Share   EPS  Growth  PNC reported a recent EPS growth rate of 17 06   That s below the banking industry average of 208 14   That s not a good sign  We like to see companies that have higher earnings growth 
  Price to Earnings   P E   The average price to earnings ratio of the banking industry is 29 72  And PNC s ratio comes in at 16 7  It s trading at a better value than many of its competitors 
  Debt to Equity   The debt to equity ratio for PNC stock is 119 95   That s below the banking industry average of 327 02   The company is less leveraged 
  Free Cash Flow per Share Growth   PNC s FCF has been higher than that of its competitors over the last year  That s good for investors  In general  if a company is growing its FCF  it will be able to pay down debt  buy back stock  pay out more in dividends and or invest money back into the business to help boost growth  It s one of our most important fundamental factors 
  Profit Margins   The profit margin of PNC comes in at 27 21  today  And generally  the higher  the better  We also like to see this margin above that of its competitors  PNC s profit margin is above the banking average of 25 48   So that s a positive indicator for investors 
  Return on Equity   Return on equity gives us a look at the amount of net income returned to shareholders  The ROE for PNC is 8 7   and that s below its industry average ROE of 11 77  
PNC stock passes four of our six key metrics today  That s why our Investment U Stock Grader rates it as a Buy With Caution ",2017-07-06,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-you-buy-pnc-stock-before-earnings-200199363,200199363
126689,348204,PNC,Have Bank Stocks Finally Turned Around ,opinion,"Bank stocks have experienced a fairly dramatic turnaround since the beginning of last month  with a number of major bank stocks trading at or near their highs for the year  The Zacks Major Banks industry  which includes all the money center banks and big regionals like JPMorgan  NYSE JPM     and PNC Financial    that kick off the Q2 earnings season for the industry on Friday July 14th  is now up  7   on the year  closing the gap with the S P 500 index s  7 8  year to date gain But as you can see in the chart below  the industry has handily outperformed the broader market since early June  blue line represents the banking industry  

Trends in treasury yields have an outsized bearing on bank stocks since they are a big driver of bank margins  You can see this correlation in the year to date stock performance of the industry relative to the 10 year treasury yield  with bank stocks moving in sync with the treasury yield bounce since mid June 

As important as yields are for banks  we should also be mindful of the group s successful completion of the Fed s  Stress Tests  in late June that allowed many of them to get the central bank s nod to announce major share buyback and dividend hike programs  One can reasonably argue that with both of these positives now fully discounted  any further gains for bank stocks will follow quarterly results that start coming out on Friday My reading of the tea leaves suggests that banks  Q2 results may turn out to be lot less impressive than what we saw from the group in the preceding reporting cycle  Trends in core profitability drivers weren t as favorable in Q2 as they were in Q1  These include lower treasury yields  since partly reversed   continued deceleration in loan growth  and an overall trough backdrop for the capital market and advisory businesses Estimates for a number of these banks have come down in recent days and weeks to reflect these developments  But I suspect that they haven t fallen enough to fully reflect the relatively softer ground realities   What Are Banks Expected to Report in Q2 Estimates were going up at this stage in the last earnings season  but they have come down for all the major industry players  including JPMorgan     Wells Fargo    and Citigroup    that will report results at the end of this week For the Finance sector as a whole  of which the Major Banks industry is the biggest earnings contributor  total Q2 earnings are expected to be up  5 8  from the same period last year on  2  higher revenues  This would follow  10 5  earnings growth in 2017 Q1 on  5 2  higher revenues 
The table below shows the sector s Q2 earnings growth expectations at the medium industry level contrasted with estimates for the following four quarters and actual results for the preceding three periods 

Please note that the Major Banks industry  of which JPMorgan  Wells Fargo and others are part  accounts for roughly 45  of the sector s total earnings  insurance is the second biggest earnings contributor  accounting for about 25  of the total  Expectations for Q2Total Q2 earnings are expected to be up  5 8  from the same period last year on  4 5  higher revenues  This would follow  13 3  earnings growth in 2017 Q1 on  7 0  revenues growth  the highest growth pace in all most two years Estimates for Q2 came down as the quarter unfolded  with the current  5 8  growth down from  7 9  at the end of March  The chart below shows how Q2 earnings growth expectations have evolved over the last three months 

Please note that while Q2 estimates have followed a well traversed path that we have been seeing consistently over the last few years  the magnitude of negative revisions compared favorably to other periods  In other words  Q2 estimates have come down  but they haven t come down by as much The table below shows the summary picture for Q2  contrasted with what was actually achieved in Q1 

The chart below shows Q2 earnings growth expectations contrasted with what is expected in the following three quarters and actual results in the preceding 5 quarters  As you can see in the chart below  this growth pace is expected to continue through the rest of the year 

Scorecard for Early Q2 ResultsWe will start getting June quarter results this week  with Pepsi s    report on Tuesday as the first such release  But we have been getting quarterly reports from companies with fiscal quarters ending in May for the last many weeks and all of those reports form part of the Q2 tally as well  In total  we have such Q2 results from 23 S P 500 members already It is hard to draw any firm conclusions from the results thus far  but total earnings for these 23 index members are up  26 1  from the same period last year on  8 3  higher revenues  with 82 6  beating EPS estimates and an equivalent proportion beating revenue estimates The table below shows the current Q2 earnings season scorecard 

Note  Here are few key points to keep in mind while reading this report      a     All the earnings analysis in this report pertains to the S P 500 index  a handy proxy for the entire business world  We use the index s current membership as the basis for all period comparisons  meaning that even historical periods reflect the index s current membership      b     We divide the corporate world into 16 sectors compared to the official S P 10 GICS  We have stand alone sectors like Autos  Construction  Conglomerates  Aerospace  Transportation and Business Services that provide for a better understanding of trends in these key areas of the economy      c     All references to  earnings  mean  total earnings  and not  mean or median EPS      d     We make adjustments to reported GAAP earnings to account for non recurring or one time items  but we do consider employee stock options  ESOs  as a legitimate business expense  Unlike Zacks  Wall Street and all other data vendors don t treat ESO s as a recurring business expense 
The chart below shows the weekly calendar of earnings releases for the entire Q2 earnings cycle  As you can see  we are about two weeks away from the reporting cycle really ramping up  We will be getting Q2 results from 37 companies this week  including 8 S P 500 members

	Chicago  IL   May 12  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Macy s  NYSE           Kohl s  NYSE           NVIDIA Corp   NASDAQ           PNC Financial  NYSE          and Anthem  NYSE          

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations     

Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  

Stocks   Retail Sector Earnings Scorecard

	Stocks started Thursday s session in the red  on downbeat earnings results from Macy s  NYSE         and Kohl s  NYSE         and a hotter than expected wholesale inflation reading that adds to the likelihood of a Fed rate move at the June FOMC meeting  Tomorrow s CPI reading has assumed relatively more significance following this morning s PPI report 

	Macy s and the broader department store space has been struggling for a while given their inability to adjust to the changing consumer spending landscape of growing online sales weighing on foot traffic in the brick and mortar facilities  Macy s results were a bit more disappointing this morning as it not only came out with a bigger than expected decline in same store sales but also missed consensus EPS and revenue estimates  Kohl s did better with respect to EPS and revenue results  on the back of disciplined inventory management  but same store sales missed the mark 

	We provide the Q1 earnings season scorecard for the Retail sector below  but please note that this daily publication features the best research output of the Zacks analyst team  In today s write up  we are featuring analyst reports on 16 major stocks  including reports on NVIDIA Corp   NASDAQ          PNC Financial  NYSE          and Anthem  NYSE           These reports have been hand picked from amongst the 70 or so stock research reports published by our analyst team today  You can see all of today s research reports     

Retail Sector Scorecard  as of Thursday  May 11th 

	Including this morning s releases from Macy s and Kohl s  we now have Q1 results from 23 of the 42 retailers in the S P 500 index  for the index as whole  we now have results from 452 members   Total earnings for these 23 retailers are up  1 9  from the same period last year on  4 7  higher revenues  with 56 5  beating EPS estimates and an equal proportion beating revenue estimates 

	Please note that we have a stand alone Retail sector  unlike the official Standard   Poor s placement of this space in the Consumer Discretionary sector  The Zacks Retail sector includes  besides the traditional department stores and other brick and mortar retailers  the online vendors like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Priceline and restaurant operators  Most of the 23 Zacks Retail sector companies that have reported Q1 results already at this stage are online vendors and restaurant players  with the traditional retail operators starting the reporting process with this morning s Macy s disappointment 

	The aggregate results from the 23 retailers that have reported Q1 results already are tracking below what we had seen from the same companies in other recent periods  This is despite the  41 1  growth in Amazon s earnings on  22 6  higher revenues  On an ex Amazon basis  the sector s Q1 earnings growth would be modestly in the negative

  Segment wise  on a year over year basis  the quarterly net income in Corporate   Institutional Banking and Other  including BlackRock  improved 22  and 30   respectively

Our ViewpointWe believe that PNC Financial is well positioned to grow  given its diverse revenue mix  balance sheet strengthening efforts and improving credit quality  Further  an increase in lending activities augurs well for the company  Easing margin pressure due to rising interest rates should continue to support its top line PNC Financial Services Group  Inc   The  Price and EPS Surprise   Currently  PNC Financial carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

126823,348338,PNC,Louisiana Pacific  Bed Bath   Beyond  Roche Holdings AG  Adidas AG And Deere Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   April 11  2017   highlights Louisiana Pacific  NYSE        as the Bull of the Day  Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ        as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Roche Holdings AG  OTCMKTS         Adidas AG  DE ADSGN   OTCMKTS        and Deere and Company  NYSE        

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

  

	It appears as though the housing market is back on track  Prices are rising across much of the country  while fears over higher rates down the line are leading to a bit of a scramble among prospective buyers and investors  Add in a relatively solid jobs market  and you have a pretty great situation for the housing space heading into the crucial spring buying season 

	This scenario could be great for homebuilders too  as these companies look to satisfy this sudden burst of demand  However  it could also be a fantastic situation for those in the building products space  as homebuilders will need to get their essentials from somewhere  That is why investors interested in the solid housing market story may want to look to stocks like Louisiana Pacific  NYSE        in this environment for another way to play this bullish story 

LPX in Focus

	Louisiana Pacific is based in Nashville  and the company is currently the world s largest producer of oriented strand board panels  while it also specializes in a variety of other wood building products  These products are used in a variety of homebuilding and other construction activities  making LPX the perfect company to benefit from a surge in homebuilding that could result from the increased demand 

	Analysts seem to agree with this sentiment too  as the wood industry in the building and materials market currently has a Zacks Industry Rank just outside the top 5  overall  Add in a sector rank in the top quarter  and the space that LPX finds itself in looks pretty promising right now from the high level look

	And while this solid trend is important  fundamentals also look great for LPX  The company currently has an  A  VGM score which includes an  A  Grade for growth  And with cash flow growth that is nearly 10 times the industry average  sales growth that is also easily above the average  and a projected EPS growth north of 70   it is easy to see why LPX has such solid rankings 

	But beyond that  LPX also shines when it comes to recent earnings estimates too  Analysts have been racing to raise their estimates for Louisiana Pacific stock  and we haven t seen any cuts in the past sixty days for either the current quarter or the current year 

  

	I hate to keep piling on the retail industry  but we are kind of at the point where some investors might start to look for some value plays amid the rubble  This probably isn t a great idea for most  as the retail sector still is at the bottom of the Zacks Sector Rank list  a position it has occupied for the better part of the past two months now  suggesting more rough trading may be ahead 

	A great example of this value trap may be Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ        stock  Sure  BBBY is down about 16  in the past year  it recently beat earnings estimates  and its forward PE is a reasonable 9 1  but that doesn t mean that a turnaround is at hand  Instead  more pain could actually be in the near future for this stock  at least if we look to recent earnings estimates 

BBBY Estimates

	Though BBBY is coming off of a recent earnings beat  this was actually just the company s first beat in the past year  and it is still posting an average surprise of  5 8  in the past four quarters  Additionally  analysts have been slashing estimates for BBBY stock  almost across the board  For the current quarter we have seen eight estimate cuts in the past two months compared to zero increases  while we have seen eleven cuts for the fully year compared to zero increases 

	The magnitude of these estimate cuts has also been troubling  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by roughly 14  in the past week  while we have seen a five percent slice to the consensus estimate for the full year in the past week as well  The following year estimates have also taken a hit  suggesting that the pain looks to continue for this stock in the near term  at least if the recent earnings estimates are any guide

Huh  Brazil Matters 

	In this Global Week Ahead  the first quarter earnings season launches 

	On Thursday  the Q1 earnings season unofficially starts for 2017  A burst of large bank quarterly results come out  including JP Morgan  Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   Citigroup  NYSE C   BlackRock and PNC Financial  NYSE PNC  

	Last week  tomahawk missiles fired at Syria  U S  Navy ships were sent nearer to North Korea  and China s trade relationship with the U S  helped push up the value of safe haven positions   and just briefly helped sell off stocks 

	To start this Global Week Ahead  those worry trades have disappeared 

	Day traders who want to go short don t have much to play with  President Trump and President Xi got on well during their first summit  held in Florida 

	The two countries agreed to work together    over the next 100 days    to reduce the chance of a trade war  China offered better market access for financial sector investments and U S  beef exports 

	Those two trade concessions    on finance and beef    are basically already in hand  Had President Obama been in office another six months  China would have raised its investment ceilings in financial services companies anyway  The China ban on U S  beef exports only goes back to 2003 

	On his way  flying back to China  President Xi stopped for a brief photo op personal experience at Beluga Point on the Turnagain Arm outside of Anchorage  Alaska 

	Xi has a learned sense on world history  This is the place where the storied Pacific Ocean explorer  the English Capt  James Cook  hunted for the Northwest Passage to China in the late 18th century 

	The biggest macro news this week  surprisingly  likely comes out of Brazil 

	On Wednesday  consensus expects Banco Central do Brasil  aka the central bank of Brazil  to cut its SELIC policy rate 100 basis points    from 12 25  to 11 25  

	If accomplished  this will be the biggest rate decline from a single Brazilian monetary policy decision in the current easing cycle  It will also mark the biggest single meeting decline since June 2009  Further  speaking historically  its size is eclipsed only by a 150 basis point decline seen in April 2009 

	Rapidly falling Brazilian inflation is now providing room for easing  Peaking at  10 7  y y in January 2016  Brazilian inflation now runs under  5  y y  Risk markets in Brazil have also sharply pared down forward inflation expectations 

	Brazil factors as a huge part of any emerging market risk play  Hence  this big a rate cut bodes well for emerging market stock liquidity generally 

	Emerging markets stock indexes have been roundly beaten down for years  This big a rate cut   coming from a major player    could be a compelling upside reversal catalyst

126849,348364,PNC,Profit From The Federal Reserve s Ties To Big Banks,opinion,"The Federal Reserve and America s big banks have a close relationship  Maybe too close 
This relationship formed more than a century ago  And there s a not so far fetched conspiracy theory that it formed specifically to serve big banks   If you really want to take a trip down the rabbit hole  read   
Today s chart shows that this connection is alive and well 
Above  we have plotted the S P U S  Bank Index and the federal funds upper target rate  As you can see  bank stocks have moved higher as rates have increased 
Over the last 12 months  U S  banks have outperformed the S P by 154 29  
This is largely because of two rate hikes in December of both 2015 and 2016  These were the first hikes the Fed had made since 2006  before the financial crisis forced Fed policy to go  zero bound  
And after the FOMC meeting this coming Wednesday  big bank stocks should run even higher 
Below  I ll show you how you can profit from this rising trend  But first  let s examine why rates should move higher this week 
Another Federal Reserve Bump 
The Fed is holding its infamous Federal Open Market Committee monthly meeting on Wednesday  Fed Chair Janet Yellen and her cronies will decide whether they will jack up rates or leave them be 
Will they push the interest rate lever up a notch 
Strong economic data and Trump s recent speech have pushed the needle toward a rate hike 
Today  the probability of a March hike is close to 100   Two weeks ago  it was in the 30  range  So the likelihood of a 25 basis points bump   from an upper target rate of 0 75  to 1    is high  Very high 
Many believe a March hike is a done deal  A probability close to 100  helps confirm that  Especially after last Friday when Yellen stated   In short  we currently judge that it will be appropriate to gradually increase the federal funds rate  
Strong language from a person known for vagueness 
Even if a hike somehow doesn t come this month  future hikes could spark more rallies in bank stocks  And investors are pricing in possible deregulation in the industry as well  This could save big banks millions in compliance costs  It s yet another reason bank stocks have been surging higher 
Why Big Banks Love Rate Hikes
The relationship between the federal funds rate and banks  profit margins is a correlation every investor must know about 
The profitability of banks increases every time there is a rate hike  It all has to do with cash 
Banks hold vast amounts of cash  Think of all the cash you have stashed at your local bank    hopefully  Customer checking and savings accounts and business deposits make up these big pools of cash 
Big banks like JPMorgan Chase  NYSE  NYSE JPM   Wells Fargo  NYSE  NYSE WFC  and Citigroup  NYSE  NYSE C  are currently sitting on  23 8 billion   20 7 billion and  23 0 billion in cash  respectively 
And when rates move up  the yields banks earn on their cash goes up  This directly boosts their bottom lines 
It s all thanks to the  spread    the difference between the rate banks pay depositors and the rate at which they invest in short term notes  When rates rise  the spread increases in the short term  And this extra cash goes straight to the bank s earnings 
That s the reason why bank stocks have been on a tear over the last year    and the reason why bank stocks rally whenever there s a hint of rate hikes to come 
Come Wednesday  a rate hike and a big bump in bank stocks is expected 
An easy way to play this trend is with the iShares US Regional Banks  NYSE IAT   Its top holdings include US Bancorp  NYSE USB   PNC Financial  NYSE PNC  and BB T  NYSE BBT  
And if you want a more aggressive play  consider the Direxion Daily Regional Banks Bull 3X Shares  NYSE DPST   This leveraged ETF hands you three times the performance of U S  bank stocks 
If banks jump 3  on Wednesday  the ETF would increase 9   This play comes with more risk  since it also drops three times when bank shares pull back  If you have a weak stomach  stick to the traditional ETF ",2017-03-12,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/profit-from-the-federal-reserve’s-ties-to-big-banks-200178507,200178507
126850,348365,PNC,Can Banks Get Their Mojo Back ,opinion,"Bank stocks have lost some of their post election sheen  with the industry lagging the S P 500 index in the year to date period  particularly since the market s March 1st peak The Zacks Major Banks industry  which includes all the money center banks and big regionals like JPMorgan  NYSE JPM     and PNC Financial    that kick off the Q1 earnings season for the industry on Thursday April 13th  is up only  0 8  vs  the  5 2  gain for the S P 500 index in that time period  JPMorgan shares are barely in positive territory this year  up  0 3    effectively losing all of their  8 4  gain since the start of the year through March 1st  We should keep in mind however that bank stocks are still up big since election day  with the Zacks Major Banks industry up  23 6  since November 8th  JPM shares are up  22 5  in that same time period  The recent pullback is solely a function of policy uncertainty out of Washington  with market participants tempering expectations for tax and regulatory reform in the wake of the healthcare standoff  This reaction likely makes sense  But we do want to point out that the overall backdrop for this industry remains very favorable  particularly given the Fed s monetary policy stance  Treasury yields have been modestly trending lower lately  with the Syrian airstrikes and the mixed March jobs report likely adding to the trend a bit  But the market appears comfortable with the Fed s rate hike outlook  which should keep the overall interest rate trend favorable for the banks It is primarily this interest rate development that has driving analysts to raise their estimates for bank stocks  These positive estimate revisions aren t that notable for the March quarter  but they are significant for the second half of the year and next year The chart below shows the stock price performance of the Zacks Major Banks industry  dark blue line  and how aggregate annual earnings estimates for the space have evolved lately  The notable element in this chart is the evolving picture for 2018 estimates  the red line with an arrow above it   As you can see  estimates for 2017 have moved up as well  but the same for 2018 have notably turned around 

What Are Banks Expected to Report or Q1 We will see if JPMorgan     Wells Fargo     and Citigroup    will say anything about the policy questions when they report Q1 results this week  all reporting on April 13th   but they ll likely reiterate the improved interest rate backdrop  heightened investor risk appetites and favorable outlook for the U S  and global economy  March quarter estimates came down a bit for JPMorgan and Citigroup  but have remained relatively stable for Wells For the Finance sector as a whole  of which the Major Banks industry is the biggest earnings contributor  total Q1 earnings are expected to be up  5 4  from the same period last year on  2 9  higher revenues  This would follow  16 7  earnings growth in 2016 Q4 on  6 3  higher revenues The table below shows the sector s Q1 earnings growth expectations at the medium industry level contrasted with estimates for the following four quarters and actual results for the preceding three periods 

Please note that the Major Banks industry  of which JPMorgan  Wells Fargo and others are part  accounts for roughly 45  of the sector s total earnings  insurance is the second biggest earnings contributor  accounting for about 25  of the total  With earnings growth for the Major Banks industry expected to be just  0 2  for Q1  a strong showing from these big players will have a big impact on the entire sector  Better than expected results will likely prompt market participants to overlook the uncertainty out of Congress and acknowledge this industry s improved outlook  In other words  these stocks can get their mojo back with better than expected results in the coming days   Expectations for Q1 As a WholeTotal Q1 earnings are expected to be up  6 5  from the same period last year on  6 3  higher revenues  This would follow  7 4  earnings growth in 2016 Q4 on  4 7   the highest growth pace in all most two years Estimates for the quarter came down as the quarter unfolded  with the current  6 5  growth down from  10 4  at the end of December  The chart below shows how Q1 earnings growth expectations evolved over the last three months 

Please note that while Q1 estimates have followed well traversed path that we have been seeing consistently over the last few years  the magnitude of negative revisions compares favorably to other periods  particularly in the first half of last year and all of 2015  In other words  Q1 estimates have come down  but they haven t come down by as much The table below shows the summary picture for Q1  contrasted with what was actually achieved in Q4 

Please note that the Q1 earnings season follows the strong showing on the earnings front in the preceding reporting cycle  Not only did 2016 Q4 growth reach the highest in two years  but total earnings for the quarter also reached a new quarterly record  The strong Q4 performance came after the first positive earnings growth in 2016 Q3  having declined in each of the preceding 5 quarters Expectations Beyond Q1The chart below shows the Q1 earnings growth contrasted with what is expected in the following three quarters and actual results in the preceding 5 quarters  As you can see in the chart below  the growth pace is expected to ramp up in 2017 

You can see this improved earnings backdrop as the chart below of the S P 500 relative to forward 12 month Zacks Consensus estimates shows 

Please note that the earnings backdrop has not changed in any meaningful way since the November elections  notwithstanding the market s strong gains since then

	The Zacks Major Banks industry  which includes all the money center banks and big regionals like JPMorgan  NYSE        and PNC Financial  NYSE        that kick off the Q1 earnings season for the industry on Thursday April 13th  is up only  0 8  vs  the  5 2  gain for the S P 500 index in that time period  JPMorgan shares are barely in positive territory this year  up  0 3    effectively losing all of their  8 4  gain since the start of the year through March 1st  We should keep in mind however that bank stocks are still up big since election day  with the Zacks Major Banks industry up  23 6  since November 8th  JPM shares are up  22 5  in that same time period  

	The recent pullback is solely a function of policy uncertainty out of Washington  with market participants tempering expectations for tax and regulatory reform in the wake of the healthcare standoff  This reaction likely makes sense  But we do want to point out that the overall backdrop for this industry remains very favorable  particularly given the Fed s monetary policy stance  Treasury yields have been modestly trending lower lately  with the Syrian airstrikes and the mixed March jobs report likely adding to the trend a bit  But the market appears comfortable with the Fed s rate hike outlook  which should keep the overall interest rate trend favorable for the banks 

	It is primarily this interest rate development that has driving analysts to raise their estimates for bank stocks  These positive estimate revisions aren t that notable for the March quarter  but they are significant for the second half of the year and next year 

What Are Banks Expected to Report or Q1 

	We will see if JPMorgan  Wells Fargo  NYSE        and Citigroup  NYSE        will say anything about the policy questions when they report Q1 results this week  all reporting on April 13th   but they ll likely reiterate the improved interest rate backdrop  heightened investor risk appetites and favorable outlook for the U S  and global economy  March quarter estimates came down a bit for JPMorgan and Citigroup  but have remained relatively stable for Wells 

	For the Finance sector as a whole  of which the Major Banks industry is the biggest earnings contributor  total Q1 earnings are expected to be up  5 4  from the same period last year on  2 9  higher revenues  This would follow  16 7  earnings growth in 2016 Q4 on  6 3  higher revenues 

	Please note that the Major Banks industry  of which JPMorgan  Wells Fargo and others are part  accounts for roughly 45  of the sector s total earnings  insurance is the second biggest earnings contributor  accounting for about 25  of the total  

	With earnings growth for the Major Banks industry expected to be just  0 2  for Q1  a strong showing from these big players will have a big impact on the entire sector  Better than expected results will likely prompt market participants to overlook the uncertainty out of Congress and acknowledge this industry s improved outlook  In other words  these stocks can get their mojo back with better than expected results in the coming days 

Expectations for Q1 As a Whole

	Total Q1 earnings are expected to be up  6 5  from the same period last year on  6 3  higher revenues  This would follow  7 4  earnings growth in 2016 Q4 on  4 7   the highest growth pace in all most two years 

	Estimates for the quarter came down as the quarter unfolded  with the current  6 5  growth down from  10 4  at the end of December

126883,348398,PNC,BB T  BBT  Beats On Q3 Earnings   Revenues  Costs Rise ,opinion,A notable rise in the top line drove BB T Corporation s   NYSE BBT   third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of 76 cents per share  This comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents An improved net interest income and non interest income drove the better than expected results  Further  loans witnessed a strong growth  However  higher operating expenses and a rise in provision for credit losses were the headwinds Results excluded certain merger related and restructuring charges  After considering these  net income available to common shareholders was  599 million or 73 cents per share  compared with  492 million or 64 cents per share in the prior year quarter  Revenues   Expenses RiseTotal revenue  taxable equivalent basis  amounted to  2 81 billion  up 13 1  year over year  The figure outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 77 billion Tax equivalent net interest income rose 9 9  year over year to  1 65 billion  Further  net interest margin increased 4 basis points  bps  from the prior year quarter to 3 39  Non interest income increased 17 8  year over year to  1 16 billion  Rise in mortgage banking income majorly contributed to the increase Non interest expense of  1 71 billion was up 7 3  from the year ago quarter  This increase was driven by higher regulatory charges while rise in occupancy and equipment expense  outside IT services and software expense was largely offset by declines in merger related and restructuring charges  foreclosed property expense and professional services BB T s adjusted efficiency ratio came in at 58 7   down from 59 8  in the prior year quarter  A fall in efficiency ratio indicates an improvement in profitability As of Sep 30  2016  average deposits declined 0 5  from the prior month to  159 5 billion  Further  average loans and leases totaled  143 7 billion  up 0 4  sequentially Credit Quality DeterioratedProvision for credit losses increased 43 7  year over year to  148 million Also  as of Sep 30  2016  total non performing assets  NPAs  rose 13 3  year over year to  843 million  As a percentage of total assets

common equity rose to 8 87  from 8 14  as of Sep 30  2015 As of Sep 30  2016  Tier 1 risk based capital ratio was 11 8   compared with 11 7  in the year ago quarter BB T s estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III  on a fully phased in basis  was approximately 9 9  as of Sep 30  2016 Our TakeWe believe that BB T s growth trajectory will continue on the back of a robust loan and deposits improvement as well as a series of acquisitions  The inorganic growth will help the company generate operating leverage  going forward  However  margin compression led by a prevalent low interest rate environment  weak cost control and heightened regulatory issues will keep profitability under strain in the near term BB T CORP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Currently  BB T carries a Zacks Rank

Estimate of  1 78  Better than expected results were aided by increased net interest income as well as non interest income  Also  continued growth in loans and deposits were among other positives   However  on the downside  the quarter recorded higher expenses and provisions Backed by strong top line growth  Wells Fargo   Company s   NYSE WFC   third quarter 2016 recorded a positive earnings surprise of about 1   Specifically  the company s earnings of  1 03 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  Wells Fargo witnessed organic growth in revenues  Moreover  a strong capital

2016 earnings of  1 58 per share handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 40  Improved fixed income and equity trading revenues  higher mortgage banking fees and growth in investment

How have estimates been moving since then 
Following the release  and in the last month  investors have witnessed an upward trend for fresh estimates  There have been six revisions higher for the current quarter  while there have been zeros moves lower in the past month  and only two moves down in the last two months 
 PNC FINL SVC CP 12 Month EPS    
VGM Scores
At this time  PNC Financial Services  stock has a weak Growth score of  F   due in part to a poor historical cash flow growth level of about 3 99   However  the stock was allocated a grade of  C  on the value side  putting it in the third quintile for this investment strategy   The company also has a so so outlook on the momentum front  including a  C  grade  though PNC does have good earnings estimate momentum which includes rising estimates  while it has outpaced the industry from a four week and 12 week price change look too 
These metrics combine to give PNC stock a VGM score of  F   so there are definitely better choices out there for investors from a fundamental perspective  
Outlook
Overall  though estimates have been trending upward for the stock  the magnitude of these revisions looks promising  Interestingly  shares of PNC Financial Services have a Zacks Rank   3  hold   so we are just expecting an in line market performance over the next few months from the company  though rising rates and shifting estimates could definitely change this outlook before the next report

126904,348419,PNC,Watch These 4 Companies Report Earnings  JPM  WFC  C  PNC,opinion,"JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM   JPMorgan     along with the companies listed below  kick off bank earnings season Friday morning  The world s largest bank is coming off a better than expected second quarter that printed a massive beat on both the top and bottom line  This was primarily driven by stronger trading activity and a bounceback in the energy market  Most of what made the quarter so impressive is expected to carry into Friday s report 
This includes steady improvements in the energy sector  ongoing momentum in its mortgage business  and minor advances in market activity  However  the bank should see pressure from its advisory business  net interest income  and its commercial and industrial loan sectors  which appear to be running out of steam  An all but certain rate hike in December will be what investors were looking for to boost earnings and pop the stock 
Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   Wells Fargo    situation is slightly different than the rest of the banks this quarter  The bank was recently caught in a major scandal that resulted in a  185 million fine and more recently the resignation of its Chairman and CEO  John Stumpf  More importantly the termination of the fake accounts program will cause a near term hit to earnings  This fraud was artificially boosting earnings and is what drove the bank to prominence following the financial crisis 
Fortunately  Wells Fargo is the largest mortgage provider in the country and could lean on the sector for some support  Any insight into whether its other banking services has been impacted would be a huge blow that the stock wouldn t be able to sustain 
Citigroup  NYSE C   After worse than expected results during the second half of 2015 and first quarter of 2016  last quarter s 11 cent beat on the bottom line was a welcomed surprise  A lot of the weakness in the past couple of years have come as the bank s traditional engines of trading revenue  fixed income and currencies  have slumped due to high regulatory costs 
After years of cost cutting  Citigroup    decided to expand its business in the equity market  Trading revenues were strong in Q2 after a rough start to the year  Like many of the other big banks  uncertainty around Brexit and the global economy looms  The almost certain promise of a rate hike in December should mean a return to healthy interest revenues in the new year 
PNC Financial  NYSE PNC   PNC s    results have been largely mixed lately  Second quarter earnings topped expectations by a wide margin but revenue fell well below its target  The prior quarter was just the opposite as this up and down trends as continued for nearly 2 years  Friday s report appears to headed in the same direction with revenue forecasted up 1  and earnings down 6

    Another big bank  Citigroup Inc    NYSE C    is also not likely to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter as expenses are expected to trend higher  Further  margin pressure will continue However  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock should witness improvement in trading income and consumer banking revenues  Moreover  the Costco  NASDAQ COST  acquisition will support its top line to some extent   Read more   Nonetheless  Citigroup surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters  as shown in the chart below CITIGROUP INC Price and EPS Surprise
    Wells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC    similar to the above two banks  is less likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around  Continued margin pressure and mounting expenses are expected to hurt the results Nevertheless  the bank should benefit from momentum in mortgage business  Management expects mortgage origination volume to increase in the third quarter  reflecting normal seasonality and strength in the housing sector as well as mortgage banking segment   Read more   This Zacks Rank  3 stock has posted a positive average beat of 0 5  for the trailing four quarters  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of them  as demonstrated in the chart below WELLS FARGO NEW Price and EPS Surprise

126937,348452,PNC,Banking And Financial Sector Earnings Preview Roundup ,opinion,"JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM 
JP Morgan  JPM   the banking behemoth and Dow component  ahead of its earnings release  The company has been on a nice run for the last couple of months thanks to hopes for higher rates  but this report will be a test if this trend can continue heading into 2017 

Fortunately for JPM investors  shares of the stock have a Zacks Rank  2  buy   and the company was actually just upgraded into this territory within the past week  Additionally  the industry rank is just inside the top 50   so that is always welcomed news heading into a release 
However  it isn t all roses for JPM  as the most recent earnings estimates have been a bit sluggish  giving the company an Earnings ESP in negative territory  while it does have an  F  VGM score as well  These conflicting numbers suggest it will be a volatile report  though this is likely to be one where the outlook weighs on the shares more than anything  We expect JPM to report earnings of  1 39 share 
PNC Financial Services  NYSE PNC 
PNC Financial Services  PNC  is a Pittsburgh based bank  and the company has been on a nice trend over the past few months which includes a 10  gain  While this is obviously nice for investors  it really puts the pressure on this coming earnings season 

Fortunately for investors  PNC has a Zacks Rank  2  buy  right now  while the stock is in a top 50  industry  The company also has a pretty impressive track record in earnings season which includes just two misses in the last five years 
However  investors should definitely note that the fundamental picture isn t that impressive for PNC a VGM score of  D  while earnings estimates have been a bit sluggish  Estimates have been falling for much of the year and it will be crucial for this to turn around soon if PNC is going to keep up the momentum  We are looking for earnings of  1 78 share for PNC this quarter 
Citigroup  NYSE C 
Citi  C  has seen some incredibly volatile trading lately  but shares are definitely on the right track over the past few months  though earnings season will definitely put that to the test 

Investors should note that C has a great track record in earnings season  and the company hasn t missed earnings estimates since early 2015  Additionally  the stock has a Zacks Industry Rank in the top 50   so this is a good combination heading into the report 
Still  the stock has a VGM score of  D   while it has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   so it is hard to get too inspired by those figures  The company has also seen sluggish earnings estimates as of late  so the stock has arguably run ahead of earnings  at least leading into the report 
This could make this coming report a volatile one  though like many banking stocks this quarter  the outlook and expectations for rate hikes looks likely to weigh heavily on shares  Citigroup reports on October 14th before the bell and we are looking for earnings of  1 15 share 
Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  
Wells Fargo  WFC  has been under fire thanks to its recent scandal  and a retiring CEO  Shares have been under pressure for quite some time  and this is in stark contrast to other financials which have been able to prosper in the past few months 

The trend could continue for Wells Fargo in the near term too  at least if earnings estimate revisions are any guide  The company has been seeing a sluggish trend on this front  while it has an  F  VGM score as well 
However  it isn t all bad news for WFC  as the stock is in an industry that is in the top 50  overall  while the interest rate situation is going be a tailwind for the stock as well  Additionally  WFC just moved out of sell territory  so at least that is something for WFC investors these days 
Still  WFC is probably a stock to stay away from for most investors this earnings season  at least due to the overhang of the ongoing scandal  This is likely to dominate the picture on the earnings call  and it could influence the stock no matter how the actual earnings come in this quarter 
Furthermore  our fellow analyst  David Bartosiak  earlier this week by giving us his thoughts on the company  and he also gave us some insight on how to play the Options market ahead of Wells Fargo s earnings announcement  We expect Wells Fargo to report earnings of  1 02 per share

126949,348464,PNC,BankUnited  BKU  Fails To Gain Despite Q2 Earnings Beat ,opinion,"BankUnited  Inc   delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2  in the second quarter of 2016  Earnings per share of 52 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  Moreover  the bottom line exceeded the year ago quarter figure by 21  
	Results benefited from an increase in net interest and non interest income  Further  improvement in loans and deposits was a positive sign  However  elevated expenses and a significant rise in provisions acted as headwinds  which probably led the stock to decline 6 4  in after market trading 

	Net income for the quarter climbed 22  year over year to  56 7 million 





Revenue Rises Higher than Expenses
	Total net revenue surged nearly 20  year over year to  243 2 million  Moreover  it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  236 million 
	Net interest income climbed 18  year over year to  214 3 million led by higher interest income  partially pulled down by increases in interest expense  Nonetheless  net interest margin declined 20 basis points  bps  year over year to 3 8  
	Non interest income was  28 9 million  up 37  from the year ago quarter  The income drivers were reduction in net loss on FDIC indemnification  higher lease financing and net gain on investment securities available for sale  These were  however  reined in by lower net income from resolution of covered assets and net loss on sale of loans 
	Non interest expenses were up 17  from the year ago quarter to  144 1 million due to a rise in all components  except occupancy and equipment Credit Quality Deteriorates
	As of Jun 30  2016  the ratio of total nonperforming loans to total loans was 0 5   compared with 0 4  as of Mar 31  2016  Similarly  net charge offs to average loans was 0 10   compared with 0 09  in the prior quarter 
	Moreover  provision for loan losses increased 70  year over year to  14 3 million  It reflected increases in reserves related to the taxi medallion portfolio Balance Sheet Strengthens while Capital Ratios Deteriorate
	As of Jun 30  2016  net loans totaled  18 1 billion  compared with  17 0 billion as of Mar 31  2016  Further  total deposits amounted to  18 2  up from  17 5 billion as of Mar 31  2016 
	As of Jun 30  2016  Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8 7   down from 9 0  at the end of the prior quarter  Tier 1 risk based capital ratio came in at 11 8  compared with 12 1  as of Mar 31  2016  Total risk based capital ratio was12 6   compared with 12 8  as of Mar 31  2016 Profitability Ratios  A Mixed Bag
	While the return on average assets fell 2 basis points  bps  year over year to 0 9  as of Jun 30  2016  return on average stockholders  equity was 9 8   up from 8 7  as of Jun 30  2015 Our Take
	BankUnited s strong balance sheet and liquidity position will allow it to capitalize on available opportunities and grow inorganically  Additionally  emphasis on the commercial loan portfolio will likely accelerate growth 
	Nonetheless  persistent margin compression  increasing costs and exposure to risky residential loans will keep the company s financials under pressure in the near term

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which heading into the unofficial last week of Summer ahead of the Labor Day holiday the Equity markets are tired  consolidating at their highs and even pulling back 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue lower while Crude Oil extends to the upside  The US Dollar Index looks to continue higher short term in its broad range while US Treasuries are biased lower in consolidation  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are both looking like they will continue lower in the short run  more damaging for the Emerging Markets than the Chinese 
Volatility looks to remain subdued but back at more normal levels keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts have lost all their strength though and suggest they may continue to pause or pullback in the short run  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

	Digging into these numbers a bit  Retail Sales performed even better once we strip out auto sales   0 7    and the control group hit 0 5   The May figure dropped 0 3   but the forward look is pretty sunny  Charting inflation metrics  CPI retained  0 2  growth in June even with food and energy prices stripped out  This is lighter than the Producer Price Index  PPI  report yesterday  which rose 0 5   The Empire State Index number is the only weaker figure in the bunch  coming in well below June s 6 01  to 0 55  for July 

	All of these figures point to a favorable scenario going forward  Analysts had been hoping for a rebound in Q2  and thus far it seems to be taking place  And this without a widening maw of inflation indicators to rain on the parade 

	Speaking of parades  two more big Wall Street banks have reported Q2 earnings results before the bell today  Citigroup  NYSE C   posted an impressive earnings and revenue beat while Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   just met the consensus estimate on the bottom line while missing slightly on sales

offset by a decline of 14 basis points  bps  in net interest margin  NIM  to 3 06  Huntington s non interest income decreased 4  year over year to  271 million  The decline was mainly due to lower mortgage banking income  trust services fees and insurance income as well as lesser gain on sale of loans  These negatives were partially mitigated by higher service charges on deposit accounts  and cards and payment processing income Non interest expense increased 6  year over year to  524 million  The rise was primarily due to increased personnel costs  outside data processing along with other

Defensive Investors are defined as investors who are not able or willing to do substantial research into individual investments  and therefore need to select only the companies that present the least amount of risk  Enterprising Investors  on the other hand  are able to do substantial research and can select companies that present a moderate  though still low  amount of risk

PNC Financial Services Group Inc qualifies for both the Defensive Investor and the Enterprising Investor  In fact  the company meets all of the requirements of both investor types  a rare accomplishment indicative of the company s strong financial position    The Enterprising Investor has no initial concerns  As a result  all value investors following the ModernGraham approach should feel comfortable proceeding with the analysis 
As for a valuation  the company appears to be Undervalued after growing its EPSmg  normalized earnings  from  5 16 in 2012 to an estimated  7 04 for 2016  This level of demonstrated earnings growth outpaces the market s implied estimate of 1 57  annual earnings growth over the next 7 10 years  As a result  the ModernGraham valuation model  based on Benjamin Graham s formula  returns an estimate of intrinsic value above the price

127009,348524,PNC,Financial Sector Stock Earnings In Focus  JPM  PNC  USB ,opinion,"The banking sector was a prime target for many investors to start the year thanks to the prospect of multiple interest rate hikes  and a widening spread between long and short term rates  But with the Brexit and global market uncertainty  those hopes have been dashed  along with dreams of fat bank profits 
This could make the coming earnings season a very dicey one for banking stocks  and especially their outlooks  Let s take a look at three bellwethers  and how their reports are shaping up for the impending earnings season  
The first company we are taking a look at is US Bancorp  NYSE USB  which reports before the bell on Friday  This company has a Zacks Rank  4  sell  and a negative earnings ESP  largely thanks to the sluggish rate environment  However  USB hasn t missed estimates in five years  so expectations are definitely high heading into their results US BANCORP Price and EPS Surprise   
Next up is PNC Financial  NYSE PNC  which also reports before the bell on Friday  Much like its counterpart USB  this stock has a Zacks Rank  4  sell  and it has been crushed by the weak interest rate outlook  This company also has a decent track record in earnings season  but it is coming off a miss in its last report  Estimates have come down a lot for this name too  but it is going to be a question of if they have fallen too far  or not enough PNC FINL SVC CP Price and Consensus   
Lastly  we have JP Morgan  JPM  which is a bit more diversified than its counterparts  This may be part of the reason why JPM has managed to get a Zacks Rank  3  hold  and stay out of  sell  territory  Still  the stock has seen earnings estimates tumble heading into the report  while the full year outlook for the stock isn t great  making the outlook key for this company  to see how to trade JPM earnings make sure to   JPMORGAN CHASE Price and Consensus

127011,348526,PNC,Big Banks   C  WFC  PNC  USB   Set To Release Q2 Earnings ,opinion,The second quarter earnings season is knocking at the door with Wall Street giant JPMorgan Chase   Co    NYSE JPM   already setting the ball rolling and coming out with better than expected results  Next up are Wells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC    The PNC Financial Services Group  Inc    NYSE PNC    Citigroup Inc    NYSE C   and U S  Bancorp   NYSE USB    all of which will report their financial numbers on Jul 15 U S  banks have been braving hurdles since the beginning of this year  Even the last week of the quarter was marked by heightened volatility and uncertainty resulting from Britain s exit from the European Union As a matter of fact  a weak financial market  along with continued pressure on margins might stifle the banking sector s revenues yet again  The first two months of the quarter saw an increase in trading activity  which might have had a positive impact on trading revenues  While client activity was weaker in equities  it was higher for fixed income  However  June data is not expected to be good for trading and investment banking because of Brexit and other macro concerns  This may well offset the early momentum Further  the decline in M A activities and a weakening IPO market in the wake of global economic concerns persisted  While energy loans are still a concern  the provision requirement should not be as high as it was in the first quarter  thanks to the recovery in oil prices While investor confidence got a significant boost with most banks getting the 2016 capital plan approval  concerns over Brexit continued to weigh on these stocks Notably  per our   overall earnings for the Finance sector in second quarter 2016 are expected to be down 6 6  Let s take a look at four major banks that are scheduled to release their results tomorrow Wells Fargo   Company is scheduled to report second quarter 2016 results before the opening bell  It is unlikely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to be reported quarter as the global economy  persistently low interest rate environment and volatile oil prices plagued the company  The Brexit fallout added to its woes Nonetheless  the company is expected to benefit from the addition of assets of GE Capital  Also  the mortgage business seems to be looking up as the low rate environment could have pushed people to refinance home loans   Read more   Notably  Wells Fargo surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimates in three of the trailing four quarters  as shown in the chart below WELLS FARGO NEW Price and EPS Surprise   The PNC Financial Services Group  Inc  is also unlikely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter  Nevertheless  modest improvement in net interest income and a 10 12  expected rise in fee income are anticipated to drive top line growth However  continued pressure on net interest margin  seasonally higher expenses and expectations of continued stress in energy lending are potential headwinds  The bank is scheduled to report results before the opening bell   Read more   PNC Financial has posted a positive average beat of 4 06  for the trailing four quarters  having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of them  as demonstrated in the chart below PNC FINL SVC CP Price and EPS Surprise   Citigroup Inc  is expected to record a 28  year over year decline in net income  Consumer business revenues are expected to be down slightly on a sequential basis due to the absence of a one time gain experienced in retail services  Moreover  the company anticipates continued pressure on net interest margin  given that the Fed has not taken any step to raise interest rates However  trading and investment banking revenues for the quarter are expected to increase slightly on a sequential basis  while continued cost management should ease the expense burden to some extent   Read more   Notably  Citigroup recorded positive earnings surprises in all of the trailing four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 4 40   as shown in the chart below CITIGROUP INC Price and EPS Surprise   U S  Bancorp is slated to announce results before the opening bell  The company has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  with an  of  1 24   We generally do not consider Sell rated stocks going into an earnings announcement  especially when it is witnessing a negative earnings momentum  Non interest expenses are expected to be higher in the second quarter driven by expected seasonality and elevated expenses associated with brand positioning in the first quarter  Continued stress in energy lending could be an undermining factor However  net interest margin is expected to remain stable  while net interest income increases slightly  Further  loan growth is expected to be around 1 5   Low rates are expected to encourage higher real estate activity and lending as well  Notably  mortgage fees are anticipated to increase 10  to 20  based on seasonal higher application volume in second quarter 2016   Read more   With respect to the surprise trend  U S  Bancorp posted positive surprises in two of the last four quarters  with an average beat of 0 65   as

127030,348545,PNC,Forget The Yield Curve  Banks Stocks Are A Bargain ,opinion,"The press is giving too much credence to the effect an interest rate hike would have on the markets and on the financial sector  First of all  the fact that the Fed has been debating whether or not to raise rates by a paltry meaningless 0 25 basis points speaks volumes  The Fed clearly understands that this recovery is nothing but smoke and mirrors  the main driving force behind being hot money 
Secondly  deflation is more of an issue than inflation  Take a look around you  You can start with oil and go down the commodity rung  copper  iron ore  coal  etc   are all trading significantly off their highs  Instead of marching to the drum beat of the naysayers  march to your own drumbeat  opportunity could be in the air 

Let s take a look at the once mighty Citibank  N C   The long term chart certainly looks terrible and the stock appears to have made hardly any headway since 2008  One could simply state that Citibank has not made much headway because it is a rotten stock  but other than perhaps bringing on a brief moment of satisfaction  it would change nothing  However  if you discard the lens of negativity and take a look at the chart in an unbiased manner  you might spot something many others are missing  We will re examine this chart shortly  Are all the regional banks suffering like this  Logic dictates that there are strong players out there  take a look at the picture below 
PNC Bank  N PNC  appears to be thriving and the stock is trading well above its 2009 highs  One thing is certainly clear  every major market crash proved to be nothing but opportunity knocking in disguise  If one understands the principles of mass psychology  then just by utilizing this one tool you could do rather well  provided you are patient and buy when there is panic and sell when the crowd is euphoric  Don t mistake bullish with euphoric 
PNC could test 72  with a possible overshoot to 67 before it attempts to challenge 100 00  As long as it does not close below 50 on a monthly basis  the outlook will remain bullish  The pullback to 72 is not a must  but if it did pullback to this range  it would make for a good place to deploy some money into this stock 
Now let s take a look at Citibank  but through the eyes of an observer  An observer starts off on neutral ground and examines the data through a neutral lens 
While others might view the chart as disastrous  we see a potential opportunity  Notice the massive channel formation  The longer the channel formation  the stronger the breakout is when it finally occurs  As it has pulled back so much from its highs  the breakout is likely to occur to the upside  A monthly close above 63 will virtually guarantee a move to the 100 and then 150 ranges 
 Suggested strategies for those willing to take on a bit of risk   Option number one  Wait for a pullback to roughly the 38 00 ranges and then purchase LEAPS  these are options that have more than one year of time on them 
Option two  Wait for a monthly breakout above 63 00 and then purchase leaps  The stock in question is Citibank  If you are looking for some of the strongest regional players  then you could put the following technique to use on PNC  N BKU  N STI  N JPM  etc ",2015-10-19,Sol Palha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/forget-the-yield-curve--banks-stocks-are-a-bargain-268587,268587
127031,348546,PNC,3 Numbers  German Factory Orders To Hold Ground Despite Headwinds,opinion,"Slowing manufacturing will weigh on German factory orders in today s update
It may be time to trim expectations of slightly faster German GDP growth in Q1
Will Eurozone investor confidence continue to ease in today s report from Sentix 
The Eurozone outlook has become weaker but no new recession looks imminent
The Fed s Labour Market Index should confirm the strong gain in payrolls
Germany s export machine is the main event today for economic updates in Europe via the monthly numbers on factory orders for the country s industrial sector  Later  Sentix publishes new survey figures for investor sentiment in Europe  In addition  the Federal Reserve revises its Labour Market Conditions Index for the US 
Germany  Factory Orders  0700 GMT   Roubini Economics thinks that global recession risk  is still running high  particularly as the remaining stock of countervailing policy tools is limited   That s what the consultancy s managing director wrote in a note to clients late last week 
That s a worry for Germany  one of the world s leading exporters  But for the moment  the near term outlook still looks encouraging for the macro trend in Europe s largest economy  based on expectations for GDP growth in this year s first quarter 
FocusEconomics last week reported that economists are expecting a slightly faster expansion in Q1  GDP for Germany is on track to tick up to a 0 4  quarter over quarter rate from 0 3  in last year s Q4  based survey numbers for a range of analysts 
Nonetheless  recent updates for Germany s industrial sector reflect a slowdown in growth  which is starting to squeeze factory orders  The last update for December showed new orders eased vs  the previous month  pushing the year over year rate down by 2 5    the biggest annual decline since 2012  The main culprit  weak demand from within the Eurozone  By contrast  orders beyond the euro area were up at a robust rate  suggesting that Germany s export business may be less vulnerable than it appears from a European perspective 
Survey data for manufacturing  however  implies that the headwinds are set to strengthen  Markit s purchasing managers  index for the sector slumped to 50 5 in February  just above the stagnation mark of 50 0 
Today s hard data on factory orders for January isn t expected to provide much relief  The consensus forecast sees no change in orders and only a slight gain of just 0 3  for the annual comparison  based on Econoday com s consensus view  If the actual change ends up well below expectations  it may be time to trim the outlook for a slightly faster pace in Germany s GDP trend for this year s first quarter 

Eurozone  Sentix Investor Confidence  0930 GMT  The outlook for this year s first quarter macro trend in the Eurozone is stabilising at the mid 0 2  range for the quarter over quarter forecast  according to Now casting com s  on Friday  That still represents a mildly lower gain vs  the previously reported 0 3  rise for last year s Q4 
The good news is that the recent run of lower estimates for this year s Q1  which cut the growth forecast from 0 5  plus as recently as mid January  has rebounded slightly in recent weeks 
The near term outlook for Eurozone growth is still weaker compared with the view from a couple of months ago  but it s not obvious that a new recession is imminent  If that s still too optimistic we may see the evidence in today s monthly sentiment data from Sentix  Unfortunately  recent history doesn t look encouraging on this front 
The Sentix Investor Confidence Index eased for the second month in a row in the February report  dipping to the lowest level   6 0   in just over a year  The Eurozone Composite PMI for last month is also stumbling  signalling the weakest economic growth for the single currency union in 13 months   The survey data raise the prospect of economic growth deteriorating further from the already meagre pace seen late last year  when GDP rose only 0 3     Markit s chief economist last week 
Markit s warning will resonate a bit deeper if we see another dip in today s Sentix data for March 

US  Labour Market Conditions Index  1500 GMT   Payrolls rebounded strongly in February  posting a solid 242 000 advance   well above January s 172 000 increase  The year over year trend continues to ease  but for the moment it s still rising at a healthy pace  payrolls advance 1 9  last month vs  the year earlier level 
In short  there s no sign of imminent recession risk  based on last month s payrolls data  In turn  the possibility for a rate hike remains in play for the Federal Reserve s monetary policy meeting next week 
 The payroll numbers are startlingly strong    Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics viaThe Wall Street Journal   In the household survey  the fifth straight big gain the labour force is starting to look like a trend  as employers dig deeper into the pool of labour  but the unemployment rate remains under downward pressure and will hit new lows in the spring  
A fresh estimate for deciding if that s a reasonable forecast arrives in today s update via the Federal Reserve s Labor Market Conditions Index  a broad minded measure of labour market activity  Given what we learned on Friday  it would be surprising if we don t see an improvement for this benchmark after the previous update that reflected a sluggish profile  LMCI dipped to 0 4 in January  the lowest since the previous April 
A stronger reading for today s February release is a reasonable bet for today s update  The chief economist at PNC Financial  NYSE PNC  Services  the last month s pop in payrolls as  consistent with continued moderate economic growth   Today s LMCI data is on track to confirm that view with a deeper and relatively objective read on the labour market

127033,348548,PNC,And Now For Some Good News  U S  Retail Sales Look Solid,opinion,"US Retail Sales Up A Solid 0 5  In May
Retail spending in the US rose 0 5  in May  the Census Bureau reported Tuesday    a bit better than economists expected  The gain marks a sharp downshift from April s 1 3  bounce  But April s unusually strong advance isn t sustainable  which means that it s no great tragedy that today s report was weaker by comparison  Overall  a look at the last two monthly increases suggests that there s still a healthy glow for retail sales  A less encouraging profile emerges  however  when we focus on the year over year trend  which is probably more reliable for analyzing the appetite for spending 
Consumption is still climbing at a decent if unspectacular pace in annual terms through May  But recent history suggests that gravity s slight but persistent hand is at work  Headline retail spending rose 2 5  for the year through last month  down from 3 0  through April  Stripping out gasoline sales paints a firmer trend  but the deceleration in year over year spending growth is becoming conspicuous this year  Indeed  retail ex gas consumption climbed 3 7  in May vs  the year earlier level  which is at the low end of the annual range in recent years 

There s certainly no smoking gun in today s report  It s reasonable to argue that the consumer is still inclined to spend at a rate that s consistent with economic expansion  But we re near the lower range of growth that passes the  smell test  for concluding that a growth bias is still alive and well 
The question is whether the slow slide will endure  If it does  there could be trouble lurking in this year s second half  Unfortunately  today s numbers don t make a strong case for arguing that the downside momentum has run its course 
Nonetheless  today s results have inspired an optimistic spin in some quarters   This is a very strong spring quarter for consumer spending   Stuart Hoffman  chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group  NYSE PNC  told Bloomberg  adding that the latest release boosts the view that the economy  is bouncing back pretty solidly  
Maybe so  but the rosy narrative will come under pressure if the year over year trend suffers another dip in the next update  Retail spending s annual rate has little room to fall further without triggering a warning sign for the economy  Maybe there s a new normal factor in play  which would mean that we ll see slow growth that holds at a subdued pace for an extended period  It s unclear if that will help the economy sidestep a new recession  but it s certainly an intriguing possibility    especially if that s the only game in town for keeping optimism alive 
Then again  such debates may end up being merely academic if the next employment report delivers another weak set of numbers  The surprisingly tepid rise in payrolls in May may have been noise  But the crowd s going to have a tough time holding on to that narrative if the July employment data remains soft for a second straight month ",2016-06-14,James Picerno,https://www.investing.com/analysis/and-now-for-some-good-news:-u.s.-retail-sales-look-good-200135899,200135899
127051,348566,PNC,Stocks Cruise Along  Whistling Past The Graveyard,opinion,"U S  stocks just continue to cruise right along  although investors seem to be displaying a healthy level of caution  looking over their shoulders as they whistle past the graveyard and bet on ongoing improvement in corporate earnings and economic growth  Despite extremely overbought technical conditions and regional hot spots that may ultimately threaten global economic recovery  investors seem undeterred  Indeed  all major central banks are now onboard the liquidity bandwagon  and although bonds have not sold off as many expected  to create a Great Rotation into equities   most income and total return seeking investors in the U S  see little in the way of attractive alternatives to equities 
The economic data continues to indicate improvement in the U S  economy  For example  the number of job openings waiting to be filled in the United States rose in April by 289 000 to 4 5 million  which is the highest in nearly seven years  This bodes well for an imminent fall in the unemployment rate  Also  April retail sales were revised upward to  0 5  
Furthermore  the global economy seems to have the wind at its back  thanks at least in part to central banks around the world providing a sea of liquidity by printing money  The scary side of this is that when the next recession eventually arises  all of these central banks will be low in ammunition to fight it  Nevertheless  for the near term  it seems that all is well for U S  stocks  even though fears of a major crisis continue to push much of the global liquidity that is being printed into U S  Treasuries in a flight to quality and safety  The U S  10 Year Treasury yield remains quite low and may yet fall further 
With economies in Europe and the U S  improving  China has been able to grow exports and expand its trade balance  In addition  China has enacted a number of policies to support the housing market and overall economic growth  All of this seems to have staved off the brewing crisis there 
Of course  there is no free lunch  and Iraq has again turned into a quagmire  perhaps predictably and inevitably  given its long history of Sunni Shiite discord   replacing the Russian Ukraine conflict as the hot spot that could ultimately pose real threats to global security  oil prices  and economic recovery  But a Wall of Worry is important to the bullish case by keeping excessive exuberance under control 
Also keeping price progression orderly is the fact that economic expansion is slower than prior recoveries from recessions  so we have not seen the typical excesses that lead to sudden corrections  And now all signs  finally  point to improving economic growth rates later this year  Furthermore  there is a lot of fuel for stocks in the form of cash on the sidelines and in underperforming bond funds 
To be sure  the old adage that you should never short a dull market has certainly rung true lately  There has not been a 10  pullback in U S  stocks in nearly 3 years  And with the VIX now flirting with single digits  it has been two months since the S P 500 last had a 1  daily move up or down  the longest such period since 1995  by the way  
Moreover  the CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  hit a 7 year low on Friday of 10 34  Although some observers are predicting single digits for the VIX  others insist that the extreme oversold conditions are ripe for reversion to the mean sometime this summer  perhaps to test resistance at 15 
In any case  short of a major black swan event  I just don t see anything on the horizon that could seriously derail the bull train in its upward path  I recommend sticking with the trend of rotation from speculative names into quality companies with attractive valuations  solid earnings growth projections  sound earnings quality  and preferably paying a consistent dividend 
To this end  Sabrient just launched its annual mid year Forward Looking Value portfolio  which is a cap  and sector diversified group of 35 GARP  Growth At Reasonable Price  stocks  selected based on a combination of our proven quant model  for identifying high potential candidates  and subsidiary Gradient Analytics  forensic accounting expertise  to evaluate earnings quality and avoid those stocks at higher risk of a meltdown due to accrual accounting issues  
SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  ARCA SPY  closed Friday at 195 38  As I said in my previous article two weeks ago  a pullback was inevitable given the extremely overbought technical conditions  and indeed it has pulled back somewhat  Although the current consolidation is allowing the moving averages to catch up with price  the oscillators have been reluctant to cycle back down  particularly MACD  which is still clinging to the roof  so to speak  Instead of testing important support levels  starting with the 20 day simple moving average   price merely formed a bull flag pattern and took another run at the upper line of the long standing bullish rising channel    which once again proved impenetrable  To breech this line  I think volume is going to have to increase  which is not likely until we get oscillators like RSI  MACD  and slow Stochastic to cycle back down to oversold territory  But this does not necessarily mean a large pullback in price  A test of the 50 day SMA  around 190  would be a good start  since it coincides with round number resistance turned support 

We shall see if bulls can gather sufficient conviction to rally to new highs    with the 200 level serving as both an enticing bullish target and a potential ambush location by some ravenous bears  who haven t eaten in quite some time   Note  Extinction is highly unlikely

Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 
Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  iShares US Financials  NYSE IYF    Technology  iShares Dow Jones US Technology  NYSE IYW    Industrial  iShares US Industrials  NYSE IYJ    Healthcare  iShares US Healthcare  NYSE IYH    Consumer Goods  iShares US Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK    Consumer Services  iShares US Consumer Services  NYSE IYC    Energy  iShares DJ US Energy Sector Fund  NYSE IYE    Basic Materials  iShares US Basic Materials  NYSE IYM    Telecommunications  iShares US Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ    and Utilities  iShares US Utilities  NYSE IDU    Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each    
Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1   Technology remains in first place with a strong Outlook score of 96  which is quite impressive especially given its huge  and still increasing  39 point gap above second place Utilities at 57  Technology displays generally solid factor scores across the board  with a strong forward long term growth rate  a reasonable forward P E  the highest return ratios  and the strongest sentiment among both Wall Street analysts  upward revisions to earnings estimates  and insiders  open market buying   Utilities displays a reasonably low forward P E and decent sell side sentiment  Energy has jumped back up into third place  while Financial rounds out the top five  However  it should be noted that Utilities  Energy  Financial  Healthcare  and Industrial are all tightly bunched in 2 6 place  providing little confidence in the middle rankings 
2   Telecommunications stays in the cellar once again with an Outlook score of 1  as it scores among the lowest in every factor in the model  It is joined in the bottom two again this week by Consumer Services Discretionary with a score of 16  despite its strong forward long term growth rate 
3   Looking at the Bull scores  Industrial holds the lead with a 54  while Utilities is the laggard with a 42  The top bottom spread has fallen to only 12 points  reflecting higher sector correlations on particularly strong market days   Of course  there haven t been many extremely strong or weak days lately  so the scores are less reliable   It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold  rather than the all boats lifted in a rising tide mentality that dominated 2013 
4   Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities is no longer the leader  dropping to 54  Instead  Energy has emerged as the clear leader at 61  which means that stocks within this sector have been the preferred safe havens on weak market days  but again  there haven t been many lately   Industrial and Consumer Services Discretionary share the lowest score of 48  The top bottom spread has fallen to only 13 points  reflecting higher sector correlations on particularly weak market days  of which there have not been many   Again  it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 
5   Technology displays by far the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Telecom is by far the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Energy is the clear leader  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   Telecom scores the lowest  indicating general investor avoidance of these sectors during extreme conditions 
6   Overall  I would say that this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings look neutral and non committal  After Technology at the top  the next five sectors are pretty much bunched in the middle  showing no clear preferences 
These Outlook scores represent the view that the Technology sector is relatively undervalued  while Consumer Services and Telecom may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look  The rest give really little indication right now 
Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or bearish   suggests holding Technology  Industrial  and Financial  in that order  in the prevailing bullish climate   Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be bullish from a rules based standpoint because SPY is still above its 50 day simple moving average while also remaining above its 200 day SMA   
Other highly ranked ETFs from the Technology  Industrial  and Financial sectors include First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund  NASDAQ TDIV   First Trust NASDAQ ABA Community Bank Index Fund  NASDAQ QABA   and the SPDR S P Transportation ETF Trust  NYSE XTN  
For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within Technology  Industrial  and Financial  some long ideas include Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Seagate Technology  NASDAQ STX   General Dynamics  NYSE GD   United Rentals  NYSE URI   The PNC Financial Services Group  NYSE PNC   and SunTrust Banks  NYSE STI   All are highly ranked in the Sabrient Ratings Algorithm and also score within the best two quintiles of our   a pure accounting based risk assessment signal based on the forensic accounting expertise of our subsidiary Gradient Analytics  We have found it quite valuable for helping to avoid performance offsetting meltdowns in our model portfolios 
However  if you are more comfortable with a neutral bias  the model suggests holding Technology  Utilities  and Energy  in that order   Similarly  if you have a bearish outlook on the market  the model also suggests holding Energy  Technology  and Utilities  in that order

127056,348571,PNC,Earnings  Tech On Deck,opinion,"I think we can all agree that this was not a good week for earnings  The bad news from banks kept coming Friday when Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  reported before the bell  The company posted Q4 EPS of  4 38 and revenues of  7 69B  both beating the street  but falling short of the Estimize consensus  The stock was punished shortly thereafter  falling as much as 2 5  after the markets opened  suggesting participants were looking for more  Investors have come to expect big beats from the bank  over the last 4 quarters they have surpassed the Wall Street consensus by an average of  0 83 

As with the other banks that reported this week  downtrodden results for Goldman Sachs had to do with a decrease in FICC trading revenues which fell 29  YoY  with overall revenues for the quarter coming in at their lowest level since Q3 2013 and declining 12  YoY  As a result of sorry results this week  the S P 500 financials sector has seen earnings growth dip to  2 3  from 5 0  at the beginning of the quarter  That said  there were some bright spots within the sector Friday  with PNC Financial Services  NYSE PNC   Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW  and SunTrust Banks  NYSE STI  all beating on the bottom and top line  with the exception of SunTrust  which saw revenues in line with expectations 

The Tech Week Ahead

Next week we ll be looking out for the beginning of the tech earnings parade  with  NYSE IBM    NASDAQ EBAY  and  NASDAQ SanDisk  scheduled to report  The IT sector is expected to be the third strongest in the S P 500 with earnings expectations of 12 2  and revenues of 7 5

127058,348573,PNC,Weekend Update January 23  2015,opinion,"   VIX continued to challenge its Cycle Top resistance at 19 18but closed above it  Fortunately  it closed above both Intermediate term support at 16 32 and Short term support at 16 62  The Cycles Model suggests a probable rally top by the end of January or early February  It may get very exciting 
SPX continues its sideways consolidation 

SPX continued its sideways consolidation between Intermediate term support at 2021 03 and Short term resistance at 2053 21  closing beneath it  It appears to be progressing within the Orthodox Broadening Top pattern with Point 6 in its sights  beneath its lower trendline near 1700 00 The unpegging of the Swiss franc sent investors scurrying into stocks  but met with overhead resistance without making new highs  The depth of the probable decline that follows may give us some indication of what to expect during the rest of 2015 
 ZeroHedge  On the surface  despite concerns about the adverse impact from the strong dollar and crashing energy earnings  so far the fourth quarter is shaping up quite strong  Indeed  as CNBC won t stop repeating  with 7  of the companies in the S P 500 reporting actual results for Q4 to date  more companies are reporting both actual EPS above estimates  84   and actual sales above estimates  60   compared to recent historical averages  Of course  this only works courtesy of the endless guide down game that analysts and corporate CFOs play year after year  in their appeal to gullible investors that companies are actually doing better than expected 
NDX had a strong week  but no new high 

NDX had a strong week  closing above weekly Short term support resistance at 4256 48  It appears to be taking a detour within the Orthodox Broadening Top pattern that signals a major change in trend may be underway 
 ZeroHedge  Who could have seen that coming  It appears that for all the bluster that the US economy could somehow decouple from the rest of the world s demise  when as always it is simply and timing issue   lagged response   America s manufacturing renaissance is dying  Markit s US Manufacturing PMI printed 53 7 in January  missed expectations of 54 0 falling for the 5th month in a row to the lowest in 12 months 
High Yield trapped between Long term support and Short term resistance 

The High Yield Index had an inside week  closing beneath its weekly Short term resistance at 143 65 and above weekly Long term support at 140 93  A breakout or breakdown will give the index its directionality The Broadening Wedge formation also plays a significant role in future expectations A decline beneath the lower trendline puts MUT in motion toward its first target near its Cycle Bottom at 106 12

The euro continues its free fall 

The euro progression toward parity with the US dollar gained intensity this week  The euro may not expect its next Master Cycle low until early February  so it may fall quite a distance in the interim  With no supports  the euro is now in a panic decline We may see parity between the euro and the dollar before this is over 
 ZeroHedge  A crashing yen failed to help Japan or fix its economy  but while Japan may now be a lost cause  the Keynesian masterminds of the world will give it another try  and following today s Draghi s announcement  the EUR USD has crashed to the lowest level since 2003  tumbling over 200 pips  and printing below 1 14 moments ago 
And since it is a zero trade sum world  now that the exports of Europe   the single largest economic block in the world   are cheap enough to compete with Japan s just as cheap  thanks to currency debasement  goods and services in the global arena  it means that the biggest loser is obvious  the United States  whose currency has soared to nosebleed levels on expectations that the Fed will hike and that the US will somehow decouple from a world that is drowning in economic malaise 
The unpegged Swissie sends EuroStoxx 50 to new highs 

The EuroStoxx 50 Index got a boost from investors caught wrong sided shorting the Swiss franc  Taking the Swiss franc off its peg with the euro drove many currency traders back into stocks  Last week s question   How high will it go  is being answered  It appears that the rally may have been turned back at the weekly Cycle Top resistance at 3412 97  It is still uncertain whether it may go higher  Bt the Cycle Model suggests   not  
 ZeroHedge  For the most succinct  and most cynical  take on yesterday s ECB QE announcement we go to Deutsche Bank which 7 years after the grand money printing experiment started  has thrown in the towel on spinning the now annual CTRL P ritual  and   in a nutshell   says  QE will fail to do anything but boost stocks  so may as well buy stocks

The yen finds support at its Cycle Bottom 

The yen finally achieved weekly support at its Cycle Bottom at 83 97  It has yet to overcome its December 16 high at 86 34  Once the breakout occurs  the yen may gain momentum in its rally  since most traders have not recognized a change of trend yet 
 Bloomberg  Margin traders in Japan raised bets the yen would fall against the dollar to a record amid their currency s best start to a year since 2010 
Wagers from individuals for the Japanese currency to decline outnumbered bets it would gain by 522 856 contracts on Jan  15  the biggest net shorts since Tokyo Financial Exchange Inc  s Click 365 began collecting the data in 2006  The figure more than doubled since Sept  30 as the Bank of Japan s unexpected Oct  31 decision to expand bond purchases  known as quantitative easing  drove the yen to an 8 1 2 year low in 2014 
The Nikkei bounced off its lower trendline 

The Nikkei bounced above its Ending Diagonal trendline and weekly Intermediate term support at 16834 85  closing just beneath its Short term resistance at 17648 52  The Orthodox Broadening Top also plays a role in this reversal  representing a market that is out of control and has a highly emotional public participation  A loss of support of the Ending diagonal and Intermediate term support trendline at 16834 85 may be the start of a dramatic decline that is imminently due 
 ZeroHedge  The Ministry of Finance just reported that Japan bought JPY 657 billion  over  5 6 billion  of foreign stocks last week  That is the biggest weekly purchase of foreign equities since records began in 2001  The huge size of the purchases  more than double the average size of recent weekly purchases   appears to have been  spent  on European stocks  and perhaps some Chinese   It is unclear whether this is direct buying by the banks as a proxy for The BoJ s quid pro quo or merely front running this week s exuberance from Draghi by Mrs Watanabe now that her Swissy trade exploded   
U S  dollar rally in high gear 

The US dollar notched up the intensity of its rally  It now appears to have a near term target near 97 00  The Cycles Model suggests that there may be a Primary Cycle high due at the end of January or the first week of February A sharp retracement may follow  lasting approximately 3 4 weeks 
 Reuters    Speculators slightly trimmed bets in favor of the U S  dollar in the latest week  and bolstered net shorts on the euro to their largest level in 2  1 2 years  according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday 
The value of the dollar s net long position inched lower to  46 22 billion in the week ended Jan  20  from  46 96 billion the previous week  Despite the slight decline  net long dollars have hit at least  40 billion for a fourth straight week 
To be long a currency is to take a view it will rise  while being short is a bet its value will decline

 WSJ  Gold and Silver are getting another turn in the spotlight  luring investors worried about slowing global growth and surprises by central banks 
On Thursday  the European Central Bank offered the latest reason to pile into precious metals by unleashing a bigger than expected bond buying program amid continued worries about Europe s economy  Gold futures ended above  1 300 a troy ounce for the first time since August  while silver neared bull market territory  defined as a 20  increase from a recent low 
Gold and silver are drawing buyers of all stripes  a sign fears about a worsening economic outlook run deep in financial markets  The metals are popular havens for nervous investors but had fallen out of favor after setting price records in 2011 as the U S  recovery gained speed  Now these metals are luring back some money managers  as collapsing oil prices  fears of a recession in Europe and volatility in currency markets shake their faith in stocks and other investments

China may have hit its final high today 

Last week I had suggested that   The Shanghai Index appears to be in need of a final high next week  The reason I could say that is that there were two Panic cycle pivots due  with the second one due today The Shanghai Index is the only Chinese stock index that can be traded by foreigners  The ruckus in Europe sent investor money where it appeared to be the most welcome  Unfortunately  appearances can be deceiving  Volatility is on the rise in China 
 Business Insider  Shanghai stocks collapsed by 7 7  on Monday  as the government cracked down on major brokers offering leverage to their clients  It was the biggest one day drop in Chinese equities since 2008  and for any other stock index  that might take some time to recover from 
But not in Shanghai  During trading Friday  the stock index erased those losses  after just four days 
The index closed up 0 30  on Friday  slightly below its open this week  but it pushed above 3 338  breaking to a fresh five year high during the day 
The Banking Index bounces from mid Cycle support 

  BKX bounced from weekly mid Cycle support at 65 42  as it makes ready for the next phase of its decline It now must decline at least 3 5  beneath the lower trendline of its Orthodox Broadening Top at 63 00 to complete point 6 of the formation  The Cycles Model now implies that a significant low may be due in late January to early February that may fulfill those requirements

Elsewhere look for gold to continue lower in the short term while Crude Oil continues to consolidate after its bounce  The US dollar also looks to continue to consolidate sideways while US Treasuries are biased lower  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are both consolidating with a bias to break that to the upside 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s  ARCA SPY    ARCA IWM  and  NASDAQ QQQ   despite the moves higher this week  Their charts also suggest more upward price action on both the daily and weekly view  This is the first week in a while that all 3 Index ETF s have looked strong  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

127065,348580,PNC,Mario Draghi Under The Spotlight,opinion,We stand ready for two side volatilityThe ECB gives policy verdict today and the President Mario Draghi s press conference will be at the centre of attention  We will be concentrated on potential disclosure of further technical details on the Quantitative Easing program  the ECB s forward guidance in the mid term and an update of perception regarding the Greek situation  Also  we are curious to hear what Draghi has to say about the drastic impact of the QE program on Eurozone s sovereign debt markets  the negative rates  whether the aggressive market reaction and the snowball effect that it has created may impact the future of the QE program  UBS has already started chattering about the possibility of an early exit   ECB has repeatedly argued that its constructive staff macroeconomic forecast from March relies on the QE programme being implemented in full  i e at least until September 2016  Yet the early impact of QE has been so pronounced that the ECB is already facing questions as to whether it might have to end it before September 2016  Yesterday s EUR USD rally has been solely due to the aggressive USD sell off as the US retail sales missed the market estimates in March  The positive news from JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  and Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  remained under the shadow of soft retail sales  therefore giving little conviction to the market to stay on the buy side in USD  Investors are now concerned that the strong USD may hit corporate revenues moving forward  which in our view should only remain an ephemeral feeling  We see broad correction in USD verse the G10 currencies since early trading today  On the equity side  US Bancorp  NYSE USB   Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW   Kinder Morgan and PNC Financial Services Group  NYSE PNC  will release results  Even in case of weak earnings  we see little chance for the Fed stepping back from its plans to start normalizing sometime in the second half of the year  the high probability scenarios are still June or September start  Therefore  the potentially weak earnings announcements might revive short run hope for a later Fed rate hike  however the conviction should stay firmly limited on a further dovish shift in Fed scenarios In the short run  Draghi s speech should define the short term direction given the confusion in technical levels following yesterday s spin  Technically speaking  any hawkishness could push EUR USD higher  The upside should remain limited however as the opportunities to sell euros at good prices will certainly not last long given the solid divergence between the ECB and the Fed policies Loonie s relief will certainly not last longWe expect the Bank of Canada to maintain the status quo at today s meeting  We remain cautious on the recent recovery in Loonie  mostly seen as a short term breather given the oil recovery  For the real damages on the Canadian economy to be restored however  the oil prices should climb back to  70 80 levels minimum  Therefore  we keep our bearish bias on CAD and do not rule out an additional rate cut over the coming months  especially if the Fed tightening gets delayed  The market is pricing over 50  chance for a September BoC easing according to implied probabilities extracted from the bond markets  We have good conviction that the USD CAD should pause before a renewed boost toward fresh 6 year highs  above 1 2830   then 1 2920 1 3000  The key support is seen at 1 2350 90  3 month support area  Some colour out of AsiaThe Chinese GDP growth slowed from 7 3  to 7 y y in Q1 in line with expectations  The reluctance to invest continues despite lower PBoC rates as final demand has hard time picking up  Despite all efforts  China might fail to secure 7  growth target in 2015  This indicates that there is a scope for further PBoC action on rates and the reserve requirement rations in weeks ahead Concerns on China weigh on the Aussie  The AUD USD consolidates weakness below the conversion line  0 7646  despite yesterday s heavy USD unwinds  The market shifts to the sell side with decent vanilla puts placed between 0 75 0 76 for today s expiry ,2015-04-15,Ipek Ozkardeskaya,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mario-draghi-under-the-spotlight-248524,248524

127079,348594,PNC,Economists  The U S  Economy Shrank In Q1 But Don t Worry,opinion,"During the first three months of this year  the U S  economy contracted at a 1 percent annual rate   Despite this  mainstream economists flooded the mainstream media with assurances that much better days are just around the corner on Thursday   In fact  many of them boldly predicted that U S  GDP would grow at a 3 or 4 percent annual rate in the second quarter   None of them seem the least bit concerned    Instead  they just blamed the bad number for the first quarter on a     and the financial markets responded to the GDP news quite cheerfully   In fact  the S P 500 soared to another brand new record high   No matter how bad the numbers get  almost everyone in the financial world seems quite optimistic   But is there actually good reason to have such optimism 
As Zero Hedge has pointed out  if it wasn t for dramatically increased healthcare spending due to the implementation of Obamacare  U S  GDP would have actually dropped at a 2 percent annual rate during the first quarter of 2014 
That would have been an absolutely disastrous number 
But within a very short time of the revised U S  GDP number being released  the mainstream media was inundated with positive stories about the news 
For example  CNN published a story entitled    and  released a survey of nine prominent economists that showed that their consensus forecast for the second quarter of 2014 is GDP growth at a 3 74 percent annual rate 
It just seems like almost everyone wants to forget about what happened during the first quarter and wants to look ahead to a great number for quarter two 
Joseph Lavorgna  the chief U S  economist at Deutsche Bank  NYSE DB   is boldly forecasting a  growth rate for the second quarter   So is    In fact  it is hard to find any  expert  in the mainstream media that does not expect rip roaring economic growth this quarter 
For example  just check out these quotes   
  NYSE    The first quarter was disappointing  but rather than view that as an omen of a recession or the first of a down leg in the economy  I see the seeds of a big bounce back in spring  
    For those worried about a recession  it s worth remembering that employment increased by nearly 300 000 in April  
    2Q growth seen at nearly 4     Weak 1Q is stone cold dead as an indicator of where the economy is headed  
  NYSE    Because of weaker inventory investment in Q1  we increased our Q2 GDP tracking estimate by two tenths to 3 9   
    Using an alternative model for projecting job growth  we see an entirely different scenario  one in which the U S  unemployment rate will fall below 5 percent by no later than the middle of next year  
Hopefully they are right 
Hopefully we are not heading into another recession 
But as I discussed earlier this week  evidence continues to mount that another recession has already begun for much of the country 
And there was another number that was released today that seems to confirm this   According to   there was a 6 percent drop in exports in the first quarter of 2014 when compared to the first quarter of 2013   

The U S  economic reversal was led by a 6 percent drop in exports year over year  until recently hailed as a key driver of the U S  recovery  and which had risen 9 5 percent in the last three months of 2013 
The slackening of trade has spread to the developing world  where emerging economies are seeing less demand from the U S   Europe and China for raw materials and other exports 

We saw a similar decline happen  as the U S  economy plunged into recession 
And Bloomberg s Consumer Comfort index has fallen to the lowest level that we have seen in six months   U S  consumers are increasingly tapped out  and the ongoing  retail apocalypse  is evidence of that fact 
A declining middle class simply cannot support the massive retail infrastructure that America has developed   As the middle class has fallen to pieces  it was just a matter of time before big trouble started erupting for the retail industry   This is something that  recently wrote about   

It does not take much analysis to see that these bell ringers do not represent sustainable prosperity unfolding across the land  For example  around 1990 real median income was  56k per household and now  25 years later  its just  51k  meaning that main street living standards have plunged by about 9  during the last quarter century  But what has not dropped is the opportunity for Americans to drop shopping  square footage per capita during the same period more than doubled  rising from 19 square feet per capita at the earlier date to 47 at present 
This complete contradiction declining real living standards and soaring investment in retail space did not occur due to some embedded irrational impulse in America to speculate in real estate  or because capitalism has an inherent tendency to go off the deep end  The fact that in equally  prosperous  Germany today there is only 12 square feet of retail space per capita is an obvious tip off  and this is not a teutonic aberration  America s prize winning number of 47 square feet of retail space per capita is 3 8X higher than anywhere else in the developed world 

Without middle class jobs  you can t have a middle class   That is why our employment crisis is at the very heart of our economic problems   Even using the government s highly manipulated unemployment figures  there are still quite a few cities out there that have official unemployment rates    

The unemployment rate in Yuma  Ariz   is 23 8   In El Centro  Calif   it is 21 6   El Centro sits in an area of California in which unemployment in many metro areas is double the national average  In Merced the figure is 14 3   in Yuba City the figure is 14 5   in Hanford it is 13 1  and in Visalia it is 13 4   In several metros close to these  the figure is above 10   Most of them are inland from San Francisco and the area just south of it  which also happens to be among the nation s most drought plagued regions  This means jobs recovery is highly unlikely 

But of course the truth is that if the government actually used honest numbers  the unemployment rate for the entire nation would be  
And as I like to remind people  according to the government s own numbers  of the families in the entire nation do not have a single member that is employed 
So how is it possible that the  unemployment rate  is just a little above 6 percent 
It is a giant sham 
But that is what they want 
They want us feeling good and thinking that everything is going to be okay 
Unfortunately  they used the same approach back in 2007 and 2008  and we all remember how that turned out ",2014-05-30,Michael T. Snyder,https://www.investing.com/analysis/economists:-the-u.s.-economy-shrank-in-q1-but-don't-worry-214486,214486
127083,348598,PNC,Top Trade Ideas   Week Of June 2  2014  PNC Financial,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
PNC Financial  Ticker  PNC PNC Financial  NYSE PNC  has been in a rising trend since October  The recent short term double top at 88 in March and April led to a 38 2  pullback from the move higher and it is consolidating in a symmetrical triangle since early April over that level  It is testing the top of that triangle with a RSI that is rising and bullish and a MACD that is crossed up and rising heading into the week  There is resistance higher at 85 50 and 88 and then free air higher and a target of 91 20 from the triangle break  There is support at 84 30 and 82 90 followed by 82 and 80 90 before 80 lower 
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 85 50 with a stop at 84 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the June 85 Calls  offered at  1 69 late Friday  on the same trigger 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the July 85 June 87 5 Call Diagonals   1 66  on the same trigger 
Trade Idea 4  Buy the June 85 July 82 5 Put Diagonals  free  for a potential pullback 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  as May ends and June begins sees the equity markets looking very bullish  Elsewhere look for Gold to continue lower while Crude Oil has an upward bias  The US Dollar Index is biased to pullback in the uptrend while US Treasuries may consolidate or pullback in their stronger uptrend  The Shanghai Composite looks headed lower again while Emerging Markets are pulling back in the uptrend  Volatility looks to remain subdued and biased to the downside keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   iShares Russell 2000 Index  ARCA IWM  and PowerShares QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts show the SPY and QQQ in good uptrends while the IWM is consolidating with an upward bias  It may have the best potential  Gold moving lower and the potential for the Dollar to pullback and maybe Treasuries is a better scenario for equities  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well
