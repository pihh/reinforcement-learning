171043,392559,CAG,StockBeat   Conagra Feeds Investor Appetite  Reaffirming Outlook  Shares Rally,news,"Investing com   ConAgra soared on Wednesday after the food company reaffirmed its full year guidance and said maintaining its dividend is a  top priority  
ConAgra Foods  NYSE CAG   maker of food brands including Birds Eye  Reddi wip and Slim Jim  maintained its guidance for earnings of between  2 03 and  2 08 per share and a net sales gain of 1   sending its share price up 6 2  
Like most food companies  ConAgra is grappling with rising ingredient costs  and its efforts to pass them on to shoppers have been thwarted by intense competition 
Most of the ConAgra s sales growth has been driven by acquisitions  so the company has focused squeezing out that little bit of extra growth by addressing executional challenges at some of its acquired businesses 
And its efforts are seemingly starting to take shape as the food company on Wednesday increased its value capture from synergies estimate to  285 million from  215 million 
Beyond the impact of rising costs  the integration of Pinnacle Foods  acquired in 2018  has weighed on overall gross margins  strangling cash flows  adding to worries that ConAgra s dividend of 85 2 cents a share is vulnerable to a cut 
But the food company vowed to slash debt as it seeks maintain its current dividend  which it said was a  top priority  
The shares are up more than 37  this year but are still off 25  from their 52 week high reached on June 21 ",2019-04-10,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stocks--conagra-feeds-investor-appetite-reaffirming-guidance-shares-rally-1832784,1832784

171223,392739,CAG,Chase for tastier tortillas starts with age old  Mexican gold ,news,"By David Alire Garcia OTZOLOTEPEC  Mexico  Reuters    Under a scorching sun  Clemente Enriquez tips his wide brimmed hat up as he proudly displays in an open palm the conico corn seeds he plants on his small plot in the rolling hills outside this village west of Mexico City    These are very special   said Enriquez  a 78 year old farmer with shaggy gray hair and bushy black eyebrows  speaking on the edge of a neighbor s field   I ve been growing these for years  I like the size of the seed and the color  and the taste of the tortillas you can make with them   Lately  his enthusiasm seems to be catching on  A growing army of  heirloom corn  fans  from celebrity chef Rick Bayless to food giants like ConAgra to a group of dogged Mexican scientists  are aiming to unlock the ancient ingredient to bring tortillas with better flavor to the high end foodie market while boosting sustainable local economies  Entrepreneurs see a huge profit to be made in higher margin tortillas and chips sold at restaurants like Bayless  Frontera Grill in Chicago and Enrique Olvera s Cosme in New York  and mass marketed at higher end retailers like Whole Foods Market Inc  O WFM   It can also boost the incomes of the poor farmers in Mexico who have been cultivating traditional maize for millennia  Several of the nearly 60 native varieties  or landraces  of this heirloom corn often grow alongside corn s ancestor teocintle  a skimpy stalk with a few meager kernels that Mexican farmers transformed in a dizzying series of improvements over some 8 000 years  Centuries later  their distant descendents see a bright future for the traditional grains if obstacles can be overcome  The first is whether Mexican scientists can hammer out a first ever fair trade certification for traditional corn farmers  similar to certifications for organic coffee or chocolate  Once an accord is reached  which is expected later this year  organizers say a civic association or panel of experts will provide the voluntary certification  Another hurdle is the farmers themselves  many of whom are not fully versed about the value of their crops abroad  or even the specific variety of corn they tend  They also must ease their reliance on middle men buyers known as coyotes who have long been their main sales channel and could be the losers if the crop s value is enhanced  If successful  exports of Mexico s gourmet maize could start to reverse a flood of cheap U S  yellow corn imports that have pushed more than 1 million Mexican farmers off their fields since the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994   I live in GMO corn country and it is the most tasteless corn in the world   Bayless told Reuters  referring to the sprawling fields planted with genetically modified corn around his hometown Chicago  Illinois  America s second biggest corn producing state  But the bolita variety of heirloom corn from Mexico s southern Oaxaca state is different  he says   It has taste  That s the whole thing    MEXICAN GOLD The chef s taste buds aren t lying  the maize scientists behind the certification in Mexico say  Commodity benchmark  Yellow 2  corn  a grain used mostly for animal feed  has little in common with Mexican corns that come in a kaleidoscope of colors and in some cases can be traced back for centuries to a specific mountain valley  says Flavio Aragon  one of the scientists behind the certification   The quality of Mexican corns is something else entirely   he said  Entrepreneurs putting big money on the line include Jorge Gaviria  chief executive of Los Angeles based  privately held Masienda  the first company to source the corn  whose ambition is to take on mass produced tortillas with a tastier if pricier alternative   What s clearly in our sights is getting into the tortilla market in a really big way   he said  U S  tortilla consumption is seen doubling to  30 billion by 2025  according to market research firm IndexBox  Conagra Brands Inc  N CAG   the maker of Chef Boyardee pasta and Hunt s ketchup  late last year bought Bayless  Frontera Foods  part of an industry trend to promote higher margin products and boost sales as consumers crave more natural foods  Around the same time  Bayless launched a line of premium tortilla chips using mostly bolita sold exclusively at Whole Foods  Conagra said in a statement that the chips are  performing well  but declined to provide sales data  The new landrace maize certification was expected to be ready late last year  but building consensus on the fine print has caused a delay  Organizers say the certification will provide farmers with a document that details the specific variety they grow  the traditional farming methods they use  It would also restrict sales to surplus supply to prevent farmers from selling what they would normally set aside for their families and animals  forcing them to turn to more processed foods in their own diets  Last season  Mexico produced around 24 million tonnes of corn  or about 4 percent of global output  and native corn surpluses are estimated at as much as 5 million tonnes annually  Masienda  which sells directly to hundreds of restaurants  began buying Mexican heirloom corn three years ago  This season  its purchases will probably reach 2 000 tonnes  up five fold since 2014  said Gaviria  At the higher end  some heirloom varieties can already fetch around three times the price of conventional corns  That has farmers like 22 year old Octavio Tejeda optimistic he can cash in on growing demand from around the world for tastier tortillas and most importantly preserve the strains  
 We re going to keep our traditions alive and rescue the varieties of corn that are important to us   said Tejeda  gazing out on a recently plowed field   It s our Mexican gold  ",2017-04-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/chase-for-tastier-tortillas-starts-with-age-old-'mexican-gold'-472365,472365

171309,392825,CAG,Exclusive  ConAgra CEO Rodkin expected to retire in months   sources,news,"By Olivia Oran and Nadia Damouni  Reuters    ConAgra Foods Inc s long time chief executive  Gary Rodkin  is expected to retire in the next several months  according to two people familiar with the matter  paving the way for a successor who investors hope can turn around the ailing packaged foods company 
The Chef Boyardee maker  which has a market capitalization of  13 billion  is in the early stages of reaching out to potential candidates to succeed Rodkin  the people said  asking not to be named since the matter is confidential 
Rodkin  who has been at the helm of ConAgra since 2005  has been under pressure from shareholders to fix problems resulting from the Omaha based company s troubled  5 billion acquisition of private brands business Ralcorp in January 2013 
A ConAgra spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment 
With its purchase of Ralcorp  ConAgra became the biggest U S  private label food company  But that business of selling food under supermarket brands has struggled to reach promised profit targets  in part due to cut price deals Ralcorp had struck with customers before it was taken over 
Shares of ConAgra  which were trading at around  30 before the Ralcorp takeover  are now trading at roughly the same level 
Rodkin  62  said in June that the company  which also makes Slim Jim meat snacks and Healthy Choice frozen meals  had underestimated the issues it inherited by buying RalCorp  which had just started to restructure 
 We knew there would be work to do but underestimated the degree of difficulty and the amount of time it would take to course correct   Rodkin said on the most recent earnings conference call 
Before the acquisition by ConAgra  Ralcorp was the target of activist investment fund Corvex Management  who had been pushing the company to consider alternatives including a sale 
In the most recent quarter ended May 25  ConAgra reported fourth quarter earnings of 55 cents per share  which was lower than its forecast of 60 cents per share 
ConAgra s shares have fallen around 9 percent so far this year even as food stocks have climbed across the board  The S P Food   Beverage select industry index has gained more than 4 percent year to date buoyed by large deals like Tyson Foods Inc s  8 55 billion offer for Hillshire Brands Co 

Rodkin previously served as chairman and chief executive officer of PepsiCo beverages and foods in North America

171328,392844,CAG,Coal In Wall Street s Stocking  Stocks Crumble To 14 Month Lows,opinion," Thursday Market Close  Whether it s the Fed hinting at more rate hikes or Congress talking about a possible shutdown in Washington  it seems like the market just can t catch a break this week 
One day after getting rattled by the Fed raising rates and sounding less dovish about 2019 than some investors might have hoped  the market fell another 2  Thursday as a budget agreement appeared to unravel in Washington  Weak guidance from Conagra  NYSE CAG  might have been another factor driving stocks down to new lows for the year and to their lowest levels in 14 months  while another bleak day in the crude market continued to drive fears of possible declining economic activity around the world 
There weren t too many other headlines today to account for the big plunge  and shutdowns haven t really hurt the market much in the past  Still  it was another sign of political uncertainty that some bearish investors could potentially hang their hats on  along with the ongoing China tariff battle and the unresolved Brexit situation 
Looking at it from a sector perspective  only utilities saw any gains Thursday  Consumer discretionary was the worst performer  dropping more than 2   but consumer staples wasn t far behind due in part to pressure from a double digit drop in CAG shares  The food packaging company reported mixed results for the quarter  but it appears to be its guidance that might have really hit shares 
Who Will Buy 
With the S P 500  SPX  down about 14  from the all time high posted last fall as it entered Thursday s session  there just hasn t seemed to be much buying interest lately  That appeared to be the case again Thursday  with few people apparently willing to step up and catch what lately has been a falling knife  That could help explain why markets keep plunging every day  Even in normal times  there are always people selling  but in normal times  more people are ready to buy  That s apparently not happening so much these days 
One school of thought claims that the Fed is partially responsible for this because it continues to see two rate hikes last year and many in the market had come into yesterday hoping for one or none  On the other hand  the Fed also said a lot of good things about the economy  and the market didn t seem to listen 
Wherever people might stand on that issue  it does seem to be the case  more often than not  that when Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks  the market goes down  It hasn t happened every time since he took over the top position early this year  but perhaps often enough that investors might want to consider being extra careful on days when Powell is on the calendar  The fact is  Powell is going to be holding press conferences at every Fed meeting from now on  so that might suggest more volatility ahead  at least based on past experience 
Speaking of volatility  there s no break from that  either  The VIX  fear gauge  jumped double digits to above 28 today  the highest it s been since October 
First Signs of Panic  But That s Not Necessarily All Bad
Ever since the market started getting soft in October  it s been a pretty orderly process on the way down  Selling has mostly been slow and methodical as the S P 500 Index  SPX  dropped hundreds of points from highs above 2940 less than three months ago to where it is now hovering below 2500 
That changed on Thursday in a big way  We saw panic today  and when things get panicked  it can sometimes indicate chances of a sell off losing steam  That s not to say there s been a bottom  only that the market did come back pretty strongly late in the session in a kind of whip saw move before getting slammed again in the very last minutes 
People sometimes ask how one defines panic  Well  it s like Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart once said about another subject  It s hard to describe it  but know it when you see it  When the SPX fell quickly on Thursday from being down 30 points to suddenly being down 60  panic seemed evident 
Some might be surprised to hear this  because maybe it feels like the market has been panicking for weeks  That s understandable  However  the methodical  orderly pattern held up until Thursday 
That raises the question of what s next  Looking ahead to next week  we have a holiday shortened trading schedule and probably some thin volume  While there aren t any guarantees  thin volume can sometimes be a precursor for upward activity  When investors return from the next two holiday weeks to a new calendar year  they ll get some data almost immediately on December payrolls and wages 
After that  we ll start to see earnings  The bulls are likely hoping that CEOs could come on the earnings calls and say things aren t as bad as they look  Of course  it could go the other way  Either way  it s arguably important to get to earnings  because even though data is nice to have  it s backward looking  At this point  with stocks getting buried almost every day  some forward looking perspective from the corporate world might be useful  Companies have been saying lately that they ve seen strong business in the U S  but slowing activity overseas  so investors might want to consider staying tuned to see if there s any change to that and whether CEOs see opportunity once earnings season gets underway in mid January 
Getting back to Thursday and looking for positives  it might be constructive that the dollar index fell moderately to below 97  Recently  a strong dollar has arguably been one weight on the stock market  The Fed backtracking from a three hike outlook down to two for next year might have helped provide some of the greenback pressure 
At the same time  10 year Treasury note yields clawed back to 2 8  after falling under that level for the first time since May  There s been some talk lately that the 45 basis point fall in yields over the last three months or so might be a boost for the home builder market  and sure enough  those stocks have flattened out a bit lately after getting slammed for weeks  Also  emerging market stocks seem to be seeing signs of a possible rebound  but any chance for that probably depends on some sign of major progress in the China tariff situation

Commentary
The plunge continues 
AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  ended the day at a 35 month low  It finally cleared all the earlier oversold periods of 2018 and reached all the way back to the pain of late 2015  This oversold period is now 4 days old but it feels like it has lasted for weeks and weeks 

AT40  T2108  continued its plunge  The 7 7  surpassed the closing lows of all 2018 s earlier oversold periods and hit a 35 month low 
AT200  T2107   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  also continued its plunge but stayed out of single digits  At 12 8  it trades at a fresh 34 month low 

AT200  T2107  dropped to 12 8  and finished at a new 34 month low 
As a reminder  the level of these breadth indicators no longer matter  They are so low that they cannot go much lower  Moves lower do not even say anything about rates of change  The technical damage is so brutal that a vast swath of stocks are tumbling in short to medium term downtrends  I am bullish only in anticipation of the inevitable bounce  but the rally will likely serve as another opportunity for slower hands to dump their inventory of stocks and ETFs   See  A Fed Undeterred Is A Stock Market Not Yet Low Enough  for a more expansive description  
The S P 500  SPY  NYSE SPY   gapped down but rallied quickly to close the gap  The index was mostly downhill from there for a 15 month low 

The S P 500  SPY  lost another 1 6  for a 15 month low 
The NASDAQ Composite and the Invesco QQQ Trust  NASDAQ QQQ  sold off for 1 6  and 1 5  losses and 14 and 15 month lows respectively 
The NASDAQ lost 1 6  for a 14 month low  The Invesco QQQ Trust  QQQ  lost 1 5  and closed at a 13 month low 
The iShares Russell 2000 ETF  NYSE IWM  reached a very important low  The 2 year low brings the index of small cap stocks within sniffing range of a complete reversal of its post election gains  The day after the U S  Presidential election IWM surged for a 3 8  gain and a close of 122 54  IWM has gone from an astounding 41 2  gain since that close at its last all time high to a mere 7 5  gain  That plunged occurred in less than 4 months 

The iShares Russell 2000 ETF  IWM  continued an unabated plunge to a 2 year low 
The volatility index  the VIX  provided one  bright  spot for the oversold period  It finally showed a relatively greater level of fear  it is the kind of higher volatility I would expect for a sell off which is worse and more back breaking than the other sell offs of 2018  The VIX finally punched through 26 and even hit 30 

The volatility index  the VIX  finally broke through the 26 barrier and even hit 30 at one point  The VIX closed with an 8 8  gain 
The small incremental spike in the VIX was my fresh signal to take profits on most of my remaining hedges  gulp   and to do a little more nibbling on long positions  For example  I bought some puts in ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY   I held on buying SPY call options because I already own ProShares Ultra S P500  NYSE SSO   I am thus in no rush  I might add more shares  but I will wait on the calls until I see some evidence of buying interest or of course if the market delivers a truly outsized spike in the VIX  like a 20   1 day gain

171330,392846,CAG,Market Seems To Steady  But Worries Appear To Cap Upside,opinion," Friday Market Open  Today is the Northern Hemisphere s winter solstice the shortest day of the year  at least in terms of daylight  The stock market  however  is still trading normally  and some bulls may be wishing for shorter hours 
While pre market activity wasn t pointing to steep losses like in the previous session  equity index futures still weren t pointing to a large bounce either  The threat of a partial government shutdown continued to add to a bevy of worries weighing on investors ahead of Christmas holiday shortened trading next week 
In addition to concerns out of Washington  investor perceptions appeared to be that the latest Fed rate hike and outlook indicated that central bankers could be more hawkish than some had been hoping  Those issues provided a double whammy of sorts to send some investors scurrying out of riskier assets Thursday 
While all three of the main U S  indices finished sharply lower  the NASDAQ Composite  COMP  only just managed to avoid a bear market on a closing basis  The tech heavy index has been weighed down in recent days amid worries about the trade war between the U S  and China  plus a bit of regulatory overhang  with authorities in the U S  and abroad eyeing data privacy regulations 
Overseas  the United States and China still haven t solved a trade dispute that has been weighing on the market for months over concerns about the prospects for global economic growth  and tensions in Europe continue to swirl surrounding Brexit 
Without much in the way of corporate earnings guidance to potentially temper the negativity  there seems to have been little to stem the December selloff 
Another factor to remember is that today is a quadruple witching day  which involves the simultaneous expiry of stock index futures  stock index options  stock options and single stock futures  While some of the previous selling may have been related to this  it s possible that we could see more volatility before the end of today s close 
In economic news  the government s third estimate of Q3 gross domestic product showed economic output increased by an annualized rate of 3 4   slightly under a Briefing com consensus estimate of 3 5  and a downward revision from the previous government figure of 3 5  
Havens Rise As Risk Switches Off
Stocks weren t the only investments on the back foot on Thursday  Both U S  and international crude benchmarks fell about 5  Thursday as the mood on Wall Street seemed to sap enthusiasm for riskier assets  The risk off sentiment Thursday comes on top of lingering worries about the global economy and doubts that demand can soak up enough supply to push prices meaningfully higher  Energy shares suffered the largest drop of any of the S P 500 sectors Thursday  finishing 2 79  lower 
With Wall Street s fear gauge  the CBOE Volatility Index  hitting an intraday high above 30  its highest mark since February  amid the seemingly panic induced selling  it was perhaps no wonder that perceived safe havens increased 
Gold  often considered a haven in times of market tumult  gained ground as stocks fell  It also appears that the precious metal got some help as the U S  dollar fell  A weaker dollar makes dollar denominated gold less expensive for investors and traders using other currencies  potentially helping demand 
And gold wasn t the only thing shining Thursday  Utilities gained ground to make for the only S P sector in the green  also apparently on safe haven buying  Utilities are often considered a more stable investment because of their history of paying dividends and the fact that people will need power regardless of what the economy and stock market are doing 
In that vein  you may have thought that consumer staples might end on a positive note  but it was right there in the red alongside many of the S P 500 sectors  The biggest loser in the sector was ConAgra Foods  NYSE CAG   which was down more than 16  after the food packaging company reported mixed results for the quarter and issued weak guidance that appeared to disappoint investors 
Nike Jumps After Earnings
In corporate news  Nike  NYSE NKE  shares were off to the races in post market trading after the athletic shoe and apparel maker reported quarterly revenue and earnings per share that beat analyst expectations  NKE was up more than 8  in pre market trading this morning 
The company s performance can be seen as somewhat of a bellwether on the health of the consumer  Sportswear isn t a must have item like food and toilet paper  and revenue growth at Nike could be seen as an indicator that the consumer is healthy  or at least optimistic 

Tech Pressures COMP Steep selling in the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite  COMP   shown here as a candlestick chart  took the index into bear market territory on an intraday basis Thursday  But the COMP managed to close just above that mark  Data Source  Nasdaq Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results  
When is a Hike Not Hawkish  It may seem like a contradiction in terms  but according to investment research firm CFRA  Wednesday s Fed move was a  dovish hike   echoing other market watchers with the phrase  Although the central bank raised its key rate by 25 basis points to 2 25  2 50   it s dot plot projection now shows two versus three hikes in 2019  And the high end of the current rate range is now at the low end of what the Fed projects is a neutral range of 2 5  3    However  other investors may have felt as if they were given a lump of coal  as the policy statement left in the phrase about the need for  some further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate    CFRA noted  And with the Fed s statement that it will  continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook   CFRA is anticipating a rate hike at the Fed s March 19 20 meeting  This puts the research firm squarely in the minority  however  as futures markets currently point to about a 25  chance of a hike at or before the March meeting 
End of an Era  One reason the market may be reacting so negatively to the Federal Reserve commentary could be that  as Briefing com put it  we have reached  the end of a policy era   Comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell including that monetary policy doesn t need to be accommodative at the moment and that current policy isn t restrictive helped to undercut what could have been considered dovish in the Fed s actions Wednesday  The market is  waking up to the reality that the Jerome Powell led Federal Reserve isn t inclined to ride to its rescue with market friendly policy actions and pronouncements   said Patrick J  O Hare  chief market analyst with Briefing com 
Santa Claus Bounce  Market participants often talk about a Santa Claus rally  referring to a rise in stock prices often seen as the year comes to an end and the new year begins  According to Dow Jones Market Data reported by the Wall Street Journal  the S P 500 since 1969 has averaged a 1 3  rise over the last five sessions in December and the first two in January  So it s not too late to see this effect this year  In fact  one argument for a Santa Claus rally this year would be that stocks have gotten hammered so hard this month that they may hit a bottom and rise from there  In that case  maybe we should call it a Santa Claus bounce

 NEW YORK  May 4  Reuters    U S  stocks fell for a third
day on Wednesday as weaker than expected economic data and more
losses in top performing commodity sectors cast doubt on how
much life a market rally had left 
 The data on U S  private sector jobs and the services
sector prompted caution ahead of Friday s key jobs report 
perhaps the most widely watched U S  economic indicator 
  Friday s jobs report will be important   said Michael
Sheldon  chief market strategist  RDM Financial  Westport 
Connecticut   If we get  200 000 job gains  or above  it will
reinforce the idea the economy continues to expand   A Reuters
poll forecast non farm job gains of 186 000 for the month of
April and private payroll gains of 200 000 
 The S P energy sector   which was up 34 percent
since September  dropped 1 2 percent on Wednesday  while
materials  fell 1 3 percent and industrials  lost
1 1 percent 
 Analysts said technicals for the overall market indicated
further underlying support  But investor sentiment appeared to
have turned more bearish  signaling at least a pause in the
rally that began in early September 
  There s been a scarcity of new lows  for indexes      all
of this suggests the technical underpinnings for the market are
fairly positive  But I wouldn t be surprised to see a period of
sideways trading or profit taking   Sheldon said 
 At the same time  the VIX volatility index   Wall
Street s fear gauge  is showing signs of strength 
 It was up 1 8 percent at 17 on Wednesday   This is the
problem area  a potential new uptrend in the VIX   said Larry
McMillan  president of McMillan Analysis Corp in a report   The
longer it holds above 16  the more the danger grows  
 The Dow Jones industrial average  was down 66 26
points  or 0 52 percent  at 12 741 25  The Standard   Poor s
500 Index  was down 7 04 points  or 0 52 percent  at
1 349 58  The Nasdaq Composite Index  was down 5 15
points  or 0 18 percent  at 2 836 47 
 It was a third day of losses for the S P 500 and Nasdaq 
though the S P 500 is up 29 percent since the start of
September 
 In the latest data  the Institute for Supply Management s
services index fell last month well below forecasts  while U S 
private employers added fewer jobs than expected in April  For

 NEW YORK  May 4  Reuters    Weak economic figures
heightened stock investors  anxiety over the extended rally 
knocking U S  shares lower for a third day on Wednesday 
 Recent winners in the energy and industrials sectors were
hit most  and a key indicator of investor worry rose for a
fourth day in what some say is the outset of extended weakness
for stocks 
  I think there is a chance that we put the high in for the
year   said Doug Kass  founder and president of Seabreeze
Partners Management in Palm Beach  Florida 
  Investors should err on the side of conservatism and be
increasing their cash positions   he added 
 The S P energy sector  up almost 12 percent so far in 2011 
dropped 1 6 percent on Wednesday  while materials fell 1 7
percent and industrials lost 1 4 percent  Dow component
Caterpillar Inc lost 2 2 percent to  110 77 on Wednesday but is
still up 18 3 percent for the year 
 Reports showed activity in the vast U S  services sector
slowed and hiring by private companies was weaker than expected
in April  The new orders index in the purchasing managers
survey hit its lowest since December 2009 
 The releases  call into question the bullish notion of a
smooth  self sustaining recovery   Kass said 
 The data also prompted caution before Friday s jobs report
for April  one of the most closely watched U S  economic
indicators 
 The Dow Jones industrial average lost 83 93 points  or 0 66
percent  to 12 723 58  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index fell
9 30 points  or 0 69 percent  to 1 347 32  The Nasdaq Composite
Index dropped 13 39 points  or 0 47 percent  to 2 828 23 
 The CBOE volatility index rose 2 3 percent to 17 08 for a
rise of more than 17 percent over the past four sessions 
 shifting its near term momentum to positive for the first time
in more than a month 
  This is the problem area  a potential new uptrend in the
VIX   said Larry McMillan  president of McMillan Analysis Corp
in a report   The longer it holds above 16  the more the danger
 for the stock market  grows  
 In deal news  chip equipment maker Applied Materials Inc
offered to buy rival Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates
Inc for  63 per share to get its hands on new technology to
meet stronger demand for smartphones and solar equipment 
 Varian shares surged 51 3 percent to  61 36 while Applied
Materials fell 1 percent to  15 09 
 Chip gear maker Novellus Systems jumped 6 5 percent to
 32 92 
 ConAgra Foods Inc raised its bid for Ralcorp Holdings Inc
to  86 a share in cash from  82 
 Shares of ConAgra rose 3 1 percent to  25 51  while
Ralcorp  which owns the Post cereal brand  jumped 4 9 percent
to  87 39 
 About 8 6 billion shares traded on the New York Stock
Exchange  NYSE Amex and Nasdaq  the largest volume since March
18 and above the average 7 74 billion shares traded daily so
far in 2011  Volume was below last year s estimated daily
average of 8 47 billion 
 Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a ratio of
more than 2 to 1  while on the Nasdaq  more than eight stocks
fell for every three that rose

171372,392888,CAG,Peanut recall has US consumers  spooked   experts,news,"By Julie Steenhuysen
 CHICAGO  Feb 9  Reuters     We have temporarily
discontinued the use of peanuts   reads a handwritten sign
behind the register at Penny s Noodle Shop in Oak Park 
Illinois 
 Although the Asian noodle shop did not get its peanuts from
the U S  peanut plant at the center of a widespread salmonella
scare  it has stopped using them anyway   You just don t want
to take a chance   said manager Louie Paine 
 Penny s is not alone 
 The recall of tainted peanut butter and peanut products
made by Peanut Corporation of America is reaching far beyond
the businesses forced to recall 1 790 potentially tainted foods
ranging from ice cream to pet treats 
 Makers of major peanut butter brands    including Jif 
Skippy and Peter Pan    have seen sales fall nearly 25 percent
since the recall began last month  according to Chicago based
market research firm Information Resources Inc 
 The salmonella outbreak traced to the plant in Blakely 
Georgia  has sickened at least 575 people  more than half of
them children  and may be connected to eight deaths 
Authorities say they have found evidence that plant management
intentionally shipped salmonella tainted products 
  These things kind of spook consumers   said Bob Goldin of
Technomic Inc  a Chicago based food industry consulting firm 
said in a telephone interview   I think part of it is you think
they ve gotten it all and it keeps getting worse 
  It is undermining consumer confidence in the food supply  
Goldin said   Until recently consumers thought everything was
fine  Now  I m not sure consumers think that  
 The peanut outbreak is the latest in a series of incidents
involving lettuce  peppers and spinach that have eroded public
confidence in food safety and renewed calls by many for change
at the U S  Food and Drug Administration 
 Despite FDA assurances that major peanut butter brands in
stores are safe  J M  Smucker Company ran ads in major
newspapers on Friday assuring consumers that it  does not buy
peanuts or any ingredients from Peanut Corp of America   It
also offered a coupon for 35 cents off to entice consumers 
 ConAgra Foods Inc ran a similar ad vouching for the safety
of its Peter Pan brand the next day and threw in a coupon for
50 cents off  Unilever is considering some marketing activities
for its Skippy brand  said company spokeswoman Anita Larsen 
  Consumers have questions   said Stephanie Childs  a
ConAgra spokeswoman   They are looking for information  That is
what is driving our action to reach out to consumers  
 Joe Hotchkiss  a professor of food science at Cornell
University in Ithaca  New York  said consumers tend to  paint
with a rather broad brush  when it comes to recalls 
  You can t remember exactly which peanut butter it is so
the whole category of product gets a black eye   he said 
 Hotchkiss  a former FDA employee and frequent adviser to
the agency  said the recall points out the problems with how
food is regulated in the United States 
  We can do better   he said  supporting the notion of a
food safety  super agency  in which foods regulated by the FDA
and the U S  Department of Agriculture are combined

 NEW YORK  May 4  Reuters    U S  stocks fell on Wednesday
as investors took profits in energy and other top performing
sectors for a third day  casting doubt on how much longer the
market s rally may continue 
 Adding to the bearish tone  economic data on private sector
jobs and the services sector were weaker than expected 
 The S P energy sector  which rose 34 percent since
September  was down 2 2 percent on Wednesday  while materials
fell 2 3 percent and industrials lost 1 6 percent 
 Analysts said technicals for the overall market suggest
further underlying support  however  investor sentiment appears
to have turned more bearish  signaling at least a pause in the
upward trend 
  There s been a scarcity of new lows  for indexes      all
of this suggests the technical underpinnings for the market are
fairly positive  But I wouldn t be surprised to see a period of
sideways trading or profit taking   said Michael Sheldon  chief
market strategist  RDM Financial  Westport  Connecticut 
 The S P 500 is up 29 percent since the start of September 
 Among Wednesday s data  the Institute for Supply
Management s services index fell last month well below
forecasts  while U S  private employers added fewer jobs than
expected in April  disappointing some who hoped for stronger
growth ahead of Friday s key jobs report 
 The news also created some worry the recent stock rally has
reached levels that aren t supported by economic fundamentals 
  Friday s jobs report will be important   Sheldon said   If
we get a print of  200 000 job gains  or above  it will
reinforce the idea the economy continues to expand   A Reuters
poll forecasts non farm job gains of 186 000 for the month of
April and private payroll gains of 200 000 
 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 123 36 points  or
0 96 percent  at 12 684 15  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index was
down 13 85 points  or 1 02 percent  at 1 342 77  The Nasdaq
Composite Index was down 28 30 points  or 1 00 percent  at

Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise      Net sales of  1 481 2 million came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 428 million  Though sales dropped 3 6  year over year  it was mainly owing to the divestiture of the SIF business  Excluding the impact of divestiture and SKU rationalization efforts  sales climbed 1 9   courtesy of favorable pricing and currency translations  partly offset by adverse volume mix  Management blamed the year over year fall on soft volume mix on Beverages  Meals  and Snacks units  along with SKU rationalization endeavors Gross margin was 15 7  in the quarter  down 290 basis points  bps  from the year ago figure  due to higher cost of sales stemming from margin improvement initiatives and restructuring activities  Gross margin comparison was also impacted by the reimbursement received in the first quarter of 2017 from product recalls  which was absent this time  Further  gross margin was hurt by increased operating expenses  unfavorable mix and escalated commodity costs  particularly cashews  durum  almonds  packaging  eggs  and oils   These were partially offset by improved pricing Adjusted operating expenses  as a percentage of sales dipped 0 2 percentage points  thanks to savings from Structure to Win initiative  additional cost saving efforts and lower amortization costs  This was somewhat negated by escalated freight costs

freight and warehouse expenses  somewhat cushioned by reduced operating costs Beverages  Sales tumbled 7  to  249 1 million  thanks to unfavorable volume mix and pricing both largely owing to greater competition  During the quarter  direct operating income margin declined 610 bps to 15 8  owing to lower pricing  higher commodity expenses  mainly oil   adverse volume mix and escalated freight costs  These were partially compensated by lower SG A expenses Condiments  Sales for the segment rose 1 6  to  315 2 million as a result of positive pricing and foreign exchange rates  negated by unfavorable volume mix  The latter was a result of SKU rationalization efforts and intense competition in the pickles  sauces and jams categories  Direct operating income margin declined 160 bps to 8 6   primarily due to higher commodity costs  primarily eggs and packaging   increased operating costs and increased freight expenses  This was somewhat compensated by positive currency and reduced SG A costs Meals  Net sales tanked 14 5  to  277 million primarily owing to the divestiture of the SIF business  along with adverse volume mix stemming from competition  Sales were somewhat cushioned by improved pricing  Direct operating income margin increased 30 bps to 10 8   The upside was mainly due to reduced operating expenses and a fall in SG A  partly negated by increased commodity costs  mainly durum  and high freight costs Snacks  Net sales from the segment inched higher by 1 1  to  293 9 million  owing to improved pricing  related to commodity based price increases   partially countered by unfavorable volume mix due to competition  Direct operating income margin crashed 200 bps to 2 3  due to increased commodity costs  particularly of cashews   and greater freight and operating costs  These were partially compensated through lower SG A expenses Other Financial UpdatesThe company concluded the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  128 5 million  long term debt

aligning capacities with consumer needs efficiently Further  management is on track with its TreeHouse 2020 initiative  which is expected to contribute operating margin growth of nearly 300 bps over the next three years  while it also expects annual savings of about  55 million from its Structure to Win plan However  increased freight and commodity costs are likely to remain headwinds for some time now  Management also expects volume mix to remain unfavorable in the second quarter  due to SKU rationalization efforts  These factors  along with an expected operational drag raise concerns for the second quarter  Nevertheless  SG A savings and amortization and tax gains should provide some respite That said  TreeHouse Foods reiterated its earnings guidance for 2018  alongside issuing a

sales and stores that no longer receive supplies from SUPERVALU The segment s adjusted operating income totaled  67 million  up from  60 million in the year ago quarter  However  adjusted operating margin contracted 110 bps to 2 3  due to lower margins from Unified Grocers Retail  Net sales in Retail dropped 0 6  to  690 million  on account of store closures   partially offset by a 0 1  gain in

171498,393014,CAG,Conagra Poised On Robust Growth Drivers Amid Inflation Woes,opinion,On Dec 26  we issued an updated research report on premium consumer goods company Conagra Brands  Inc    NYSE CAG     Existing ScenarioOver the last three months  shares of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company yielded a return of 14 9   outperforming 6 8  growth recorded by the  The company reported better than expected results for second quarter fiscal 2018  ended Nov 30  2017  Conagra s net sales were up 4 1  and organic sales improved 2 3  in the fiscal second quarter fiscal  both on a year over year basis  The upside was driven by elevated sales of the company s renowned branded products such as Healthy Choice  Marie Callender  Slim Jim  Duke s  Bigs and Frontera  Moreover  favorable price mix  product mix and customer mix boosted the quarterly top line results  The company also noted that amid margin pressure  its adjusted earnings had improved year over year during the quarter  primarily on the back of stronger top line performance  We believe these positives will continue to bolster Conagra s results in the quarters ahead Also  Conagra consistently restructures its product portfolio through disciplined mergers   acquisitions  and major divestitures  For instance  the divestiture of J W  Swank and Spicetec Flavors   Seasonings businesses  July 2016  has been stoking its top line growth  Notably  Conagra expects that the Wesson brand s spin off  May 2017  will also complement its portfolio restructuring strategy  On the other hand  the Angie s Artisan Treats  LLC acquisition  October 2017  as well as the latest Sandwich Bros  acquisition  December 2017  are anticipated to drive the company s revenues in the near term Further  Conagra is highly committed toward its shareholders and intends to provide adequate returns on the back of dividends and share buyback offers  During the fiscal second quarter  the company repurchased roughly 8 million shares for  280 million  Conagra is on track with its motto to buy back shares worth  1 1 billion in fiscal 2018 However  prices of various raw inputs used by Conagra are highly sensitive to demand and supply imbalances  as well as changes in government s agricultural policies  Input price inflation often hurts the company s margins by remarkably flaring up its raw material  packaging  energy and operational costs  For instance  in the recently reported quarter  Conagra s gross profit margin contracted 100 basis points year over year  The company stated that this downside largely stemmed from price inflation of certain major inputs  including animal proteins  dairy and oils  The company predicts that it will experience roughly 3 7  cost inflation in fiscal 2018  higher than 3 3  predicted in the preceding quarter  Conagra also mentioned that tropical hurricanes during the fiscal second quarter adversely affected its revenue generating and profit making prospects  The company noted that consumer pantry stocking and warehousing activities had significantly increased during the quarter  especially across grocery and snaking businesses  due to these hurricanes  This would result in sales decline in the upcoming quarters  Furthermore  these environmental hazards escalated the company s warehousing and transportation expenses  in turn hurting operating margins In addition to the above  Conagra conducts its business in a highly competitive industry  Intense competition increases the bargaining power of consumers and exposes the company to risks of market share loss  Moreover  in order to increase or retain demand from prospective end users  Conagra not only needs to ensure good product quality and prices but also has to maintain greater corporate transparency by ascertaining health and wellness aspects of products  Maintaining the desired level of transparency often becomes challenging for the company Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top ranked stocks in the same space are listed below Greencore Grp   OTC GNCGY   currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy   The company s earnings per share  EPS  are projected to be up 8 90  in the next three to five years  You can see  Flowers Foods  Inc    NYSE FLO   holds a Zacks Rank of 2  Buy   The company s EPS is estimated to rise 6 10  over the next three to five years Lamb Weston Holdings Inc    NYSE LW   also carries a Zacks Rank of 2  The company s EPS is estimated to be up 5 70  during the same time frame Zacks Editor in Chief Goes   All In   on This StockFull disclosure  Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other  He believes in its short term profit potential and also in its prospects to more than double by 2019  Today he reveals and explains his surprising move in a new Special Report ,2017-12-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/conagra-poised-on-robust-growth-drivers-amid-inflation-woes-200275770,200275770
171499,393015,CAG,Is ConAgra Foods  CAG  A Great Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put ConAgra Foods  Inc    NYSE CAG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  ConAgra Foods has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 20 4   as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 22 9x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  ConAgra Foods  current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that ConAgra Foods has a forward PE  ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 19 9  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for ConAgra Foods stock in the near term too  P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  ConAgra Foods has a P S ratio of about 1 9  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 6x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  ConAgra Foods currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40   of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes ConAgra Foods a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though ConAgra Foods might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of C  This gives CAG a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to four lower  while the full year estimate has seen four up and one down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 1 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched upper by 1 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action  for the stock in the chart below Conagra Brands Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineConAgra Foods is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  with a strong industry rank  among Top 42  of more than 250 industries  instilss our confidence on the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3 it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All                 Last year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the world s first trillionaires    but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2018-01-30,Zacks

171520,393036,CAG,Why You Should Buy Nomad Foods  NOMD  Stock Right Now,opinion,It goes without saying that the food industry has been suffering from lower sales for the last few quarters  Much of the sales debacle can be attributed to the changing eating pattern of consumers and their evolving preference for healthy  fresh and organic food products  Again  the industry has been grappling with other challenges like stiff competition  weak margins and aggressive promotional environment That said  overlooking the industry will not be prudent as there are several companies with a decent performance history and strong fundamentals  signaling at a profitable investment opportunity  After all  year end seasonal factors will continue to drive stocks higher  Nomad Foods Ltd    NYSE NOMD   is one such company that continues to show strength in a number of areas and adding the stock to your portfolio should not be a disappointment  So far this year  Nomad Foods s shares have skyrocketed more than 71  against the  s loss of 4 9   Also  the company  engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of frozen food items  primarily in the U K   Italy  Germany  Sweden  France and Norway  outperformed the industry in all the other time frames we considered   4 week  12 week and 52 week In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year and next year earnings have moved north by 1 8  and 3 1   respectively  over the last 30 days  This bullish sentiment of analysts justifies the stock s current Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are expecting it to outperform in the near term  You can see  What Makes Nomad Foods a Solid BetStellar Performance and Upbeat Views  The company has been witnessing robust performance buoyed by strong organic revenue growth and favorable category performance coupled with market share gains  This momentum is underpinned by a strong balance sheet and a portfolio of market leading brands  Again  the company has impressive growth prospects within European frozen foods market and beyond In the last reported quarter  Nomad Foods reported 5 9  organic revenue growth  representing a third consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth and market share expansion  Notably  the company s U K  business  largest market  returned to growth in the third quarter following few consecutive quarters of declines  It experienced stellar growth in 10 of its 13 core countries  including the U K In the first nine months of 2017  the company registered organic revenue growth of 3 3   driven by 2 6  growth in volume mix and 0 7  growth in price  Gross

the industry as well as the market at large  as the current P E for the industry and S P 500 is at 22 2 and 21 5  respectively  Its lower than market positioning calls for an upside in the quarters ahead Again  the company s trailing 12 month Price to Sales or P S ratio of 1 32 is lower than the industry s 1 97x as well as S P 500 s 3 41x Other Stocks to ConsiderYou can consider a few other top

Adjusted earnings of 73 cents per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  However  earnings increased 1 4  year over year driven by higher operating income in the smokeable segment and lower outstanding shares  This was offset by lower equity earnings from Altria s beer investment and lower income in the smokeless products segment  which was negatively impacted from the recall of some of its smokeless tobacco products 
In January  U S  Smokeless Tobacco Co  a unit of Altria Group  had recalled some of its smokeless tobacco products after getting complaints from eight consumers in Indiana  Texas  North Carolina  Tennessee  Wisconsin and Ohio  who allegedly found some sharp metal objects in certain cans 
Revenues and Margins

Segment Details
Smokeable Products Segment  Revenues net of excise taxes inched up 1 9  year over year to  4 0 billion despite a difficult year over year comparison  The increase was primarily driven by strong pricing  partially offset by lower volume and higher promotional investments  Total shipment volume decreased 2 6  year over year to 29 1 billion units  Cigarettes retail market share declined 0 1 share point to 51  in the quarter 
Adjusted operating companies income   OCI   increased 8 1   while adjusted OCI margins expanded 2 9 percentage points to 51 0

The deal will bring together two large grocery wholesale organizations with combined sales of  16 billion in 2016  Both Supervalu and Unified will have 24 distribution centers and serve a customer base of over 3 000 stores 
Following the completion of the merger  Unified Grocers will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Supervalu  By the end of the third year after the transaction  the combined business will save at least  60 million in operating costs  The transaction is expected to be accretive to earnings per share  excluding the transition and integration costs as well as potential purchase accounting adjustments  in fiscal year 2018 
We believe the acquisition is a strategic fit for Supervalu  which has been focusing more on its wholesale business than retail as its retail businesses have been witnessing a slowdown due to tough competitive pressure  deflationary environment in the food industry and soft sales in the retail segment 
The company s shares declined 28 6  in the past year underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s gain of 0 4  in the same time frame 

Deflation in the grocery industry has also hit the company s profits  An oversupply in some types of food   particularly meat  poultry and dairy   has  lowered prices and forced grocery stores into more aggressive promotions  Moreover  customers are becoming more receptive to purchasing private label products as a low cost alternative to national brands  However  the company has undertaken several initiatives to post a turnaround 
In order to combat declining sales at the retail segment  the company is working on new pricing strategies and has plans to expand retail banners  Supervalu is geared to rebrand most of its retail banners in order to create a unique clearly defined identity for each of the brands  communicated through in store signage  weekly ads  customer emails  mobile devices and banner web pages  Further  the company has developed the store within a store concept to expand offerings and started offering home delivery through the Instacart app 
Supervalu has also spun off its underperforming business Save A Lot to private equity firm Onex Corporation in Jan 2017 in order to concentrate on more profitable core businesses and fund several other turnaround initiatives 
It is better to wait and see if these initiatives help the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock to post a turnaround in the near future SuperValu Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Revenues from combustible products declined 6 6   down 4 3  excluding negative currency  to  5 6 billion  On the contrary  Reduced Risk Products  RRPs  reported a whooping increase from last year quarter  stemming from the shift of customer preference away from tobacco products 
Total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume fell 9 4  to 178 0 billion units  due to a tough year over year comparison as well as low price volumes in specific markets  including Pakistan and Philippines  Last year  the results were benefited from the favorable estimated impact of the leap year

Eastern Europe  the Middle East   Africa  EEMA   Net revenue in EEMA region declined 7 8  year over year to  1 5 billion  Excluding the impact of currency  net revenue declined 1 6  primarily due to 10 2  decline in cigarette and heated tobacco shipment volumes  Also  unfavorable volume mix and lower total market share were overshadowed by the favorable pricing primarily in Egypt  Saudi Arabia and Ukraine 
Asia  The company recorded net revenue growth of 13 9  to  2 2 billion in Asia  Excluding currency impact  revenue was up 11  from the prior year quarter  despite a 9 7  decline in cigarette and heated tobacco shipment volumes  The increase was supported by favorable pricing in Australia  Indonesia and Philippines  along with favorable volume mix driven by favorable heated tobacco unit volume in Japan  However  it was partly offset by unfavorable volume mix in Indonesia and unfavorable volume in Australia  Pakistan and Philippines 
Latin America and Canada  In Latin America and Canada  revenues declined 6 8   down 3 4  excluding currency  to  606 million  primarily due to 11 1  decline in cigarette and heated tobacco shipment volumes  Also  unfavorable volume mix was partly offset by a favorable pricing in Argentina  Canada and Mexico 
Financial Update

Guidance
Philip Morris raised its earnings guidance for 2017  owing to a favorable tax item of 4 cents  The company now expects 2017 earnings in the band of  4 84  4 99 per share  compared with the earlier guidance of  4 80  4 95    This was also higher than adjusted earnings of  4 48 reported in 2016  Excluding unfavorable currency of 8 cents expected in full year 2017 and favorable tax item of 4 cents reported in the first quarter  this earnings guidance reflects growth of nearly 9 12  over 2016  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is currently pegged at  4 90  which is within the company s guidance range 
Further  the company expects revenue growth  excluding excise taxes  to be more than its present target growth  which in the range 4 6   annually  Moreover  the outlook excludes share repurchases in the year  However  the company anticipates a combined cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume decline of 3  to 4  for the full year 
Nevertheless  we believe the company s strong pricing power and focus on accelerating IQOS volume growth will help the company deliver upbeat results in 2017

4 Stocks to Celebrate World Food Day

 Climate is changing  Food and agriculture must too  

	This is the theme of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  FAO  for this year s World Food Day   WFD   The theme revolves around the fact that the global climate is undergoing a drastic change  which is heavily affecting food and agriculture production  On the other hand  population is also growing steadily  which means a gradual rise in food demand 

	This is why it is important to adopt effective steps to boost food and agriculture production by a significant extent in order to meet rising demand despite the effects of climate change  Most countries are coming forward to explore different ways to make food production and agriculture more sustainable in order to exterminate hunger completely from the entire world 

Objectives of WFD

	Since the time it was first observed in 1979  WFD is celebrated every year on October 16  the day on which the FAO was created with the aim to eradicate global hunger  Millions of people from across the world celebrate this day by participating in several events that are organized to promote awareness about different issues  including food wastage and lack of preservation of water for irrigation  that lead to scarcity of food  These events include the WFD dinner  a meal packaging event and hunger walk 

	This year s WFD will be celebrated at a time when the United Nations  UN  is preparing for the Climate Change Conference  COP 22  which will be held from November 7 to 18 in Marrakech  Morocco  Countries throughout the globe have been asked to give special importance to food and agriculture in the climate action plans they provide  The FAO have also asked countries to raise their rural development investments  In Sep 2015  193 countries committed to eliminate hunger by 2030 

Why Bet on Consumer Staples 

	The concerns related to scarcity of food  which is one of the main reasons for hunger  are mostly associated with the consumer staples category  Even in a country like the U S   the popularity of this category provides important indications about the financial markets and the overall economy  Though the sector has struggled for most part of this year  there is still scope for a rebound  Concerns including food deflation  rising competition and slowdown in demand in emerging markets affected the sector 

	However  it is being speculated that signs of improvement in the U S  economy in the second half of this year hold the key for the sector s rebound  Recently released economic data  including the ISM manufacturing and services Indexes  consumer confidence data and consumer credit numbers have been encouraging  which indicates that the economy is back on track 

	Separately  rising possibilities of a rate hike in December is also expected to attract investors  attention to this category  Consumer staples is considered to be one of the major defensive sectors and is expected to remain relatively unaffected by a rate hike 

4 Stocks to Consider

	Selecting financially strong consumer staples stocks  especially those whose operations are related to food production  might be a profitable option ahead of World Food Day  Food producing companies have an important role to play in eliminating hunger in the days ahead  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult 

	This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score 

	We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM score

171692,393208,CAG,ConAgra  CAG  Beats Q1 Earnings On Restructuring Initiatives ,opinion,"North American food company  ConAgra Foods  Inc    NYSE CAG   reported mixed results for first quarter fiscal 2017  ended Aug 28  2016  Quarterly earnings from continuing operations  adjusted for items impacting comparability  came in at 61 cents  above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents 
The bottom line also comfortably surpassed the year ago tally by 48 8  
The remarkable year over year improvement came on the back of benefits generated from the company s meaningful restructuring moves ConAgra is currently undergoing rigorous structural changes by divesting its less profitable businesses and acquiring new brands  for boosting its revenues and margins 
Revenues
ConAgra generated net revenue of  2 667 5 million in the fiscal first quarter  down 4 6  year over year  The year over year decline resulted from lower volumes accrued due to the company s initiatives to create an improved quality revenue base 
The company s divestitures and unfavorable foreign currency translation lowered sales by roughly 2   However  these headwinds were partially offset by raised price mix and improved Lamb Weston trade 
The top line also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 742 million 
Segmental Break Up
Effective from fiscal 2017  ConAgra would account its results in five reporting segments 
Grocery   Snacks  The segment s quarterly sales were  757 2 million  5 4  year over year 
Refrigerated   Frozen  Quarterly revenues declined 8 1  year over year to  604 6 million 
International  Sales of the segment were  194 7 million  down 5 7  year over year 
Foodservice  The segment s quarterly revenues were  268 million  down 1  year over year 
Commercial  Revenues came in at  843 million in fiscal first quarter  down 2  year over year 
Other Financial Fundamentals
ConAgra s cost of goods sold decreased 7 2  year over year to  1 943 4 million  Selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses plummeted 30 6  year over year to  281 5 million  Interest expenses plunged 26 5  to  59 million stemming from lower debt levels 
ConAgra exited the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  794 6 million  lower than  843 5 million recorded at the end of fiscal 2016  Senior long term debt  excluding current portion  was  4 255 5 million  down from  4 721 9 million as of May 29  2016 
In the fiscal first quarter  ConAgra generated net cash worth  325 9 million from operating activities  up from  93 1 million in first quarter fiscal 2016  Capital spent on additions of property  plant and equipment totaled  117 4 million  up 15 6  year over year 
During the reported quarter  ConAgra paid dividends worth  109 5 million compared with  107 1 million paid a year ago   
Outlook
ConAgra claimed that by the end of fiscal 2017  it would successfully spin off its Lamb Weston business  This would result in the formation of two separate pure play public companies   ConAgra Brands and Lamb Weston  The decision reflects the company s focus on greater commercial flexibility and intention to boost near term profits Lamb Weston and ConAgra Brands would be hosting investor events on Oct 13 and Oct 18  2016  respectively Zacks Rank and Share PriceConAgra currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   ConAgra s stock price was  43 18 per share  nearly up 0 12  on pre market trading basis  Clearly  the initial reaction to the release has been positive  We view the company s robust earnings performance in the fiscal first quarter as the primary reason responsible for this positive sentiment CONAGRA FOODS Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

171708,393224,CAG,Treehouse Foods Hits 52 Week High On Strong Q1 Results,opinion,"Shares of Treehouse Foods Inc    NYSE THS   reached a 52 week high of  99 49 on Jun 28 and eventually closed at  98 64  Shares have been gaining momentum since the company reported strong first quarter 2016 results on May 5 
What Led to the Rise 
Estimates have been increasing over the past 60 days since the food manufacturer posted better than expected first quarter 2016 results  This Illinois based food company posted earnings per share of 48 cents per share in the first quarter of 2016  Though earnings declined 18 6  from the year ago level due to lower gross margin and currency headwinds  it beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents by 20  and were way ahead of the company s guided range of 38   43 cents TREEHOUSE FOODS Price   Net sales of  1 270 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 248 billion by 1 8   Sales also grew significantly by 62 2  year over year due to the inclusion of business from the Private Brands acquisition  partially offset by lower volume mix  primarily in the Industrial and Export segment  and currency headwinds 
All the segments posted strong growth on a year over year basis  North American Retail Grocery segment sales increased 72 1   Sales from the Food Away From Home segment grew 27 5   and sales from the Industrial and Export segment increased 35  
Adjusted EBITDA increased 48 2  to  125 2 million driven by the inclusion of operating income from the acquisition of the private brands operations of ConAgra Foods  Inc    NYSE CAG    operating efficiencies  and favorable commodity costs  partially offset by currency headwinds and lower legacy volumes 
Looking Ahead
In 2016  the company anticipates weakness in the overall food industry  However  TreeHouse is optimistic about its acquisitions and plans to focus on integrating its recently closed acquisition of the Private Brands Business 
TreeHouse net sales are expected to double in 2016 to approximately  6 3  6 5 billion  driven by the addition of the Private Brands Business  despite its lower margin structure than the legacy TreeHouse business 
TreeHouse carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Top 5 Stocks with Powerful Sales Growth to Buy Now 

An age old Wall Street saying has it that  uncertainty is the enemy of investors   If this be so  picking stocks rationally based on fundamentals is the key to navigating any market downturn  In this article  among several rational and down to earth investment strategies  we picked one that is focused on the sales growth of a company 

Why Sales Growth 
	A healthy business with steady sales growth is the key to survival in today s fast changing and highly competitive business environment  As such  superior revenues are necessary to drive growth  and most companies look for a strong relationship between sales growth levels and the value of an enterprise 
	Revenues are income generated by a company through business activities  Though a company might not be profitable over a particular time period  it usually generates revenues unless there are unforeseen situations like a factory shut down  a strike and lack of human capital or any other resources required for products and services 
	Notably  in cases when companies tend to incur a loss on a temporary basis due to short term situations like product development stage  new entrant in a high growth industry or paying higher taxes  companies are valued based on revenues and not on earnings  This is because sales growth  or decline  is usually an early indicator of the company s future earnings performance 
	The Price to Sales  P S  ratio takes into account a company s revenue when valuing it  Notably  it remains a key stock selection criteria keeping in mind that management usually has limited opportunities to fiddle with revenues as they can with earnings  Thus  the P S ratio is subject to lower manipulation than the Price to Earnings ratio Ensure Right Picks
	While sales growth is an important metric for any corporate for the purpose of growth projections and strategic decision making  this in isolation doesn t indicate too much about a company s future performance  Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  a huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits 
	Therefore  a consideration of a company s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and further potential investments  Most importantly  an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction Right Strategy

A careful selection of stocks considering certain factors should help investors not only to build wealth but beat the market as well 

In order to shortlist stocks that have impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we added 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our primary screening parameters 
	However  sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added a few other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry    This metric measures the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Northward estimate revision has often been observed to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is being translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  High ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 
	Here are 5 of the 13 stocks that made it through the screen Raymond James Financial  Inc      a Florida based company in the investment brokerage space  has a long term expected EPS  earnings per share  growth rate of 17 0   The company sports a Zacks Rank  1 LPL Financial Holdings Inc      also operating in the investment brokerage space  currently has a long term expected EPS growth rate of 15   This Massachusetts based company sports a Zacks Rank  1 Total System Services  Inc     is engaged in offering payment processing  merchant  and related payment services to financial and nonfinancial institutions globally  This Georgia based company currently has a long term expected EPS growth rate of 13 7  and sports a Zacks Rank  1 Two Harbors Investment Corp     is a Florida based real estate investment trust  REIT  that is engaged in investing in  financing  and managing residential mortgage backed securities  The company has a long term expected EPS growth rate of 4 8  with a Zacks Rank  2 ConAgra Foods  Inc      a Nebraska based packaged food company  has a long term expected EPS growth rate of 8 1   The company carries a Zacks Rank  2

171747,393263,CAG,JANA Preys On Conagra  What To Expect From Today s Results,opinion," NYSE CAG  reports its FQ4  15 results this morning and it is likely to draw a great deal of attention due to the recent activist stake accumulated by JANA Partners  Wall Street is predicting flat earnings QoQ of  0 59 compared to the Estimize community which predict a slightly higher figure of  0 60  Estimize has also predicted higher revenues than Wall Street with an estimate of  4 167B compared to Wall Street s  4 140B 
ConAgra operates its business through three different segments  Consumer Foods  Commercial Foods  and Private Brands  ConAgra sells its products through a range of distribution channels and focuses on retail such as grocery and convenience stores  Its operations are predominately focused in North America 
Recently  ConAgra was brought into the spotlight when New York based activist investor JANA Partners  disclosed to the market that they had taken a 7 2   approx   1 2B  stake in the company  ConAgra s management have made clear to the market that they have no intention of discussing the recent developments until the FQ4  15 results are released  In addition  JANA are yet to disclose their full intentions to the market  However  JANA is well known for its skill at taking activists stakes leading to either split offs or outright sales  This was recently demonstrated when JANA targeted PetSmart  NASDAQ PETM  in the latter stages of 2014  which they then sold to a private equity firm 5 months later 
ConAgra s earnings have been struggling for some time as the public becomes more health conscious and moves away from ConAgra s consumer  oriented brands  which include Hutns  PAM  Chef Boyardee  Bertolli and Blue Bonnet among others   In addition to this  increasing competition is driving down margins  The lack of earnings growth has been reflected in ConAgra s share price up until the recent announcement involving JANA  Before the announcement was made  ConAgra s stock had underperformed the S P 500 by 40  over a five year period 
The report later today  as well as the days following will be very interesting as the market will not only get a better understanding of ConAgra s business performance  but will also receive guidance on what both JANA and ConAgra s management intend on doing moving forward ",2015-06-30,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/jana-preys-on-conagra.-what-to-expect-from-tomorrow’s-result-256671,256671

171784,393300,CAG,Why I Love This Food Company,opinion,It s impossible to get more basic or old economy than Chef Boyardee  The brand is owned by ConAgra Foods  Inc   CAG   which is one of North America s largest packaged food enterprises  The company s brands are found in 97  of American households  and it has a large commercial foods segment ConAgra just reported a very good quarter  especially considering how mature and competitive the food business is  Frankly  the company s sales and earnings were quite impressive Total revenues for the 13 weeks ended May 26  2013 grew to  4 59 billion  up 33 7  over the comparable quarter  The company s consumer foods division grew 7 3  to 2 3 billion  while commercial foods grew 3 5  to  1 33 billion  The rest of the revenue gain came from the acquisition of Ralcorp Holdings  Inc   which added  962 million to revenues and  108 million in operating earnings In its fiscal fourth quarter of 2013  ConAgra s earnings were a solid  192 million  compared to a loss of  86 2 million in the same quarter last year For its full fiscal year  ended May 26  2013   ConAgra s total sales grew 15 9  to  15 5 billion  Earnings grew an impressive 65 4  to  774 million The company s cash balance also grew significantly to  184 million  and shareholders  equity jumped to  5 4 billion  up from  4 5 billion ConAgra s 20 year stock chart is featured below The company s share price recently crossed below its 50 day simple moving average  but as the above chart illustrates  the shares have clearly broken out after a long consolidation Currently yielding three percent on the stock market  this position looks to be fully priced with a price to earnings ratio of around 29 But what the Street likes about the company s return to profitability was its solid forecast for the future This fiscal year  the company expects its adjusted earnings per share  for comparability purposes  to be  2 40  representing 11  comparable growth Management cited a strong earnings contribution from its Ralcorp acquisition and continued growth in its consumer foods division as reasons for the solid forecast The company expects some  300 million in annual pre tax cost synergies from the Ralcorp business by the end of fiscal 2017 Because of this  annual adjusted diluted earnings per share between fiscal 2015 and 2017 are targeted at a minimum of 10  The company forecasts annual adjusted earnings per share growth of between seven and nine percent for the long term  with annual sales growth expected to be between three and four percent This is an improvement over ConAgra s previous expectations  and while the earnings forecast might not seem that robust  they are very solid for such a large and mature enterprise  Institutional investors want certainty  and that s exactly what ConAgra delivered in its latest quarter  They bid the shares significantly on the company s earnings results The numbers so far are modest  but generally holding up much like in the first quarter  There have been some earnings surprises  both up and down  Big investors are still nibbling away at positions  and as earnings season gets into full swing  this will be the biggest trading catalyst  From my perspective  the stock market remains a big hold  Interest rates are going up as they should be  They ve been held down for far too long  Large cap balance sheets remain excellent Disclaimer  There is no magic formula to getting rich  Success in investment vehicles with the best prospects for price appreciation can only be achieved through proper and rigorous research and analysis  The opinions in this e newsletter are just that  opinions of the authors  Information contained herein  while believed to be correct  is not guaranteed as accurate  Warning  Investing often involves high risks and you can lose a lot of money  Please do not invest with money you cannot afford to lose ,2013-07-03,Mitchell Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-i-love-this-food-company-173827,173827
171785,393301,CAG,Everybody Eats So  ,opinion,"ConAgra  NYSE CAG  crept onto the radar this past weekend and is consolidating nicely ahead of a possible breakout  The chart below shows the tapping against resistance at 31 65 and near the 200 day SMA  The RSI is rising and is

in the bullish zone while the MACD is rising and investors are accumulating the stock  The Measured Move higher takes it to about 34 on the broad scale and 33 on the shorter scale  And a move to those levels would break the downtrending resistance on the weekly chart as well  Maybe this is a good longer term hold as well
