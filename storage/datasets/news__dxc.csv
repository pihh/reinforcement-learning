Shares of DXC Technology  NYSE DXC  fell 29 3  in 2019  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence  The IT services company  which was born in 2017 from the merger of Computer Sciences Corporation and the enterprise services division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise  saw revenue and earnings fall all year long  And that s just the beginning of DXC s troubles 

DXC Revenue  TTM  data by YCharts 
So what
The chart above shows everything you need to know about DXC s financial performance over the last six quarters  Trailing revenue fell 7 3  over this period while earnings per share plunged 44   DXC s stock lost 55  of its value over the same time frame  The first quarter report in August triggered the sharpest single day drop along the way  based on in line results but a weak slate of next quarter guidance targets 
The company completed its search for a new CEO in September  but the replacement was widely regarded as a downgrade and DXC s stock only fell faster on the news  DXC is now looking for buyers of several underperforming divisions that currently represent roughly 25  of its total revenue 

Now what
The asset sale was announced in November and investors were quick to embrace that idea  DXC s share prices surged 35  higher that month  even though the announcement was paired with cuts to the company s full year guidance  Analysts called it a  reset  of Wall Street s short term expectations  which sounds like a good thing 
But even that huge jump left DXC s shareholders with a 29  loss in 2019 as a whole and even larger drops if you look further back  The stock is still priced for absolute disaster at 6 1 times forward earnings and five times trailing free cash flow  That s not a pessimistic view  but a realistic one  Asset sales may tap the brakes on this long term decline  but I m still not convinced that DXC belongs on any serious investor s list of great ideas today ",2020-01-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pg1up,2056349

the Information presented on the call  except as required by law And now I d like to introduce DXC Technology s President and CEO  Mike Salvino  Mike Mike Salvino    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Shailesh  And I appreciate everyone joining the call today  As I mentioned on my first earnings call  my style is one of focus and clarity and our comments today concerning the quarter will follow that direction Let me quickly outline the agenda for today s call  I will update you on the progress against the priorities discussed during our Q2 earnings call  These priorities of running the business and unlocking value represents the transformational journey that we re on at DXC  We call this our focused strategy  Paul will then take you through the financial details of our third quarter results and our business outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year  I will then make some closing remarks concerning what s next on the transformational journey before we take questions Turning to our third quarter  I m pleased with the initial progress we ve made on the priorities of running the business and unlocking value through reported financial results in line with our plan  Simply put  we did what we said we are going to do  and we are executing nicely against our new focused strategy Revenue was up 3  sequentially in constant currency  We also delivered on our profitability expectations  and our book to bill ratio of 1 06 was our best in three quarters  As I ve discussed with you before  this transformation will not be a quick fix  but I am confident that our new focused strategy will position DXC to compete in the IT services space Let me give you a little color now around the progress we are making with our customers  people  operational execution  and unlocking value  As I continue to meet customers  I m most impressed with the types of services our customers have entrusted us with for years  The applications and infrastructure we are running are at the heart of our customers  businesses  I ve used the phrase inside of DXC that we have the courage to deliver the critical for our customers  This is truly unique in the IT services space  Without the work that our people do every day for our customers  planes don t fly  hospitals don t operate  and Black Friday sales are not completed During our last call  I mentioned that we needed to leverage our ITO business and make investments to improve our delivery and regain trust with some of our customers  I have a fundamental belief that by running our customers  critical systems smoothly  we will earn the right to win additional business This is one of the key tenants of our focused strategy  leveraging our ITO business to grow DXC  We have been focusing on account management and delivery capabilities  and we re making good progress  My original assessment had 20 to 30 accounts in the challenged category  meaning we were not meeting service levels or customers were not pleased with our performance  We started doing in depth reviews and saw some partial terminations and two accounts that terminated completely  During this quarter  we established a very focused program that includes 40 accounts to address these issues  These accounts represent about a quarter of our revenue  Overall  this program is off to a good start with seven accounts graduating out of this program  We expect a majority of these accounts to be turned around by the end of Q4 and the program to be completed in the first half of fiscal  21 I ve been receiving positive comments during my check in calls  I ve done 92 in total  And this program has clearly created positive momentum with our customers  In fact  we have already been awarded over  500 million of business from several of these accounts in the form of renewals and new work  Some of this new work was previously put on hold and some of the new work is in analytics  which is at the top of the enterprise technology stack  This is solid evidence that leveraging the ITO business and focusing on our customers  people  and operational execution is the right strategy to grow DXC Turning now to our people  We have held town halls in every region in this past quarter  and we have completed a global employee survey  We received over 140 000 comments representing that our people are engaged  They re telling us that they are seeing positive changes and are feeling optimistic Our current focus areas for our people are learning opportunities  career prospects  and compensation  During this quarter  a great example of our action and investment was implementing salary increases for our Indian delivery centers ahead of our typical salary review cycle Another area where we re making progress is attracting new talent  In Q3  we added roughly 50 leaders to DXC in the areas of account management  delivery  and corporate functions  We also added two more senior leaders to our leadership team  Both Carla and Chris have impeccable resumes  broad experience  and played broader roles in their prior companies  but joined DXC to be a part of the transformation journey  Carla is our Chief Risk Officer and leads physical and virtual security  ethics and compliance  and overall enterprise risk management  And Chris will be our CIO and will lead our IT transformation to deliver tools to our people to better serve our customers I ve also made a couple of key leadership changes  Vinod is now leading global delivery and Steve is accountable for our business in UKIIMEA  All of these hires are integrating well with the existing team and the total team is making an immediate and positive impact  Our book to bill of 1 06 for this quarter is evidence that we are working well as a team We re also seeing a positive shift in the market about DXC s brand perception  This is evidenced by DXC alumni rejoining us and others reaching out to join the transformation journey  I am thrilled that Ian Read  the retired Chairman and CEO of Pfizer  will be joining us as our new Chairman  Ian brings a wealth of experience  particularly in the area of leading large public companies through transformations  All of this gives me confidence that we can attract  integrate  and retain top talent to execute on our focused strategy Another key component to running the business is operational execution  We are taking steps to improve delivery execution  Vinod and his team are examining our delivery footprint  utilization  and talent to improve our quality  speed  and cost of delivery  Ultimately our goal is to consolidate and further scale our delivery operations We are now also moving to a regionally focused operating model with a tighter management system  designed to speed up decision making and increase accountability  From an industry perspective  we are bringing together our automotive and banking capabilities with Luxoft under Dmitry s leadership to take advantage of the opportunities in those 2 industries As I previously mentioned  we are leveraging our ITO business to begin to grow DXC  Let me give you a little bit more detail on the plan  We are using our unique industry capability of Virtual Clarity to assess the IT estates of our top 200 accounts  These assessments will allow us to have fact based dialog with our customers concerning the migration of their IT estate to the cloud  In these discussions  we talk about technical feasibility  risk  the value proposition  and the ability of our customers to execute such a migration along with their need for assistance In the fourth quarter  we will complete these assessments for 30 of our top accounts  and we will be in the market engaging with our customers  This work will allow us to have productive and proactive discussion with our customers and give us hard numbers concerning how fast our ITO business  which has a large amount of mission critical applications and infrastructure in it  will move to the cloud Now let me turn my comments to the area of unlocking value  The clarity of our strategy to focus on the enterprise technology stack has given us an opportunity to engage with our customers and better align with their needs  We are introducing our customers to the breadth of our offerings across the enterprise technology stack  and customers are reacting positively by communicating to us and industry players that they have an interest in trying our services We re also executing    we re also executing well in pursuing strategic alternatives for three businesses and are on track to hit the timeline we ve set for ourselves  We have retained several world class advisors to help us with this effort  and our plan is to be in the market this month Let me comment briefly on the three businesses  In state and local health and human services  it s been business as usual  And we are in the final stage of adding one new state to our portfolio  In the other two business  horizontal BPS and workplace and mobility  results were mixed but they were in line with our expectations  On the positive side  some customers have awarded us new work or have renewed existing contracts  However  there has been a few cases where customers are pushing out renewals  insourcing the work  or have indicated their intent not to renew with us Now I m going to hand the call over to Paul to take you through the third quarter results and our business outlook for the fourth and full year Paul Saleh    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Mike  and greetings  everyone  As usual  I ll start by covering some items that are excluded from our non GAAP results this quarter  In the current quarter  we had restructuring cost of  74 million pre tax  or  0 25 per diluted share  These costs were primarily related to workforce optimization and facilities rationalization Also in the quarter  we had  68 million pre tax  or  0 20 per diluted share  of integration and transaction and separation related costs  Year to date restructuring transaction  separation  and integration costs amounted to  474 million pre tax  or  1 49 per diluted share  In the third quarter  amortization of acquired intangibles was  146 million pre tax  or  0 44 per diluted share Now in the quarter  we recorded an out of period tax adjustments of  53 million related to the goodwill impairment we took in the second quarter  Now this non cash adjustment does not impact income from continuing operations  net income  or earnings per share  However  in connection with this out of period adjustment we determined that we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting  and this is primarily relating to complex transactions and processes  This material weakness does not involve any restatement of prior issued financials  More information about our remediation plan is included in our Form 10 Q  which we expect to file after the close of business tomorrow  Excluding all of these special items  our non GAAP income before taxes from continuing operations was  468 million and our non GAAP EPS was  1 25 I ll now move on to our third quarter results in more detail  GAAP revenue in Q3 was  5 02 billion  As always  all revenue comparisons I will discuss will be in constant currency  Our Q3 revenues represent a sequential increase of 3   While we typically experience a pickup in activities in Q3 compared with Q2  our revenue growth this quarter also reflects in part add on and project work from customers who had previously put business with us on hold  Now these are encouraging signs that the investment we re making to turn around challenged accounts are starting to pay off Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was  528 million  Adjusted EBIT margin was 10 5   in line with the plan we shared with you on our last earnings call  Our EBIT margin was down 40 basis points sequentially  That s reflecting the moderation of our cost takeout activities as well as additional investment in the business consistent with our stated priorities of customers  people  and operational execution In the quarter  our non GAAP tax rate was 29 9   slightly better than our expectations of 32  to 33   Book to bill in the quarter was 1 06 times  We were able to close a few deals that had slipped from Q1 and Q2 and convert new business opportunities across every layer of the enterprise technology stack  This book to bill reflects the collaboration among all the members of the senior leadership team  Year to date revenue was  14 76 billion  Adjusted EBIT was  1 7 billion  Margin was 11 6   and bookings were  13 3 billion for a book to bill of 0 9 times Turning now to our segment results  Our Global Business Services segment consists of the three upper layers of the enterprise technology stack  It also includes for now the state and local health and human services business and the horizontal BPS business which are under strategic review GBS revenue was  2 36 billion in the quarter  up 3  sequentially and up close to 10  year over year  Excluding Luxoft  GBS revenue was down 0 5  year over year  primarily due to the completion of a few application transformation projects and the insourcing of the large BPS contract earlier this year In the third quarter  GBS segment profit was  353 million and profit margin was 15   Sequentially  our margins were down 70 basis points  reflecting the investment we re making in digital talent as well as a slower pace of cost takeout  GBS book to bill in the quarter was 1 07 times  with every offering posting a book to bill in excess of one time  In particular  we saw strength in our data  analytics  and engineering services business  Year to date GBS revenue was  6 8 billion  segment profit was  1 1 billion  margin was 15 8   and bookings were  6 8 billion for a book to bill of 1x Now let me turn to our GIS segment  The GIS business consists of the ITO  cloud  and security layers of the enterprise technology stack  GIS also includes for now workplace and mobility business  which is under strategic review  GIS revenue was  2 66 billion in the quarter  up 3 1  sequentially  Year over year revenue was down 10 6   primarily due to the roll off and insourcing of work in select accounts GIS segment profit in the third quarter was  232 million and profit margins was 8 7   Sequentially  our profit margin was down 80 basis points  reflecting the slowdown in our delivery cost take out actions and the investment we re making in turning around challenged accounts  GIS book to bill in the quarter was 1 06 times  reflecting the conversion of pipeline opportunities that were previously delayed as well as the award of add on and project work from challenged accounts  Year to date GIS revenue was  8 billion  segment profit was  815 million  margin was 10 2   and bookings were  6 5 billion for a book to bill of 0 8 times Now let me briefly comment on the performance of the layers within the enterprise technology stack  ITO revenue was up 2 4  sequentially but down 16 1  year over year  The year over year decline is primarily due to roll off of previously terminated work on select accounts and price concessions made earlier in the year to help customers with their digital transformation efforts  Book to bill was 0 9 times  Cloud and security revenue was up 1 9  sequentially and 9 9  year over year  Book to bill was 1 5 times  which is the best book to bill we ve had since Q3 of last year Moving up the stack  application and industry IP was up 3  sequentially and up 0 4  year over year  Book to bill for this layer of the stack was 1 1 times  This is the first time in four quarters that our application business  excluding our enterprise cloud applications  grew sequentially  Data analytics  engineering services business  revenue there was up 3 5  sequentially and up year over year by two folds  Excluding Luxoft  data analytics and engineering services grew 0 9  on a year over year basis  Book to bill was 1 5 times with solid performance across the board  Lastly  advisory revenue was up nearly 5  sequentially but down 8 5  year over year against a strong prior year performance  Book to bill was 1 1x Turning now to the three businesses under strategic review  Those businesses are collectively up 3 9  sequentially but down 7 2  year over year  The year over year decline was driven primarily by the shift from traditional to digital in the workplace and mobility business  We re moving at pace  We re tracking the timeline for the strategic reviews for all three businesses  We plan to be in the market in the coming weeks and are still confident that we will be able to realize  5 billion of net proceeds from this effort as previously stated Turning to our financial highlights  Adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter was  397 million  124  of adjusted net income  reflecting improved working capital management and the expanded use of our receivables facility by  110 million  Year to date  adjusted free cash flow is  1 21 billion  or 106  of adjusted net income  For the full year  our target free cash flow as a percentage of adjusted net income remains unchanged at 80  or more Free cash flow in the fourth quarter will reflect two large cash outflows  one to cover our annual 401 k  match  and the second  for a contract settlement payment that we expect to recover in fiscal  21 from insurance coverage  Free cash flow also reflects more conservative working capital assumptions for the fourth quarter Capex in the quarter was  310 million  or 6 2  of revenue  and on a year to date basis  capex was  1 01 billion  or 6 8  of revenue  During the quarter  we returned  140 million of capital to shareholders in the form of  54 million in dividends and  86 million in share repurchases  Year to date  we ve paid  161 million in dividends and repurchased  736 million  Phonetic  in shares for a total  897 million Cash at the end of the quarter was  2 6 billion  Our total debt was  8 9 billion  including capitalized leases  Net debt to total capital ratio was 35 2   Following our second quarter earnings call  all three agencies    rating agencies issued updated credit reports on DXC  Fitch and S P reaffirmed our ratings  but revised their outlook to negative  Moody s indicated that DXC s rating and outlook were unaffected  but as a pursuit of strategic alternatives was credit negative Now we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation  including reinvestment in the business  making strategic tuck in acquisitions  and returning capital to shareholders  while protecting our investment grade credit profile In closing  we continue to target revenue in the range of  19 5 billion to  19 8 billion  Sequentially  we expect revenue to be slightly down  primarily due to softness in the UK as we no longer expect the typical seasonal uptick in revenue from certain key accounts  We expect profit margins to be lower sequentially  reflecting the full quarter impact of the investment we re making These investments include salary increases  particularly in our delivery centers  new talent acquisition  including the addition of senior leaders  ongoing investment to turn around challenged accounts  additional resources deployed to assess the ITO estate of our top 200 accounts  and finally  additional investments not previously contemplated to shore up our support functions  particularly in HR  finance  risk management  and IT  For the full year  we re targeting non GAAP EPS to remain in the range of  5 25 to  5 75 per share  although we are trending toward the lower end of that range I ll turn now the call back to Mike for his closing remarks Mike Salvino    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Paul  Our third quarter results are a decent first step on our transformation journey  We ve done a good job of executing against our new focused strategy  As I said in our last earnings call  we had significant scope and scale of services  a reduced cost structure  and customers need our services to support their IT transformation needs  Although our transformation will not be a quick fix  I am confident that our focused strategy will position DXC in the future because we have proven this quarter we can win in the market and we are building a very strong team to execute In Q4  our priorities are as follows  with customers  our plan is to turn around the majority of the challenged accounts by the end of this quarter  and we also expect to complete the Virtual Clarity IT estate plans with the first 30 accounts and be in the market engaging with our customers  On the people front  we plan to continue to address the feedback of our global employee survey  implement our employee value proposition  and continue attracting right  Phonetic  talent to DXC In the area of operational execution  we will complete the rollout of our operating model in support of our regional structure  We also plan to streamline our offering portfolio to better align with the enterprise technology stack  and we will be conducting detailed regional business reviews focused at the account level to develop our plan and investments for fiscal 2021  Finally  we expect to make progress on unlocking value as we move at pace along our stated timeline for the three businesses Thank you again for joining the call  and we will now open the line up for questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question will come from Jason Kupferberg  Bank of America Jason Kupferberg    BofA Securities  Inc     AnalystHey  Thanks  Good afternoon  guys  Really nice progress out of the gate here  so congrats on that  I just wanted to ask  I m just going to combine a couple of quick ones here into one question  if you will  But first off  do you think the book to bill of back to 1 0 plus is sustainable and are you still comfortable with the fiscal  22 targets you had given us last quarter  And then just last  any thoughts on when we potentially see the first of the strategic review announcements Mike Salvino    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo  Jason  look  thanks for your comments  First of all  on the strategic alternatives  look  we re moving at pace  We said that the alternatives would be looked upon and we d execute them across the next 12 months  and that s what we re going to continue to do As it relates to  22 and the sustainability of the book to bill  look  I ve been very encouraged about the progress we ve made over the last three months  The receptivity of our transformation programs by customers  people  and the market have been very good  And when I think about 2021  right  that will be a transitional year for us  and we re going to continue to invest in our customers  people  and operational execution  And what I plan to do is discuss that 2021 plan on our next earnings call  And then I also plan to provide any additional updates on our expectations for 2022 at that time  So I won t be and Paul won t be commenting any further on that other than the outlook that we gave on 2020 Jason Kupferberg    BofA Securities  Inc     AnalystJust on the book to bill Mike Salvino    President and Chief Executive OfficerLook  on book to bill we made a good start  right  I mean what I expect is that we ll continue to make good progress in Q4  but we re going to be in and around I think that 1 0  maybe a little bit slightly lower  But I mean  the bottom line is we have a motion in the market that is winning Jason Kupferberg    BofA Securities  Inc     AnalystPerfect  thank you OperatorNext up is Darrin Peller  Wolfe Research Darrin Peller    Wolfe Research LLC    AnalystHey  Nice job  guys  and good bookings  Let me just start off  I mean I appreciate the color on the 40 clients that  Mike  you just talked about  It seems like a meaningful portion of the headwinds in the ITO piece  I assume that s the case  Maybe to touch on how clients are reacting to your refocused emphasis on ITO now and I guess I d like to hear how your clients are reacting to that  but also how the internal organizational culture feels about the one DXC  reemphasized the focus on kind of one company investing in all parts of it  Do you feel that there has been reenergized of the employee base  Thanks  guys Mike Salvino    President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Look  thanks for that  First of all  on the comment  the 40 clients are not just within that  what I call  the green layer or the ITO layer  It s also in the orange in the apps layer  So it s those two layers  And when I talk about an in depth review  I mean  I took a very stringent line on what went into those clients  And it wasn t  like I said  just the service levels  because that s the easiest thing  right  You hear in the marketplace the watermelon effect  green on the inside and then red on the    green on the outside  red on the inside  What that means is  you got to listen to the voice of the customer So when I said I made 92    I m up to 92 calls now  I m talking to these customers to make sure that our performance is where it needs to be  And if it wasn t where it needed to be  I put them in the program  I mean it was as simple as that  all right  And moving out of the program  the only way you get out of the program is if I here get a note or have a call that says the client is happy and we ve seen that performance over a month  So when I said seven  Phonetic  has gotten out  you would have expected sort of that framework as it relates to the progression The second part of your call was the one DXC  Look  our people are definitely engaged  all right  And not only did they like the town halls and the openness and transparency that we re talking about in terms of the transformation  but they really responded well to the global employee survey  not only from taking it  but they wanted to see the results  And what I would say is that whole energy bleeds into the market  because our people sit side by side with our customers  and when our people are happy  right  our customers hear that and then that tends to get out in the market So the reason I highlighted what I call DXC alumni rejoining is that s a new movement  all right  meaning people want to come back and join the place  And then it goes without saying  right  I m honored  along with I m very impressed with the talent that we ve been able to attract  So I would tell you that the receptivity has been very good Darrin Peller    Wolfe Research LLC    AnalystThanks  guys OperatorNext up  we ll hear from Lisa Ellis  MoffettNathansonLisa Ellis    MoffettNathanson LLC    AnalystHi  Good afternoon  guys  And off to a good start here  I guess one for Mike maybe and one for Paul  Mike  can you just elaborate a little bit on any changes you re making to the sales and go to market model to support the sort of updated strategy for DXC  And then  Paul  just one for you  I mean I think restructuring and the separation costs are running about a third or so of adjusted free cash flow and then that s kind of an important driver of the longer term outlook  Do you see that as you look into 2021 2022 coming down or are they going to be kind of a big piece of your free cash flow for the foreseeable future  Thank you Mike Salvino    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo  Lisa  I ll go first  In terms of changes on the sales model  what I would say is  you ll hear this word a lot is focus  So when I into the detail about the Virtual Clarity IT estate plan  I ll tell you  I was getting a little tired of people saying that our ITO business was just going to run to the cloud  So the reason I started to do analysis around what that business entails and the critical nature of that  most of the stuff that s going to the cloud so far has been the easier stuff  right  It s gone to the public cloud  The estate that we have now being of more critical nature that will take a little bit of time  And when it goes  it will usually go to a private cloud  So the reason I went into such detail on the estates  Lisa  is we are literally handing  all right  that roadmap to our sales force  And myself and the leadership team is getting involved in those conversations with those accounts  because when I did check in with the customers  there we asking us to be more curious  So as part of sort of the new mindset here  we re showing up  And we re going to not only show up with a point of view  but we re going to show up with a detailed plan of what can happen on their estate  So that s the main change I ve made so far is I want to see these detailed plans  all right  for the existing accounts  And when we have a new account  right  that we re competing with  I also want to see that detailed plan because we can do a high level analysis before we walk into the conversation with a new client  So that s the main thing I would highlight for you Paul Saleh    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And Lisa  on the restructuring  it s been just really this quarter  For example  we had some restructuring more related to some of the complex countries  As I look to the near term and particularly through fiscal  21  as Mike mentioned  this is going to be a transitional year for us  Importantly  there the restructuring is going to be a little bit also more targeted  the stranded costs coming out of those three businesses that we re going to be reviewing all the options from a strategic perspective  And then as we had indicated previously  by fiscal  22  we ve got to expect restructuring to moderate  and we will start to think a little bit more about providing a little bit more granularity in terms of our expectations on restructuring in the coming quarters Lisa Ellis    MoffettNathanson LLC    AnalystExcellent  Thank you  Thanks  guys OperatorRod Bourgeois from DeepDive Equity Research has the next question Rod Bourgeois    DeepDive Equity Research  LLC    AnalystOkay  guys  Nice initial step in the December quarter it looks like  So it seems that you ve made some positive progress on some of the turnaround in the December quarter  and you re still  though  juggling multiple turnaround initiatives and you re working to sell these three assets  And it seems that those multiple efforts that are still in process could create some near term disruption particularly to revenues  So what I d like to ask  what is your experience so far with the business disruption that might be occurring  And I m assuming fiscal  21 is starting really before your turnaround work can really drive full payoff  while you still have potential disruption to deal with  So essentially as we approach the fiscal  21 period  I m trying to weigh potential for some turnaround progress against risks of revenue disruption and would like to hear what your experience is so far and how you re thinking about that Mike Salvino    President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Rod  I ll take that  First of all  thanks for the question  When I think about the business  right  obviously it s one business  but if you look at the strategic alternatives  state and local health and human services business as usual  In fact  the one state we re adding I m very happy about that The horizontal BPS and workplace and mobility businesses have held up in line  right  with what we thought  We thought we d win some stuff and we thought that some stuff would go away  So revenue disruption to the strategic alternatives  we re not seeing  So we ll put that to one side The rest of the business in terms of revenue disruption  look  you know this business is a balancing act of decisions that have been made in the past in terms of term contracts that will now float into 2021 and also bringing on new business  That s why such the focus on the delivery because that new business has got to come online  right  so that we can    we can balance out So the way I look at 2021 will be still that transitional year  right  We will be dealing with some of the stuff in the past  all right  But I m hoping with these IT estate plans that we re doing  I m hoping with unlocking some of the work from the challenged accounts right that we will have a motion in 2021 that will obviously be positive  But I look at 2021 as a transitional year  Rod  where we are still going to deal with some of the stuff  but also invest in our customers  people  and operational execution So  look  I mean  the bottom line is  I m seeing progress across the board in our client meetings  And the thing I guess I would highlight  right  is the fact that when our clients talk to us  it is not just about the work that we have  They re very curious about the rest of the stack  And this is where I m looking forward to getting to the top of the stack in the blue  I mentioned about bringing automotive and banking together with Luxoft  We have got to make sure that we re combining the capabilities that we have to compete in the market  and Luxoft has a really  really nice agile workforce that we should be able to deliver in the top of the stack very nicely  So anyhow  Rod  that s the way I think about it Rod Bourgeois    DeepDive Equity Research  LLC    AnalystAll right  thanks  That s helpful color OperatorOur next question today comes from Bryan Bergin  Cowen Jared Levine    Cowen and Company LLC    AnalystHey  This is actually Jared Levine on for Bryan  So  Mike  where do you stand with the makeup of your direct hires  Obviously a lot of announcements  a short period since September  Still have a lot to do at the senior rank to really put your plan into action Mike Salvino    President and Chief Executive OfficerLook  right now  my focus is to continue to implement what I call our regional operating model  And the reason I highlighted it in my comments that the new hires are integrating well with the folks that are here is because we did have a talented team  This isn t about just all bringing new hires into the place  Where I ve seen places that I really want to take a step up  that s typically when I ve gone for a new hire  Carla is a perfect example of that  all right  in the sense that from a risk standpoint  I want a lower level of detail on that  so we re able to attract a really talented person IT is another one  right  I mean  as you can imagine with EDS to HPE along with CFC  the back end of our systems  right  we need to continue to do more with  all right  And when I think about controls and so forth  that s why we went after and got Chris  I mean  Chris  knows how to deal with complex environment being at GE  So very pleased with the hires  but I also don t want to disparage the existing team  because the existing team is incredibly talented The thing that I want to highlight for people is they come together well  We don t have a series of haves and have nots here  And like I said  the results in Q3 proved together that we could come together as a team very quickly and start making impact  So that would be my comment there Jared Levine    Cowen and Company LLC    AnalystGreat  Thanks for the color OperatorNext from Citi  we ll hear from Ashwin Shirvaikar Ashwin Shirvaikar    Citigroup Global Markets  Inc     AnalystThanks  Hi  Mike  Hi  Paul  It s a good first step here  Appreciate it  My question is on the stronger bookings performance  How much of that was because of delayed bookings from prior quarters  I know that s been a    the specter of delayed bookings has occurred in both the June and September quarters  And are there delayed contracts still outstanding  And in that context  if you can talk also about how the pipeline is building and whether the delayed contracts coming in is more a function of was it year end  was it the improved process you put in  What s causing these contracts to now come in Mike Salvino    President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  So let me    I ll start with the bottom and then you can go back to the individual details  So in terms of what happened  it wasn t yearend type things  all right  And it also wasn t something where we did something miraculous  right  Because when I talked to you guys on November 11th in my first call  I mean the things I m putting in place are just getting into place  But I will tell you  the focus on making sure that we ve dealt with these clients  we were front and center  right  We came up and showed up with a new attitude along with we cared  along with what I call the groundswell from our people saying  hey  there s something new going on here  that unlocks stuff  all right  And I ll let Paul get to the detailed numbers on what was put on hold and so forth The only other comment I would make is with the challenged accounts  There is still more work to be had  all right  And it s not work to be had that was just put on hold  It s also what s sitting with those clients and finally being curious with them  And I made my comments around the operational execution is the fact that what we re out in the marketplace talking about is the enterprise technology stack  which means we re not just in the ITO business  But we re also not in this thing that we used to call digital  right  We have a very focused approach about what we re selling  ITO  cloud  apps  and then analytics and insight  So that s the motion that we re putting out in the market  and I would tell you  decent first step Paul Saleh    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Ashwin  to answer your first question   215 million from deals that had slipped in the first half of the year  There is still another  500 million that are up for grabs  either in the fourth quarter or into the fiscal  21  And then out of the    this is all TCV  right  And then the other thing Mike mentioned already   500 million of TCV from contracts that had been put on hold  two separate things Ashwin Shirvaikar    Citigroup Global Markets  Inc     AnalystUnderstood  And  Mike  if I can ask you just philosophically  To the extent you see some upside in earnings and cash flow relative to initial expectations  are you more likely to be on the side of reinvesting that upside or passing it on to investors Mike Salvino    President and Chief Executive OfficerI m going to    the bottom line is  Paul already said it  We re going to keep the capital balanced  right  in terms of our capital allocation  We re paying attention to the rating agencies  and we obviously    I totally understand my job is shareholder value  So we re going to keep that balance Ashwin Shirvaikar    Citigroup Global Markets  Inc     AnalystAll right  Thank you OperatorOur next question will come from Bryan Keane  Deutsche Bank Bryan Keane    Deutsche Bank AG    AnalystHi  guys  Mike  just wanted to clarify  On fiscal year  22  the revenue range of  50 million plus and EBIT margin non GAAP I think was 12  plus and  7 in earnings plus  does that all still hold  or should we now put that to the side and kind of wait until fiscal year  21 and see how things progress Mike Salvino    President and Chief Executive OfficerBryan  again  thanks for the question  And like I said  I m not going to comment outside of 2020  My plan right now is to go and do the detailed account reviews for 2021  I plan to discuss 2021 on our next call  And on our next call  I ll provide any updates around those expectations for 2022 Bryan Keane    Deutsche Bank AG    AnalystOkay  got it  That s all I had  Thanks OperatorAnd that is all the time we have for questions today  I d like to hand things back to Shailesh Murali for any additional or closing remarks Shailesh Murali    M A and Investor RelationsThank you everyone for joining us this afternoon  We appreciate it  Thank you Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  51

155069,376585,DXC,4 Stocks With Low Price to Cash Flow Ratio To Buy Now,opinion,Warren Buffett once said   It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price   The strategy is very simple   find stocks that are trading below their inherent worth Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices  In value investing  investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound  So  chances are high that these stocks will allow investors to book profits when the market trends upward There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential  Each ratio helps an investor to understand a particular aspect of the company s business  One such ratio  Price to Cash Flow  or P CF   can work wonders in stock picking  if used prudently  This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better Why Price to Cash Flow You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price Earnings  or P E   Well  one of the important factors that makes P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  Then again  cash flow is quite reliable  Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company s liquid assets  This gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder friendly moves  Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which  in turn  lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and take into account price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks P CF less than or equal to X Industry Median Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable P E using  F1  less than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers P B less than or equal to X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain P S less than or equal to X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company s sales   the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is PEG less than 1  The ratio is used to determine a stock s value by taking the company s earnings growth into account  PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  Here are four of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening G III Apparel Group  Ltd    NASDAQ GIII    which designs  sources and markets women s and men s apparel  sports a Zacks Rank  1  It has an expected EPS growth rate of 15  for 3 5 years and has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters by a wide margin  You can see  SYNNEX Corporation   NYSE SNX    which provides business process services  has an expected EPS growth rate of 12  for 3 5 years  This Zacks Rank  2 company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 6  for the trailing four quarters Newmark Group  Inc    NASDAQ NMRK   provides commercial real estate services  This Zacks Rank  2 company has an expected EPS growth rate of 8 4  for 3 5 years DXC Technology Company   NYSE DXC   provides information technology services and solutions  It has a Zacks Rank  2 and expected EPS growth rate of 6 6  for 3 5 years  The company delivered positive earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters  with the average being 6 7  Get the rest of the stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test  It can all be

155074,376590,DXC,Special Report  Inside the West s failed fight against China s  Cloud Hopper  hackers,news,"By Jack Stubbs  Joseph Menn and Christopher Bing LONDON  Reuters    Hacked by suspected Chinese cyber spies five times from 2014 to 2017  security staff at Swedish telecoms equipment giant Ericsson  BS ERICAs  had taken to naming their response efforts after different types of wine  Pinot Noir began in September 2016  After successfully repelling a wave of attacks a year earlier  Ericsson discovered the intruders were back  And this time  the company s cybersecurity team could see exactly how they got in  through a connection to information technology services supplier Hewlett Packard Enterprise  Teams of hackers connected to the Chinese Ministry of State Security had penetrated HPE s cloud computing service and used it as a launch pad to attack customers  plundering reams of corporate and government secrets for years in what U S  prosecutors say was an effort to boost Chinese economic interests  The hacking campaign  known as  Cloud Hopper   was the subject of a U S  indictment in December that accused two Chinese nationals of identity theft and fraud  Prosecutors described an elaborate operation that victimized multiple Western companies but stopped short of naming them  A Reuters report at the time identified two  Hewlett Packard Enterprise and  IBM   NYSE IBM   Yet the campaign ensnared at least six more major technology firms  touching five of the world s 10 biggest tech service providers  Also compromised by Cloud Hopper  Reuters has found  Fujitsu  Tata Consultancy Services  NTT Data  Dimension Data  Computer Sciences Corporation  NYSE DXC  and DXC Technology  HPE spun off its services arm in a merger with Computer Sciences Corporation in 2017 to create DXC  Waves of hacking victims emanate from those six plus HPE and IBM  their clients  Ericsson  which competes with Chinese firms in the strategically critical mobile telecoms business  is one  Others include travel reservation system Sabre  the American leader in managing plane bookings  and the largest shipbuilder for the U S  Navy  Huntington Ingalls Industries  which builds America s nuclear submarines at a Virginia shipyard   This was the theft of industrial or commercial secrets for the purpose of advancing an economy   said former Australian National Cyber Security Adviser Alastair MacGibbon   The lifeblood of a company   Reuters was unable to determine the full extent of the damage done by the campaign  and many victims are unsure of exactly what information was stolen  Yet the Cloud Hopper attacks carry worrying lessons for government officials and technology companies struggling to manage security threats  Chinese hackers  including a group known as APT10  were able to continue the attacks in the face of a counter offensive by top security specialists and despite a 2015 U S  China pact to refrain from economic espionage  The corporate and government response to the attacks was undermined as service providers withheld information from hacked clients  out of concern over legal liability and bad publicity  records and interviews show  That failure  intelligence officials say  calls into question Western institutions  ability to share information in the way needed to defend against elaborate cyber invasions  Even now  many victims may not be aware they were hit  The campaign also highlights the security vulnerabilities inherent in cloud computing  an increasingly popular practice in which companies contract with outside vendors for remote computer services and data storage   For those that thought the cloud was a panacea  I would say you haven t been paying attention   said Mike Rogers  former director of the U S  National Security Agency   Reuters interviewed 30 people involved in the Cloud Hopper investigations  including Western government officials  current and former company executives and private security researchers  Reporters also reviewed hundreds of pages of internal company documents  court filings and corporate intelligence briefings  HPE  worked diligently for our customers to mitigate this attack and protect their information   said spokesman Adam Bauer   We remain vigilant in our efforts to protect against the evolving threats of cyber crimes committed by state actors   A spokesman for DXC  the services arm spun off by HPE in 2017  said the company put  robust security measures in place  to protect itself and customers   Since the inception of DXC Technology  neither the company nor any DXC customer whose environment is under our control have experienced a material impact caused by APT10 or any other threat actor   the spokesman said  NTT Data  Dimension Data  Tata Consultancy Services  Fujitsu and IBM declined to comment  IBM has previously said it has no evidence sensitive corporate data was compromised by the attacks  The Chinese government has denied all accusations of involvement in hacking  The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Beijing opposed cyber enabled industrial espionage   The Chinese government has never in any form participated in or supported any person to carry out the theft of commercial secrets   it said in a statement to Reuters  BREAK INS AND EVICTIONS For security staff at Hewlett Packard Enterprise  the Ericsson situation was just one dark cloud in a gathering storm  according to internal documents and 10 people with knowledge of the matter  For years  the company s predecessor  technology giant Hewlett Packard  didn t even know it had been hacked  It first found malicious code stored on a company server in 2012  The company called in outside experts  who found infections dating to at least January 2010  Hewlett Packard security staff fought back  tracking the intruders  shoring up defenses and executing a carefully planned expulsion to simultaneously knock out all of the hackers  known footholds  But the attackers returned  beginning a cycle that continued for at least five years  The intruders stayed a step ahead  They would grab reams of data before planned eviction efforts by HP engineers  Repeatedly  they took whole directories of credentials  a brazen act netting them the ability to impersonate hundreds of employees  The hackers knew exactly where to retrieve the most sensitive data and littered their code with expletives and taunts  One hacking tool contained the message  FUCK ANY AV    referencing their victims  reliance on anti virus software  The name of a malicious domain used in the wider campaign appeared to mock U S  intelligence   nsa mefound com  Then things got worse  documents show  After a 2015 tip off from the U S  Federal Bureau of Investigation about infected computers communicating with an external server  HPE combined three probes it had underway into one effort called Tripleplay  Up to 122 HPE managed systems and 102 systems designated to be spun out into the new DXC operation had been compromised  a late 2016 presentation to executives showed  An internal chart from mid 2017 helped top brass keep track of investigations codenamed for customers  Rubus dealt with Finnish conglomerate Valmet  Silver Scale was Brazilian mining giant Vale  Greenxmass was Swedish manufacturer SKF  and Oculus covered Ericsson  Projects Kronos and Echo related to former Swiss biotech firm Syngenta  which was taken over by state owned Chinese chemicals conglomerate ChemChina in 2017   during the same period as the HPE investigation into Chinese attacks on its network  Ericsson said it does not comment on specific cybersecurity incidents   Our priority is always to ensure that our customers are protected   a spokesman said   While there have been attacks on our enterprise network  we have found no evidence in any of our extensive investigations that Ericsson s infrastructure has ever been used as part of a successful attack on one of our customers   A spokesman for SKF said   We are aware of the breach that took place in conjunction with the  Cloud Hopper  attack against HPE   Our investigations into the breach have not found that any commercially sensitive information was accessed   Syngenta and Valmet declined to comment  A spokesman for Vale declined to comment on specific questions about the attacks but said the company adopts  the best practices in the industry  to improve network security   DRUNKEN BURGLARS  The companies were battling a skilled adversary  said Rob Joyce  a senior adviser to the U S  National Security Agency  The hacking was  high leverage and hard to defend against   he said  According to Western officials  the attackers were multiple Chinese government backed hacking groups  The most feared was known as APT10 and directed by the Ministry of State Security  U S  prosecutors say  National security experts say the Chinese intelligence service is comparable to the U S  Central Intelligence Agency  capable of pursuing both electronic and human spying operations  Two of APT10 s alleged members  Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong  were indicted in December by the United States on charges of conspiracy to commit computer intrusions  wire fraud and aggravated identity theft  In the unlikely event they are ever extradited and convicted  the two men would face up to 27 years in an American jail  Reuters was unable to reach Zhu  Zhang or lawyers representing the men for comment  China s Foreign Ministry said the charges were  warrantless accusations  and it urged the United States to  withdraw the so called lawsuits against Chinese personnel  so as to avoid causing serious harm to bilateral relations   The U S  Justice Department called the Chinese denials  ritualistic and bogus    The Chinese Government uses its own intelligence services to conduct this activity and refuses to cooperate with any investigation into thefts of intellectual property emanating from its companies or its citizens   DOJ Assistant Attorney General John Demers told Reuters  APT10 often attacked a service provider s system by  spear phishing    sending company employees emails designed to trick them into revealing their passwords or installing malware  Once through the door  the hackers moved through the company s systems searching for customer data and  most importantly  the  jump servers    computers on the network which acted as a bridge to client systems  After the attackers  hopped  from a service provider s network into a client system  their behavior varied  which suggests the attacks were conducted by multiple teams with different skill levels and tasks  say those aware of the operation  Some intruders resembled  drunken burglars   said one source  getting lost in the labyrinth of corporate systems and appearing to grab files at random  HOTELS AND SUBMARINES It s impossible to say how many companies were breached through the service provider that originated as part of Hewlett Packard  then became Hewlett Packard Enterprise and is now known as DXC  The HPE operation had hundreds of customers  Armed with stolen corporate credentials  the attackers could do almost anything the service providers could  Many of the compromised machines served multiple HPE customers  documents show  One nightmare situation involved client Sabre Corp  which provides reservation systems for tens of thousands of hotels around the world  It also has a comprehensive system for booking air travel  working with hundreds of airlines and 1 500 airports  A thorough penetration at Sabre could have exposed a goldmine of information  investigators said  if China was able to track where corporate executives or U S  government officials were traveling  That would open the door to in person approaches  physical surveillance or attempts at installing digital tracking tools on their devices  In 2015  investigators found that at least four HP machines dedicated to Sabre were tunneling large amounts of data to an external server  The Sabre breach was long running and intractable  said two former HPE employees  HP management only grudgingly allowed its own defenders the investigation access they needed and cautioned against telling Sabre everything  the former employees said   Limiting knowledge to the customer was key   one said   It was incredibly frustrating  We had all these skills and capabilities to bring to bear  and we were just not allowed to do that    The security of HPE customer data is always our top priority   an HPE spokesman said  Sabre said it had disclosed a cybersecurity incident involving servers managed by an unnamed third party in 2015  Media reports at the time said the hackers were linked to the Chinese government but did not name HP  A Sabre spokeswoman said an investigation of the breach  concluded with the important finding that there was no loss of traveler data  including no unauthorized access to or acquisition of sensitive protected information  such as payment card data or personally identifiable information   The spokeswoman declined to comment on whether any non traveler data was compromised  UNINVITED GUESTS The threat also reached into the U S  defense industry  In early 2017  HPE analysts saw evidence that Huntington Ingalls Industries  a significant client and the largest U S  military shipbuilder  had been penetrated by the Chinese hackers  two sources said  Computer systems owned by a subsidiary of Huntington Ingalls were connecting to a foreign server controlled by APT10  During a private briefing with HPE staff  Huntington Ingalls executives voiced concern the hackers could have accessed data from its biggest operation  the Newport News  Va   shipyard where it builds nuclear powered submarines  said a person familiar with the discussions  It s not clear whether any data was stolen  Huntington Ingalls is  confident that there was no breach of any HII data  via DXC or HPE  a spokeswoman said  Another target was Ericsson  which has been racing against China s Huawei Technologies to build infrastructure for 5G networks expected to underpin future hyper connected societies  The hacking at Ericsson was persistent and pervasive  said people with knowledge of the matter  Logs were modified and some files were deleted  The uninvited guests rummaged through internal systems  searching for documents containing certain strings of characters  Some of the malware found on Ericsson servers was signed with digital certificates stolen from big technology companies  making it look like the code was legitimate so it would go unnoticed  Like many Cloud Hopper victims  Ericsson could not always tell what data was being targeted  Sometimes  the attackers appeared to seek out project management information  such as schedules and timeframes  Another time they went after product manuals  some of which were already publicly available   The reality is that most organizations are facing cybersecurity challenges on a daily basis  including Ericsson   Chief Security Officer P r Gunnarsson said in a statement to Reuters  declining to discuss specific incidents   In our industry  and across industries  we would all benefit from a higher degree of transparency on these issues   WHITE WOLF In December 2018  after struggling to contain the threat for years  the U S  government named the hackers from APT10   Advanced Persistent Threat 10   as agents of China s Ministry of State Security  The public attribution garnered widespread international support  Germany  New Zealand  Canada  Britain  Australia and other allies all issued statements backing the U S  allegations against China  Even so  much of Cloud Hopper s activity has been deliberately kept from public view  often at the urging of corporate victims  In an effort to keep information under wraps  security staff at the affected managed service providers were often barred from speaking even to other employees not specifically added to the inquiries  In 2016  HPE s office of general counsel for global functions issued a memo about an investigation codenamed White Wolf   Preserving confidentiality of this project and associated activity is critical   the memo warned  stating without elaboration that the effort  is a sensitive matter   Outside the project  it said   do not share any information about White Wolf  its effect on HPE  or the activities HPE is taking   The secrecy was not unique to HPE  Even when the government alerted technology service providers  the companies would not always pass on warnings to clients  Jeanette Manfra  a senior cybersecurity official with the U S  Department of Homeland Security  told Reuters  
 We asked them to notify their customers   Manfra said   We can t force their hand  ",2019-06-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/special-report-inside-the-wests-failed-fight-against-chinas-cloud-hopper-hackers-1907884,1907884

155113,376629,DXC,HP Enterprise strikes  8 8 billion deal with Micro Focus for software assets,news,"By Paul Sandle and Liana B  Baker LONDON NEW YORK  Reuters    Hewlett Packard Enterprise agreed to sell its software business to Micro Focus in a  8 8 billion deal that shrinks the Silicon Valley pioneer again while catapulting the little known British firm into the top tier of European tech companies  Autonomy  the British firm bought by HP in an ill fated  11 billion push into software just five years ago  will return to British control after the deal for far below its original price  HPE Chief Executive Meg Whitman is focusing the group on a few areas such as networking  storage and technology services since it separated last year from computer and printer maker HP Inc    Micro Focus  approach to managing both growing and mature software assets will ensure higher levels of investment in growth areas  like big data analytics and security  while maintaining a stable platform for     software products that customers rely on   she said  Micro Focus approached HPE in February  four months before Britain voted to leave the European Union in a shock referendum that initially spooked global financial markets  the British firm s executive chairman  Kevin Loosemore  said  It is the second big deal involving a British company since the June 23 Brexit vote that many feared would put the brakes on mergers  It is also a relatively rare example of a British company buying U S  technology assets  Loosemore spotted another opportunity to profit from managing old software  Companies including banks and airlines pay Micro Focus to extend the life of the computers they use to run their businesses  for example to manage data  This allows the companies to avoid spending on newer computer systems     It  is entirely consistent with our established acquisition strategy and our focus on efficient management of mature infrastructure products   he told reporters on a conference call from New York  BORING BUT PROFITABLE Shares in Micro Focus  based in Newbury  southern England  jumped by a fifth to an all time high of 2 400 pence  topping the FTSE 100 index of leading shares that it joined days ago  after chip designer ARM Holdings  LON ARM  was bought by Japan s Softbank Corp  Micro Focus  with a market capitalization of 4 45 billion pounds   6 billion  before the deal  has been snapping up software companies  This would be its largest deal to date  Earlier this year  it acquired U S  firm Serena Software for  540 million  Loosemore said he would bring the core earnings margin for the mature assets in the deal   about 80 percent of the total   from 21 percent today to Micro Focus s existing 46 percent level within three years   The way we do it is really just lots of 101  boring management   he said   Too often people chase unattainable growth rates and in doing so they waste a lot of money   A serial acquirer of software platforms  Micro Focus has also shifted strategy to buying higher growth software such as SUSE  the world s No 2 maker of Linux software while wringing the most out of aging software   This strategy works well for current shareholders  who gain significant ownership in better run businesses   said UBS analyst Steve Milunovich  who tracks HP Enterprise  The deal  announced along with HPE s latest quarterly earnings  came on the same day that Dell and EMC Corp  NYSE EMC  completed their merger in a deal that unites two of HPE s biggest rivals   In the third quarter  HPE reported net revenue of  12 2 billion  down 6 percent from  13 1 billion a year earlier  The transaction is expected to be tax free to HP  The deal is the latest in a series of asset disposals by HPE  which agreed in May to spin off and merge its struggling technology services business to Computer Sciences Corp  N CSC   in a transaction valued around  8 5 billion  The sale will mean two thirds of HPE s remaining business will be hardware  which is fast becoming a commodity  UBS s Milunovich said  It could make the company a more agile competitor but also could make it harder to compete with far larger companies such as Cisco  O CSCO  and Dell  DI UL   Micro Focus will pay  2 5 billion in cash to HPE  JP Morgan is advising on the deal and providing financing for the payment  HPE shareholders will own 50 1 percent of the combined company that will operate under the name Micro Focus and be run by its executives  HPE  which is working with Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   GSGSC UL  on the deal  said it would pay  700 million in one time costs related to the separation of the assets   AUTONOMY BACK IN BRITAIN  In the deal  HPE is sending one of the British firms it acquired back to where it started  HPE acquired part of its software portfolio through HP s  11 billion purchase of Autonomy in 2011  a deal that was supposed to form the central part of the U S  group s move into software  HP later wrote off three quarters of the company s value    Some of those  Autonomy  products are very exciting  some of them are more mature   Loosemore said  Other HPE assets that will be merged include software for application delivery management  big data  enterprise security  information management   governance and IT Operations management businesses  By acquiring the HP Enterprise software assets  the deal thrusts Micro Focus into the top ranks of European software makers  It would rank around sixth in market capitalization terms among regional software names  Since sterling tumbled on the Brexit result  many British companies have become more attractive for international suitors   
Loosemore said  however  the Brexit vote didn t change the dynamic   If you map our share price in dollars rather than pounds it s pretty consistent   he said   So no real effect  ",2016-09-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/hp-enterprise-strikes-$8.8-billion-deal-with-micro-focus-for-software-assets-424812,424812

155116,376632,DXC,Ex U S  software chief  ex Australia bank exec charged in bribery scheme,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
 Reuters    A U S  grand jury on Wednesday indicted a California technology executive and a former manager at Commonwealth Bank of Australia over their alleged involvement in a bribery scheme to generate more money for shareholders of the executive s cloud computing company 
Eric Pulier  the founder and former chief executive of ServiceMesh Inc  was accused of paying  2 5 million of bribes to two technology executives at the bank  so they would arrange  10 4 million of contracts to inflate his company s revenue 
Prosecutors said this fraudulently caused Computer Sciences Corp  NYSE DXC  to award ServiceMesh shareholders a  98 million  earn out  bonus  on top of  282 million that Computer Sciences has said it paid in November 2013 to buy the Santa Monica based company 
Pulier  as ServiceMesh s largest shareholder  received about  30 million of the bonus  prosecutors said 
Jon Waldron  a former Commonwealth Bank of Australia information technology manager  was accused by U S  prosecutors of helping arrange the contracts in exchange for  1 9 million of the bribes  paid mainly through a New Zealand shell company 
Arrest warrants have been issued for both defendants 
Pulier  50  of Los Angeles  is expected to surrender  in the coming days  while Waldron  47  of Sydney  is in Australia  prosecutors said  The U S  Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil charges against Pulier 
A lawyer for Pulier did not immediately respond to requests for comment  Waldron s lawyer could not immediately be identified 
Wednesday s 15 count indictment charges both Pulier and Waldron with five fraud counts and one conspiracy count  Pulier faces nine additional counts related to alleged bribery  obstruction of justice  and filing a false tax return 
The other bank technology executive  Keith Hunter  was in December 2016 sentenced in Australia to 3 1 2 years in prison for his receipt of bribes from Pulier  Hunter received  630 000 of bribes  the SEC said 
Following the merger  Pulier became an executive vice president at Computer Sciences

155179,376695,DXC,DXC Technology  DXC  Soars To A 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of DXC Technology Company   NYSE DXC    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 16 1  over the past month  DXC hit a new 52 week high of  107 13 in the previous session  DXC Technology has gained 12 46  since the start of the year compared to the 9 16  move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 8 54  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on February 8  2018  DXC Technology reported EPS of  2 15 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 99 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 0 69  
For the current fiscal year  DXC Technology is expected to post earnings of  7 83 per share on  24 38 billion in revenues  This represents a 153 55  change in EPS on a 220 46  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  9 03 per share on  24 25 billion in revenues  This represents changes of 14 89  and  0 53   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
While DXC has moved to its 52 week high in the recent past  investors need to be asking  what is next for the company  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
DXC Technology has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 13 63x current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 13 43x versus its peer group s average of 17 05x  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 3  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective DXC Technology Company  Price and Consensus
    Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  DXC Technology  currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if DXC Technology meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though DXC shares could still be poised for more gains ahead ",2018-03-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dxc-technology-dxc-soars-to-a-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200297318,200297318
155180,376696,DXC,5 Top Stocks To Gain As The Tax Season Draws To A Close,opinion,There are many  calendar trends  in the financial markets which indicate its outperformance or underperformance in a given time frame  The common axioms are Sell in May and go away   the  January Effect  and the  January Barometer   to name a few These calendar trends do have a logical basis in contrast to some random time frame showing gains and losses  For instance  markets typically scale north in two weeks after the Tax Day  which is on Apr 17 this year  This is because money flows into the market as a significant number of people start funding their Individual Retirement Accounts  IRA  in order to receive tax deduction Tax Day  thus  brings a seasonal trend where you can make some gains  with a few sectors traditionally showing an improvement  Apr 17 is Tax Day This Year  Here s WhySince 1955  Tax Day has been observed on Apr 15  But  if the date falls on a Saturday or Sunday  the filing of federal income tax returns is pushed to the next business day  This means that tax day should have been on Monday  Apr 16 this year However  the Emancipation day holiday unique to Washington D C  fell on Apr 16  postponing the tax filing deadline this year  District of Columbia observes Emancipation day  which marks the freeing of slaves in Washington in 1892  This makes Apr 17 the closing date for filing taxes in the United States Tax Day TradeTax Day is always special for the stock market  Estimates are that 15  to 33  of all tax filers wait for this day to fund their IRAs  After all  IRAs are a basket of various asset classes  including stocks in which individuals invest money to prepare for retirement The average daily gain  by the way  for the S P 500 on the Tax Day has been around 0 3  over the past 10 years  But  don t dismiss 0 3  as meager because it is nearly 7 points on the S P that equates to an annualized gain of around 75  over the average 252 trading days in a year In fact  April has always been one of the best months for the S P  The broader index in the past 10 and five years has climbed about 90  and 80  of times this month  respectively The benchmark index  however  this time around is down so far in the month  So  this indicates that some sort of a bounce back may take place during the remaining of the month that will push the index back into positive territory End of Tax Season Throws Open Buying ProspectsThe stock market  historically  tends to gain momentum in the two weeks following the Tax Day  Conversely  stocks tend to remain flat or somewhat down in the first two weeks of April The S P has been nearly down on an average 0 2  in the first two weeks of the month  while it was up around 1 7  on an average during the weeks following the day  per data analytics firm Kensho  That s a positive swing of about 2  on average for the S P 500  Similarly  certain sectors like technology  financials and industrials have notched average gains of around 3   1 7  and 2 2   respectively Profit From Tax Season With These 5 StocksGiven that the aforesaid sectors are poised to make the most of the upcoming bullishness  investing in stocks from the same will be judicious  And why not  The Trump administration s initiative to cut tax rates has provided the much needed windfall to tech companies  while a recent move by the Fed to raise rates bodes well for financials  Firm business investment  in the meantime  helped factories expand at a record pace  Manufacturers are also on a hiring spree and are paying more than other jobs  reflecting sustained strength in the sector We have  thus  selected five such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and a  of A or B  Our Growth Style Score condenses all the essential metrics from a

For the current fiscal year  CACI International is expected to post earnings of  11 19 per share on  4 46 billion in revenues  This represents a 71 36  change in EPS on a 2 38  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  8 75 per share on  4 61 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of  21 86  and 3 42   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
CACI International may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for CACI  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
CACI International has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are C and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 14 2X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 16 2X versus its peer group s average of 16 3X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 42  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective CACI International  Inc  Price and Consensus
    Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  CACI International currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if CACI International fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though CACI shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does CACI International Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of CACI International have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks  including SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION   NYSE SAIC    DXC Technology Company    NYSE DXC    and Baidu   NASDAQ BIDU    all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 43  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for CACI  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2018-04-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/caci-international-caci-hits-fresh-highs-is-there-still-room-to-run-200306874,200306874
155182,376698,DXC,Resurgence Of 10 Year Bond Yield  Winners   Losers,opinion,The yield on the 10 year Treasury note  a benchmark for interest rates  hit 3  for the first time in about four years  The Federal Reserve  in fact  has already stepped up the pace of monetary tightening from two to three additional rate hikes this year Rising inflation expectations led to Treasuries getting sold off  After all  higher commodity prices diminish the value of a bond s fixed interest payments  The 10 year yield increased as treasuries came under pressure Investors have exited bond proxies  including utilities and consumer staples  Meanwhile  financials  technology and home improvement suppliers are expected to benefit from a resurgent benchmark bond yield Benchmark Bond Yield Reaches Key MilestoneThe 10 year government bond yield increased 0 9 basis points  bps  to 2 983  on Apr 24  after touching a four year intraday high of 3 001   according to Tradeweb data  The benchmark bond yield had exceeded the 3  mark briefly in 2013 and January 2014  which was toward the end of the bond market wipeout  better known as the  taper tantrum  In fact  head of U S  rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets  Ian Lyngen expects the bond yield to hover near 3 047  in the near term  which would see the yield go past the highs seen in January 2014  propelling it to its loftiest levels since 2011 The 10 year is used as a proxy for many other important financial matters  such as mortgage rates  Fed officials  for now  have rekindled the idea to raise federal funds rate four times this year and not three times as previously indicated  In March  the Fed has already raised rates a quarter point to a range of 1 5  to 1 75   On Apr 20  the Fed fund futures market witnessed a 40 2  chance of four rate hikes this year  much higher than 28 6  estimated in the previous month What s Acting in Favor of Bond Yields Rising inflationary pressures and speculations that the Fed will take aggressive steps in hiking rates have kept the yield at elevated levels for now Consumer prices are expected to scale north mostly due to a rally in oil and raw material prices  Oil prices rose to the highest level on Apr 24 since Nov 24  lifted by hearsay that U S  sanction on Iran will be put into place by May American companies  by the way  are paying a significant amount for purchasing raw materials  As per HIS Markit  the cost of raw materials and partly finished goods increased at the fastest pace in nearly five years  Trump s recent move to impose tariffs on steel and a series of Chinese goods were partly to blame Equities Wobble  Defensive Stocks Take a HitHigher bond yields affected the buying appetite for stocks as it increased the opportunity cost of investing in equities  And why not  While the benchmark yield has touched the coveted 3  mark  the average dividend yield for stocks trading on the Dow is 2 4  and the average dividend yield for the S P 500 components is just 2  Defensive sectors known as  bond proxies   especially  have fallen out of favor  The industries including utilities  consumer staples  telecom and real estate are known for providing higher dividend yields  but  with Treasury yields climbing such stocks have lost their charm  Moreover  bonds are providing encouraging yields without the higher risk that comes with equities In a sign of how money is being pulled out of such sectors  the Utilities SPDR ETF has seen outflows of  739 8 million in the past month and nearly 833 million has been redeemed from the Staples SPDR ETF so far this year Which Sectors Gain From the Rise Shares of banks and insurance companies were bolstered by higher interest rates in the form of an uptick in bond yields  Higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer term assets  such as loans  with shorter term liabilities Rising rates also act as a boon for insurance companies as they derive their investment income from investing premiums  which are received from policyholders in corporate and government bonds  Yields and coupons on these bonds rise in response to a hike in Fed fund rates and bank interest rates  This enables life insurers to invest their premiums at higher yields and earn more  expanding their profit margins Rate hikes  in the meantime  indicated that the economy is in fine fettle  After all  the jobless rate is at a 17 year low  wages are improving and consumer confidence continues to hover at record high levels  All these lead to higher levels of spending  which spells good times for consumer discretionary companies like automakers  casinos  homebuilders  apparel retailers and cruise lines Technology firms also stand to gain from a rate hike  Interest rates correlate with an economy that is getting stronger day by day  And a stronger economy could easily boost their bottom lines  Rising rates may also compel would be home buyers to stop searching for houses and instead improve their existing ones 5 Winning StocksWe have  thus  selected five solid stocks from the aforesaid sectors poised to gain from the current interest rate scenario  These

see how the economy evolves  If it evolves broadly in line with our projections we would probably raise interest rates a couple of times over the next few years  Tuesday s U K  CPI report may further inform BoE policy risks  The expectation is for inflation to be topping out at about 3  and thereby averting the over 3 data that triggers the hand wringing by central bankers the world over The European Central Bank  ECB  head Mario Draghi is also expected to jawbone while keeping his various ECB policy measures intact Europe s central bank is unlikely to be terribly exciting to watch for some time  It has already moved for extending bond purchases through to next September 2018 at a diminished pace   while guiding that rate hikes would follow much later The ECB is likely to reduce its bond market portfolio reinvestment well after that   if it follows the Fed s path of reinvesting All of this will happen   until the ECB rate normalization process is well underway  in just a few

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock s next earnings release  or is it due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers Hewlett Packard Q4 Earnings Top EstimatesHewlett Packard reported modest fourth quarter fiscal

a GAAP basis  the company reported earnings of 23 cents from continuing operations  compared with 19 cents reported in the year ago quarter  Moreover  it compared favorably with the guided range of a breakeven to earnings of 4 cents The better than expected bottom line performance was primarily owing to cost savings  lower tax rate  favorable other income and expense as well as transactions in connection with Software spin merger Notably  during second quarter fiscal 2017  the company closed the spin merger of its Enterprise Services business  Consequently  Hewlett Packard considers Enterprise Services as a discontinued operation since the fiscal second quarter  and the year ago quarter s results have also been adjusted accordingly Additionally  the company completed the pending spin merger of its Software business in the fiscal third quarter  Per the company  this quarter  represents adjustment to net periodic pension cost resulting from remeasurements of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise pension plans in connection with the spin off of the software business  Seattle SpinCo  Inc   and the merger of Seattle SpinCo  Inc  with Micro Focus International plc and the spin off of the enterprise services business  Everett SpinCo  Inc   and the merger of Everett SpinCo  Inc  with Computer Sciences Corporation  NYSE DXC   Before diving into the quarter s details  it is to be

Adjusted for currency exchange rates and divestures  the company s revenues from continuing operations were up 11  year over year During the quarter  Hewlett Packard Enterprise s performance in the

year over year Operating ResultsHewlett Packard Enterprise s gross margin contracted 210 basis points  bps  on a year over year basis to 29 7   This year over year contraction was mainly due to competitive pricing  elevated DRAM pricing and unfavorable currency Moreover  the company s non GAAP operating margin descended 100 bps to 8 2   primarily due to a lower gross margin  which was partially offset by a decline in non GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenues Fiscal 2017 HighlightsHewlett Packard Enterprise reported revenues for fiscal 2017 from continuing operations

155309,376825,DXC,5 Stocks Near 52 Week High With Scope To Scale Higher,opinion,While betting on a stock near its 52 week high  investors are faced with one of the trickiest questions   will the stock scale higher or are it the right time to book profits Though betting on 52 week high stocks without a foolproof investment plan is perilous and even na ve  clubbing it with the correct parameters can turn the tide in investors  favor In this screening article  we discuss the 52 week investment plan  While market analysts may be divided in their opinion regarding the 52 week high investment technique  many of them believe that 52 week high stocks which are still undervalued and have strong upside potential can be lucrative bets 52 Week High  A Good IndicatorStocks near 52 week highs often instill the presumptive  adjustment and anchoring bias  in the minds of investors  This principle works on the belief that investors use the 52 week high price as a reference point and value stocks against this anchor Many a times  such stocks are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending A few of the stocks remain undervalued due to prolonged under reaction on part of investors despite bullish growth drivers  Meanwhile  news pertaining to robust sales  surging profit levels  bullish earnings prospects and strategic acquisitions can drive the stock higher However  when a string of positive developments dominate the market  investors find their under reaction unwarranted and the renewed interest might drive stocks beyond the 52 week high bar  Wall Street s fast paced trading makes it imperative for investors to step in before the market gets a whiff of it Also  recent academic research reveals that if a stock s current price is near its 52 week high  there are high chances that it will outperform peers in the subsequent period  According to researchers George and Hwang  holding 52 week high stocks for six months resulted in an average monthly gain of 0 45  between 1963 and 2001  Encouragingly  this is twice the gain that can be garnered from similar

 The added parameters are strong earnings growth expectations  sturdy value metrics and positive price momentum These stocks are relatively undervalued compared to their peers  in terms of earnings as

155311,376827,DXC,5 Best GARP Stocks Based On PEG Ratio,opinion,During the course of their financial planning and execution  while value investors miss the chance of betting on stocks that have bright long term prospects  growth investors often end up investing in expensive stocks Consequently  the quest for a mixed investment strategy led to the introduction of the GARP  growth at a reasonable price  approach  What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential  Investopedia  The price earnings growth  PEG  ratio is a perfect example of a GARP strategy  Although it is categorized under value investing  this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings  Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P E ratio with future earnings growth rate While P E alone only gives the idea of stocks  which are trading at a discount  PEG  while adding the GROWTH element to it  helps to find those stocks that have solid future potential A lower PEG ratio  preferably less than 1  is always better for GARP investors Say for example  if a stock s P E ratio is 10 and expected long term growth rate is 15   the company s PEG will come down to 0 66  a ratio which indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP E Ratio  using F1  less than X Industry Median  For more accurate valuation purpose  Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  or  2 have a proven history of success  Market Capitalization greater than  1 Billion  This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity  Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than 5   Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism  suggesting further bullishness Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3  Hold  offer the best upside potential  Here

 Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Stocks Near 52 Week High with Scope to Scale FurtherWhile betting on a stock near its 52 week high  investors are faced with one of the trickiest questions   will the stock scale higher or are it the right time to book profits Though betting on 52 week high stocks without a foolproof investment plan is perilous and even na ve  clubbing it with the correct parameters can turn the tide in investors  favor In this screening article  we discuss the 52 week investment plan  While market analysts may be divided in their opinion regarding the 52 week high investment technique  many of them believe that 52 week high stocks which are still undervalued and have strong upside potential can be lucrative bets 52 Week High  A Good IndicatorStocks near 52 week highs often instill the presumptive  adjustment and anchoring bias  in the minds of investors  This principle works on the belief that investors use the 52 week high price as a reference point and value stocks against this anchor Many a times  such stocks are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending A few of the stocks remain undervalued due to prolonged under reaction on part of investors despite bullish growth drivers  Meanwhile  news pertaining to robust sales  surging profit levels  bullish earnings prospects and strategic acquisitions can drive the stock higher However  when a string of positive developments dominate the market  investors find their under reaction unwarranted and the renewed interest might drive stocks beyond the 52 week high bar  Wall Street s fast paced trading makes it imperative for investors to step in before the market gets a whiff of it Also  recent academic research reveals that if a stock s current price is near its 52 week high  there are high chances that it will outperform peers in the subsequent period  According to researchers George and Hwang  holding 52 week high stocks for six months resulted in an average monthly gain of 0 45  between 1963 and 2001  Encouragingly  this is twice the gain that can be garnered from similar momentum based strategies And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the remaining stocks on

155337,376853,DXC,Industry Rank Analysis  Time For A Software Upgrade ,opinion,"Want to invest or trade a growth industry  Perhaps in the HOT Tech space 
Take a look at the Business Software Services industry  This is a Zacks industry with a sizeable 12 publicly covered companies  This active Info Tech niche is currently ranked  21 out of 265 industries we rank  That is in the top 8  
The YTD 2017 return is a superb  28   It s tough to beat share performance like that 
Further  it doesn t look like covering analyst earnings upgrades will stop arriving anytime soon  As evidence for that  I see 8 upgrades and just 1 downgrade in our system  The proprietary Zacks Heat Map shows this group has stayed hot  going back 8 weeks in a row  and it is getting hotter over time 
A recent industry report  put out by Grand View Research  stated the obvious  Expect the global business software and services end markets to grow smartly   they say primarily due to a relentless need for transparency and efficiency    in ever more complex  Info Tech oriented internal business functions 
Furthermore  compliance with stringent government regulations assist the broad implementation of such software 
Business software can improve productivity and minimize complexity  Often known as enterprise software and services by this  wonkie  crowd  their programming efforts facilitate the integration of numerous business processes 
Their latest software upgrades assist a smoother flow of information across functions  That makes for quicker decision making and speeds up both worker and machine based productivity 
The business software industry segments it s programming effort based on functions  usually into finance  human resource and supply chain 
The finance function accounts for a maximum share of activity  Software makes it easy to manage different financial activities including investment  accounting  asset management and cash flow management 
Yet  the human resource function should show the maximum growth  This is due to ballooning organizations in rapidly expanding companies 
A high cost of implementation    and a high level of competition within this very established market    acts as the major restraint for those in the business 
Now  here are three top Zacks Ranked picks to look into 
Synnex Corp   SNX   A Zacks Rank  1  STRONG BUY   This is a  5 1 billion market cap stock  Though it is priced at  131 a share  the stock garners a B in Value  with a 14 9 Forward P E   but an F in Growth  where 2017 earnings are at  8 79 and 2018 is at  9 56   That  0 77 in future earnings growth doesn t add up to enough  in a fast growing space like this 
Yet  my colleague Tracey Ryniec wrote up this stock on Oct  10th for Zacks Bull of the Day   Beating the estimate has become commonplace with SYNNEX  It has only missed once in the last five years  
Synnex Corporation is a business process services company  The company provides a range of distribution  logistics and integration services for the tech industry and provides outsourced services focused on a unique customer engagement strategy  It operates in two segments  Technology Solutions and Concentrix  
Cognizant  CTSH   A Zacks  2 Rank  BUY   This is a  44 billion market cap stock  It is priced at  75 a share  Momentum is on  This stock started 2017 as a  55 a share stock  After that nice run up  the stock garners a C in Value  with a Forward P E at 23  and a C in Growth 
Cognizant s strong growth can be attributed to its significant exposure to the fast growing industry verticals like Financial Services and Health Care 
The firm operates in four segments  Financial Services  Health Care  Manufacturing Retail Logistics and Other  Headquarters is in Teaneck  NJ 
For Finance and Manufacturing Retail Logistics  its consulting and technology services include strategy consulting  business and operations consulting  technology strategy and change management  and program management consulting services 
Also  they offer application design and development  systems integration  and application testing  consulting and engineering services  as well as enterprise information management services 
The company also develops  licenses  implements  and supports proprietary and third party software products for the Health Care industry 
Finally  it provides more generic outsourcing services  
The big risk is the stiff competition  Cognizant faces significant competition from the likes of Accenture  Capgemini  Computer Sciences Corp  NYSE DXC   Genpact  HCL Technologies  HP Enterprise  IBM  NYSE IBM  Global Services  Infosys Technologies  Tata Consultancy Services  Wipro and numerous local providers 
That gets me to my last pick 
Wipro  WIT   A Zacks Rank  2  BUY  stock  This a cheap value stock in the space  currently trading at a technical low near  5 a share  The stock had gotten to  7 a share in recent years  The Forward P E is 20  which amounts to a Zacks Value rank of B 
This is a classic Info Tech outsourcing company  based out of India  2017 annual earnings look to be  0 27 a share  while  0 29 a share is the 2018 consensus  In its recent Oct  7th earnings report  Wipro offered its shareholders just 7 cents a share in quarterly earnings  The company also missed on revenue growth and showed some market stress  with a  0 5  annual revenue growth rate 
WIPRO provides comprehensive IT solutions and services  including systems integration  Information Systems outsourcing  package implementation  software application development and maintenance  and research and development services    to corporations globally

155339,376855,DXC,5 Top Stocks Backed By Explosive Relative Price Strength,opinion,Whether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios  Simultaneously  it is important to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average On such comparison  if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples  it may be better to avoid it However  those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio  since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns  Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth  and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen  When a stock undergoes an upward revision  it leads to additional price gains Screening ParametersRelative   Price change   12 weeks greater than 0Relative   Price change   4 weeks greater than

155340,376856,DXC,Bet On These 5 GARP Stocks Based On Low PEG Ratio,opinion,In the course of strict screening to determine the intrinsic value of a company  investors often miss the chance of betting on stocks that have bright long term prospects  The same way  growth investors often end up investing in expensive stocks If we keenly observe the investment track of the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha  we can see how  in quest of eliminating these hazards  this pure play value investor has gradually shifted to a mixed  investment strategy or more precisely GARP  growth at a reasonable price  strategy This strategy combines both growth and value investing principles and has a proven track record of success  What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential  Investopedia  Here lies the importance of a not so popular fundamental metric  the price earnings growth  PEG  ratio  Although it is categorized under value investing  this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings  Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P E ratio with future earnings growth rate While P E alone only gives the idea of stocks  which are trading at a discount  PEG while adding the GROWTH element to it  helps to find those stocks that have solid future potential A lower PEG ratio  preferably less than 1  is always better for GARP investors Say for example  if a stock s P E ratio is 10 and expected long term growth rate is 15   the company s PEG will come down to 0 66  a ratio which indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rates followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP E Ratio  using F1  less than X Industry Median  For more accurate valuation purpose  Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  or  2 have a proven history of success  Market Capitalization greater than  1 Billion  This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity  Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than 5   Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism  suggesting further bullishness Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3  Hold  offer the best upside potential  Here are five of the 33 stocks that qualified the screening Boot Barn Holdings  Inc    NYSE BOOT     This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company is a lifestyle retail chain and operates specialty retail stores in the United States  Boot Barn Holdings can be an impressive value investment pick with its Value Style Score of B  The company s long term expected earnings growth rate is projected to be 15 7  Perrigo Company plc   NYSE PRGO    The company develops  manufactures  markets  and distributes over the counter  OTC  consumer goods and pharmaceutical products worldwide  Apart from a Zacks Rank  2 and a Value Style Score of B  the stock also has an impressive long term expected growth rate of 9 6  Boise Cascade Company   NYSE BCC    This is one of the largest producers of engineered wood products and plywood in North America and a leading U S  wholesale distributor of building products  The stock has an impressive long term expected growth rate of 18 5   The stock currently has a Value Score of A and a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  DXC Technology Company   NYSE DXC    This is an independent  end to end IT services company primarily providing information technology services and solutions in North America  Europe  Asia  and Australia  Apart from a discounted PEG and P E  the stock has a Value Score of B and holds a Zacks Rank  1 Koppers Holdings Inc    NYSE KOP    Headquartered in Pittsburgh  PA  Koppers is an integrated global provider of treated wood products  wood

155369,376885,DXC, Zacks Industry Rank Analysis   Time For A Software Upgrade ,opinion,"Want to invest or trade a growth industry  Perhaps in the HOT Tech space 
Take a look at the Business Software Services industry  This is a Zacks industry with a sizeable 12 publicly covered companies  This active Info Tech niche is currently ranked  21 out of 265 industries we rank  That is in the top 8  
The YTD 2017 return is a superb  28   It s tough to beat share performance like that 
Further  it doesn t look like covering analyst earnings upgrades will stop arriving anytime soon  As evidence for that  I see 8 upgrades and just 1 downgrade in our system  The proprietary Zacks Heat Map shows this group has stayed hot  going back 8 weeks in a row  and it is getting hotter over time 
A recent industry report  put out by Grand View Research  stated the obvious  Expect the global business software and services end markets to grow smartly   they say primarily due to a relentless need for transparency and efficiency    in ever more complex  Info Tech oriented internal business functions 
Furthermore  compliance with stringent government regulations assist the broad implementation of such software 
Business software can improve productivity and minimize complexity  Often known as enterprise software and services by this  wonkie  crowd  their programming efforts facilitate the integration of numerous business processes 
Their latest software upgrades assist a smoother flow of information across functions  That makes for quicker decision making and speeds up both worker and machine based productivity 
The business software industry segments it s programming effort based on functions  usually into finance  human resource and supply chain 
The finance function accounts for a maximum share of activity  Software makes it easy to manage different financial activities including investment  accounting  asset management and cash flow management 
Yet  the human resource function should show the maximum growth  This is due to ballooning organizations in rapidly expanding companies 
A high cost of implementation    and a high level of competition within this very established market    acts as the major restraint for those in the business 
Now  here are three top Zacks Ranked picks to look into 
Synnex Corp   SNX   A Zacks Rank  1  STRONG BUY   This is a  5 1 billion market cap stock  Though it is priced at  131 a share  the stock garners a B in Value  with a 14 9 Forward P E   but an F in Growth  where 2017 earnings are at  8 79 and 2018 is at  9 56   That  0 77 in future earnings growth doesn t add up to enough  in a fast growing space like this 
Yet  my colleague Tracey Ryniec wrote up this stock on Oct  10th for Zacks Bull of the Day   Beating the estimate has become commonplace with SYNNEX  It has only missed once in the last five years  
Synnex Corporation is a business process services company  The company provides a range of distribution  logistics and integration services for the tech industry and provides outsourced services focused on a unique customer engagement strategy  It operates in two segments  Technology Solutions and Concentrix  
Cognizant  CTSH   A Zacks  2 Rank  BUY   This is a  44 billion market cap stock  It is priced at  75 a share  Momentum is on  This stock started 2017 as a  55 a share stock  After that nice run up  the stock garners a C in Value  with a Forward P E at 23  and a C in Growth 
Cognizant s strong growth can be attributed to its significant exposure to the fast growing industry verticals like Financial Services and Health Care 
The firm operates in four segments  Financial Services  Health Care  Manufacturing Retail Logistics and Other  Headquarters is in Teaneck  NJ 
For Finance and Manufacturing Retail Logistics  its consulting and technology services include strategy consulting  business and operations consulting  technology strategy and change management  and program management consulting services 
Also  they offer application design and development  systems integration  and application testing  consulting and engineering services  as well as enterprise information management services 
The company also develops  licenses  implements  and supports proprietary and third party software products for the Health Care industry 
Finally  it provides more generic outsourcing services  
The big risk is the stiff competition  Cognizant faces significant competition from the likes of Accenture  Capgemini  Computer Sciences Corp  NYSE DXC   Genpact  HCL Technologies  HP Enterprise  IBM  NYSE IBM  Global Services  Infosys Technologies  Tata Consultancy Services  Wipro and numerous local providers 
That gets me to my last pick 
Wipro  WIT   A Zacks Rank  2  BUY  stock  This a cheap value stock in the space  currently trading at a technical low near  5 a share  The stock had gotten to  7 a share in recent years  The Forward P E is 20  which amounts to a Zacks Value rank of B 
This is a classic Info Tech outsourcing company  based out of India  2017 annual earnings look to be  0 27 a share  while  0 29 a share is the 2018 consensus  In its recent Oct  7th earnings report  Wipro offered its shareholders just 7 cents a share in quarterly earnings  The company also missed on revenue growth and showed some market stress  with a  0 5  annual revenue growth rate 
WIPRO provides comprehensive IT solutions and services  including systems integration  Information Systems outsourcing  package implementation  software application development and maintenance  and research and development services    to corporations globally

155397,376913,DXC,HPE Falls On Earnings,opinion,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise  NYSE HPE  delivered its fiscal second quarter results on Wednesday  Analysts overall expected a decline in their revenue as the company continuously failed to address corporate demands 
Analysts Expectations
For their earnings  analysts expected an adjusted earnings of 35 cents per share which is 16  lower than their earnings of 42 cents per share during the same period last year 
Wall Street analysts also expected their revenue to decline at around 24 2  to  9 64 billion compared to the  12 71 billion a year ago  This was expected due to the company s 100 000 employee sale of its computing services business to Computer Sciences Corp  NYSE DXC  back in April 
The company s revenue in their software and service subscription sales are also expected to go down despite HP s efforts in investing in the following businesses  HP currently has plans to sell its software business this September and is expected to shift their recurring revenue percentage from 45  to 30   Around 46  of HP s revenue is also divested from its servers followed by 24  coming from the rest of its technology services business 
Disappointing Q2 Earnings
The Palo Alto based company delivered an even weaker earnings report on Wednesday that missed analysts estimates 
For the fiscal second quarter  the company reported a loss of  612 million or around 37 cents per share down by more than 200  from last year  The company s adjusted earnings for the quarter came at around 25 cents per share after non recurring costs and pre tax expenses  The results mostly reflected the company s recent merger with Computer Sciences Corp 
The company s adjusted income rose by 29  to  400 million but still largely missed analysts estimates for  615 3 million in profit 
According to HP chief executive officer Meg Whitman  the company still has a lot of work to do but remains confident about the results of their efforts in delivering to their customers and partners 
Meanwhile  HPE chief financial officer Tim Stonesifer stated that the enterprise services division merger allowed and gave the company another opportunity to optimize the cost structure of the company s future 
HPE s enterprise group revenue has also lost around 13  year over year to  6 2 billion while its revenue from its software division fell by 11  compared to the same quarter last year to  685 million  Meanwhile  HP s financial services revenue inched 11  higher to  872 million 
Despite this  the company was able to slightly beat analysts revenue estimates delivering a revenue of  9 9 billion for the quarter compared to consensus analysts estimates of  9 87 billion 
HPE Shares
HPE Shares have declined by around 19  since the start of the year  Following the release of the earnings report  the shares of the company sinked by 2 3  during the after hours trading to  18 36 down by 45 cents from the previous trading session ",2017-06-01,Trade12,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hpe-falls-on-earnings-200192664,200192664

155464,376980,DXC,5 Cheap Value Stocks Flaunting Low PEG Ratio,opinion,While searching for a suitable investment option  value investors with varied risk appetite are unlikely to consider price earnings to growth  PEG  ratio among a number of other popular metrics like price earnings  P E   price sales  P S  or price book value  P B  This is because they often find this ratio complicated  considering the limitations in calculating the future earnings growth potential of a stock However  at a time when volatility strikes every second day  it is pointless to ponder on methods  which don t consider a stock s future growth rate while calculating its intrinsic merit  Yardsticks such as dividend yield  P E or P B are most commonly used to single out whether a stock is trading at a discount However  these ratios  while not taking into account the future growth potential of a stock  may end up convincing us to invest in stocks that are at a discount just because of their poor show  This may often lead to  value traps    a situation when these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems  which once drove the share price down turn out to be persistent In such a case  even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value  you might still end up paying more  And here comes the importance of this not so popular but crucial value investing metric  the PEG ratio The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings  Earnings Growth RateA low PEG ratio is always better for value investors While P E alone fails to identify a true value stock  PEG helps to find the intrinsic value of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration Here are some of the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP E Ratio  using F1  less than X Industry Median  for more accurate valuation purpose Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 have a proven history of success  Market Capitalization greater than  1 Billion  This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity  Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable  Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than 5   Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism  suggesting further bullishness  Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3  Hold  offer the best upside potential  Here are five stocks that qualified the screening The Chemours Company   NYSE CC   is a leading player in the field of titanium technologies  fluoroproducts and chemical solutions  catering to a wide range of industries with market defining products  application expertise and chemistry based innovations  The company has an impressive expected five year growth rate of 15 5   The stock currently has a Value Style Score of  B  and a Zacks

5 Stocks to Buy with Solid Earnings Acceleration

	Constant earnings growth captivates almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  This is because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making  Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings 

	Upbeat earnings results are more often than not followed by an uptick in the share price  Earnings acceleration  however  works even better when it comes to lifting the stock price  Studies have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before an uptick in the stock price 

Finding Future Outperformers

	Basically  earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company  In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be referred to as earnings acceleration 

	In case of earnings growth  you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  But  earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates 

	Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  On the other hand  a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down 

	This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance

Why Does Hewlett Packard Enterprises Need to Be in Your Portfolio 

Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company  NYSE     have been rallying since its split from the parent company  driven particularly by its massive restructuring plan

155537,377053,DXC,4 Trade Ideas For Computer Sciences Corporation,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Computer Sciences Corporation  NYSE CSC   did absolutely nothing for the 6 months into June this year  It gapped down at the start of December and sat there in a  4 range for 6 months  In May that all changed  Well it changed for a day  The stock gapped up 40   but then held in a tight range again for 3 and a half months until mid September 
It started higher again then with a shorter trend followed by a pullback  That repeated in October and Friday looks to have started a third leg up  The bullish engulfing candle  on strong volume to start the third leg gives a target on a Measured Move to 59  But there is also a larger Measured Move to 65 above that 
The stock has positive momentum with the RSI moving up in the bullish zone while the MACD is turning back higher towards a cross up  and is positive  In the intermediate term the Bollinger Bands  have turned higher  but short term may still provide a cap as they are flat  The company will not report earnings again until February 9th and short interest is elevated at 7 6  
The November options chain shows big open interest at the 57 5 strike on the call side  It is greater than the total open interest on the put side  The put side open interest is biggest at 50 and 52 50  This suggest a easier path higher  Longer dated options have been lightly traded thus far 
Computer Sciences Corporation
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock now  over 54  with a stop at 52 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock now  over 54  with a December 55 52 5 Put Spread   1 30  and selling a January 60 Covered Call  80 cents  
Trade Idea 3  Buy the December 52 5 55 bullish Risk Reversal   2 00  
Trade Idea 4  Buy the November January 55 Call Calendar   1 10  and sell the December 52 5 Put  65 cents  for 65 cents 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which heading into the first full week of November and with the US elections Tuesday  sees the equity markets are weak and hemorrhaging 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue higher in the short term while Crude Oil continues to move lower  The US Dollar Index looks to continue to the downside while US Treasuries are biased lower but consolidating  The Shanghai Composite should continue to drift higher while Emerging Markets are biased to the downside 
Volatility looks to remain elevated keeping the bias lower for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and NASDAQ QQQ  Their charts agree and look better to the downside on both the daily and weekly timeframes  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

3 cents to 7 cents  mid point  5 cents  and non GAAP earnings of 42 46 cents  mid point  44 cents   The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 47 cents Our TakeHewlett Packard Enterprise reported modest fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results  wherein earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased on a year over year basis  On the other hand  revenues lagged our expectations and were also down from the year ago figure Nonetheless  in our opinion  Hewlett Packard Company s initiative to split the business is already reaping benefits for Hewlett Packard Enterprise  We believe that the decision enabled a customized approach for two different kinds of businesses  which might not have been possible as a single entity Hewlett Packard Enterprise has done considerably well in the enterprise class server and storage markets  The company concentrates its resources on the high margin software and security markets as well  We believe that the company s traction in the cloud  security and Big Data segments will enhance its growth trajectory  going forward Furthermore  Hewlett Packard Enterprise s strategic divestments and initiatives to return value to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases bode well Since the split  Hewlett Packard Enterprise s Chief Operating Officer  CEO   Meg Whitman  has been looking to reduce the company s large portfolio of non core businesses that are now struggling to maintain their growth trajectory In keeping with this effort  the company  in September this year  announced that it will spin off the software business and merge the same with British software firm  Micro Focus International Plc  in a cash stock deal worth  8 8 billion The transaction  which is subject to certain regulatory approvals  is anticipated to be tax free for the company  Per the agreement  the company will receive  2 5 billion in cash and a 50 1  stake in the merged entity  which is currently estimated to be worth  6 3 billion Also  Hewlett Packard Enterprise completed the sale of 84  of its 60 5  equity stake in Mphasis Limited  an IT service provider in Bangalore  India  to The Blackstone  NYSE BX  Group in September  The transaction has fetched the company around  700 million Furthermore  this May  it announced the spin off of its struggling IT services segment   Enterprise Services   and entered into an agreement to merge the same with Computer Sciences Corporation   NYSE CSC   The primary motive behind such a massive restructuring drive is to reassure investors of the company s sustained focus on improving profitability and returning value to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases We believe that Hewlett Packard Enterprise s ongoing business overhaul will yield long term benefits by supporting innovation and leading to cost savings We also believe that successful deployment of the company s products will boost its top line  going forward However  macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain near term concerns  Competition from International Business Machines   NYSE IBM   and Oracle  NYSE ORCL  add to its woes Currently  Hewlett

155563,377079,DXC,Hewlett Packard  HPE  Spin Off News Dulls Q3 Earnings Beat,opinion,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company   NYSE HPE   released its third quarterly earnings release yesterday post the split from Hewlett Packard Company  The company reported mixed results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016  wherein its bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missed the same However  quarterly results were overshadowed by the company s announcement of its decision to spin off the software business and merge the same with British software firm  Micro Focus International Plc  in a cash stock deal worth  8 8 billion Details of the Spin Off   Merger TransactionThe transaction  which is subject to some regulatory approvals  is anticipated to be tax free for Hewlett Packard Enterprise  Per the agreement  the company will receive  2 5 billion in cash and a 50 1  stake in the merged entity  currently estimated to be valued at  6 3 billion In 2015  Hewlett Packard Enterprise s software division generated revenues of  3 6 billion  It includes the highly controversial Autonomy takeover  which was mostly written down by the current CEO  Meg Whitman  It also includes acquisitions like Mercury Interactive and Vertica  However  the segment hasn t been doing too well of late due to the customer shift toward cloud supported  as a service software purchasing The recent move is part of Whitman s massive restructuring plan  which started last year  post its split from the parent company  Since then  management has been focused on trimming the company s structure by shedding struggling and low margin businesses  and shifting focus toward fast growing  high margin areas like networking  storage and technology services This May  Hewlett Packard Enterprise announced the spin off its struggling IT services segment   Enterprise Services   and entered into an agreement to merge the same with Computer Sciences Corporation   NYSE CSC    The transaction  which is scheduled to close in Mar 2017  will deliver approximately  8 5 billion to the company s shareholders on an after tax basis  This includes  4 5 billion in the form of equity in the combined company   1 5 billion in cash dividend and  2 5 billion of debt assumption Most recently  Hewlett Packard Enterprise completed the sell off of 84  of its 60 5  equity stake in Mphasis Limited  an IT services provider in Bangalore  India to The Blackstone Group   NYSE BX    The transaction has fetched the company around  700 million Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes that such massive restructuring moves will complement its focus on core businesses and enable it to compete with players like Oracle   NYSE ORCL    Cisco and NetApp  NASDAQ NTAP  as well as the new entrant  Dell  Interestingly  with the acquisition of EMC Corporation  NYSE EMC   Dell has now emerged as one of the biggest competitors for Hewlett Packard Enterprise Although these strategies appear impressive  we believe that Hewlett Packard Enterprise s growth story depends largely on how well it is able to capture market share in the networking  storage and technology services space Now  let s discuss Hewlett Packard Enterprise s results in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 Quarterly ResultsNotably  Hewlett Packard Company split itself into two standalone companies   HP Inc    NYSE HPQ   and Hewlett Packard Enterprise   effective Nov 1  2015  Post the split  Hewlett Packard Company s PC and printer business operates under HP Inc   while Hewlett Packard Enterprise specializes in commercial tech products RevenuesHewlett Packard Enterprise reported total revenue of  12 210 billion  lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  12 588 billion and down 6 5  year over year  The year over year decline was mainly due a weak performance in Japan and the Europe  particularly in the UK  Unfavorable currency exchange rates negatively impacted revenues by 210 basis points  bps  Segment wise  revenues at the Enterprise Group were down 8  from the year ago quarter to  6 5 billion  However  adjusting for divestures and currency  segment revenues were flat  Revenues from Servers  Storage  Networking and Technology Services were down 4   8   22  and 7   respectively Enterprise Services revenues were down 5  to  4 7 billion  Revenues were hurt by a 4  decline in Application and Business Services and a 6  dip in IT Outsourcing  Adjusted for divestures and currency  the segment s revenues declined 3  Software revenues were down 18  to  738 million  Revenues from License  Support  Professional Services and SaaS were down 28   17   8  and 5   respectively  Adjusted for divestures and currency  the segment s revenues fell 3  Financial Services revenues were up 1  to  812 million Operating ResultsHewlett Packard Enterprise s non GAAP gross margin expanded 60 basis points  bps  on a year over year basis to 29 3   Moreover  the company s non GAAP operating margin expanded 30 bps to 8 8  mainly due to a higher gross margin  partially offset by increased operating expenses as a percentage of revenues Non GAAP net income came in at  844 million or 49 cents per share  compared with  871 million or 47 cents per share reported a year ago  Moreover  non GAAP earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate Balance Sheet and Cash FlowHewlett Packard Enterprise ended the fiscal third quarter with  10 743 billion in cash and cash equivalents  compared with  9 010 billion at the end of the previous quarter  Long term debt during the quarter was  15 354 billion  compared with  15 247 billion last quarter Hewlett Packard Enterprise generated cash flow of  1 7 billion from operational activities during the third quarter  Moreover  during the period  the company returned  1 591 billion through share repurchase and dividend payments  Year to date  the company has returned  2 9 billion to its shareholders GuidanceHewlett Packard Enterprise raised the lower end of its

Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at  1 88 The company now anticipates returning  3 billion in fiscal 2016  which is approximately thrice its original commitment made at the start of the fiscal year For fiscal fourth quarter  the company expects GAAP earnings per share in the range of 44 cents to 49 cents  mid point  46 5 cents  and non GAAP earnings of 58 63 cents  mid point  60 5 cents   The

Celator Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ CPXX  looks like a rock star for us  up 44 cents to 17 55  or 2 57   on 1 4 million shares  Buying in after the pullback was the right thing to do  It has moved from about 8 00 to 18 00  It s near the bottom of the channel of a little mini flag  and if it can pop through 15 20 as early as Thursday it could run  I wouldn t be surprised to see a quick pop into the low 20s

155594,377110,DXC,Hewlett Packard  HPE  Q2 Earnings In Line  Revenues Beat,opinion,Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company   NYSE HPE   soared nearly 12  during yesterday s afterhours trading session after the company announced robust results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 as well as major progress on its ongoing restructuring initiative Quarterly ResultsThis was the second quarterly earnings release by Hewlett Packard Enterprise post its split from Hewlett Packard Company  Notably  Hewlett Packard Company split itself into two standalone companies   HP Inc    NYSE HPQ   and Hewlett Packard Enterprise   effective Nov 1  2015  Post the split  Hewlett Packard Company s PC and printer business operates under HP Inc   while Hewlett Packard Enterprise specializes in commercial tech products During the second quarter of fiscal 2016  Hewlett Packard Enterprise s earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues beat the same RevenuesHewlett Packard Enterprise reported total revenue of  12 711 billion  above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  12 419 billion and up 1 3  year over year  Notably  this was the first time in the last five years that the company s revenues witnessed year over year growth  The improvement was mainly driven by a strong performance at the Enterprise Group segment On a constant currency basis  revenues increased 5  year over year  representing the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth Segment wise  revenues at the Enterprise Group were up 7  from the year ago quarter to  7 010 billion  driven primarily by higher contributions from Networking  up 57    Servers  7   and Storage  2    partially offset by a 6  decline in Technology Services Enterprise Services revenues were down 2  to  4 723 billion  Revenues were hurt by a 3  decline in Application and Business Services  and a 1  dip in IT Outsourcing Software revenues were down 13  to  774 million mainly due to a weak performance at the IT Management division  which more than offset sales growth at Security and Big Data Financial Servicesrevenues fell 2  year over year to  788 million Operating ResultHewlett Packard Enterprise s non GAAP gross margin was up 10 basis points  bps  on a year over year basis to 28 7   However  as a percentage of revenues  the company s non GAAP operating margin contracted 50 bps to 7 9  mainly due to higher operating expenses Non GAAP net income came in at  731 million or 42 cents per share  compared with  805 million or 44 cents per share reported a year ago  Non GAAP earnings were  however  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate Balance Sheet and Cash FlowHewlett Packard Enterprise ended the fiscal second quarter with  9 010 billion in cash and cash equivalents  compared with  8 505 billion at the end of the previous quarter  Long term debt during the quarter was  15 247 billion  compared with  15 229 billion last quarter Hewlett Packard Enterprise used a net cash of  1 121 billion for operational activities during the first half of fiscal 2016  Moreover  during the period  the company repurchased  1 212 billion shares and paid dividends worth  190 million GuidanceHewlett Packard Enterprise reiterated its earnings guidance for the full year  The company still expects non GAAP earnings per share between  1 85 and  1 95  mid point   1 90   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for non GAAP earnings is pegged lower at  1 89 Moreover  the company still expects to return at least 100  of free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2016  Apart from this  the company also intends to use a major portion of the proceeds from the Tsinghua transaction  approximately  2 billion  for share repurchases For fiscal third quarter  the company expects to report GAAP earnings per share in the range of  1 10 to  1 14  mid point   1 12  and non GAAP earnings of 42 46 cents  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 49 cents Spin Off and Merger of Enterprise Services BusinessYesterday  the company took a step toward restructuring its struggling IT services business as it announced the spin off of the Enterprise Services segment  following which the segment will merge with Computer Sciences Corporation   NYSE CSC    The transaction is expected to allow Hewlett Packard Enterprise to focus on faster growing businesses and unlock value for shareholders The transaction  which is scheduled to close in Mar 2017  will deliver approximately  8 5 billion to Hewlett Packard Enterprise s shareholders on an after tax basis  This includes  4 5 billion in the form of equity in the combined company   1 5 billion in cash dividend and  2 5 billion of debt assumption Our TakeHewlett Packard Enterprise reported strong second quarter fiscal 2016 results  wherein the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and earnings came in line  Moreover  revenues witnessed year over year growth for the first time in five years In our opinion  the parent company s  Hewlett Packard Company  initiative to split the business has already started reaping benefits for Hewlett Packard Enterprise  We believe that splitting the businesses has ensured a customized approach for two different kinds of businesses  which might not have been possible as a single entity Hewlett Packard has done considerably well in the enterprise class server and storage markets  The company focuses its resources on the high margin software and security markets as well  We believe that the company s traction in the cloud  security and Big Data segments will drive growth  going forward Furthermore  Hewlett Packard Enterprise s strategic divestments and initiatives to return value to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases are positives However  macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain near term concerns  Competition from International Business Machines   NYSE IBM   and Oracle  NYSE ORCL  further add to its woes
