1373,222888,ASGN,Is ASGN Incorporated  ASGN  A Good Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put ASGN Incorporated   NYSE ASGN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  ASGN Incorporated has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 32  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 25  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  ASGN Incorporated s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 18 62 over the past five years Further  the stock s PE compares quite favorably with the Computer and Technology Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 41  This indicates that the stock is quite undervalued right now  compared to its peers Also  ASGN Incorporated has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 14 24  which is slightly lower than the current level  So  it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for ASGN Incorporated stock P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  ASGN Incorporated has a P S ratio of just 1 05  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 32 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this stands below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  ASGN Incorporated currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes ASGN Incorporated a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for ASGN Incorporated is 1 58  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1 68x  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  ASGN is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though ASGN Incorporated might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of C  This gives ASGN a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter consensus estimate has risen 1 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below ASGN Incorporated Price and Consensus   Despite this somewhat bullish trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and it is the reason why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineASGN Incorporated is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Although the stock has a strong industry rank  among Top 27  of more than 250 industries   with a Zacks Rank  3 it hard to get too excited about the stock However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  despite a Zacks Rank  3  we believe that bullish analyst sentiment and favorable industry factors make this value stock a compelling pick Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity  Current technology will

EBITDA increased 2 5  year over year to  62 7 million  which was within management s guided range of  63  66 million  EBITDA per worksite employee per month declined 8 3  in the quarter Insperity s

technology infrastructure  security and development As percentage of revenues  operating expenses decreased 10 bps from the year ago quarter to 12   primarily owing to operating leverage and budget savings  Operating expense per worksite employee per month declined from  204 in the year ago quarter to  202 in the reported quarter  Non bonus payroll cost per worksite employee per month increased 0 5  to  6 725 As a result  operating margin contracted almost 50 bps from the year ago quarter to 6 1   Operating income per worksite employee per month plunged 8 9  on a year over year basis to  102

11 12   which is near the low end of initial guidance  primarily due to ongoing weakness in net hiring by clients and a slight shift in the timing of enrolment of two large midmarket accounts Our TakeInsperity is well placed to benefit from the booming professional employer organization  PEO  industry  strong client retention and growth in worksite employees in the long run However  the company has not achieved the desired levels despite increasing average worksite employees  which remain a major concern  Additionally  a sluggish global macro environment can lead to headcount reductions at client companies  An increase in health care costs does not bode well for Insperity as it is one of the major components of operating expenses Furthermore  increasing competition from

out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  On Assignment has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 89  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 19  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts On Assignment s current PE ratio below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Business Services industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 73  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that On Assignment has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 18 11  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for On Assignment stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  On Assignment has a P S ratio of about 1 13  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 12 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  On Assignment currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes On Assignment a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though On Assignment might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives ASGN a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging  The current quarter has seen three estimates going higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen three up and no down in the same time period  The next year estimate  on the other hand  has seen four upward and no downward movement This has had a small impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 1 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has remained flat at  2 90  The next year estimate has inched down by 0 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below On Assignment  Inc  Price and Consensus   Despite this somewhat bearish trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineOn Assignment is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 18  out of more than 250 industries  strengthens its growth potential  In fact  over the past five years  the Zacks Business Service industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  8 Companies Verge on Apple Like RunDid you miss Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  s 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007  Now 2017 looks to

For the last four quarters  the company generated a positive average earnings surprise of 10 13  

Jacobs aims to improve its revenues and margins on the back of a unique customer centric model 
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors to Influence Second Quarter Results
Jacobs expects to report higher revenues in the to be reported quarter on the back of its diversified product portfolio and increased demand from Aerospace   Technology as well as PharmaBio markets  Moreover  the company anticipates its new business contracts to help in boosting sales in the quarter under review  At the same time  timely project delivery  specialized cost reduction plans along with lower overhead as well as real estate portfolio expenses are expected to widen margin in the fiscal second quarter 
However  reduced capital spending by major integrated oil and mining companies  unfavorable product pricing environment and strong U S  dollar might weigh on the company s revenues and earnings in the to be reported quarter

2061,223576,ASGN,Week in Review Part III  Foreign Affairs,opinion,  President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad appeared at a nuclear facility in Tehran to show off his nation s new  breakthrough   fuel plates that few nations have the technology to make  But the backdrop looked like it was from one of those chintzy Matt Helm series films  plus some workers were wearing face masks  others weren t  so I m thinking they really have a SARS epidemic  only many of the workers don t know that  Ahmadinejad also claimed Iran added 3 000 new centrifuges at the Natanz facility  bringing the total there to 9 000  which  if true  would be significant  But U S  officials were skeptical of both claims Iran also expressed renewed willingness to resume talks on its nuclear program  but the West has learned its lesson  This seems highly unlikely   Then again  I just saw where Sec  of State Clinton said a letter from Iran to the U S  and its allies was  one we have been waiting for   Oh brother  At the same time  Iran threatened to cut off oil to six European nations ahead of their announced July 1st embargo   While China is buying less Iranian oil due to a price dispute  And Iran attempted to attack Israeli diplomats in New Delhi  Tbilisi  and Bangkok with very limited success  though one Israeli injury was serious  One of the would be terrorists  most likely Hizbullah disciples operating with Iran s help  blew his leg off with a grenade while being chased by police in Bangkok  Hizbullah was no doubt acting in retaliation for the Feb  2008 assassination of its key military chief  Imad Moughniyeh Lastly  Iran threatened once more to close the Strait of Hormuz and is said to have prepared suicide boats  On this the threat is very real  nor should the West  and Israel  dismiss Hizbullah s amateur terror attempts  No doubt they have hundreds of more qualified operatives around the world waiting for their orders Editorial   Wall Street Journal Tehran officially denied involvement  in the attempted terror attacks   But three Iranian nationals are now under arrest in Thailand  another is on the lam  and a fourth is being extradited to Thailand from Malaysia  If these are the marks of a country that is  ready to talk    as former Obama administration diplomat Dennis Ross argued in a New York Times op ed this week   we d be interested to know what Iranian actions would qualify as evidence of belligerence  An attempt to bomb Washington  D C    Oh  wait  They tried that  too  The larger story is that Iran is coming close to openly making war on the country it wants to wipe off the map  That s an escalation from the more veiled  and often more deadly  warfare the Islamic Republic has waged against Israeli and Jewish targets for decades  It s also an indication that the mullahs  far from seeking to de escalate tensions with the West  are scrapping for a fight  They might get one  It is in nobody s interest  least of all America s  to see a regional war erupt in the Middle East  It is even less in America s interests to back our allies in Jerusalem into a corner where they feel they have no choice other than to fight  as they did in 1967  An Iran that seeks to murder diplomats across the globe is a threat to global security  The U S  has an even larger interest than Israel in stopping it  Israel  For his part  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said of the first incidents in Delhi and Tbilisi   Today we witnessed two attempts of terrorism against innocent civilians  Iran is behind these attacks and it is the largest terror exporter in the world  Netanyahu blamed Hizbullah as well  Iran is undermining the stability of the world  Nations of the world must draw a red line against this Iranian aggression  Aggression like this  if it is not stopped  will spread like a storm  Barron s interviewed intelligence consultant George Friedman of Stratfor and I have to take issue with some of Mr  Friedman s conclusions  To Friedman  the likelihood of an imminent Israeli strike on Iran s nuclear facilities remains low   a one in four chance   he opined   For one thing  to be successful the action would require U S  assistance  And that aid is unlikely to be forthcoming  especially in an election year  The fact that it is an election year makes U S  assistance more  not less likely  Friedman adds   The task is infinitely more difficult than Israel s air strikes that destroyed the Iraqi Osirak reactor in 1981 or the Syrian nuclear reactor in 2007 Israel has also lost all elements of surprise by its bellicose broadsides in the Western press  What s more  if Israel learned anything from its unsuccessful 2006 war against Hizbullah in Lebanon  air force generals always over promise what they can deliver on  So Friedman is saying it s too late  Israel will just sit back and let Iran get the bomb  whether it is end of 2012 or 2015  That s absurd  Or I am totally misreading Netanyahu Friedman talks about the aftermath of any attack on Iran  Civilian casualties from Hizbullah and Hamas rocket attacks would be higher than anticipated They ll be high but not unanticipated Friedman says Iran will have success in closing  or dramatically slowing the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf through the Strait  I just don t see this  Friedman believes the hysteria over Iran s apparent quest to become a nuclear power has clouded rational consideration of more important geopolitical issues  Even if Iran succeeds in building some kind of nuclear arsenal  It s hardly hysteria Amir Taheri   The Times of London on the mindset of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei   Khamenei s  analysis is simple  the U S  is too tired  too divided and too concerned about the global economy to launch a full scale war against Iran  The perception that Barack Obama is a master of the art of running away reinforces Tehran s analysis  With political moves and economic sanctions manifestly having no effect  the U S  and its allies are running out of options  Soon they would find themselves with the last of the famous  all options on the table   military action  The way Khamenei sees it  such action would be limited to bombing raids on Iran s most vulnerable nuclear sites  such as the enrichment facility at Natanz  That would be no big deal as Tehran has transferred most of its enrichment activities to a new and air attack proof facility in the Fordo mountains  The Americans may also destroy some Islamic Revolutionary Guard bases  However  once all that is done  Khamenei could claim to have fought the  Great Satan  and survived while the U S  and allies would have nothing more to throw at Iran  Comparing himself to the Prophet Muhammad  Khamenei claims that he is about to repeat the great victories of the founder of Islam at Kheybar and Badr  Khamenei s message is  either surrender or fight  That position is based on the Shia concept of  relief after hardship  under which believers welcome suffering  even martyrdom  in the certainty that their sacrifice leads to comfort or even paradise  Rather than waiting for the worst to happen  the believer should provoke it  In fact  under Shia theology  waiting is worse than death  Sanctions are already hurting the people  war  even a limited one  is sure to cause more suffering  However  none of that would alter Khamenei s behavior  He would compromise only if the survival of his regime is at stake  A limited bombing war would play into his hands  This is why he is trying to trigger it by a series of provocative acts over the nuclear issue and plots to kill Israeli  American and Saudi diplomats in several countries  Syria  President Bashar Assad called for a sham referendum on a new constitution for Feb  26  a document that would allow for multiple parties in the legislature and a maximum two  7 year terms for the president  but also gives the president sweeping powers to rule by decree and dissolve parliament  Plus  with parliamentary elections slated for 90 days after the constitution is approved  Assad would nonetheless remain in power until his term expires 2014  So he d let the elections go through and then tell the legislators to go home On Feb  24  Sec  of State Clinton has called for a meeting in Tunisia among the willing to explore ways to help the rebels  but this is now complicated by the United States  revelation that al Qaeda in Iraq was involved in the suicide terror attacks in Damascus and Aleppo  exactly what Assad has claimed  Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri called on jihadists to join the fight against the Syrian president In the meantime  on Thursday the UN General Assembly voted 137 12 to call for an end to the violence in Syria  with Russia and China lining up with the likes of North Korea and Venezuela  as well as Syria itself  Another 17 abstained  The vote was nonbinding but at least a mild morale boost for the opposition But just who is the opposition  There is no unified command or leader and al Qaeda is exploiting the civil war  Lebanon could blow at any minute  dragged into its own civil war by Syria   Over 6 000 Syrian refugees are already in northern Lebanon   The Gulf States are aligned against Assad  as well as al Qaeda  The Iraqis are arming both sides  including allowing Iraqi Shiite militiamen and Iranian fighters through its border with Syria   We note the passing of New York Times correspondent Anthony Shadid  who died of an apparent asthma attack while on assignment in Syria  The award winning Shadid was just 43  I quoted him last week in a bit on Libya  Lebanon  Former Prime Minister Saad Hariri  speaking from Paris  called on Hizbullah to begin to surrender its arms to Lebanese authorities and  relieve Lebanon and all Lebanese of the danger of violence  and relieve the state of the danger of collapse  Let Hizbullah and all Lebanese work for the triumph of the state and for Lebanon to remain a pioneer among Arabs in the Arab Spring  At the same time  Hariri said  Israel is our enemy and a danger to us all which we should all face  Let us all defend our country and win within the confines of the Lebanese state  But when the weapons  under the pretext of fighting Israel  become a weapon to fight each other and eliminate the state  then it only serves Israel and no one but Israel  Hariri is recovering in Paris after a skiing accident and promised to return to Lebanon soon Libya  The nation is concerned about the pronouncements of one of Muammar Gaddafi s sons  Saadi  who warned in a television interview from Niger that his family s supporters were planning attacks on the interim leadership  Niger refuses to extradite Gaddafi back to Libya  let alone other surviving members of the family  Libya itself remains highly unstable with no coherent institutions  including the courts and a police force  Some say it s even more corrupt than during Gaddafi s time  Torture  as previously reported  is widespread Egypt  President Obama s new fiscal 2013 budget contains  1 3 billion in military aid for Egypt  along with  250 million for economic assistance  the same level as 2012  Our goal is to provide the necessary funds  It s obviously clear to all of us that we have issues we need to work through  and we re working very aggressively to do so   said Deputy Secretary of State Tom Nides   But this budget reflects our commitment and our desire to fully fund this initiative  It goes without saying that Congress will have a voice in any disbursements and right now  Egypt doesn t deserve a dime Likewise with the Palestinians  who stand to receive significant aid as well  though off previous levels  but this depends on the role of Hamas in any new Palestinian government Pakistan  Prime Minister Gilani was indicted on Monday for contempt of court  the Supreme Court  in a move that could disqualify him from holding office  If convicted of refusing to re open a corruption case against President Zardari  Gilani faces six months in prison  Afghanistan  In a positive step  at least on paper  Afghan officials are attempting to rid the army of Taliban infiltrators by ordering soldiers with families in Pakistan to either go home or move their relatives to Afghanistan But as the Washington Post s Kevin Sieff reports   the ultimatum could force painful choices for thousands of Afghan troops  and it is likely to stoke ethnic tensions just as the country s leadership is seeking a negotiated end to the war  Purging members of the military with family in Pakistan also has the potential to aggravate long troubled relations between Afghanistan and its eastern neighbor  The issue is when the soldiers return home to Pakistan on leave  it is a fact many are then influenced by Pakistani militants to return and kill NATO forces  or launch attacks against government troops under cover of being in the military  At least 58 Western military personnel were killed in 26 attacks by Afghan soldiers or police between May 2007 and May 2011 Meanwhile  President Hamid Karzai arrived in Pakistan to explore how the Pakistanis can help the peace process between the Karzai government and the Taliban  Heretofore  the Taliban has said they would talk only to the Americans  describing Karzai as a  puppet  leading a  puppet government  China  Vice President Xi Jinping  the next president of his country  is nearly finished with his trip to the U S  as I write  During his visit to Washington  both sides staked out their positions  though without fireworks  Among the issues discussed with President Obama  Vice President Biden and Sec  of State Clinton  Xi said he had a  candid exchange  regarding human rights  I stressed that China has made tremendous and well recognized achievements in the field of human rights over the past 30 plus years  since reform and opening up  Of course  there is always room for improvement when it comes to human rights   Xi added I ll say  Like why has China been on such a mission lately to arrest dissidents  especially ahead of Xi s visit  It s nonsensical President Obama said he  welcomed China s peaceful rise   but added   We want to work with China to make sure that everybody is working by the same rules of the road when it comes to the world economic system  That includes ensuring that there is a balanced trading flow not only between the United States and China but around the world  Xi signaled he wants to work with the U S  on foreign policy issues  but he also called on Washington to recognize China s one state policy when it comes to Taiwan  as well as Tibet  China welcomes the United States playing a constructive role in promoting the peace  stability and prosperity of the Asia Pacific region  At the same time we hope the U S  side will truly respect the interests and concerns of countries in the region  including China  So did Xi s visit narrow the  trust gap  between our two nations  Not likely  Xi is  however  limited in what he can do until he formally takes charge end of the year and early 2013  in a staged process  I m optimistic he is someone the United States can deal with Lastly   Linsanity  creates a problem for Beijing  the New York Knicks Jeremy Lin having a Taiwanese background  as well as being a devout Christian  Chinese Central Television has apparently stopped showing Lin s games as quickly as it started showing them owing to the presence of Taiwanese flags  though CCT covered Taiwan s presidential election  where obviously Taiwan flags were everywhere  You can imagine how Lin is being covered on the island  He s leading every newscast on days the Knicks play North Korea  My this place has been quiet following the mourning period after the death of Kim Jong il and the elevation of his son   Great Successor   Kim Jong un  The transition  we re to assume  is going smoothly  but Kim has one primary challenge  How to feed his people  Some say the North faces a 700 000 ton grain shortage  which would mean 1 3 of the people starve  Kim needs to be able to deliver the food before he can go forward with his reform plan  whatever that is  But both the U S  and South Korea aren t in the food giving mood these days Russia  Just two more weeks before the March 4 presidential vote and the question remains  can Putin capture 50  and avoid a run off  He has zero opposition  Communist Party veteran Gennady Zyuganov will probably finish second but with no more than 10  of the vote  according to the polls  So there s no question Putin emerges the winner  eventually  it s just how long does he then remain in office  I m long on record as saying he ll be removed  More and more are coming around to my thinking It also needs to be said that Putin s anti American rhetoric ahead of the election is despicable  But then as one political analyst told the Washington Post the other day   Putin is choosing worse relations with the West to keep himself in power  Of course it s a KGB mentality  France  President Nicolas Sarkozy formally announced his campaign for reelection  with the first round of voting April 22  and then the top two vote getters squaring off May 6  March 16 is the deadline for qualifying  which pertains to the likes of National Front candidate Marine Le Pen  who at last word still hadn t qualified but it s assumed she eventually will  In the latest Ifop poll  Socialist Francois Hollande has seen his lead dwindle  30  to Sarkozy s 25   Le Pen is third at 17 5  and Centrist Francois Bayrou at 12 5  In a rather bizarre situation  German Chancellor Merkel is supporting Sarkozy  as Hollande has said that if he s elected  he ll want to renegotiate any EU treaties France is party to  especially as it pertains to the debt crisis  It s not clear Hollande would even be able to do this Sarkozy will campaign on being tough on immigration and welfare  He is not helped by a general mood across Europe that has led to regime change in Spain  the U K   Ireland  Portugal and Hungary Germany  Chancellor Merkel was forced to cancel a visit to Italy on Friday because of a scandal involving President Christian Wulff  a home loan deal that included bullying a paper not to run the story  Wulff  a member of Merkel s center right Christian Democrat party  then resigned While the president is mostly a figurehead  he is also supposed to be a moral compass for the nation  yet he d become a laughingstock for the press  The scandal comes at an obviously bad time for Merkel and will hurt her in state elections later this year Britain  Prime Minister David Cameron traveled to Edinburgh to try and get the Scots to abandon their idea of independence  but talks went badly  Alex Salmond  Scotland s First Minister  wants a referendum on independence in 2014  Cameron wants one sooner  gambling it would be defeated Venezuela  President Hugo Chavez will have a challenger in the October election  Henrique Capriles  a 39 year old who handily won a primary last Sunday   This is a country in crisis   he said   If there was one message people all across Venezuela gave me  it was they are exhausted by confrontation and division  I ll be a president for Venezuelans of all colors  not just red ones   referring to the red shirts worn by Chavez supporters Capriles wants to retain Chavez s social programs  but run a less corrupt government and reduce crime  which has been soaring   19 400 murders last year compared to 8 000 in 2000   Capriles is looking to model his approach after former Brazilian President Luiz da Silva  who used welfare programs to reduce poverty and increase consumption  which  together with increased education opportunities  raised living standards Honduras  The descriptions of the prison fire in Comayagua are beyond horrible  In the world s deadliest such incident in a century  358 are confirmed dead  with many bodies found lying on top of each other  burned beyond recognition  Most of the victims had not even been charged with crimes yet There were only 12 guards on duty when the fire broke out  with 856 prisoners packed into barracks built to accommodate 400 ,2012-02-22,Brian

IL   Jan 19  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Business Services  Part 1  including ExlService Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ EXLS     Brink s Co     NYSE BCO     Heidrick   Struggles International  Inc    NASDAQ HSII     On Assignment  Inc     NYSE ASGN    and Robert Half International Inc    NYSE RHI    Industry  Business Services  Part 1Link  The economic backdrop exhibits signs of improvement with the rise in GDP  a better employment scenario  inflation approaching 2   easing of the U S  dollar and momentum gained by oil prices The outlook for business services sector moves in line with the broader economy  Significantly  the business friendly orientation of the current administration is widely expected to give the U S  economy a nudge of growth The business services sector includes companies that provide ancillary services to other industries in the market  Companies from this sector help other firms focus on their core competencies  helping them benefit from operating efficiencies  Many of these functions fall within otherwise ancillary areas for most companies    for example  payroll processing  staffing  marketing advertising and information technology  to name some of the major areas Gradual improvement in interest rate environment points toward improving economic conditions  The Fed has kept its promise of three rate hikes in 2017 and the interest rate now stands at 1 25 1 50   Retaining this optimism  outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen reiterated expectations for three rate increases in 2018 The Fed also provided an optimistic employment outlook  Fed officials expect the unemployment rate to be 3 9  for both 2018 and 2019 and 4  in 2020 President Trump has signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on Dec 22  2017  The tax reform policy  an overhaul of the tax code after 31 years  lowers the corporate tax burden to 21  from 35   This move is likely to act as an impetus Per the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   gross domestic product is estimated to increase in the upcoming quarters  GDP growth is now expected to accelerate 2 4  in 2018 and 2019  better than 2 3  in 2017  This favorable outlook for the U S  economy is a net positive for the business service sector as well  No doubt the Zacks Business Services sector has been a strong performer  gaining 20 9  in a year  outperforming the S P 500 index s 18 2  gain The intensely competitive business services sector must diligently work toward controlling costs and generating higher revenues in order to maintain profitability  Focus on functions and activities in line with core competence is a prerequisite in reaping the benefits of economies of scale  as well as improving competitive positioning Economic sensitivity aside  business service companies are quite conservatively managed  with a large number of players sharing excess cash with investors through dividends and share buybacks  Another attribute of the sector is its highly fragmented nature  with no single service provider enjoying market dominance  Per business reports  the top 50 companies of the sector contribute less than 25  to the sector s total revenue Stand Alone Zacks Sector  FavorableGiven the group s unique nature  Zacks has classified it as one of the 16 sectors  the S P s official GIC classification has only 11 sectors where business services are grouped within the  Industrials  sector   Notably  with about 3 8  of total market capitalization  the sector generated 3 1  of the total S P 500 income in 2017 This industry offers an array of services that include marketing  consulting  staffing  security  telecommunications  Internet services  logistics and waste handling  In its expanded sense  the U S  business services sector generates consolidated yearly revenues of about  620 billion  though many of these companies do not strictly fall within the generally accepted definition of the industry Within the Zacks Industry classification  we have divided the business world into 16 sectors comprising 60 industries at the medium  M level  and 265 industries at the expanded  X level   We rank all 265 X level industries in

this Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock has surpassed the industry in the past three months  Shares of Robert Half rallied 11 3  in the said time frame  in comparison with the   s growth of 10 8   Let s Delve DeepRobert Half s adjusted earnings of 65 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents  and grew 6 6  year over year  The bottom line excludes an estimated one time cash charge of about 27 cents per share on provision for income taxes associated with the recently implemented Tax Cuts and Jobs Act   TJCA   Well  this management had already projected such charges in a range of 27 31 cents a share  when it released updates of the recent tax reforms on its business operations in December 2017 Including the one time charges  earnings slumped 37 7  to 38 cents per share Robert Half s total revenues of  1 346 3 million advanced 6 4  year over year  and cruised ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 311 8 million  Moreover  the top line came toward the higher end of management s guided range  1 287  1 347 million Notably revenues were backed by broad based growth  with both staffing and Protiviti witnessing improved sales  while permanent placement division was the outperformer  Also  the company delivered higher sales across U S  and non U S regions  On a constant currency basis  revenues jumped nearly 5  year over year The company recorded gross profit of  553 1 million in the quarter  which grew 6 5  year over year  Further  the gross margin expanded by 10 basis points  bps  to 41 1   mainly due to lower staffing margins  Further  Robert Half reported operating income of  128 8 million  compared with the year ago period figure of  124 7 million  However  the operating margin contracted 30 bps to 9 6  Segment DetailsBased on the nature of services

shares available for buyback under the stock repurchase program Also  it paid a quarterly cash dividend of 24 cents per share for a total cash outlay of  30 million The Road Ahead  Q1 ForecastsManagement remains impressed with the broad based growth witnessed in the fourth quarter  Also  given the lower unemployment levels  the labor market remains tightened  This in turn leads to lack of talented personnel in some fields  which increases the demand for Robert Half s services  Notably  management gave an insight into the overall trends so far Temporary and consulting staffing revenues grew 3 3  in the first two weeks of January  somewhat affected by the recent East Coast storms  For the first three weeks of January  revenues from permanent placement division advanced 11 9

quarter 2018  The company expects revenues in the range of  1 335  1 395 million for the said quarter  In addition  it projects earnings in the range of 70 76 cents per share  Encouragingly  the mid

  Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  Jobless Claims Fall to 45 Year Low  5 PicksAmericans filing for unemployment benefits plunged to a 45 year low last week  indicating strong job growth  Job additions rose at a steady pace in January  and the record low unemployment rate and strong wage growth show that the labor market is in good shape  The year  in fact  is off to a sizzling start for job creation as several indices measuring employment trends moved north last month Staffing companies stand to gain as the labor market strengthens  while President Trump has also urged the country s top executives to step up hiring  In fact  one of his core campaign policies was to bring back millions of jobs for Americans Jobless Claims Tank to Lowest in 45 YearsJobless claims fell by 7 000 to 222 000 in the week ending Feb 17  This marked the second lowest level since the end of Great Recession of 2007 09  In fact  the four week moving average that evens out sharp fluctuations in weekly reports declined by 2 250 to 226 000 The average level of jobless claims continues to hover just over the 200 000 mark  which was last seen in the early 1970s  This is a clear sign that the labor market may strengthen in the near term  helping the economy roar back to life  After all  the lesser the number of people filing for unemployment benefits  the more Americans have jobs Upbeat Labor MarketMost firms continue to hire as the unemployment rate stayed at a 17 year low of 4 1  in January  according to the Labor Department  Non farm payrolls climbed by 200 000 jobs last month after rising 160 000 last December  This means the economy has now added jobs for 88 months in a row Employers have also hiked wages in order to retain and attract workers  Wage growth hit the fastest pace in January in more than eight and a half years  Average hourly wages increased 9 cents  or 0 3   to  26 74  This helped the average year on year hourly earnings to rise to 2 9   the highest since June 2009 Wages have been largely driven by the Republican tax cut policy and a rise in the minimum wage threshold in several states  Market pundits believe that the tax cut will boost wage growth as companies will use that extra money to give workers a raise  read more    Minimum wage  in the meantime  has already been raised in 18 states in January  which had a positive impact on 4 5 million workers  per the Economic Policy Institute  read more    Jobs Growth Index Shows No Signs of a SlowdownJobs growth is not showing signs of slowing down  per the Conference Board s Employment Trends Index  The index stands at 106 93 in January  up from 106 59 in December  When compared to the year ago level  the index jumped 5 4  Gad Levanon  Chief Economist  at the Conference Board said that  the Employment Trends Index continues its solid path upwards and shows no sign of slowing down   He added that  a strong US economy provides additional tailwinds to employment growth  bringing down the unemployment rate even further and encouraging more men and women to join the labor force  The nation s GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 6  in the final three months of 2017 following gains in the previous two quarters of more than 3   per the  advance  estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis  This marked the economy s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid 2009  The economy also expanded at a rate of 2 3  for all of 2017 following a meager 1 5  increase in 2016  The growth topped the 2 2  average of the last eight and a half year long recovery  read more    The manufacturing sector  in the meantime  is solid and the service sector is improving  To meet such growth  hiring is accelerating  In fact  service sector is the bellwether of the U S  economy  employing around eight out of 10 workers  A sub index of the ISM services index that shows current staffing and future hiring plans touched an all time high of 61 6 in January from 56 3 in the prior month 5 Top Staffing Stocks to Buy NowThe latest numbers bode well for staffing companies  The

2444,223959,ASGN,On Assignment  ASGN  Hits A 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of On Assignment  Inc   NYSE ASGN    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 7 82  over the past month  ASGN hit a new 52 week high of  80 02 in the previous session  On Assignment has gained 24 48  since the start of the year compared to the 4 89  move for the Business Services sector and the 4 99  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a fantastic record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on February 14  2018  On Assignment reported EPS of  0 85 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 76 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0 01  
For the current fiscal year  On Assignment is expected to post earnings of  3 76 per share on  2 81 billion in revenues  This represents a 23 28  change in EPS on a 6 91  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  4 13 per share on  2 98 billion in revenues  This represents changes of 9 66  and 6 3   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
On Assignment may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for ASGN  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
On Assignment  has a Value Score of D  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 21 26x current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 18 83x versus its peer group s average of 14 07x  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 13  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective On Assignment  Inc  Price and Consensus
    Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  On Assignment currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if On Assignment passes the test  Thus  it seems as though ASGN shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does On Assignment Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of On Assignment have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including     and   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 9 43  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for ASGN  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2018-03-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/on-assignment-asgn-hits-a-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200296411,200296411

2446,223961,ASGN,Weekly Jobless Claims Continue To Decline  5 Staffing Picks,opinion,U S  Labor Department s weekly jobless claims data for the week ended Mar 10 provides fresh evidence that the labor market is in strong shape  Since the beginning of this year  the U S  labor market remains firm buoyed by strong job additions and record low unemployment level  Modest wage growth assuaged employer s fears over rising inflation and interest rate hikes Strong non farm payrolls data for February along with continuing decline in the weekly jobless claim indicates that employers will continue to recruit more employees  U S  employers are on a hiring mode as both blue collar and white collar industries hiring as the economy remains remarkably strong  Consequently  it makes sense to invest in good staffing stocks to enrich portfolio Jobless Claims Continues to SlipOn Mar 15  the U S  Labor Department data revealed that weekly jobless claims decreased 4 000 to a seasonally adjusted 226 000 for the week ended Mar 10  This was the 158th consecutive week that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits remained below the 300 000 threshold  The continued decline in weekly jobless claims data reflects longest trend since 1970 The four week moving average of initial claims dropped 750 to 221 500 for the week ended Mar 10  This metric is considered a better measure of labor market trends as it eliminates weekly fluctuations  Likewise  the four week moving average of continuing claims declined 17 250 to 1 89 million  This was the lowest level witnessed since November 2017 On Mar 12  the U S  Labor Department Data revealed that the economy added 313 000 jobs in February 2018  exceeding the consensus estimate of 208 000  Moreover  the total labor force increased by 806 000 and now stands slightly below 162 million  This is the highest since September 2003   Read   This reflects a robust U S  labor market which is operating at its near full employment level currently Strong Recruitment TrendMost of the traditionally blue collar and white collar industries hired last month  Blue collar industries are mostly led by construction companies

2447,223962,ASGN,Weekly Jobless Claims Plunge To 45 Year Low  5 Staffing Picks,opinion,U S  Labor Department s weekly jobless claims data for the week ended Mar 24 provides fresh evidence that the labor market remains robust  In fact  the metric dropped to its lowest level since January 1973  The U S  labor market is a picture of health at the moment fueled by strong job additions and record low unemployment Meanwhile  the Fed recently revised 2018 GDP projection to 2 7  from earlier estimate of 2 5   highlighting the strong fundamentals of the economy   For the month of February  U S  Commerce Department data displayed robust business spending at US factories for expensive durable items such as machinery and vehicles Strong business confidence is likely to aid the enterprises in recruiting more manpower  Consequently  good staffing stocks are lucrative investment options at the moment Jobless Claims Continue to DeclineOn Mar 29  the U S  Labor Department data revealed that weekly jobless claims decreased 12 000 to a seasonally adjusted 215 000 for the week ended Mar 24  This was better than the consensus estimate of 228 000 and the lowest level experienced in 45 years This was the 158th consecutive week that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits remained below the 300 000 threshold  The continued decline in weekly jobless claims data exhibits its longest trend since 1970 The four week moving average of initial claims dropped 500 to 224 500 for the week ended Mar 24  This metric is considered a better measure of labor market trends as it eliminates weekly fluctuations  Likewise  the four week moving average of continuing claims declined 12 750 to 1 86 million  This was the lowest level witnessed since November 2017 Labor Market to Remain SolidCurrently  the U S  unemployment rate is around 4 1   itself a 17 year low  The Fed s latest projection for the labor market has added a little extra sweetness to the economic scenario  Also  the central bank reduced its 2018 unemployment rate estimate to 3 8  in March 2018 from the earlier estimate of 3 9  released in December 2017 Also  the unemployment rate is now projected to remain stable at 3 6  in 2019 and 2020 better than the central bank s earlier projection of 3 9  and 4   respectively  This indicates that the U S  labor market will maintain near full employment levels over 2018 2020   Read More   How to Identify the Potential Winners An almost saturated labor market is likely to spur wage growth in the second quarter of 2018  This in turn will result in an increase in consumer spending  which slowed down since the beginning of 2018  Consumer spending accounts for about 70  of U S  economic activity   Consequently  higher consumer spending will result in to higher growth in GDP At this stage  adding staffing stocks to your portfolio makes good sense  However  picking winning stocks can be a difficult task This is where our  comes in handy  Here V

22800,244315,ASGN,Wall Street Cheers Up As Fears Subside  5 Top Gainers,opinion,Subdued inflation mollified concerns that the Federal Reserve might speed up rate hikes this year  In the wake of this  investors  appetite for riskier assets  including tech and energy  has increased  pushing major bourses higher  In turn  market volatility continued to ebb Thus  picking stocks from desirable sectors seems prudent  And why not  Buffet s bet on Apple Inc    NASDAQ AAPL   and Facebook  Inc  s   NASDAQ FB   shrugging off of the data fiasco have boosted investor confidence  Meanwhile  energy shares have shifted to high gear as oil touched its highest level since November 2014 Wall Street Rallies  Here s WhyThe Dow Jones added nearly 200 points on May 10 to notch its longest string of advances   six straight days   since Feb 16  And if the blue chip index can gain on May 11  it will mark its longest winning streak since Oct 5  2017  The broader S P 500 finished in the green  with the tech heavy Nasdaq registering its fifth successive day of gains Stocks scaled higher as the tumultuous market phase seems to have faded   at least for the time being  Softer inflation numbers helped allay fears of faster interest rate hikes this year  while concerns about a US China trade war have somewhat subsided Tepid Inflation Data  Trade War Fears SubsideRising inflation played spoilsport at the beginning of the year  It compelled the Fed to quicken its monetary policy instead of raising rates at a gradual pace  aggravating market fears  But  softer than expected rise in consumer prices in the month of April cooled inflation fears  The Consumer Price Index  CPI  rose 0 2  in April from the prior month  per the Labor Department  Market pundits  however  expects the CPI to tick up to 0 3  Fears about a full blown trade war between the two largest economies  the United States and China  have been doing the rounds for quite some time  This in turn could deal a massive blow to the global economy  However  China is expected to import more American goods as the two sides are looking for means to avert an all out trade war Volatility EbbWith investors  anxiety seems to have eased  the Cboe Volatility Index  VIX    Wall Street s so called  fear gauge    fell for the sixth straight session  down 2 4  to 13 09 on May 10  Now  the index is likely to slip to its lowest close since Jan 26 This indicated that the index has almost erased the huge spike witnessed in early February  During that time period  concerns over inflation saw the index more than double in a single session  Moreover  the VIX s average level is 20  Thus  the current level is extremely low compared to historical standards Appetite for Riskier Assets RisesWith fears taking a back seat  investors are looking to bet on riskier assets  Technology and Internet stocks regained their crown as the most sought after stocks  Bellwethers Apple and Facebook  to name a few  saw their shares move north  The recent

featured in the blog include ASGN Inc    NYSE ASGN    DXC Technology Company   NYSE DXC    Seagate Technology plc   NASDAQ STX    Evolution Petroleum Corp    NYSE EPM   and Oasis Midstream Partners LP   NYSE OMP   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog Wall Street Cheers as Fears Subside  5 Top GainersSubdued inflation mollified concerns that the Federal Reserve might speed up rate hikes this year  In the wake of this  investors  appetite for riskier assets  including tech and energy  has increased  pushing major bourses higher  In turn  market volatility continued to ebb Thus  picking stocks from desirable sectors seems prudent  And why not  Buffet s bet on Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and Facebook s shrugging off of the data fiasco have boosted investor confidence  Meanwhile  energy shares have shifted to high gear as oil touched its highest level since November 2014 Wall Street Rallies  Here s WhyThe Dow Jones added nearly 200 points on May 10 to notch its longest string of advances   six straight days   since Feb 16  And if the blue chip index can gain on May 11  it will mark its longest winning streak since Oct 5  2017  The broader S P 500 finished in the green  with the tech heavy Nasdaq registering its fifth successive day of gains Stocks scaled higher as the tumultuous market phase seems to have faded   at least for the time being  Softer inflation numbers helped allay fears of faster interest rate hikes this year  while concerns about a US China trade war have somewhat subsided Tepid Inflation Data  Trade War Fears SubsideRising inflation played spoilsport at the beginning of the year  It compelled the Fed to quicken its monetary policy instead of raising rates at a gradual pace  aggravating market fears  But  softer than expected rise in consumer prices in the month of April cooled inflation fears  The Consumer Price Index  CPI  rose 0 2  in April from the prior month  per the Labor Department  Market pundits  however  expects the CPI to tick up to 0 3  Fears about a full blown trade war between the two largest economies  the United States and China  have been doing the rounds for quite some time  This in turn could deal a massive blow to the global economy  However  China is expected to import more American goods as the two sides are looking for means to avert an all out trade war Volatility EbbWith investors  anxiety seems to have eased  the Cboe Volatility Index  VIX    Wall Street s so called  fear gauge    fell for the sixth straight session  down 2 4  to 13 09 on May 10  Now  the index is likely to slip to its lowest close since Jan 26 This indicated that the index has almost erased the huge spike witnessed in early February  During that time period  concerns over inflation saw the index more than double in a single session  Moreover  the VIX s average level is 20  Thus  the current level is extremely low compared to historical standards Appetite for Riskier Assets RisesWith fears taking a back seat  investors are looking to bet on riskier assets  Technology and Internet stocks regained their crown as the most sought after stocks  Bellwethers Apple and Facebook  NASDAQ FB   to name a few  saw their shares move north  The recent tax cut has already given the much needed windfall to tech  while cloud computing  artificial intelligence and big data remain growth areas  read more    One of the least popular sectors last year  energy  is now hogging the limelight  It s kind of a comeback for them as oil prices springs above the  71 a barrel  Iran sanctions have majorly kept oil prices at a three and a half year peak  A cut in global oil output initiated by the OPEC and other major oil producers  including Russia  has helped prices more than double from the collapse in early 2016  Venezuela s production woes also drove the rally  read more    Rosy Earnings Picture Both tech and energy sectors are also witnessing solid first quarter performance  For the quarter as a whole  total tech earnings are expected to be up 28 5  on 12 6  higher revenues The energy sector s earnings are expected to grow 76  from the same period

22803,244318,ASGN,CACI International  CACI  Soars To A 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of CACI International   NYSE CACI    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 13 6  over the past month  CACI hit a new 52 week high of  167 80 in the previous session  CACI International has gained 26 6  since the start of the year compared to the 5 6  move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 11 4  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on May 2  2018  CACI International reported EPS of  2 33 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 8 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0 22  
For the current fiscal year  CACI International is expected to post earnings of  11 55 per share on  4 47 billion in revenues  This represents a 76 88  change in EPS on a 2 73  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  8 93 per share on  4 63 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of  22 61  and 3 52   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
CACI International may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for CACI  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
CACI International has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 14 5X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 17 1X versus its peer group s average of 17 4X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 45  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective CACI International  Inc  Price and Consensus   Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  CACI International currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if CACI International meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though CACI shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does CACI International Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of CACI International have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including Syntel   NASDAQ SYNT    On Assignment   NYSE ASGN    and SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION   NYSE SAIC    all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 37  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for CACI  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2018-05-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/caci-international-caci-soars-to-a-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200320878,200320878
