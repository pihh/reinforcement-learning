7427,228942,TEX,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  ANI Pharmaceuticals  Avianca  Avid  Terex And Encore Wire,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  April 5  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  ANI Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ANIP    Avianca Holdings S A    NYSE AVH    Avid Technology  Inc    NASDAQ AVID    Terex Corporation   NYSE TEX   and Encore Wire Corporation   NASDAQ WIRE   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog Fears of Far Reaching Economic Slowdown Diminish  5 PicksThe U S  economy did slow down sharply toward the end of 2018 and in early 2019  However  as spring approaches  signs of growth have started to emerge  While U S  factory activity regained lost ground in March  the service industry expanded steadily  Construction business too rebounded in early 2019 after a tough spell toward the end of 2018 Most importantly  encouraging service sector figures from Europe and China along with increasing optimism in U S  China trade negotiations ebbed fears of a global economic downturn  Thus  it s time to invest in solid stocks that are likely to make the most of the bullish economic situation U S  Economy is in Sound ShapeBoth the Institute of Supply Management  ISM  surveys of manufacturing and service industry reported steady growth in March  American manufacturing rebounded last month after taking a beating in the prior month  According to the ISM  its manufacturing index came in at 55 3  last month from 54 2  in February However  the latest reading can be termed as normal growth rather than unusually strong growth  After all  the 12 month average is still at the lowest since May 2017  Nonetheless  employment rebounded strongly  indicating that the manufacturing index s comeback has been primarily backed by domestically focused activities  At the same time  16 of the 18 U S  manufacturing industries surveyed by ISM expanded in March Service oriented companies like banks  retailers and tech service providers to name a few expanded last month at the slowest pace in 19 months but most of the top executives remained optimistic about the U S  economy  And why not  Even though the ISM non manufacturing index slipped to 56 1  last month from February s 59 7   it still remains above the 55  mark  which is considered exceptional  To top it  16 out of the 18 service industries tracked by ISM did expand  Chief U S  economist Jim O Sullivan of High Frequency Economics chipped in and said that the  data are consistent with moderate rather than dramatic slowing in the economy  Builders  by the way  boosted construction in February for the third month in a row  a tell tale sign that the U S  economy is in the pink  Per the Census Bureau  construction outlays increased 1  in February  And let us not forget that such outlays had increased 2 5  in January  In fact  the pace of construction activities in the first two months of this year turned out to be the strongest since last summer Though the economic picture in the United States is hunky dory  what about the global economy  After all  a global economic slowdown will have serious implications on the state of the U S  economy as well  Growth in Eurozone s service sector came in better than expected in March  with Germany  Spain and Ireland leading the way  Also  China s service sector hit the fastest pace in 14 months last month Service Sector Data from Europe   China PromisingFor the single currency bloc  the services purchasing managers  index  PMI  increased to 53 3 in March  up from 52 8 in February  and touched the highest level since November 2018  Remember  any reading above 50 indicates growth  This reading  by the by  surpasses analyst s expectations of a score of 52 7  which undoubtedly gives you a comprehensive picture about the health of the Eurozone economy Coming to China  the Caixin Chinese services business activity index rose to 54 4 in March from 51 1 in February  recording the fastest rise since January 2018  Beijing had introduced a series of measures including cutting taxes to help support its economy  And the latest service sector reading shows that such measures have paid off   Progress on U S  China Trade TalksOn the political side  both U S  and Chinese trade officials have begun talks to bring an end to their prolonged trade dispute  Myron Brilliant  executive vice president of international affairs at the U S  Chamber of Commerce recently said that  ninety percent of the deal is done  but the last 10  is the hardest part  it s the trickiest part and it will require trade offs on both sides  Nonetheless  resolving most of the differences is a reassuring sign for the global economy  Needless to say  these economies imposed billions of dollars of tariffs on each other s goods over the past year  battering equity markets  souring business and consumer sentiment as well as hampering economic growth 5 Solid BetsOptimism about trade negotiations and positive economic numbers from the United States  Europe and China have reduced concerns of an across the board economic slowdown  Hence  it will be prudent to invest in five of the best fundamentally solid stocks that can make the most of this favorable economic scenario Such stocks have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a VGM Score of A  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted

7428,228943,TEX,Is Terex  TEX  A Profitable Pick For Value Investors Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Terex Corporation   NYSE TEX   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Terex has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 27  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 16  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Terex s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Manufacturing  Construction and Mining industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 12 59  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Terex has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 8 72  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Terex in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Terex has a P S ratio of about 0 47  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 31x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Terex currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Terex a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though TEX might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of D  This gives TEX a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been upbeat  The current year has seen eight upward revisions with no downward movement in the past sixty days  For the next year  the estimate has seen six upward revisions in the same time period with no movement in the opposite direction This has had an impact on the consensus estimate as the current year consensus estimate has increased 9 7  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has risen 5 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Terex Corporation Price and Consensus   This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment  and its Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term Bottom LineTerex is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 17  of more than 250 industries  and Zacks Rank 1 boosts our confidence  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below  We believe  satisfactory past industry performance and a good Zacks rank signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Terex Today

7432,228947,TEX,5 Best GARP Stocks With Discounted PEG,opinion,With smart investment becoming the buzzword in today s investment world  millennials are more inclined toward hybrid investment patterns rather than traditional pure play theories like value or growth The logic behind this is the effectiveness of a mixed investment strategy as value or growth investing approaches come with their own share of pitfalls  A pure play value investor misses the chance of betting on stocks that have bright long term prospects  The same way  growth investors often end up investing in expensive stocks  In other words  to make a long term investment more effective  the principles of both value and growth strategies need to be combined The quest for a mixed investment strategy led to the introduction of the GARP  growth at a reasonable price  approach  What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential  Investopedia  One of the fundamental metrics for finding GARP is the price earnings growth ratio  PEG   Although it is categorized under value investing  this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings  Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P E ratio with future earnings growth rate While P E alone only gives the idea of stocks  which are trading at a discount  PEG while adding the GROWTH element to it  helps to find those stocks that have solid future potential A lower PEG ratio  preferably less than 1  is always better for GARP investors Say for example  if a stock s P E ratio is 10 and expected long term growth rate is 15   the company s PEG will come down to 0 66  a ratio which indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It does not consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP E Ratio  using F1  less than X Industry Median  For more accurate valuation purpose Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  or  2 have a proven history of success  Market Capitalization greater than  1 Billion  This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity  Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than 5   Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism  suggesting further bullishness Value Score of less than or equal to B Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3  Hold  offer

the  s growth of 1 5  Let us see how things are shaping up for Illinois Tool this quarter  Factors to Affect Q2 ResultsIllinois Tool s results can be influenced by several company specific matters  Of all  the company s Enterprise Strategy   including Business Structure Simplification  Portfolio Management and Strategic Sourcing initiatives   as well as its well diversified business structure  a solid product portfolio and share buyback activities will be boons  These tailwinds supported results in the first quarter and must have had positive impacts in the second quarter of 2019 as well On the flip side  certain headwinds  which adversely impacted first quarter 2019 results  might be seen as problems for the second quarter  A high tax rate  woes arising from unfavorable movements in foreign currencies  weakness in auto production in China and Europe  restructuring activities  and softness in organic sales might be prime troubling factors Of the above mentioned headwinds  high tax rates are predicted to adversely influence results in the first half more than the second half of the year  Notably  earnings were lowered by 3 cents in the first quarter due to high tax rate  Also  forex woes are expected to lower second quarter earnings by 6 cents while restructuring activities will have a dilutive impact of 9 cents In addition to these company specific factors  we believe that industrial machinery companies are gaining from infrastructure investments  use of sophisticated technologies in manufacturing process  favorable policy changes in the country  growing use of e retail  and new construction and remodeling activities  However  slower pace of growth in industrial production might be concerning The Food Equipment segment might benefit from strengthening demand and

surprise in the first quarter of 2019 was  1 87   The Automotive OEM segment s results might be influenced by the company s program wins and solid product offerings  However  prevailing softness in

of 0 2  from the sequential figure Earnings WhispersOur proven model provides some idea about the stocks that are about to release their earnings results  Per the model  a stock needs a combination of

11313,232828,TEX,China s Zoomlion sweetens offer for U S  crane maker Terex  sources,news,"By Greg Roumeliotis  Reuters    China s Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science   Technology Co Ltd  000157 SZ  has raised its bid for U S  crane maker  Terex Corp   N TEX   according to people familiar with the matter  as it challenges Terex s merger with Finland s  Konecranes   HE KCR1V   Zoomlion s latest move shows corporate China s determination to acquire U S  assets and expand its global footprint  Another Chinese company  Anbang Insurance Group Co  is trying to disrupt hotel operator Marriott International Inc s  O MAR  merger with peer  Starwood Hotels   N HOT   Zoomlion s main stumbling block in its negotiations with Terex is the price  rather than concerns that the United States could block the deal because of Terex s ties to the U S  military and presence in U S  ports  the people familiar with the matter said this week  Zoomlion has increased its offer to more than  3 4 billion by adding a special dividend for Terex shareholders of  1 per share to its previous  30 per share cash offer  the people said  Terex has responded by asking for  32 75 per share in cash to terminate its merger agreement with Konecranes and agree to sell itself to Zoomlion  the sources said  The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential  Terex shares jumped as much as 12 percent on the news and were trading up 7 3 percent at  23 38 in New York on Tuesday  Terex has argued privately that the synergies with Konecranes in the material handling and port systems businesses of the two companies mean Terex is worth more in the long term than what Zoomlion has offered  Reuters reported last month  In response to this  Zoomlion has also discussed offering Terex shareholders some type of security that would allow them to benefit from any upside in the potential deal  as opposed to completely cashing out  the sources said  Among the ideas that Zoomlion suggested are so called contingent value rights  that would entitle Terex shareholders to specific payments or other benefits if the combined company s shares or financial performance met certain targets  or a public stub  which would allow Terex shareholders to retain some equity  the people said   The sources said that Terex  however  has rejected these ideas as too complicated  and this prompted Zoomlion to come back with its increased cash offer of  31 per share  Terex has also held conversations with some of its shareholders who have privately asked it to continue to negotiate a deal with Zoomlion  the people said   The sources added that among these shareholders is activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp  which in its most recent filing with U S  regulators revealed it had acquired a small stake in Terex in the fourth quarter of 2015  The discussions between Terex and Zoomlion have not advanced beyond price  the people said  Zoomlion s banks  including China Development Bank and the Export Import Bank of China  are waiting for Terex to provide the access they require for their due diligence in order to finalize their financing commitments  the same sources said  The sources said there is no certainty that Terex and Zoomlion will be able to bridge their price differences and agree to a deal  Terex and Zoomlion declined to comment  Konecranes  Elliott  China Development Bank and the Export Import Bank of China did not immediately respond to requests for comment  WEAK MARKET FOR CRANES The battle for Terex coincides with weak demand in the market for cranes  driven by low oil and gas prices and foreign exchange volatility  Terex reported 2015 fourth quarter income from continuing operations of  14 6 million on net sales of  1 6 billion  versus income from continuing operations of  79 9 million on net sales of  1 8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014  Konecranes has offered 0 8 of its shares for each Terex share  It has argued that the two companies can face the downturn in their cyclical industry more effectively if they join forces  and that the shareholders of the combined companies will reap substantial profits in an upturn  Westport  Connecticut based Terex has 97 so called priority rated contracts with the U S  government that could attract scrutiny from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS   It also provides mobile harbor cranes in ports that are seen as a critical part of U S  infrastructure  However  Terex is not treating CFIUS as an issue that would preclude any deal with Zoomlion  The value of Terex s priority rated government contracts is small and not material to Terex s business  Reuters reported in January  The company s ports business in North America is also small  with its biggest contract being a  75 million order for automated equipment at the Long Beach port in California  Zoomlion is a publicly listed company  with the Chinese province of Hunan as its biggest shareholder with a roughly 16 percent share  It is led by researcher turned entrepreneur Chunxin Zhan  who founded Zoomlion in 1992 with seven other partners with a loan of 500 000 yuan   77 000   Zoomlion now has a market value of 31 8 billion yuan   4 9 billion   It has acquired significant stakes in six other companies in five countries over the last two decades  and is now present in more than 80 countries

11315,232830,TEX,U S  companies skeptical of corporate China s advances,news,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Mike Stone  Reuters    Chinese life sciences entrepreneur Wei Zhou submitted a  1 5 billion bid for U S  gene testing company Affymetrix last month   topping a  1 3 billion agreed acquisition by Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc  N TMO   A few days later  he got an unusual deadline  Affymetrix s CEO Frank Witney called Zhou  a former Affymetrix executive who had partnered with Shanghai government backed investment firm SummitView Capital on his offer  Witney gave him five days to put the full purchase price and the breakup fee that would be owed Thermo Fisher in an escrow account  Suitors of U S  companies don t typically face such demands  But Affymetrix s board of directors decided that  because Zhou s consortium had no significant U S  assets  the company would have little recourse if the deal fell through  Zhou s investment bankers responded that only the consortium s break up fee of  100 million could be escrowed  and that would take weeks  Affymetrix decided to stick with Thermo Fisher  The deliberations  described in regulatory filings  underscore the challenges many Chinese buyers face in convincing U S  companies to make a deal  especially when competing against a U S  company  Traditionally  the biggest hurdle has been the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS   a government panel that scrutinizes deals for national security threats  But as Chinese acquisitions picked up this year  U S  dealmakers also are paying attention to financing and regulatory risk from China  The biggest illustration of that risk was China based Anbang Insurance Group Co s surprise withdrawal last month of its  14 billion bid for  Starwood Hotels    Resorts Worldwide Inc  N HOT   which had trumped a rival offer from Marriott International Inc  O MAR   U S  companies want to make sure that Chinese suitors have approval of key Chinese agencies  such as the ministry of commerce  MOFCOM   and that financing is reliable   If the buyer faces uncertainty over their financing or approval from MOFCOM  their bid won t be competitive without a substantial reverse break up fee   said Robert Profusek  head of mergers and acquisitions at law firm Jones Day   When Chinese aviation and shipping conglomerate HNA Group clinched a deal in February to buy U S  electronics distributor  Ingram Micro Inc   N IM  for about  6 billion  it agreed to deposit  400 million in an escrow account payable to Ingram Micro should the deal fail to receive regulatory or antitrust approval  This  reverse termination  fee of 6 6 percent of the deal s value illustrates the higher reassurance demands for Chinese buyers  By comparison  U S  acquirers typically offer about 3 percent  COMPETING OFFERS When Chinese suitors attempt to acquire U S  companies that have competing offers  it can be difficult to get them to abandon a pending agreement  For example  Chinese crane maker  Zoomlion Heavy Industry  Science and Technology Co  HK 1157  has spent six months trying to convince U S  peer  Terex Corp   N TEX  to abandon its merger agreement with Finland s  Konecranes   HE KCR1V  for its bid  which now exceeds  3 4 billion  Still  there is a logic to moving in on pending deals  dealmakers say  Some Chinese buyers  lacking the resources and confidence to make their own offers  piggyback on diligence performed by others   When negotiating in a less competitive environment  Chinese companies have driven hard bargains  Richard Handler  CEO of investment bank Jefferies LLC  which has advised 10 U S  companies in sales to Chinese buyers totaling  6 billion  said in an interview his investment bankers and clients have found Chinese buyers to be  tough negotiators   When a Chinese consortium led by ink cartridge chip maker Apex Technology Co Ltd reached a deal last week to buy Lexmark International Inc  N LXK  for  3 6 billion  it secured it with a termination fee of  150 million   4 percent of the deal s value   through a letter of credit from the New York branch of Bank of China  rather than an escrow  Lexmark had been exploring a sale for more than six months and was unhappy with previous acquisition offers  said sources close to the company who spoke on condition of anonymity  So  it was in a weaker negotiating position than U S  companies demanding full escrow  There is little evidence Chinese acquirers are paying more on average  Thomson Reuters has tracked 66 deals involving U S  acquirers and buyers this year  The average ratio of deal value to 12 month earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization on those deals was 11 3  For six Chinese purchases  it was 9 9  It can be easier for private equity firms than publicly traded companies to make deals with Chinese buyers because they don t face the threat of shareholder lawsuits if things go wrong  
Some private equity firms have sought to take advantage by acting as a  bridge  between public U S  companies and Chinese acquirers  Anbang  for example  agreed to acquire Strategic Hotels   Resorts Inc from Blackstone Group LP  N BX  for about  6 5 billion in March  three months after Blackstone took it private for  6 billion ",2016-04-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-companies-skeptical-of-corporate-china's-advances-398148,398148

11348,232863,TEX,UPDATE 3 Deere outlook overshadows Q3 beat  shares fall,news,"  Fiscal Q3 better than expected
   Full year forecast implies disappointing Q4
   Shares down in early trading
  Adds details on outlook  background  updates shares 
 By James B  Kelleher
 CHICAGO  Aug 19  Reuters    Deere   Co reported a
higher than expected third quarter profit as improved
profitability in its core agriculture machinery business helped
to offset weakness in construction and forestry equipment 
 But the company said it expected to barely break even in
the current quarter  sending its shares down more than 4
percent in early trading 
 The world s largest maker of tractors and harvesters  which
is cutting production in anticipation of lower demand next
year  reported a third quarter profit of  420 million  or 99
cents a share  down from  575 2 million  or  1 32 a share  last
year  Sales fell 24 percent to  5 89 billion 
 Analysts  on average  had expected the company to report a
profit of 56 cents per share on sales of  5 27 billion 
 Analyst Eli Lustgarten of Longbow Research called the
results  a clean beat   although 20 cents of the earnings came
from nonoperating items  including a lower tax rate 
 Moline  Illinois based Deere reiterated its forecast for a
full year net profit of  approximately  1 1 billion  
 Since Deere has already reported earnings of  1 1 billion
for the first nine months of the year  the guidance implied a
break even or possibly even a marginally unprofitable fiscal
fourth quarter 
  They re burying the fourth quarter with these production
cuts   Lustgarten said   And so their guidance is for a
marginally break even quarter  
 Analysts had expected Deere to report a fourth quarter
profit of 33 cents a share  according to Reuters Estimates 
 Deere also cut its forecast for corn prices for the
2009 2010 crop year to  3 40 a bushel  down from a previous
forecast of  3 80  That s up from its current price of about
 3 12 a bushel but down 59 percent from the record highs it
touched last summer 
 Since farm equipment purchases are highly correlated with
crop prices and the cash receipts they represent  that was
likely to translate into less demand for the tractors and
harvesters produced by Deere and its top rivals  Fiat Spa
subsidiary CNH Global NV and Agco Corp 
 With demand from farmers easing  that puts added pressure
on Deere s construction and forestry unit  which competes with
Caterpillar Inc  Komatsu Ltd and Terex Corp  and has seen
demand drop sharply as a result of the worldwide downturn in
building 
 Deere shares fell about 4 3 percent  or  1 96  to  43 13 in
early New York Stock Exchange trading

110986,332501,TEX,ISM Manufacturing Index Rebounds From 2 Year Low  5 Top Picks,opinion,U S  manufacturing registered a strong rebound in March from its lowest point in two years  Orders  hiring and production picked up after two particularly dismal months  Additionally  construction spending hit its highest level in nine months in February Meanwhile  retail sales and IHS Markit index numbers for February disappointed  But manufacturing and construction spending numbers are forcing economists and market watchers to reassess their position on the U S  economy  Many now believe that the ongoing expansion is unlikely to end any time soon A near term solution to the U S  China trade dispute  which now looks increasingly likely  would only improve the situation  Under such circumstances  it makes good sense to invest in select manufacturing stocks Multiple Metrics Show ImprovementThe ISM manufacturing index increased from February s reading of 54 2  by 1 1  to hit 55 3  in March  In February  the index had plummeted to its lowest level since November 2016  The March reading is also higher than the estimated level of 54 5  The new orders index increased by 1 9  from February s level of 55 5  to hit 57 4   Meanwhile  the production index increased from 54 8  by 1  to touch 55 8   Additionally  the prices index increased by 4 9  to 54 3   clearly indicating a hike in input prices for the first time since December 2018 Notably  the metric for employment increased by 5 2  to hit 57 5   emerging as the largest contributor to the improvement in the reading witnessed in March  This was the largest increase in three years  bringing an end to three consecutive months of declines Construction Spending  Uptick in China Manufacturing Raise OptimismMeanwhile  construction spending increased 1  to hit a nine month high in February  This follows an upwardly revised increase of 2 5  in January and marks the third straight month of gains Improvements were witnessed in both private and public construction  raising optimism about the economy after a clutch of disappointing economic reports  The index also increased 1 1  year over year  negating the projection of a decline of 0 1  Optimism about the global economy also increased after a private survey indicated on Apr 1 that China s manufacturing activity had improved in March  The Caixin Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers  Index  PMI  increased from 49 9 in February to 50 8 in March  The expansion was the fastest pace witnessed in eight months The report comes on the heels of Apr 31 s official figures  which also indicate that China s manufacturing sector improved in March  The official Purchasing Managers  Index recovered from February s three year low of 49 2 to hit to 50 5 in March  This marks the first expansion in four months  Our ChoicesEconomists and market watchers believe that fresh ISM data on manufacturing indicates America s economic expansion is unlikely to end in the near term  Such a view is bolstered by February s bullish construction spending numbers Meanwhile  the latest manufacturing data out of China indicates that the corrective measures being taken by the Xi administration are proving to be effective  This also negates fears of a worldwide slowdown  especially at a time when a U S  China trade deal seems tantalizingly close Investing in domestic manufacturing stocks seems prudent at this time  We have narrowed down our search based on a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and other relevant metrics  You can see Sun Hydraulics Corporation   NASDAQ SNHY

110989,332504,TEX,Fears Of Far Reaching Economic Slowdown Diminish  5 Picks,opinion,The U S  economy did slow down sharply toward the end of 2018 and in early 2019  However  as spring approaches  signs of growth have started to emerge  While U S  factory activity regained lost ground in March  the service industry expanded steadily  Construction business too rebounded in early 2019 after a tough spell toward the end of 2018 Most importantly  encouraging service sector figures from Europe and China along with increasing optimism in U S  China trade negotiations ebbed fears of a global economic downturn  Thus  it s time to invest in solid stocks that are likely to make the most of the bullish economic situation U S  Economy is in Sound ShapeBoth the Institute of Supply Management  ISM  surveys of manufacturing and service industry reported steady growth in March  American manufacturing rebounded last month after taking a beating in the prior month  According to the ISM  its manufacturing index came in at 55 3  last month from 54 2  in February  However  the latest reading can be termed as normal growth rather than unusually strong growth  After all  the 12 month average is still at the lowest since May 2017  Nonetheless  employment rebounded strongly  indicating that the manufacturing index s comeback has been primarily backed by domestically focused activities  At the same time  16 of the 18 U S  manufacturing industries surveyed by ISM expanded in March Service oriented companies like banks  retailers and tech service providers to name a few expanded last month at the slowest pace in 19 months but most of the top executives remained optimistic about the U S  economy  And why not  Even though the ISM non manufacturing index slipped to 56 1  last month from February s 59 7   it still remains above the 55  mark  which is considered exceptional  To top it  16 out of the 18 service industries tracked by ISM did expand  Chief U S  economist Jim O Sullivan of High Frequency Economics chipped in and said that the  data are consistent with moderate rather than dramatic slowing in the economy  Builders  by the way  boosted construction in February for the third month in a row  a tell tale sign that the U S  economy is in the pink  Per the Census Bureau  construction outlays increased 1  in February  And let us not forget that such outlays had increased 2 5  in January  In fact  the pace of construction activities in the first two months of this year turned out to be the strongest since last summer Though the economic picture in the United States is hunky dory  what about the global economy  After all  a global economic slowdown will have serious implications on the state of the U S  economy as well  Growth in Eurozone s service sector

111014,332529,TEX,Terex  TEX  To Report Q4 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"Terex Corporation   NYSE TEX   is likely to beat on earnings in its to be reported fourth quarter 2018  The company also seems poised to deliver year over year improvement in both its top line  In the last reported quarter  the company s adjusted earnings per share rose 36  year over year while revenues improved 11   However the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts  Barring the last quarter  Terex has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the four trailing quarters  recording average positive surprise of 20 1   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Terex Corporation Price and EPS Surprise 
   Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Terex is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  courtesy of a perfect combination of the following two key ingredients  Earnings ESP  Terex has an  of  3 17   representing the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  While the Most Accurate Estimate is at 47 cents  the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 46 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   Zacks Rank  Terex carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Notably  stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3 alongside a positive ESP have significantly higher chances of beating estimates  Thus  the above combination raises the odds of a likely earnings surprise for this stock  Conversely  sell rated stocks   4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions  Factors at Play Terex s Aerial Work Platforms   AWP   segment  which generated approximately 52  of third quarter 2018 revenues  will gain from strong global markets  operational execution and innovative new products  The segment is in the early point of the growth cycle  both in North America and Western Europe  China and other developing markets are still in the early phase of adopting products  Macroeconomic fundamentals and customers feedback all hint toward a multi year growth period for the segment  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment sales is currently pegged at  499 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 that reflects year over year growth of 11   The segment is expected to report an operating income of  36 million  a year over year increase of 19    With strong markets and a significantly higher backlog than last year  the Material Processing segment is well poised for improved results in the to be reported quarter  Further  rising global demand for crushing and screening equipment stemming from economic growth  construction activity and aggregate consumption bodes well  The segment is likely to grow on the back of continued improvement in its Fuchs material handlers and broad line of environmental products in global markets  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the quarter to be reported is at  326 million  reflecting projected growth of 15  from the  283 million reported in the year ago quarter  The estimate for the segment s operating income is at  38 7 million  an improvement of 9  from fourth quarter 2017  The Cranes segment  that contributed 24  of third quarter 2018 revenues  will improve driven by fairly stable global cranes markets  Currently  oil prices are driving demand in North America and the Middle East  Sales of Demag all terrain cranes continue to improve on a global basis aided by successful new product introductions  The Utilities business remains a consistent performer in a relatively stable market environment and the tower crane business continues to perform well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment s sales for the December end quarter is  343 million  reflecting year over year improvement of 6   However  supply chain challenges and raw material inflation are likely to dent segment income in the quarter  Owing to the abovementioned factors  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment s income is at  0 1 million  a plunge of 93  from the prior year  For the seventh quarter in a row  Terex s backlog grew year over year in every segment on the third quarter 2018  Its total segment backlog surged 41  year over year in the to be reported quarter  Consequently  improving backlog  along with an enhanced global market and environment positions the company well for 2018  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales of  1 2 billion for the December end quarter indicates an increase of 13  from the prior year quarter  However  input cost inflation  unfavorable currency headwinds and abovementioned issues in the Crane segment will somewhat dent margins  Nevertheless  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Terex s earnings per share is pegged at 46 cents for fourth quarter 2018  a projected surge of 39  from the prior year quarter   Share Price Performance  Shares of the company have lost 28  compared with the 17  decline recorded by the   Stocks to Consider Here are some companies in the Zacks  sector that you may want to consider as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter  according to our model  HD Supply Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ HDS   has an Earnings ESP of  1 50  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see   Graphic Packaging Holding Company   NYSE GPK   has an Earnings ESP of  0 54  and a Zacks Rank  3  Plug Power  Inc    NASDAQ PLUG   has an Earnings ESP of  23 91

millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge   With battery prices plummeting and

111154,332669,TEX,Caterpillar Poised For A Better 2018 On Rising Mining Spend,opinion,Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT   seems positioned for an improved 2018 backed by its positive end markets namely construction  mining and energy as well as the benefits of substantive cost cutting undertaken over the past few years  A Turnaround Performance in 2017 Caterpillar reported year over year improvement in both the top and bottom line for the first time in 10 quarters in the first quarter of 2017  The company sustained the momentum in the rest of the quarters as well  aided by continued strength in the Asia Pacific region  improvement in the construction sector as well as its relentless focus on cutting costs  Retail sales growth entered the positive trajectory in March following an unprecedented stretch of declines for 51 months and has shown significant improvement ever since  Caterpillar finished the year with an impressive 160  improvement in earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 owing to improved end user demand across all regions and most end markets  Consequently  it can be said that 2017 was the comeback year for the mining and construction equipment behemoth  Its shares notched a 70  gain through the year  It remains to be seen whether the company can better or even repeat the feat in 2018  Retail Sales on an Upward Trajectory Caterpillar reported a rise of 34  in global retail sales for the three months ended January 2018  at levels last seen in August 2011  This was driven by improvement across all regions  Sales in Asia Pacific surged 51   The region has been a consistent contributor for the company since it posted the first positive reading in August 2016  Latin America registered growth of 49  in October and Europe  Africa and Middle East   EAME   sales were up 31   North America sales also went up 23   Within Machines  Resource Industries and Construction Industries reported positive gains for the seventh and 12th consecutive months  respectively  Resource Industries segment delivered an impressive 49  growth in December sales and sales growth in the Construction Industries segment went up 30   Sales in the Energy   Transportation segment rose 16   This upbeat numbers instill optimism for an improved performance through the rest of the year  2018 View Upbeat Strong sales momentum resulting from strong order rates  lean dealer inventories and an increasing backlog bode well for an improved 2018 performance  Given these factors  along with positive economic indicators globally and many of the company s end markets  Caterpillar initiated adjusted EPS guidance range of  8 25  9 25 for fiscal 2018  The mid point of the guidance range reflects 27  year over year growth  Resource Industries Likely to Lead Growth This Year While the Construction Industries is expected to grow in 2018  anticipated seasonality of sales in China will slow down growth in the latter part of the year  Most other APAC countries are expected to grow  attributed to investments in infrastructure  In North America  continued improvement in residential and non residential construction as well as revival in infrastructure demand will drive revenues  President Trump s plans of big spending in infrastructure would be a catalyst as major companies like Caterpillar and Deere   Company   NYSE DE   are expected to gain from the big spending in infrastructure  For the Energy   Transportation segment  sales into Oil and Gas applications are likely to increase in 2018  led by reciprocating engines for gas compression and well servicing activity in North America  Sales to Transportation sector will benefit from recent acquisitions in rail services  We believe this year  the Resource Industries segment is poised to be the catalyst  Global economic momentum and increasing commodity prices is restoring miners  profitability and they are resuming capital spending  This bodes well for the segment  Rebuild and aftermarket demand should continue as fleet utilization increases  Demand for new equipment also grows with an extension of existing mines  Caterpillar along with other players in the same like Terex Corporation   NYSE TEX   and Komatsu Ltd    OTC KMTUY   will benefit from these improving trends in mining  Further  the recently passed tax reform is likely to lead to higher spending for Caterpillar s customers

111155,332670,TEX,CAT Or DE  Which Industrial Stock To Bet On Post Earnings ,opinion,The fourth quarter verdict for the  sector is out  with all the S P 500 participants having reported their numbers  The sector s impressive 34 8  earnings growth made it one of the nine Zacks Sectors to deliver double digit growth in earnings  This momentum is expected to continue in 2018 as well  Per our projections  the Industrial Products sector s earnings are anticipated to register 23 7  growth in first quarter 2018 followed by 22 8  in the second quarter  17 7  in the third quarter and 15  in the fourth quarter   Read more    We note that the sector is currently placed at the top 13  out of the total 16 Zacks Sectors   To learn more visit      In this context  we narrow the focus on two industrial bigwigs  Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT   and Deere   Company   NYSE DE    Caterpillar  with a market capitalization of  91 8 billion  is the world s largest manufacturer of construction and mining equipment and also dabbles in agricultural equipment  Deere  with a market capitalization of  52 1 billion  is the one of the world s foremost producers of agricultural equipment as well as a leading manufacturer of construction  forestry  and commercial and consumer equipment  While Deere currently boasts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Caterpillar carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   We pit these two players against each other on certain metrics to see which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals  You can see   Price Performance  Over the last year  the two stocks under consideration have significantly outpaced S P 500 s performance of 21 4   While the Industrial Products sector has advanced 15 2   Caterpillar has soared 66 4   Meanwhile  Deere s shares have also performed better than the sector  with a price appreciation of 46 5   However  Deere s gain failed to match Caterpillar  Valuation The most appropriate ratio to evaluate these two industrials stocks is EV EBITDA  This metric is usually used to compare two stocks within the same industry or sector  It is superior to other metrics such as P E because it is not affected by the different capital structures of the two companies  Further  EV EBITDA does not include the impact of non cash expenses   Both Caterpillar and Deere are underpriced  with EV EBITDA ratios of 10 1 and 12 2  respectively  compared with the Industrial Products Sector s EV EBITDA ratio of 14 4  Clearly  Caterpillar is cheaper and scores on this front  Inventory Turnover Ratio Inventory turnover ratio evaluates the efficiency of an industrial company s manufacturing process  A high inventory turnover ratio ensures that the company is able to manage its inventory effectively to generate revenues and avoid wastage  This is one of the most important financial ratios  which is widely used by industrial companies to measure their ability to utilize their inventories   In the last year  the inventory turnover ratio for Caterpillar and Deere has been 3 2  and 4 4   respectively  lower than the sector s level of 4 8   Deere has registered better inventory turnover than its competitor  Return on Assets Return on assets   ROA   is one of the key financial ratios for industrials as they rely heavily on inventory to create revenues  An above average ROA denotes that the company in question is generating earnings by effectively managing its assets   Coming to Caterpillar and Deere  ROA for the trailing 12 months   TTM   is 5 3  and 3 8   respectively  which are below the industrial sector s level of 5 8   This round easily goes to Caterpillar  Dividend Yield  Over a year s time  the dividend yield for Caterpillar has been higher than both the broader sector and Deere  While the broader sector offered a yield of 1 6   Caterpillar returned 2 0   In comparison  Deere has a dividend yield of 1 5   Net Margins  Comparing the net margin trends of the two companies  Caterpillar has a trailing 12 months net margin of 9 0   higher than the sector s 8 3   Deere falls behind both Caterpillar and the sector with a trailing 12 months net margin of 7 7   Last Reported Quarter Performance  Guidance Caterpillar delivered an impressive surge of 160  year over year in its fourth quarter 2017  ended Dec 31 2017  adjusted earnings per share to  2 16  Earnings also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 22   The better than expected performance was due to improved end user demand and disciplined cost control efforts  Driven by strong order rates  lean dealer inventories  increasing backlog and expectation of higher sales volume  the company has initiated fiscal 2018 earnings per guidance range of  8 25  9 25  This reflects a 27  year over year rise at the mid point reflecting higher sales volume across its three primary segments   Read more    Deere s first quarter fiscal 2018  ended Jan 28  2018  earnings soared around 111  year over year to  1 31 per share  a positive earnings surprise of 13   Results were driven by improvement in agricultural and construction equipment markets  For fiscal 2018  Deere expects net sales to increase about 25  year over year adjusted net income to be about  2 85 billion  excluding the impact of the tax reform    Read more    Earnings Estimate Revisions The Zacks Consensus Estimates for both Caterpillar and Deere have been revised upward  following their respective earnings releases  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Caterpillar for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 has moved up 1    The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Deere for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 has surged 17  and 14   respectively    Earnings Projections  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Caterpillar for fiscal 2018 is pegged at  9 14  reflecting a year over year growth of 32 85   The earnings estimate for Deere for the fiscal 2018 is pegged at  9 53  depicting a 42 7  year over year rise  Earnings Surprise History  Considering a more comprehensive earnings history  both Caterpillar and Deere delivered positive surprises in the trailing four quarters  However  Caterpillar stands out with an average positive earnings surprise of 51 6   better than Deere s average beat of 17 3   Long Term Growth Expectations In terms of long term earnings growth expectations  Caterpillar scores above Deere with a projection of 10 3  compared with the latter s 8 2   Both the companies have substantially improved business model delivering better than expected margin  earnings  and cash flow performance despite a weak mining and agricultural conditions  Efforts to lower costs helped sustain margins  Both have witnessed strong order activity lately  In North America  continued improvement in residential and non residential construction as well as revival in infrastructure demand will drive revenues  President Trump s plans of big spending in infrastructure would be a catalyst for both Caterpillar and Deere  Global economic momentum and increasing commodity prices is restoring miners  profitability and they are resuming capital spending  This bodes well for demand for Caterpillar s mining equipment as demand for new equipment also grows with an extension of existing mines  Caterpillar along with other players in the same  like Terex Corporation   NYSE TEX   and Komatsu Ltd    OTC KMTUY   will benefit from these improving trends in mining  Conditions in the farm equipment  are improving as farmers are replacing equipment based on need  Consequently  Deere s earnings have upside potential  Also  Precision Agriculture initiatives will help the company outpace competitors and deliver margin improvement in the long run  However  President s Trump s plan to impose import duties of 25  on steel could dent margins of both the companies  Conclusion These two stocks have grabbed the spotlight with striking performances in their earnings results  estimate revisions as well as surprise history  However  our comparative analysis shows that the scales are currently tipped in Caterpillar s favor when considering share price performance  valuation  ROA  dividend yield  leverage  net margins and long term growth expectations  Deere scores on inventory turnover  earnings estimate revisions and projections for fiscal 2018  On comparison  Caterpillar is clearly a better stock as of now  Don t Even Think

111190,332705,TEX,Caterpillar  CAT  Rides On Strong End Markets   Cost Control,opinion,On Dec 18  we issued an updated research report on the mining and equipment behemoth  Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT    The mining and equipment behemoth has delivered a turnaround performance this year owing to its relentless cost saving actions  The improvement also continues to be driven by the Asia Pacific region and the construction sector  Notably  the Resource Industries has also picked up lately Caterpillar delivered another upbeat quarter with adjusted earnings per share surging 129  in the third quarter while revenues improved 24 6   further building on the momentum noted in the first half of 2017  The better than expected performance can be attributed to surprisingly strong demand for construction equipment in North America  robust sales in China  improvement in other markets as well as disciplined cost control efforts  Moreover  Caterpillar s backlog was at  15 8 billion at the end of quarter  a year over year improvement of  3 8 billion The company reported a rise of 26  in global retail sales for the three months ended November 2017  with improvement noted across all regions   its best performance so far in 2017  Within Machines  Resource Industries and Construction Industries reported positive gains for the fifth and tenth consecutive month  respectively  and scaled peak levels for 2017  Energy   Transportation s retail sales improved for the third consecutive month  The company s overall retail sales growth graph has remained in the positive territory since March this year  The company witnessed a 1  rise in machine retail sales in March  which put an end to its unprecedented 51 month long stretch of declining sales  The company has delivered an average sales growth of 11  since March Given the performance so far  the company has outperformed the on a year to date basis  Shares have surged 61 5  while the industry registered growth of 59 8   The stock has an estimated long term earnings growth rate of 10 33  Caterpillar to Finish 2017 on a Strong NoteOwing to encouraging order rates  upbeat economic indicators and an increasing backlog  Caterpillar hiked revenue guidance during third quarter conference call to the range of  44 billion from the prior range of  42  44 billion  The company now projects earnings per share of  6 25 compared with previous guidance of  5 00 per share  The mid point of the revenues and earnings guidance reflects year over year growth of 14  and 83   respectively The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 for revenues is at  44 52 billion and for earnings at  6 44  both ahead of the company s guidance  Estimates for Caterpillar have moved up in the past 30 days  reflecting the optimistic outlook of analysts  The earnings estimate for fiscal 2017 has gone up 22  while that of fiscal 2018 has moved north 15  Will the Momentum Sustain in 2018 Caterpillar s share price has benefited since the victory of Donald Trump as investors expect Trump s plans of big spending in infrastructure to boost revenues which had until that point borne the brunt of weak mining demand  The prospect of gigantic infrastructure spending is welcome news for Caterpillar which is anticipated to play a major role in the national infrastructure plan Meanwhile  the Construction Industries segment is benefiting from strong order activity across all regions and favorable price realization  End user demand remains robust in North America  driven by an uptick in pipeline construction and improved residential and non residential construction  In China  the construction industry is improving due to government spending  In 2017  the 10 ton and above excavator industry in China is projected to more than double from last year  Not only China  but also other regions in the Asia Pacific are anticipated to show improvement in construction activity going forward  In Resource Industries  sales are being driven by continued strong demand for aftermarket parts  favorable changes to dealer inventories  and positive pricing In September 2015  Caterpillar set upon significant restructuring and cost reduction initiative  with actions expected through 2018  Once fully implemented  the plan would aid to lower its annual operating costs by about  1 5 billion  This is likely to stem from the consolidation or closure of more than 30 facilities that would decrease manufacturing square footage by more than 10  and reduce the workforce by more than 10 000 people  In addition to restructuring activities  Caterpillar continues to focus on customers and on the future by continuing to invest in digital capabilities  connecting assets and jobsites along with developing the next generation of more productive and efficient products Caterpillar currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Other top ranked companies in the industrial product space include Deere   Company   NYSE DE    H E

111214,332729,TEX,Why Rockwell Is Right To Reject Emerson s Takeover Attempts,opinion,After Emerson Electric Co  s   NYSE EMR    for automation products manufacturer   Rockwell Automation Inc    NYSE ROK     was spurned by the latter last week  we believe it might be prudent for Emerson to completely abandon its suit  In fact  Emerson s shares had risen 2 5  in the aftermath of the rejection  as investors  concerns about an expensive deal that would overstretch Emerson s finances eased Let s discuss the reasons why a deal between the two would  more likely than not  be a debacle  after we touch upon the relatively few arguments in favor of the same  For  the DealEmerson is seeking to bolster its offerings by adding the leading supplier of software and controls for assembly line operations  Doubtlessly  the deal would have added heft after Emerson s CEO slashed almost a third of the company s sales during its two year restructuring process  To that end  it has been making smaller  bolt on acquisitions  including a  3 15 billion acquisition of Pentair s valves and controls business in April Similar to the rationale for buying Pentair s valves and controls unit  Emerson believes acquiring Rockwell Automation would help equip it better to bid for larger scale automation projects  Emerson s process automation prowess  and Rockwell Automation s leadership in discrete automation would  no doubt  result in a truly hybrid  global player  and also a leader in the  200 billion global automation market Emerson also believes the deal will create  6 billion in capitalized synergies  of which about a third would come from sales synergies  with the rest coming in the form of cost synergies Rockwell Automation s stock price has raced much ahead of Emerson in the past year  While Emerson has risen 13 2   Rockwell Automation s shares have soared a whopping 46 7  during the same time frame Emerson has also underperformed the industry during the same time frame  with the  gaining 15 9  over the past year Rockwell s Reality Check for EmersonAutomation firmly believes Emerson s sweetened bid of  29 billion doesn t outweigh the risks involved in integrating the two industrial automation giants  It maintained that the unsolicited proposal undervalued the company  and also expressed concerns about the large amount of Emerson s stock in the deal Emerson s poor track record of integrating acquisitions was another nail in the coffin for its ambitions to create an industrial automation giant  Also  Moody s Investors Service estimates that the proposed deal implies leverage of five times the combined company s EBITDA   which is more than twice the median for major North American industrial companies  according to Bloomberg reports  Rockwell Automation said that the proposed merger would stunt its growth and hurt its competitiveness in the evolving market  The company noted that unlike Emerson  Rockwell Automation does not see this proposed deal as essential for its growth and expansion in the industrial automation and information market  Clearly  the company has great confidence in its strategic direction and ability to continue delivering superior levels of growth and value creation  It has witnessed bullish momentum this year  and its profit levels and margins are impressive The company maintained that it is better off alone  riding on the success of the company s Logix product which offers customers a single software platform to build on instead of learning multiple ones  Integrating it with Emerson s multiple offerings could be costly and could create grave customer disruptions Summing UpWhile both companies have impressive long term track records  Emerson has arguably been lagging in shareholder and operational returns over the past decade  Its shares have been largely inert  while shares of Rockwell Automation have virtually tripled over the time period Rockwell Automation boasts superior margins and revenue growth  while Emerson is beset by repercussions of poor M A decisions of the past  Emerson might have strategic rationale behind the deal  however a large multiple  high leverage  lack of earnings accretion  and a questionable track record  all hint toward abandoning the deal being a better choice Both Emerson and Rockwell Automation currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Stocks to ConsiderBetter ranked

111231,332746,TEX,Can Emerson s Latest Sweetened Takeover Bid Tempt Rockwell ,opinion,Emerson Electric Co    NYSE EMR   sweetened its earlier bid forautomation products manufacturer Rockwell Automation Inc    NYSE ROK    in an effort to bring its hesitant rival to the negotiating table and form a new giant in industrial automation Yesterday  Emerson wrote to Rockwell Automation  proposing a takeover at  225 per share  with 60  in cash and 40  in stock  for a total consideration of about  29 billion  The price represents a premium of 19  to Rockwell Automation s closing stock price of  188 73 on Wednesday The latest bid follows Rockwell Automation s repeated rejections of Emerson s overtures for much of this year  In late October  we came to know that Rockwell Automation had already rejected two offers from Emerson  including a  215 per share   27 6 billion takeover offer made in the same month Rockwell Automation s stock price has raced much ahead of Emerson in the past year  While Emerson has risen 8 9   Rockwell Automation shares have soared a whopping 47 6  during the same time frame  Responding to the offer  Rockwell Automation said it would review the unsolicited proposal with its financial and legal advisers  and then determine the course of action which is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders Emerson believes there is undeniable strategic  operational and financial merit to the merger  and it would benefit customers  employees and shareholders alike Emerson s strength lies in process automation   enabling power plants and factories in mining  cement and other such sectors operate more efficiently  Rockwell Automation is a prominent player in the so called discrete automation   helping assemble component parts to manufacture products like household appliances  automobiles and computer systems Doubtlessly  an Emerson and Rockwell Automation merger would create a leader in the  200 billion global automation market Emerson believes the deal will create  6 billion in capitalized synergies  of which about a third would come from sales synergies  Sales synergies would include more comprehensive in house product offering  an increased win rate in large projects and complementary products for cross selling opportunities and channel pull through The rest would represent cost synergies  including corporate and public company costs  materials costs  administrative and channel efficiencies  manufacturing optimization  and more effective R D and engineering costs spread across a broader base Emerson also stated that the deal would create  8 billion of total value   62 per share  for Rockwell Automation shareholders Rockwell Automation had earlier insisted that it was better off alone  with its booming Logix product that offers customers a single software platform to build on  instead of learning multiple ones which Emerson offers  The company thinks that the common platform is vital to its commercial success and integrating it with Emerson s multiple offerings could be costly and create customer disruptions  Also  the company had great confidence in its strategic direction and ability to continue delivering superior levels of growth and value creation Some analysts see definite value in the deal  however  and the latest bid would surely be difficult for Rockwell Automation to reject outright Both Emerson and Rockwell Automation currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the broader space include Terex Corporation   NYSE TEX   and Caterpillar  Inc    NYSE CAT    both sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Terex generated four outstanding beats over the trailing four quarters  for an outstanding average positive surprise of 135 9  Caterpillar has a striking earnings surprise history for the same time frame  having beaten estimates all through for an average beat of 53 1  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana      Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ,2017-11-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-emersons-latest-sweetened-takeover-bid-tempt-rockwell-200266174,200266174
111232,332747,TEX,Rockwell Automation  ROK  Stock Up On Emerson s Raised Offer,opinion,"Shares of Rockwell Automation Inc    NYSE ROK   were up 2 59  to close at  193 61 on Nov 16  as rival Emerson Electric Co    NYSE EMR   sweetened its offer to acquire the former at  225 per share  This translated the total value of the deal to  29 billion  Notably  this is Emerson s third attempt to acquire the automation products manufacturer  The consideration would be paid in  135 per share in cash and  90 per share in Emerson shares  Per Rockwell Automation  it would review the unsolicited proposal with its financial and legal advisers to determine the course of action that will be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders On Oct 31  the company had announced the rejection of Emerson Electric s takeover bid valued at around  28 billion  This led to the stock hitting a 52 week high of  210 72 as the decision impressed the market and analysts  In fact  the company s share price has outperformed the  as well as the S P 500 year to date  While the stock has been up 44 1  the industry grew 41 1   and the S P 500 gained 16 9  

Meanwhile  shares of Emerson Electric have rallied 5 8   underperforming its  s growth of 11 3  and the S P 500 s gain of 14 8  A Dogged SuitorOn Oct 10  Emerson Electric had offered Rockwell Automation  107 50 per share in cash and 225 million shares of its common stock  The stock was valued at  107 50 per share based on Emerson Electric s 30 day volume weighted average share price of  62 92 as of Oct 10  2017 Markedly  this was Emerson Electric s second attempt to acquire Rockwell Automation  On Aug 2  2017  Rockwell Automation had refused Emerson Electric s proposal to acquire it for  200 per share  with approximately half of the consideration in cash and the other half in common stock Why Is Emerson Pursuing Rockwell Automation Earlier  Emerson Electric s management had stated that they considered only small bolt on acquisitions  However  from these proposals it is evident that the company is now trying to diversify businesses and reduce exposure to volatile energy prices Therefore  Emerson Electric sees Rockwell Automation as a way to get more exposure to the rapidly growing automation business  One of Rockwell Automation s advantages is its advancement in internet of things  which allows different devices and systems to communicate with each other over the internet Even though Emerson Electric has been trying to expand its software portfolio through acquisitions  it clearly lags Rockwell Automation s offerings that help industrial businesses connect their technology operations  While  Emerson has a market capitalization of  37 77 billion  Rockwell Automation has a market capitalization of  24 72 billion  The deal  if comes through would create a leader in the  200 billion global automation market  with best in class portfolio of automation solutionsWhy Were the Previous Offers Shunned Following a review of the proposal and consultation with financial and legal advisors  Rockwell Automation s board of directors had concluded that Emerson Electric s offer was not in the best interest of the company or its shareholders  Also  as per reports  Rockwell Automation had concerns about the large amount of Emerson Electric s stock in the deal  Furthermore  it was apprehensive regarding Emerson Electric s poor track record of integrating acquisitions Is Rockwell Automation Better Off Alone Rockwell Automation targets long term revenue growth of 6 8   double digit EPS growth  returns on invested capital  ROIC  of more than 20  over the long term and cash flow of around 100  of adjusted income  These goals are likely to be supported by the company s strategy of diversifying sales streams by expanding products portfolio  solutions and services as well as global presence Additionally  it aims at achieving growth rates in excess of the automation market by expanding the company s served market  strengthening competitive differentiation  and catering to a wider range of industries and applications Going forward  Rockwell Automation s new Connected Enterprise  CE  integrated supply chain management system is anticipated to be a catalyst  Meanwhile  the company is increasing the number of industries  applications and geographies as well as improving investments to expand the value of CE  With average profitability well above the corporate average  CE sales are expected to be an integral part of Rockwell Automation s incremental growth and boost margins over the next few years In the trailing four quarters  Rockwell Automation outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate and delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 9 1   In fact  the company has been witnessing upward revisions in the last 30 days  Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate moved up 1  to  7 39 for fiscal 2018 and 5  to  8 26 for fiscal 2019  A positive trend in estimate revisions reflects investor s optimism on the company s bright prospects Rockwell Automation currently has a ROA of 12 3  while the industry s ROA is 12   An above average ROA denotes that the company is generating earnings by effectively managing assets  Moreover  the company s trailing 12 month ROE of 38 7  is higher than the industry s ROE of 34 8   reflecting the company s tactical efficiency in using shareholders  funds  In addition  Rockwell Automation s long term earnings growth rate of 11 8  is a positive Thus  substantiating the fact that Rockwell Automation is better placed on a stand alone basis  It currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks worth considering in the same sector are Caterpillar Inc    NYSE

111257,332772,TEX,Can TransUnion  TRU  Beat Q3 Earnings On Broad Based Growth ,opinion,TransUnion   NYSE TRU   is slated to report third quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 27 In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 8   TransUnion has an impressive average positive surprise of 10 6  for the trailing four quarters  beating estimates all through We expect TransUnion to score an earnings beat in the to be reported quarter as well Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model shows that TransUnion has the right combination of the two key ingredients  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is perfectly the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  TransUnion has an Earnings ESP of  2 14   as the Most Accurate estimate of 48 cents is pegged above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  The company carries a Zacks Rank  2  which when combined with a positive ESP  makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat Conversely  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions Growth Drivers for the QuarterTransUnion has an attractive business model with highly recurring and diversified revenue streams  significant operating leverage  low capital requirements  and strong and stable cash flows  In addition  the inherent nature and significance of the company s solutions in customers  decision making steps endow it with high customer retention and revenue visibility  These factors have helped drive consistent operating results for the company in recent times  and will likely boost the upcoming quarterly results as well During the quarter  TransUnion acquired leading provider of vehicle and driving records  Datalink Services  Inc  d b a Compass Driving Records  This acquisition will enable TransUnion s DriverRisk solution to offer the insurance industry a full driving record platform  We anticipate the acquisition to have a favorable impact on the quarter s results TransUnion Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   TransUnion has been enjoying strong growth momentum in recent times  Particularly  the company s USIS segment  which witnessed 16  year over year growth in revenues in the second quarter  will likely record sturdy top line growth in the coming results as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the USIS segment revenues in the to be reported quarter is pegged at  294 million  reflecting impressive growth of 13 5  year over year Further  we expect the International segment to continue its strong growth trajectory this quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment s revenues is pegged at  91 million  underlining striking year over year growth of 15 2  In fact  the Consumer Interactive segment  which has been weak in recent times  is also expected to return to the growth track this quarter  The segment s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter s sales is  102 million  indicating growth of 6 3  year over year  However  the revenues of the segment are expected to decline sequentially The company s collaboration with Carahsoft Technology Corp    a trusted government IT solutions provider   will also likely boost the results in to be reported quarter As emerging market economies continue to develop and mature  the company becomes well positioned to gain from the associated favorable socio economic trends  Additionally  increased risk of identity theft due to data breaches  and higher consumer awareness about the importance and usage of their credit information are propelling the demand for TransUnion s consumer solutions  These factors bode well for the company s operating results Per the company s guidance provided in the last quarterly results  consolidated revenues are expected to be in the range of  470  475 million for third quarter 2017  Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be between  185 million and  189 million  while adjusted earnings are expected to be between 45 cents and 46 cents per share Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Terex Corporation   NYSE TEX    with an Earnings ESP of  3 17  and a Zacks Rank of 2  is expected to release quarterly numbers around Nov 1  You can see  CNH Industrial N V    NYSE CNHI    with an Earnings ESP of  8 11  and a Zacks Rank of 2  is slated to report results on Oct 31 Rockwell Collins  Inc

111295,332810,TEX,Ericsson  ERIC  Q3 Earnings  Another Miss In The Cards ,opinion,Ericsson  BS ERICAs    NASDAQ ERIC   is set to report third quarter 2017 results on Oct 20 The company has a dreadful earnings history  with repeated  colossal earnings misses  Last quarter  the company missed estimates for the sixth consecutive quarter  recording a huge negative surprise of 60   Ericsson witnessed an average negative surprise of 288  for the trailing four quarters Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement and whether Ericsson is set to add yet another earnings miss to its losing streak Factors to ConsiderEricsson is in the midst of its worst crisis in a decade  grappling with shrinking markets and stiff competition from China s Huawei and Finland s Nokia  HE NOKIA   Slowdown in spending by wireless carriers severely hurt the company s financials in the past few quarters and will likely hurt the third quarter results as well The beleaguered infrastructure giant s repeated earnings misses  eroding profitability and precipitous revenue decline have left investors high and dry  The stock has lost 6 3  over the past six months  much wider than the  s average gain of 3   Most of the company s troubles have stemmed from drying up investments by major telecom equipment makers across the world  Particularly  uncertainty in the financial markets  reduced consumer telecom spending and delayed auctions of spectrums pose significant threats for Ericsson  The company s revenues and margins in the Networks and IT   Cloud segments continue to take a grave beating from adverse industry trends  which are expected to reflect in the upcoming results as well Further  in the second quarter 2017 earnings report  Ericsson noted that it expects a  high single digit percentage  drop in the market for radio access networks this year  which is worse than previously projected  Network equipment sales  particularly in the North America and Europe markets  continue to contract  Europe and Latin America   the markets with the biggest impact   are likely to have an increasingly challenging investment environment in the quarters to come Particularly  straight quarters of revenue declines and contract losses in Italy and Russia have made matters worse for Ericsson  This trend is unlikely to reverse itself in the to be reported quarter  thus thwarting profitability and sales Ericsson Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Soft mobile broadband demand and slowdown in emerging markets will continue to put a significant dent in Ericsson s performance  These factors will likely manifest in the company s sales in the to be reported quarter  In fact  it expects the industry trends and business mix in mobile broadband to prevail this year as well To turn its fortunes  Ericsson came up with an elaborate restructuring plan to cut costs and focus on strategic areas Despite these challenges  Ericsson is the world s largest supplier of LTE technology  with a significant market share and has established a large number of LTE networks worldwide  Also  the Ericsson Cisco partnership  which has been shaping up well ever since its inception in November 2015  is winning Ericsson lucrative awards  which should positively impact the upcoming quarterly results We believe the only potential upside to earnings in the near future depends mostly on expense management  Ericsson had earlier announced a restructuring plan to cut costs and streamline the company s focus areas  as well as explore options for the media business Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Ericsson will beat on earnings estimates in this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for the company is currently pegged at  260 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 2 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at earnings of 1 penny You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our Zacks Rank  Ericsson has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Terex Corporation   NYSE TEX    with an Earnings ESP of  5 04  and a Zacks Rank  2  is expected to release quarterly numbers around Oct 30  You can see  Scorpio Bulkers Inc    NYSE SALT    with an

CalAmp Corp   NASDAQ CAMP  may have broken on Wednesday  It dropped 1 38  or 7 8   on 1 7 million shares  and took out the key support line  The next test could be the May lows around 14 3 4  which should occur pretty quickly 
Covance Inc   NYSE CVD  also broke this week  hard  It s been down four or five days in a row  The key is that a major zone was broken on Wednesday  down 1 62  or 2   on 1 1 million shares  It could see 70 very soon 
Nu Skin Enterprises Inc   NYSE NUS  continues to look bad  If formed a bear wedge  and when that wedge is broken  it could lead to the 34 5 should it break 40 first

111476,332991,TEX,Stocks On The Short Side,opinion,"It was almost turn around Tuesday  The stock market took quite the dive in the morning  and then came back in the afternoon  It closed mixed  so we haven t broken support yet  There are signs of  perhaps  a crack in the armor  We ll just have to see what the market wants to give us  We are going to go over some longs and some shorts here 
Avanir Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ AVNR  is looking well  It went up to 13 83 before backing off  but it was still up 48 cents  or 3 7   on 7 3 million shares  That s a little bit better volume  but what I want to see is if this can get going again  It s in a rising channel  and there s lateral resistance  The next target is 18 
Groupon  Inc   NASDAQ GRPN  is having a good time of it a breakaway gap  and the moving averages are moving sharply higher  It may get a pullback at some point  I think I put my swing trade target at 8 3 4 first  After that  we re looking at 9 3 4 10 
Stocks on the Short Side 
Emerge Energy Services  EMES  rolled over hard and came down for about two weeks in a row  It bounced sharply on short covering  in my opinion  and then rolled over after double topping  On Tuesday  it broke support  dropping another 6 59  or 7 5   on 1 3 million shares  Technicals are very negative  I m looking for this to retest 69 1 2 70  That could be about a 10 12 short here  If it gets below that it could get ugly 
Hi Crush Partners  NYSE HCLP  had a big drop  a big pop  it fell right at the declining topsline  and the 50 day moving average  and rolled over  dropping 3 22  or 7 28   on nearly a million shares  Again  in the case of a hike rush  39 was support  Tuesday s high was a low of 39 69 before bouncing  but should it take that out  we could see 34 35

Avanir Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ AVNR  soared 85 3   up 5 75 to 12 49  on 88 7 million shares after reporting positive clinical trial results for an Alzheimer related drug  It opened at 9 35  ran all the way up to 13 09  before pulling back to close at 12 49  That s the best volume this stock has ever seen  Looking at the long term pattern  the highest this stock has ever reached is 17 33  which is a potential short term target  It will get there possibly in the next day or two 
ReWalk Robotics Ltd   RWLK  continues to surge on the second day of its IPO  On Monday  it pulled back  then exploded 11 55  or 45   on 11 2 million shares  Since the IPO  it popped  coiled  popped  dipped  popped again  formed a little wedge  and then accelerated  After reaching all the way up to 43 71  it backed off to the mid to high 30s  The pattern that formed looks like some sort of coiling consolidation  If it moves under the 35 1 2 area it would be a disaster  Just so it doesn t move under 32  If it moves to mid channel  the target is 45  The top of the channel is mid 60  Do I think it could get that high  No  but it doesn t mean it can t 
Stocks on the Short Side 
CalAmp Corp   NASDAQ CAMP  hasn t been looking too bad  The top is in  it declined  formed a rising wedge  another quick fall  a bear flag  and then on Monday  it dropped 1 41  or 7   on 1 2 million shares  The volume picked up a little bit  and that was the best in about 7 or 8 weeks  Look for a retest of the 16 3 4 range  if that breaks  then 14 1 2  and it could get all the way down to 11 12 if it falls apart 
Terex Corp   NYSE TEX  formed a top in Feb Mar  rolled over  formed another topping pattern  broke down  snapped back to resistance  and then on Monday it had a big rollover  down 2 23  or 6 4   and the volume spiked to 6 1 million shares  It looks like it wants to go lower  eventually down to 27
