whereas strength in Chinese Mainland and local customer sales offered some respite In Japan  sales grew 19  to  169 million and comps rose at the same rate  Adverse currency movements also dented

7227,228742,TIF,Tiffany  TIF  Misses Q3 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Tiffany  TIF  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 65 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 85 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 77 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  23 53   A quarter ago  it was expected that this luxury jeweler would post earnings of  1 05 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 12  delivering a surprise of 6 67  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Tiffany  which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Jewelry industry  posted revenues of  1 01 billion for the quarter ended October 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 11   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 01 billion  The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Tiffany shares have added about 66 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 24 2  
What s Next for Tiffany 
While Tiffany has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Tiffany was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 78 on  1 37 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 79 on  4 46 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Retail   Jewelry is currently in the bottom 8  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-12-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tiffany-tif-misses-q3-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200490266,200490266
7228,228743,TIF,Tiffany  TIF  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Tiffany  TIF  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 5  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This luxury jeweler is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 85 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 4  
Revenues are expected to be  1 04 billion  up 2 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 02  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Tiffany 
For Tiffany  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  6 23  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Tiffany will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Tiffany would post earnings of  1 05 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 12  delivering a surprise of  6 67  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Tiffany doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-11-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tiffany-tif-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200488813,200488813

15020,236535,TIF,StockBeat  Kering Moncler Report Propels Luxury Names,news,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing com    There s merger speculation in the air among Europe s luxury groups Thursday  with shares in Moncler  MI MONC    the Italian maker of high end puffa jackets   rising nearly 10  after reports that it may be swallowed by Gucci owner   Kering    PA PRTP  
Bloomberg reported late on Wednesday that  Kering   PA PRTP   which also owns brands such as Yves St Laurent  Bottega Veneta and Alexander McQueen  has held preliminary talks about a takeover  Neither company officially confirmed the talks 
The move would  to all intents and purposes  be  Kering   PA PRTP  patriarch Francois Henri Pinault s response to the recent move by his arch rival Bernard Arnault on iconic U S  jeweller   Tiffany   Co     Arnault s LVMH   PA LVMH  agreed to buy Tiffany  NYSE TIF  for  16 2 billion last month 
An approach for Moncler doesn t quite have the same powerful strategic logic behind it  Tiffany will make LVMH the world leader in  hard luxury   catapulting it above Swiss based   Richemont   SA  SIX CFR   while Moncler would simply add some extra heft in fashion  an area where  Kering   PA PRTP  is already strong  The combined annual revenues of Kering Moncler  at some 18 billion euros  would still be less than one third of a Tiffany enhanced LVMH 
At a current price of nearly 11 billion euros   1 22 billion  and a price earrnings ratio of over 29  Moncler wouldn t come cheap  but it is at least growing revenues at well over 10   and its long term future would arguably be more secure in a bigger stable such as  Kering   PA PRTP

15035,236550,TIF,Stocks   Trade Optimism Sends Wall Street to New Highs,news,"Investing   Stocks started Thanksgiving week with a solid rally Monday  the second in two trading sessions  led by technology and health stocks 
The rally saw the Dow Jones industrials  S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hit new closing highs  The S P 500  Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 indexes hit new intraday highs and the Russell 2000 index hit a 52 week high 
The Dow s 300 point swing between Friday and Monday brought the blue chip index to within about 24 points of its all time high of 28 090 21 
The S P 500 finished up 0 75   The Dow added 0 68   The Nasdaq was up 1 32   and the Nasdaq 100 was up 1 21   The Russell was even stronger with a 2  gain 
The catalyst seemed to be more optimism about a U S  China trade deal and perhaps a market perception that an impeachment effort to remove President Donald Trump from office will fall short 
The trade optimism  which fueled the Russell s big gain  was based on a call by Chinese officials for speeding up new penalties and punitive action for infringement of patents and copyrights The proposal was published over the weekend  The issue is key for U S  tech companies  especially smaller tech companies trying to scale up their businesses 
In addition  Reuters reported a Chinese state backed tabloid said Beijing and Washington were  very close  to an initial pact 
Tech stocks were also buoyed by a big gain in Nvidia  NASDAQ NVDA   which builds graphics chips used in games and in data centers  Nvidia helped the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rise 2 43  
Health stocks moved higher  led by UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH  
The rally was quite broad  with 10 of the 11 S P 500 sectors showing gains  The only decliner was the utilities sector  down 1 37  as investors were more confident in taking on more risk 
Among those that benefited from the optimism was Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY   up 8 3  after a Bank of America  Merrill analyst said the odds of a turnaround for the home wares retailer have improved greatly since the company hired Mark Tritton as its CEO in October  The shares are up nearly 86  since bottoming in August 
Among stocks hitting new 52 week highs were Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   Buckle  NYSE BKE     General Electric    NYSE GE   JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  and RH  NYSE RH  
Upscale jeweler Tiffany  NYSE TIF  was up 6 2  after the venerable retailer agreed to sell out to French luxury brand company LVMH  OTC LVMUY  for  16 2 billion 
If there was a downside to the rally is that it is exhibiting signs of frothiness  The relative strength indexes for the S P 500 and the Nasdaq finished above 70 on Monday  a signal the market is getting overbought 
Apple s  NASDAQ AAPL  RSI was 71 on Monday after the shares rose 1 75   Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   up 1 1   hit a new all time high of  151 35  saw its RSI finish the day at 73

 It s a smart move  that will help LVMH  launch a more concerted attack on the Asian millennial market   Flavio Cereda  analyst at Jefferies International Ltd   wrote in a note  The deal also will likely lead to renewed speculation about other potential tie ups among luxury players  including Richemont  privately held Chanel and Gucci owner  Kering   PA PRTP  SA  Cereda wrote

The deal should have a slightly enhancing impact on LVMH s 2020 EPS  2 5   and give a net debt Ebitda ratio close to 0 9x by the end of 2020Acquisition will give LVMH a 20  share of the global jewelry market   very close  to RichemontU S  weighting in LVMH sales will increase to 26  from 23  given the U S  weight in Tiffany s sales  44  Jefferies  Flavio Cereda  Hold on LVMH 
LVMH is the obvious acquirer for Tiffany  not only because of its deep pockets and annual EU5b in free cash flow generation  but also its status as a conglomerate and its need to bulk up its offering in hard luxury  which has grown organically since the 2011 purchase of BulgariWithout Tiffany  hard luxury would account for 9  of LVMH sales and 6  of Ebit in 2020  Tiffany would lift this to 15  and 11   respectively    so  still dwarfed  by soft luxury  42  and 66    but attaining a  rather more relevant  roleDeal is a positive for LVMH as there are limited M A opportunities of size in luxury generally  barring Rolex or Patek Philippe there are no others in hard luxury  the category LVMH needed to bulk up inBy contrast  it s a negative for Richemont given that Tiffany allows LVMH to become a  far more credible competitor on its home turf  and one with deeper pockets and greater clout RBC Europe  Rogerio Fujimori  Outperform on LVMH

 Reuters    French luxury goods group LVMH s deal to buy U S  jewelry firm Tiffany boosted European shares to a one week high on Monday  while optimism that Washington and Beijing would be able settle their trade spat also lifted investor sentiment 
Shares of LVMH  PA LVMH  rose 1 8   putting them on track for their best day in three weeks  as the French firm said it would buy  Tiffany   Co   N TIF  for  16 2 billion  The pan European STOXX 600 index  STOXX  was up 0 7  
All the major European subsectors were trading higher  led by trade sensitive miners  SXPP   which hit a two week high after a report that China and the United States were  very close  to an initial trade agreement 
That added to optimism from Friday  when the presidents of both the countries reiterated their desire for a trade deal  helping the benchmark European index log its best day in three weeks 
 A  phase one  deal is now priced into markets  there isn t much upside that will come from that unless they announce something like a complete rollback of the tariffs imposed  but  that doesn t really seem likely   said Simona Gambarini  markets economist at Capital Economics 
Headlines surrounding the prolonged trade spat have dictated stock market moves this year  with the STOXX 600 index inching towards a record high on hopes the two sides would resolve their dispute  which has so far dulled sentiment and dented global growth 
A reading of the German IFO business climate index rose slightly in November from the previous month  but indicated that manufacturing in Europe s powerhouse was still stuck in a recession 
The numbers follow underwhelming PMI data on Friday  which showed business growth in the eurozone almost ground to a halt in November

A Reuters report that completion of a  phase one  trade deal could slide into next year raised fears that a fresh round of U S  tariffs on Chinese goods in December could trigger a global slowdown 
Further adding to woes  U S President Donald Trump is expected to sign two bills passed by Congress intended to support protesters in Hong Kong 
 Recently  we ve seen optimism that at one point there will be a trade deal  but the news overnight shows that there is not much certainty to that   said Elwin de Groot  head of macro strategy at Rabobank 
 These moves are a reflection of some investors increasingly questioning whether there will now be a trade deal at all  
Hopes that the two sides will be reaching a deal soon and somewhat better than expected earnings reports had driven European stocks to a four year peak earlier this week

15073,236588,TIF,De Beers banks on  diamonds are for me ,news,"LONDON  Reuters     Anglo American   L AAL  unit De Beers said its 2019 marketing budget will exceed last year s figure of  170 million and will focus on the biggest market the United States  where women lavishing diamonds on themselves has boosted sales 
While U S  demand has held firm  the diamond market has weakened elsewhere and trade tensions and protests in Hong Kong have dented sales in China  the second largest diamond market 
But luxury groups see potential for growth in jewelry demand  as shown by LVMH s  PA LVMH  nearly  14 5 billion offer  made public on Monday  to buy  Tiffany   Co   N TIF  
Esther Oberbeck  group head of strategy at De Beers  the world s biggest diamond producer by value  said in an interview the company was about to launch new marketing campaigns  focused on the U S  and China 
She did not specify the budget  but said De Beers  2019 spend would exceed last year s  170 million and was the highest in more than a decade 
The campaigns  which she said would concentrate on  self purchase and the bridal market   are based on research carried out for De Beers  published on Monday 
It found the share of U S  women buying their own engagement ring doubled from 7  to 14  over the five year period 2013 2017 and that women on average spent a third more than men    4 400 compared with  3 300 
De Beers sells rough diamonds and jewelry through its Forevermark brand 
Its research anticipates the rough diamond market will recover from a period of oversupply as some mines reach their end of their lives  notably Rio Tinto s  L RIO   AX RIO  Argyle mine in Australia 
Global consumer demand for diamonds rose by 2  in 2018 to  76 billion and  in dollar terms  China and the United States were the fastest growing regions  both increasing by 5  year on year  it said 
Demand for diamond jewelry in the U S  rose by 5  to  36 billion  representing just under half of total global diamond jewelry demand  underpinned by  solid macro economic factors   the De Beers research found 
Diamonds are still the leading choice for engagement rings  whether between same sex or heterosexual couples 
But demand for diamond jewelry as a gift to mark all kinds of special occasions  including rewards to oneself  now outweighs demand directly related to weddings  De Beers said ",2019-10-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/de-beers-banks-on-diamonds-are-for-me-2005893,2005893

15075,236590,TIF,French luxury group LVMH offers to buy U S  jeweler Tiffany  sources,news,"By Greg Roumeliotis
 Reuters    Louis Vuitton owner LVMH  PA LVMH  has approached  Tiffany   Co   N TIF  with a  14 5 billion acquisition offer  people familiar with the matter said  at a time when the U S  luxury jeweler grapples with the impact of tariffs on its exports to China 
LVMH  which has for years been looking for ways to expand in the U S  market  submitted a preliminary  non binding offer to Tiffany earlier this month  one of the sources said 
LVMH s offer valued Tiffany at about  120 per share  another of the sources added  Tiffany shares ended trading on Friday at  98 55 
Tiffany has hired advisers to review LVMH s offer but has not yet responded to it  and there is no certainty that it will negotiate a deal  according to the sources 
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential  LVMH and Tiffany declined to comment  Bloomberg News reported earlier on Saturday that LVMH was holding talks with Tiffany 
LVMH  which is behind brands such as Fendi  Christian Dior and Givenchy  as well as Veuve Cliquot champagne  has stood out for several years as one of the top performers in the upscale retail sector  where not all labels are benefiting to the same degree from booming Chinese appetite for branded goods 
Tiffany  on the other hand  has not been as resilient  Beyond the tariffs that have been triggered by the trade war between the United States and China  a lower Chinese domestic sales tax has also contributed to double digit decreases in its sales to Chinese tourists in the United States and in other destinations 
High end brands have also long relied on Hong Kong as a major shopping hub drawing visitors from mainland China in particular  and four months of pro democracy demonstrations are starting to take their toll 
However  earlier this month LVMH  which has a market capitalization of 194 billion euros   215 billion   beat sales forecasts for the third quarter despite the unrest in Hong Kong  In August  Tiffany reported quarterly earnings that also beat analysts  expectations  thanks to a drop in marketing costs 
Tiffany has been refreshing its offerings with more affordable items such as pendants and earrings  to appeal to millennials who have been gravitating to lower priced competitors such as Denmark s  Pandora  A S  CO PNDORA  and Signet Jewelers  N SIG

Net profit fell 24  and revenue fell 3  on the year in the three months to September  prompting interim CEO Noel Quinn to abandon the bank s profitability target for next year  although he stopped short of cutting the dividend and said the targeted common equity tier 1 capital ratio   a key measure of financial strength   will remain unchanged at over 14  
The bank s problems were already well flagged by the unscheduled departure of John Flint as CEO earlier this year  followed by unconfirmed reports four weeks ago of plans to cut up to 10 000 jobs  The areas highlighted by Quinn in the earnings release are exactly those mentioned in the earlier reports  the U S  operations  the wholesale banking operation in the U K  and the retail operations in continental Europe 
 Our previous plans are no longer sufficient to improve performance for these businesses  given the softer outlook for revenue growth   Quinn said   We are therefore accelerating plans to remodel them  and move capital into higher growth and return opportunities  
The bank now expects  substantial  restructuring charges that will stop it reaching its target of a return on tangible equity of 11  next year  A weak third quarter means that RoTE has dropped to 9 5  for the first nine months of this year  Talking to Bloomberg later  chief financial officer Ewen Stevenson declined to say how long it would take to hit the 11  mark

1  Stocks to open near all time highs
U S  stock markets are set to open with a fresh run at all time highs on Monday after China s Ministry of Commerce said at the weekend that technical consultations on some parts of the interim trade deal being hammered out with the U S  were  basically completed  
By 6 AM ET  Dow futures were up 74 points or 0 3   while the S P 500 Futures contract was up 0 2  and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0 3  
The news comes at the start of a big week for global markets  which have been dragged lower for most of the year by the economic slowdown caused by the U S  China trade dispute  The dispute has caused an economic slowdown that has forced most of the world s central banks to ease monetary policy substantially  Both sides have claimed in the last few days that technical agreements on an interim trade are basically completed 
The Federal Reserve s policy making committee is due to decide on Wednesday whether or not to cut interest rates for a third time this year  Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool says there s a 93  chance   That will follow the first reading for U S  GDP in the third quarter  The Bank of Japan will hold its own policy making meeting on Thursday  while the euro zone will release 3Q GDP on the same day

The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure contract  or JEDI as it s inevitably known  could be worth as much as  10 billion  according to reports 
The award is the clearest illustration yet of the growing threat to Amazon Web Services  dominance of the cloud hosting business  That s important because AWS has been by far the biggest profit generator for Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  in recent years  Earnings released last week showed that AWS s quarterly sales growth slowed to 35   while Microsoft s Azure unit grew by 59

The European Union formally agreed to a three month extension of the deadline for Brexit until the end of January 2020  according to a tweet from EU Council President Donald Tusk

The House of Commons is scheduled to vote later Monday not on the withdrawal agreement  but on whether to hold a general election in December in the hope of breaking the deadlock on Brexit   The chance of the House passing legislation enacting the withdrawal agreement before the proposed election date is slim

2  Fed Jawboning on the Menu
As uncertainty over whether the U S  and China will resume trade talks dominates market direction  investors will likely welcome the opportunity to hear from Federal Reserve members for further signs the U S  central bank will cut its benchmark rate next month  
Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin will speak at 12 20 pm ET  4 20pm GMT   San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly will speak at 5 30 pm ET  9 30pm GMT  
Expectations for an aggressive Fed rate cut at the central bank s next meeting were dented by better than expected consumer confidence data  suggesting the U S  economy remains on solid footing  
While the Fed is still expected to cut rates in a few weeks  a sense that consumers remain largely shielded from the trade war implies a quarter point  rather than a half point rate cut  BMO said 
3  U S  Crude Inventories on Tap
The weekly EIA crude inventories data  due Wednesday  is expected to show oil stockpiles fell for a second straight week  adding to the deeper production decline by major oil producers

WTI futures snapped a four day losing streak today to settle 2 4  higher at  54 37 a barrel  
Crude production  which remains close to record highs  will also be in focus as domestic output appears to be tailing off

1  Pound slides on reports of extended recess for U K  Parliament
The pound slid against the dollar and euro after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced he had requested Queen Elizabeth to suspend parliament from Sept  9 to Oct  14  
The move was hailed as a tactic to curtail parliamentary procedures that could lead to legislative changes that would prevent the U K  from leaving the European Union on Oct  31 without a deal  known as a  hard Brexit  
2  30 year Treasury yield hits record low
The yield on the 30 year U S  Treasury bond hit a record low  keeping markets on edge as they watch current yield curve inversions 
The 30 year yield fell below that of 3 month paper a day earlier for the first time since 2007  meaning that investors were willing to loan the U S  government money at a lower rate for the longer term bond 
The more closely followed premium on the 2 year over the 10 year  considered a precursor for recession  reached 6 basis points  a spread also not seen since 2007 
The 2 year rate has passed that of the 10 year ahead of every recession over the past 50 years  On average  yield curve inversion comes 22 months ahead of the impending recession  according to Credit Suisse 
3  U S  futures steady despite yield curve inversion
U S  futures held steady  managing a slight bounce after a triple digit decline in the Dow in the prior session 
Traders appeared to have taken a pause from concerns over the yield curve inversion  while Sino U S  trade tensions were put on the back burner as markets awaited the next round of tariffs 
Washington will apply the first stage of U S  tariffs on  300 billion worth of Chinese goods on Sunday  just ahead of the Labor Day holiday while Beijing will enact its retaliatory tariffs on the same day

COPENHAGEN  Reuters     Pandora   CO PNDORA   the world s biggest jeweler maker  will relaunch its brand at an event in Los Angeles later on Wednesday as it tries to attract middle class shoppers seeking affordable luxury back to its stores 
The Denmark based company  best known for its customisable silver charm bracelets  will completely revamp the design of its 2 700 shops worldwide  unveil a new logo  increase marketing campaigns featuring celebrities and launch themed collections  including Harry Potter and Walt Disney s Frozen 
Pandora s sales increased more than 10 fold in the decade to 2017 as it found a relatively unoccupied market niche between cheaper accessories found in stores like H M  ST HMb  and more expensive jewelry such as that from  Tiffany   Co    N TIF 
But a lack of innovation and overstretching itself at both the top and bottom end of the market has kept both shoppers and investors at bay recently 
 Customers tell us they used to think of Pandora as affordable but don t any more  The brand has drifted away from its original position and now we re trying to move it back to what made Pandora   Chief Executive Alexander Lacik told Reuters in an interview this week 
 We have to strengthen our position as an affordable jewelry brand big time   he said 
Lacik took the helm at Pandora  which sold 280 000 pieces of jewelry per day in 2018  in April after the former CEO was ousted last year after several profit warnings 
Investors have generally welcomed Pandora s new strategy  which was launched at the beginning of the year and focuses on cost savings  improved brand positioning and less promotions

HONG KONG  Reuters    Hong Kong s July retail sales sank by the most since February 2016 amid anti government protests that have gripped the Chinese ruled city for months 
Retail sales in July fell 11 4  from a year earlier  government data showed on Friday  as social unrest hurt consumer sentiment and visitor arrivals started to fall 
Unrest in Hong Kong escalated in mid June over a now suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial in Communist Party controlled courts 
The protests  which at times have turned violent  have evolved into broader calls for democracy for the former British colony which returned to Chinese rule in 1997 
Retail sales fell to HK 34 4 billion   4 4 billion  in July  a sixth consecutive month of declines  June s decline was 6 7   In volume terms  retail sales in July fell 13   compared with a 7 6  fall in June 
For the first seven months of 2019  retail sales fell 3 8  in value from a year earlier and 4 4  in volume terms 
Many businesses in Hong Kong are already facing strains from China s economic slowdown  a weak Chinese yuan and fallout from the Sino U S  trade war  while businesses say violence has added to the toll on tourism and the pivotal retailing industry 
 The situation may deteriorate further if the social incidents involving violence do not come to a stop   a government spokesman said  adding Sino U S  trade tensions and subdued economic conditions continued to dampen sentiment 
Banks are issuing unprecedented profit warnings  while hotels and restaurants are half empty  Several global events have been postponed and economists say retail sales  a key economic pillar in the Asian financial hub  could drop by 20  30  this year 
Hong Kong is also facing its first recession in a decade  with the government recently cutting its full year 2019 growth forecast to 0 1   down from 2  3  previously 
The Hong Kong Retail Management Association urged landlords to halve rents for six months and expected some retailers may have to sack staff or even shut down 
TOURISM HIT
Retailers had said they expected sales for July and August to drop by double digit percentage points from a year earlier  while hoteliers are bracing for a wave of cancellations 
The city s Federation of Trade Unions said hotel occupancy rates fell 20  in June from a year earlier  and probably 40  in July 
Tourism  especially from mainland China  has dropped markedly  Britain  Japan  Singapore and others have issued travel alerts 
 Tours from the mainland dropped by more than 90  in August  and many related workers were forced to take no pay leave   Paul Leung  chairman of Hong Kong Inbound Travel Association  told Reuters  He said the number of mainland tours had been cut to only 14 a day from 300 400 tours in the same period in 2018 
July tourist arrivals fell 4 8  on year to 5 197 million  according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board  the first decline since January 2018 and the biggest percentage drop since August 2016   https    That compared with 8 5  growth in June  Mainland visitors fell 5 5  in July  accounting for 80 1  of the total 
New York based luxury jeweler  Tiffany   Co   N TIF   which operates 10 stores in its fourth largest market in Hong Kong  said protests disrupted business 
Department store operator Lifestyle International  HK 1212  said outlook for the city s retail sector was challenging as people lose the appetite to consume

U S  government bond yields were also dragged lower by a plunge in the Bund as weaker than expected German PMIs renewed fears the euro zone may be heading for a recession 
Financials  mostly banks  were hit the hardest by the swoon in government bond yields  which stifles banks  ability to generate net interest

PulteGroup  NYSE PHM   DR Horton  NYSE DHI  and  Lennar  Corporation  NYSE LEN  ended the day sharply higher

1  GDP Expected to Tick Higher
Economic indicators pick up tomorrow with another reading on third quarter economic growth and the latest figures on new home sales 
The Bureau of Economic Analysis will release the second measure of third quarter GDP at 8 30 AM ET  13 30 GMT  
On average  economists expect that the economy grew at an annual rate of 3 6   up from the initial measure of 3 5  
For inflation watchers  core PCE prices are expected to hold steady at the first estimate of 1 6  annual growth 
Solid but tamer economic growth is expected for the fourth quarter and next year 
 The US economy has performed really well this year with a robust jobs market and massive tax cuts helping to generate the strongest year of GDP growth since 2005  But maintaining this momentum in 2019 will be hard  given the headwinds of the lagged effects of the strong dollar and higher interest rates along with the fading support from the fiscal stimulus and intensifying trade protectionism at a time of softer global growth   ING chief international economist James Knightley said 
At 10 AM ET  the Commerce Department will issue the new home sales numbers for October 
The market is looking for a rise of 3 7  for the month  rebounding from a drop in September

The Dow jumped more than 500 points  rising about 2 2  at 2 20 PM ET  19 20 GMT   The S P 500 was up 1 8  and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1 3

Many investors believe that the Fed can end its steady tightening cycle once a neutral rate is reached 
Powell said the Fed s  gradual pace of raising interest rates has been an exercise in balancing risks   but added  there is no preset policy path

15212,236727,TIF,Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,news,"Investing com   Top 5 things that rocked U S  markets this week 
1  Trade Takes Market on a Rollercoaster Ride
There was a burst of optimism about trade in the market during the week  but that didn t last until the closing bell Friday 
The U S  announced a bilateral deal with Mexico Monday  But tension built throughout the week as the U S  announced there was a Friday deadline to bring Canada into a newly revamped NAFTA 
The U S  and Canada missed that deadline  but announced that talks would resume next Wednesday  leaving the market facing more wait and see trading days 
There was also drama during Friday s discussions after the Toronto Star reported that Trump told Bloomberg off the record he had no plans to give any concessions at all to Canada 
The president appeared to later confirm that stance in a tweet  saying Canada now knows where he stands 



Trade worries spread beyond North America  though  Trump told Bloomberg he was prepared to withdraw from the WTO if necessary  And he plans to move ahead with tariffs on  200 billion in Chinese imports as soon as a public comment period concludes next week  Bloomberg reported 
China s foreign ministry said Friday that the U S  putting pressure on Beijing would not work 
2  Retailers See Wild Earnings Swings  Sector Rises

Among big movers  Abercrombie   Fitch  NYSE ANF  stock plummeted second quarter revenue and same store sales missed estimates 
 Best Buy   NYSE BBY  stock tumbled despite better than expected second quarter revenue and earnings as online sales slowed and the company warned that it is  expecting a non GAAP operating income rate decline in the third quarter  
Dick s Sporting Goods  NYSE DKS  stock tanked after second quarter revenue missed expectations and it forecast a 3  to 4  decline in consolidated same store sales for 2018  But it recovered a lot of lost ground

3  Tesla Is Staying Public  Musk Is Still Tweeting
Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  shares started the week with a quick drop and finished it lower as it scrapped plans to go private 
CEO Elon Musk wrote in a blog late on Friday  Aug  24 that he would not move forward with a plan to take the company private  noting that after speaking with retail and institutional shareholders that  the sentiment  in a nutshell  was  please don t do this   
Musk surprised the market out of the blue  tweeting he was thinking of taking the company private at  420 per share and had funding secured  The SEC was interested in whether the tweet was designed in away to punish short sellers  according to reports 
But Musk didn t stay clear of controversy for long  On Sunday  he tweeted about a British diver who was involved in the Thai cave rescue and whom Musk had previously called  a pedo   Musk replied to a tweet  saying it was curious the man  Vernon Unsworth  didn t sue him for the remark  Unsworth s lawyer said in a letter the tweets were  false and defamatory  
4  Consumer Stays Strong  Housing Still Wobbles

5  Oil Finishes Higher in August
Oil closed out the month higher as traders balanced expectations of crude supply losses with the potential of trade wars denting global demand 
China  the world s largest commodity importer  has seen economic growth dwindle since the trade war with the U S  kicked off  and a further escalation could dent growth  forcing Beijing to rein in crude imports 
Oil prices ended the month nearly 2  higher on bets on renewed global supply shortage as U S  sanctions on Iran s crude exports are expected to reduce crude from market  underpinning higher crude prices

1  NAFTA Deal Likely  Hours  Away
With summer drawing to a close  trade related headlines could be the main driver of sentiment in the week ahead 
U S  and Mexican trade negotiators are  hours  away from squaring away bilateral differences on the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo told reporters as he entered the offices of the U S  Trade Representative 
 We ve continued making progress   Guajardo said 
Talks are set to resume at 9 00AM ET in Washington 
President Donald Trump tweeted on Saturday morning that the United States   relationship with Mexico is getting closer by the hour  Some really good people within both the new and old government  and all working closely together    A big Trade Agreement with Mexico could be happening soon  
The U S  and Mexico have been holding bilateral talks aimed at resolving their differences before bringing Canada back to the talks 
All three governments are hoping to reach a new NAFTA agreement in principle by the end of August 
2  U S  Stocks Set to Extend Push into Record Territory
U S  stock index futures ticked higher  suggesting Wall Street would extend its push into record territory  after a market friendly speech by Fed Chairman Powell and signs of progress on a U S  Mexico NAFTA trade deal 
The blue chip Dow futures were up 75 points  or around 0 3   at 5 40AM ET  the S P 500 futures tacked on 7 points  or around 0 3   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a gain of 32 points  or roughly 0 4  
Stocks ended higher on Friday  with the S P 500 and Nasdaq composite indexes closing at record highs  The Dow meanwhile was still around 3  away for its all time high 
A number of earnings reports are expected this week as the quarterly reporting season winds down 
The retail sector will remain in focus with  Best Buy   NYSE BBY   Tiffany  NYSE TIF   Dick s Sporting Goods  NYSE DKS   PVH  NYSE PVH   Kroger  NYSE KR   Dollar General  NYSE DG   Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR   Lululemon  NASDAQ LULU   and Ulta Beauty  NASDAQ ULTA  all set to release earnings 
Other S P 500 members scheduled to report earnings this week include Salesforce com  NYSE CRM   H R Block  NYSE HRB   and HP Enterprise  NYSE HPE  



Elsewhere  in Europe  the majority of the region s major bourses were higher in mid morning trade  with most sectors in positive territory  British markets were closed for a public holiday 
Earlier  Chinese markets led gains in a mostly positive trading session across Asia  after the country s central bank reintroduced a policy adjustment aimed at supporting the yuan  which hit a two and a half week high against the U S  dollar 
3  Tesla Sinks After Musk Abandons Buyout
Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  shares looked set for a big down day as investors reacted to Chief Executive Elon Musk s decision to abandon a proposed  72 billion buyout to take the electric car maker private 
Musk said in a blog post late on Friday that his decision to scuttle the proposed deal was motivated in part by existing Tesla shareholders who said they wanted the company to remain publicly traded 
Tesla s shares  already down nearly 10  from their level on Aug  7  just before Musk tweeted that he had  funding secured  for a buyout at  420 a share  fell 4 4  in pre market trade to  308 60 
Both Musk and Tesla face investor lawsuits and a U S  Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the accuracy of Musk s tweet 
4  Dollar Stabilizes After Powell 
Away from equities  the U S  dollar was little changed against a basket of the other major currencies  stabilizing after remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week sent the greenback lower 
At a closely watched symposium at Jackson Hole  Wyoming  the Fed chairman on Friday emphasized the central bank s push to raise interest rates despite President Donald Trump s recent criticism of higher borrowing costs 
Powell made the case that gradual rate hikes are the best way to protect the U S  economic recovery and keep job growth as strong as possible and inflation under control 
His comments were also seen to have disappointed some dollar bulls hoping for a more hawkish message 
The U S  dollar index held steady at around 95 10  after slipping more than 0 5  in the previous session 
In the bond market  the two year yield edged up as the Fed stuck to its rate hike trajectory  while the central bank s restrained inflation view anchored the 10 year yield  resulting in the flattest yield curve since 2007 
5  Oil Dips As Oversupply Concerns Remain

International Brent crude oil futures were at  75 78 per barrel  down 34 cents from their last close 
U S  West Texas Intermediate WTI crude futures were down 31 cents at  68 41 a barrel

U S  President Donald Trump said he planned to talk to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau soon  according to Reuters  which means that news on progress or tweets from Trump could swing the markets at any time

2  Can  Best Buy  Keep Its Rally Going 
Best Buy  NYSE BBY  reports earnings before the bell  with shareholders hoping it can keep the retail rally going

LONDON  Reuters    U S  hedge fund Hudson Bay Capital is opening an office in Britain to expand its European trading book  two sources told Reuters on Tuesday 
Hudson Bay  which runs  2 8 billion in assets across equity  credit and other assets  has hired a team of three for its new London base and plans to add more staff  the sources with direct knowledge of the matter said 
Other U S  hedge funds are have also increased investment in Europe  including high profile activists such as Elliott Advisers  amid increased competition and less attractive valuations at home 
Elliott had its most active first quarter in Europe in at least five years  and more than 211 U S  based hedge funds already have British bases  Preqin data showed 
Britain continues to be a popular destination for U S  hedge funds seeking to trade financial products in Europe in spite of its upcoming exit from the European Union 
 I think  Hudson Bay   along with many others  still see London as the European financial center and the people they want to hire want to live here   said one of the sources 
Founded in 2005 and led by Sander Gerber  Hudson Bay s stakes include TripAdvisor  Madrigal Pharmaceuticals and Tiffany   Co  NYSE TIF   Thomson Reuters data showed 
Its main fund  the Hudson Bay International Fund  was up 4 4 percent in the year to end May  one source said

The letter escalates long held criticisms of a board that CtW and several investors have faulted for being beholden to Musk  Tesla s chief executive officer  The company has burned through almost  4 billion during the past year while scaling up operations for the Model 3  intended to be its first mass manufactured car  The sedan has missed several production targets and stoked concerns about whether the company has enough cash 
A Tesla spokesman didn t immediately comment  The shares rose 0 3 percent to  303 as of 8 40 a m  in New York  before the start of regular trading 
Wide Ranging Concerns
While praising Tesla as a  successful innovator with an environmental mission   CtW s Waizenegger writes that the company s prospects for continued success are  more tenuous than ever  and that the board needs to  raise its game  
The wide ranging letter raises concerns with matters including Musk s combative earnings call with analysts last week  safety issues at Tesla s California assembly plant  fatal crashes involving the driver assistance system Autopilot and litigation related to the company s controversial acquisition of SolarCity Corp 
 In response to these considerable financial and operational challenges  the Tesla board has been unduly deferential toward Chairman and CEO Elon Musk   Waizenegger writes   Mr  Musk s peripatetic focus    he is also CEO of SpaceX  a proponent of the hyperloop  and apparently about to start a candy company    is exacerbated  rather than contained  by a board most of whose members have family or non Tesla ties to him  lack industry experience  and have no track record of effective independent board service at a public company  
Gracias  a Tesla director since 2007  has both personal and professional ties to Musk  46  The founder of Valor Equity Management invested in Paypal Inc   which Musk co founded  and participated along with Valor in funding rounds and a debt raise that Tesla conducted before its 2010 initial public offering  Musk gave Gracias the second Roadster sports car that the company built  He s also on the board of Space Exploration Technologies Corp 
 The lead independent director should be leading a process of renewing and modernizing the board by recruiting well qualified  diverse  and independent directors with a combination of industry and governance experience   Waizenegger writes   Given his longstanding conflicts  we see no likelihood that Mr  Gracias will change course and initiate this long overdue process  
 Inexplicable  Nomination
CtW also knocks Tesla for re nominating Kimbal Musk  45  who lacks relevant industry experience or  a track record of effective public company board service   according to Waizenegger  He became director of  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc   NYSE CMG   in 2013  and shareholders rejected the company s executive compensation plan the next year  The stock slumped during a prolonged food safety crisis 
 We would find it inexplicable if Tesla were anything like a well run public company   Waizenegger said of Kimbal Musk s re nomination 
CtW was among the group of influential investors that pressed Tesla in April 2017 to add new directors who didn t have ties to Elon Musk  citing concerns about the lack of independence on the board  The carmaker named longtime media executives James Murdoch  the son of News Corp  NASDAQ NWSA   Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch  and Linda Johnson Rice  chairman of Johnson Publishing Co 
Waizenegger listed scandals involving companies James Murdoch managed  including News Corp  s phone hacking episode and Twenty First Century Fox s sexual harassment lawsuits  Murdoch doesn t appear to have any experience in manufacturing or engineering  Waizenegger writes 
 Given that the simultaneous appointment of Linda Johnson Rice added significant media experience to the board   Waizenegger writes   it is not clear why Tesla would need two directors with media but not automotive backgrounds  
Track Record
CtW has organized campaigns to vote against directors previously over a lack of independence and diversity  including at Urban Outfitters Inc  NASDAQ URBN   and Tiffany   Co  NYSE TIF   last year  At Urban Outfitters  meeting last May  as many as two thirds of outside shareholders voted against a director the firm opposed  and investors including Norges Bank and CalSTRS joined CtW in opposition  The shareholder response at Tiffany s was more muted  but the company has since named a new CEO and new chairman 
Waizenegger describes Tesla s board as  a holdover  from the company s earliest days  when the carmaker was a private company under Musk s control 
 Now that Tesla s IPO is eight years in the past  a modernization of the Tesla board is long overdue   he writes

15297,236812,TIF,Special Report  How Philip Morris is selling regulators on its hot new smoking device,news,By Paritosh Bansal  Tom Lasseter  Duff Wilson Thomas Wilson  Ami Miyazaki and Aditya Kalra TOKYO TEL AVIV BOGOTA  Reuters    In Tokyo s upscale Ginza shopping district  around the corner from the sparkling storefronts of Tiffany   Co  NYSE TIF  and Cartier  shoppers searching for a new device called iQOS can buy it in a boutique behind a glass fa ade  The store combines a high tech aesthetic with the feel of an exclusive club  The young woman at the door says a members only smoking lounge is upstairs  The device is advertised under the slogan   This changes everything   with a hummingbird in fluorescent green and blue floating in midair  From the small  i  of its name when it was rolled out to the minimalist white box it comes in  the iQOS evokes the marketing and design savvy of the American technology giant Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   But this little machine is sold by the tobacco giant Philip Morris International Inc  NYSE PM   And it isn t a smartphone  The iQOS is essentially an electronic cigarette that heats   without burning   plugs of tobacco  releasing tendrils of nicotine laced aerosol  And the world s largest publicly traded tobacco company by market value  which has spent more than  3 billion in developing new smoking devices  says iQOS is nothing less than its future  Philip Morris International says the lack of combustion means iQOS produces far lower levels of carcinogens than regular cigarettes  It s early days  but iQOS is already bringing in piles of cash  The device drove up sales of the company s new generation smoking products to nearly  1 billion in the last quarter  from some  200 million just a year ago  Wowing consumers with the prospect of a less harmful smoke built on flashy technology is essential to iQOS  rapid success  Consumers  though  aren t the only target  Interviews with government officials and trade groups reveal how the company is seeking to sell national authorities on the benefits of the device  before regulators can toss up hurdles  A key objective  convince governments of iQOS  benefits so they don t slap the same taxes and restrictions on the device as they do on cigarettes  Philip Morris is employing a novel argument  The tobacco plugs inserted into the iQOS device shouldn t be classified as cigarettes because they do not burn or produce smoke  And the device itself  the company says  is an electronic product and so should not be regulated like tobacco  In Japan  Philip Morris blitzed officials with the science of iQOS to persuade them to classify the device in a way that would lead to a lower tax rate than cigarettes  In Israel  the company flew in an executive to convince a senior health official of the upside of the device  And in Colombia  the health ministry says Philip Morris launched iQOS without seeking the agency s approval  The approach is outlined in internal company documents seen by Reuters  Evidence that iQOS  is  not smoked  is the most critical element   says a 2014 PowerPoint briefing on iQOS and other new smoking devices  Reuters has published that document and others in a searchable repository  The Philip Morris Files     Other traditional cigarette companies  notably  British American Tobacco   LON BATS  Plc and Japan Tobacco Inc  have launched similar devices  None have reported anything close to the global sales of iQOS  UNLIKELY VENUE The iQOS is championed by Andre Calantzopoulos  Philip Morris International s chief executive  who in media interviews makes the point that he smokes the device  In September last year  Calantzopoulos told investors it was the company s  aim to become the undisputed leader  of a new tobacco category it dubs  reduced risk products   The goal he said  is to have  RRPs  ultimately replace regular cigarettes  Philip Morris now has an application pending at the U S  Food and Drug Administration for permission to market the device in America as being less harmful than cigarettes  A Reuters investigation published Wednesday identified shortcomings in the training and professionalism of some of the lead investigators in the clinical trials that underpin the tobacco giant s application to the FDA  Former Philip Morris employees and contractors described irregularities in those experiments  The company chose Japan as its first iQOS market  launching in late 2014  If the company could achieve its goals in  priority  markets like Japan  it would provide  good reference points to other countries   said the 2014 Philip Morris presentation on reduced risk products like iQOS  It unveiled the device in an unlikely venue   Nagoya  a city of more than 2 million people on a bay of the Pacific Ocean  Nagoya is close to Toyota Motor Corp s headquarters  a town of skyscrapers and automotive plants  a place with neither the buzz of Tokyo nor the charm of Kyoto  At first  business lagged  An internal company review of Asia  dated June 2015  put iQOS sales figures toward the end of the Japan market rundown  It showed iQOS sales dropping about 40 percent from that January to May  Philip Morris pushed ahead with a national expansion in September 2015  In an in house newsletter for the Japan operations the next month  Ashok Rammohan  director of reduced risk products  told employees that  building iQOS will take time and focus as we need to educate LAS    legal age smokers  By early 2016  the buzz surrounding iQOS in Japan was growing  thanks in part to a group of Japanese entertainers  That April  six popular Japanese comedians were on a national TV show when the presenters began to talk about smoking  One of the comedians  Terumoto Goto  a household name  held up a red iQOS   It doesn t release smoke   he explained   It s like steam coming out of my mouth   The five men sitting around him on the TV set  decorated with bright rainbow stripes  held up iQOS units as well  Goto said he bought an iQOS because his wife wouldn t let him smoke cigarettes inside their house and the neighbors didn t like him standing around and smoking outside  Toshiyuki Itakura  just behind Goto  chimed in about smoking the device in public   There doesn t seem to be any harm   Searches on Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  for the Japanese word for iQOS spiked that day  The talent agency that represents Goto and Itakura  Yoshimoto Kogyo Co Ltd  said in a statement   Our company received absolutely no payment from Philip Morris or affiliated companies  for the appearance  The network that carried the show  TV Asahi Corp  said it did not consult with the tobacco company beforehand   THAT IQOS MOMENT  That promotional bump came during a period when Philip Morris was working to use social media to propel iQOS into the national consciousness   That IQOS moment    My IQOS way of living   Those are two of the catchphrases the company s social media team considered using as catalysts to promote online chatter about the device  The guidance appears in a 2017 online content strategy paper  marked  confidential   that cites examples from Japan  A separate document  a 54 page training handbook for social media teams in 2016  warns that the company s postings walk a fine line   Since the law is set up to prevent tobacco companies from promoting their products on social media  and iQOS is a product that uses tobacco  you ll always be walking through a minefield of sorts   the document says  Away from the public eye  Philip Morris employees equipped with pages of scientific findings were lobbying government officials in Japan  They set out to convince regulators to tax iQOS at a lower rate than cigarettes and exempt it from ordinances that ban smoking in public places and restaurants  Koki Okamoto  a member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly  said the city s planned public smoking regulations almost certainly will exempt iQOS   My personal view  as a lawyer  is that there will be reluctance to apply penalties to something without scientific evidence on health hazards   said Okamoto  a lead for tobacco control issues in the party that won the capital s elections this July  To date  Philip Morris is responsible for the majority of the science that has been published about iQOS   Philip Morris executives say the product is meant only for people who would not otherwise quit smoking  That is inconsistent with where the company has chosen to introduce iQOS   Industry sales numbers show Philip Morris is selling iQOS almost entirely in countries where cigarette sales are already in decline   in other words  where people are quitting  While the global average for cigarette sales was down 1 9 percent from 2005 to 2016  in 30 countries where iQOS is now sold the drop in sales was about 30 percent  according to a Reuters analysis of industry numbers from Euromonitor International  Philip Morris said in response that there are more than 180 million smokers in the countries where iQOS has been launched   Those 180 million people deserve an opportunity to switch to a potentially less harmful product than cigarettes   the company said  As the company honed its strategy in Japan   impressing officials with its scientific findings while advocating for lower taxes   it set out to conquer new markets  HOLY LAND LAUNCH  More than half a year before iQOS launched in Israel  Moira Gilchrist  a corporate affairs vice president for reduced risk products  flew into the Holy Land and took a March 2016 meeting with a senior health ministry official to talk about the company s science  A few weeks after that meeting  the official  Itamar Grotto  sent a letter to the country s tax authority saying iQOS was in a new product category exempt from marketing and advertising restrictions on tobacco products  In a later court filing  Philip Morris cited the letter in explaining its decision to launch iQOS in Israel   Asked why he said iQOS was exempt from tobacco regulations  Grotto told Reuters that the ministry was being cautious after losing a case against e cigarette companies a few years earlier  Grotto also said he thought at the time that the question of regulating iQOS was  theoretical   He had understood from Philip Morris that it did not plan to market the device in Israel until it had approval from a European or American regulatory authority  Grotto said   Told of Grotto s remarks  Philip Morris said in a statement   We did not state that PMI would wait for the approval of a foreign regulatory authority   In Israel  iQOS has faced obstacles  This March  a group headed by an activist named Shabi Gatenio challenged the health ministry and Philip Morris in the country s top court over the sale of iQOS without the same marketing restrictions imposed on regular cigarettes  An Israeli tobacco company also challenged the government and Philip Morris in a similar filing   During an interview in Tel Aviv  Gatenio  45  marveled at the reach and access of Philip Morris  He said within two and half hours of his filing the court petition  before it had become public  he got a text message from Erez Gil Har  co chief executive of Policy Ltd  Philip Morris  powerful lobbying company in Israel  The message  viewed by Reuters  accused Gatenio of becoming a  tool  in the hands of the local tobacco company   a charge he dismisses   Gil Har  who attended the meeting with Grotto and Philip Morris  Gilchrist  declined to comment  The tobacco company  Dubek Ltd  declined to talk as well  Before the court could give a final ruling  the health ministry reversed its position and said it would treat iQOS as it does traditional cigarettes  The ministry said it planned to revisit its decision after seeing how the U S  FDA regulates the product  The about turn left Philip Morris scrambling  According to a government official familiar with the matter  Philip Morris hired more than two dozen women for an urgent task  They manually peeled off the old labels from thousands of tobacco insert packs in a warehouse near Tel Aviv and stuck on new ones with more prominent health warnings  The packs were then released   DERIVED FROM TOBACCO  Half a world away in Colombia  Philip Morris kicked off its sale of iQOS this March with a large white balloon at a music festival  Emblazoned with  iQOS  in blue and green letters  the balloon was hoisted 20 feet in the air by a crane  Tobacco advertising and promotion are banned in Colombia  the first country in Latin America to get iQOS  According to a health ministry official  Philip Morris launched iQOS without getting approval from the agency to sell the tobacco inserts in the country as is required by law    This is a product which is derived from tobacco and which must have a prior evaluation by this ministry   said senior health ministry official Jose Fernando Valderrama   Philip Morris said it is in compliance with Colombian law  The company said it is required to submit the tobacco inserts for health ministry approval following the release of the agency s tobacco warnings in November each year  Its Colombian affiliate will do so  in the next month   the company said in a Dec  7 statement to Reuters  On a stroll through the capital Bogota a few months ago  iQOS could be seen being sold at the front of a restaurant with bright displays of packs of the tobacco inserts and the hummingbird emblem facing the sidewalk  In a trendy quarter of the city  a large white billboard advertised a coming  iQOS Boutique   next to a Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  and an Apple retailer   A former Philip Morris employee in Bogota said the company s position is that because the device itself does not include tobacco  unlike the inserts  marketing restrictions don t apply to it  The company confirmed that position  saying iQOS is an electronic device  and  as such  the current tobacco law does not regulate its commercialization as a tobacco product   Back in Japan  sales of the device have taken off  Philip Morris says the iQOS tobacco inserts made up 11 9 percent of the Japanese tobacco market in the third quarter  up from 3 5 percent a year ago  That growth took on additional significance for company revenue in light of the lower tax rates  The iQOS kit retails for about 11 000 Japanese yen  roughly  100  The company said that cigarettes in Japan are taxed at 60 percent  while the iQOS tobacco inserts   priced about the same as a pack of Marlboros   are at 51 percent   Philip Morris shows no signs of slowing down  Paul Riley  president of the company s operations in Japan  this January called on Emiko Takagai  who as a former vice health minister is an influential voice on national health policy  They met in Takagai s seventh floor office in Tokyo  one decorated with stuffed animals and posters of healthy food groups  During that conversation  Riley laid out the company s pitch on iQOS  said Takagai  In documents later sent to her office  Philip Morris said the product reduces the levels of harmful substances by at least 90 percent compared to regular cigarettes  When Reuters in August interviewed Takagai  a member of the upper house of parliament for the nation s ruling party  it seemed the tobacco giant s message was hitting home   If the company s scientific claims bear out  she said   we must make efforts to thoroughly tell people

15298,236813,TIF,Fields of Gold  Jana seeks new money  allies with impact hedge fund,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss and Ross Kerber BOSTON  Reuters    Wall Street investor Barry Rosenstein s new impact investing fund aimed at serving environmental and social causes could  if he plays his cards right  enhance his traditional business of pushing companies to boost earnings  The founder of JANA Partners has tapped British musician and activist Sting to sit on the new fund s advisory board and burnish his credentials with green and socially conscious investors he hopes will pledge at least  1 billion  That amount is a fraction of the billions that have been pulled from Jana since 2015  Its assets have shrunk by more than half to  5 billion since then  as hedge fund investors fled to cheaper  passive products  Still  it gives him an important foothold in the growing arena of  responsible investing   Industry watchers said Rosenstein could forge more alliances with institutional investors that could carry over to Jana s main business  pushing companies to make financial changes that often include recapitalizing or restructuring the business   There is a longer game here than just this one fund   said a hedge fund industry advisor who is not permitted to speak publicly about individual hedge fund firms   The new fund will create a bridge with other institutional investors which Jana may need in its future activism   People familiar with the fundraising say commitments have already been made and interest is high  The fund will not be a typical hedge fund product  people familiar with the matter say  noting the fees are expected to be lower  Jana made its first foray into socially minded investments this month  pressuring Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  to give parents more control over the setup options of their children s iPhones  The fund partnered with CalSTRS  the largest U S  public sector teachers  pension fund and one that is increasingly emphasizing social responsibility in its bets  Calstrs does not invest with Jana but with  222 billion in assets under management  more than half of it in stocks  it could be a powerful ally in future activist fights  Apple reacted quickly  promising new parental controls  and the hedge fund industry is chalking this up as a victory for Jana  Calstrs spokeswoman Michelle Mussuto declined to comment on its work with Jana   Rosenstein cut his activist teeth during the 1980s heyday for corporate raiders  a background that has made traditional environmental  social and governance  ESG  activists doubt the sincerity of his pivot to socially conscious investing  Last year  John Mackey  CEO of Whole Foods  called Jana  greedy bastards  as the hedge fund pushed for a sale of the grocery chain  Charles Penner  a partner at Jana  defended the new direction    It is not inconsistent with what we have done historically  it is just different   he said  The Jana Impact Capital Fund is set to launch later this year  Joining Sting as an advisor is Patricia Daly  a nun who battled  Exxon Mobil  Corp  NYSE XOM  over environmental disclosures  Sustainability expert Robert Eccles  who has taught at Harvard Business School  will also be on board  None of the three were available to comment  WALL STREET CHOPS Until recently  activism in the responsible investing space was largely the preserve of religious funds and public pension leaders with a genteel approach to boardroom battles and the patience to wait years for progress  But now more major investors  including sovereign wealth funds and pensions  are pushing companies on issues like climate change  income and gender equality  By bringing some hard charging Wall Street chops into this arena  Jana could stand out and  if successful  curry favor with such investors      In its 17 year history  Jana has waged roughly 75 activist campaigns at companies ranging from Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  to Tiffany   Co  NYSE TIF    delivering an annualized average return of 11 percent in its flagship fund  Its JSI fund  which concentrates purely on activist situations  has returned an annualized 18 percent since its 2010 launch after gaining 22 percent in 2017  matching the S P 500 s 22 percent gain  The flagship Jana Partners fund  meanwhile  gained 5 6 percent last year  underperforming the Standard   Poor s 500 stock index   At a time when flows to hedge funds have been thin  the socially responsible space is appealing  Net deposits into socially responsible mutual funds were  4 7 billion in 2017  a 22 percent jump from the year before and a large leap from 2013  when investors directed just  1 billion into the category  One reason is returns  A Vanguard fund based on the popular FTSE4Good US Select Index of ESG stocks for instance beat the S P 500 in three of the last five years  including in 2017  according to Morningstar  Hedge funds are still smarting from  70 billion in redemptions in 2016  Hedge Fund Research data show  The sector  including activist funds  did see an uptick of investor inflows in 2017  with  2 9 billion added in the first three quarters    A BIT OF A STRETCH  Jana s past record of shareholder activism means it is carrying some baggage as its climbs onto the responsible investing bandwagon  some people say  Some investors think the firm has a way to go to prove its commitment to social and environmental concerns      The new fund is  a bit of stretch  no question  said Seamus Finn  chairman of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility  whose members include religious groups  foundations and other organizations      Some of Finn s members have described Jana as disinterested at best in their efforts to get companies to heed environmental or social concerns  Jana s Penner said the firm would not have been able to take up such causes in the past because it was not part of its investment profile   We didn t have a mandate to do that   he said             Boston Common Asset Management  which has a long running partnership with energy producer  Apache Corp   NYSE APA  aimed at improving sustainability and protecting the rights of indigenous peoples  said it did not hear from Jana when it took a stake in Apache in 2014     But Geeta Aiyer  Boston Common s president  is willing to give Jana the benefit of the doubt  
     If they move from the business of shortening already short time horizons to taking a longer term view  it could put to bed this whole debate about whether being a responsible investor is somehow bad for returns   Aiyer said ",2018-01-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/fields-of-gold-jana-seeks-new-money-allies-with-impact-hedge-fund-1099066,1099066

At 15 35GMT or 11 35AM ET  the Dow 30 gained 169 points  or 0 96   while the S P 500 rose 15 points  or 0 72   and the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite traded up 28 points  or 0 57  
The minutes from the last Fed meeting along with a string of hawkish comments from officials of the U S  central bank had been efficient in getting the market to adjust its odds on a summer rate hike 
Fed funds futures were discounting the probability of a rate hike in June at 38  on Wednesday  a far cry from the 4  in the week prior to the minutes  while a move in July had risen to odds of 61  
Markets were left to digest a string of data between the present and the June 15 meeting  not to mention Fed chair Janet Yellen s own view on the economy that should be presented first on Friday and perhaps more importantly on June 6 
Meanwhile  the advanced trade deficit data reported on Wednesday gave a positive for growth  The report caused Goldman Sachs to increase its forecast for U S  second quarter gross domestic product  GDP  to 3 0   from the prior 2 7    Morgan Stanley similarly upped its own estimate from 2 0  to 2 4  based on its own read 
However  not all of Wednesday s numbers were so chipper  Markit s services purchasing managers  index  PMI  slipped to a three month low in May with business optimism at a six and a half year low 
Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said that the deterioration in the composite data for May  deal a blow to hopes that the U S  economy will rebound in the second quarter after the dismal start to the year  
Contrary to the aforementioned investment bank forecasts  Williamson predicts growth of only 0 7  for the second quarter 
In other economic data  the house price index for March rose 0 7   compared to expectations for an increase of 0 4  
Late Tuesday  St  Louis Fed president James Bullard did suggest that a rate hike in June was  not set in stone   and insisted that the final decision would depend on the data 
However  he did note in the interview with CNBC that if labor market data was the only factor   then we d definitely move  
On Wednesday  Philadelphia Fed president Patrick Harker largely repeated the view he delivered last Monday  stating that there could be two to three hikes this year 
He noted that he saw no significant risk from China and that while global events were relevant  they don t drive his own decision making process 
Later in the session  Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari is due to deliver comments at the Williston Basin Petroleum Conference in North Dakota at 15 40GMT  or 11 40AM ET  while Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan speaks in Houston at 18 00GMT  or 2 00PM ET

in big markets such as Hong Kong  mainland China  Russia and the United States  But some of Cartier s problems are specific to the brand  setting up a challenge for Cyrille Vigneron when he takes over the leadership next month   Improving Cartier s image as a watchmaker in China  where wealthy women love its red boxes but men prefer pure watch brands such as Rolex  Patek Philippe or Vacheron Constantin  may be top of his to do list   Cartier is popular among fashion focused customers in Hong Kong  Consumers will regard it as a piece of jewelry when they hear the brand  it is particularly popular among ladies   said Lam Tung hing  general manager of the Hong Kong retail operations of Oriental Watch Holdings Ltd   For men  first time luxury watch buyer will choose to buy Rolex  which is practical and good looking   Cartier and Richemont declined to comment on the brand s strategy to improve watch sales   Richemont said last month that watch sales were down mid single digits in the six months to September  dragged down by its biggest markets  Hong Kong and the United States  It had already stated a similar decline for Cartier watches in the full year to March  Shares have fallen over 12 percent this year   Comparisons with competitors are hard to make  Rolex is privately owned and at LVMH  watch and jewelry sales rose 10 percent during the first nine months but it does not give a separate watch figure  Swatch Group  VX UHR  shares have fallen 18 percent  partly due to competition from smartwatches and the drop in demand from China   Watch exports from Switzerland  where Cartier and other watches are made  fell 3 2 percent during the first ten months of 2015 with shipments to Hong Kong down 22 7 percent and rising just 0 1 percent to the United States  Pierluigi Fedele  who is responsible for watchmaking at the Swiss union Unia  downplayed any talk of a crisis    There is no real crisis in the Swiss watch industry today  Exports are down a bit  but probably still above 20 billion Swiss francs for the whole year   he said  NO MORE CHINESE GIFTS But he noted the subdued Asian market was causing problems for some companies and a few had laid off staff  Cartier said last year it introduced shorter working hours for some employees and would not say if the measure was still in place         Some analysts estimate that the high end watch market in mainland China is down 60 percent since its 2012 peak  This is partly due to the government s crackdown on the tradition of gifts for favors which often involved watches  Richemont also highlighted difficulties in Macau where the casino industry is suffering from the crackdown on corruption  the weak yuan and Chinese government restrictions on travel   The strong franc has made Swiss exports more expensive while Tiffany   Co  N TIF  forecast a bigger fall in full year profit than previously expected as a strong dollar kept tourists from spending in its showpiece U S  stores   Last month s terrorist attacks in Paris are also expected to further dent tourists  travels to Europe to buy luxury goods during the pre Christmas period which  for some brands  represent up to a quarter of annual sales   NEW IDEAS But for Cartier  whose sparkling creations adorned royal heads around the globe in the early 20th century and more recently Kate Middleton s at her wedding to Prince William  the challenges are bigger than for most  Exane  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP  analyst Luca Solca said Cartier is particularly exposed to China    Cartier is facing a relatively subdued luxury market  as the bulk of the other mega brands  Additionally  Cartier is suffering from the step back in the Chinese watch market   gifting practices  You could argue Cartier has not been the strongest innovator in recent years   he said   Lack of innovation has been a problem and Vigneron  who replaces Stanislas de Quercize  a 25 year Richemont group veteran who stepped down last month  will need to focus on this  Many of Cartier s new watches have been based on existing versions with innovation focused on the most expensive models  In January  Cartier unveiled its first new model in eight years  the Cl  watch  but so far only gold models costing more than 10 000 euros are available  According to a person close to the Richemont group who declined to be named  about 90 percent of buyers of Cl  since its launch have been women   The way to be successful is  first of all  with product innovation because in a subdued environment that is the way you can maybe get the consumer to buy a new watch   said Bernstein analyst Mario Ortelli   The company is also a relative newcomer in  in house  watch movements  the mechanisms that make a watch tick and are beloved of collectors  When Swatch Group  the world s largest watchmaker  started phasing out delivery of watch movement components to the rest of the industry  competitors were forced to develop their own manufacturing tools  now an important part of the prestige of high end watches   Lam says in China Cartier chased the mass market on the mainland and paid less attention to the top technical design required by buyers in Hong Kong   Many local collectors will have a question mark as the design appeared as not as good   he said   MORE SOCCER  LESS POLO In marketing as well  Cartier could do with a few fresh ideas  While Omega s name is omnipresent at the Olympic Games and each new James Bond movie and Rolex cultivates its image as a sports brand  Cartier relies on its signature panther and other more traditional attributes  It has sponsored polo for more than 30 years but competitors such as Hublot have been a bit more adventurous by doing deals with soccer teams and ski schools in resorts such as Courchevel  
Richemont thinks Vigneron  a music composer and guitar player who was rehired at Cartier after heading LVMH s operations in Japan  is the right man to lead Cartier back to growth   He is known for thinking out of the box   said one Cartier employee based in London   I think a lot of people have high hopes for him    1    1 0000 ",2015-12-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/cartier's-new-boss-must-put-the-sparkle-back-in-watches-375012,375012
15427,236942,TIF,Holiday shopping unlikely to cheer many investors,news,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    The holiday shopping rush that kicked off on Friday is unlikely to bring much cheer to investors looking for a revival in retail stocks 
After months of uninspiring sales growth and recent disappointments from Macy s and Nordstrom  N JWN   shareholders of apparel sellers have had little to be thankful for and face a challenging holiday season 
Retail sales were expected to grow by 3 7 percent in November and December  declining slightly from the 4 1 percent growth in the 2014 year period  the National Retail Federation  NRF  said in a forecast reaffirmed on Sunday 
NRF s survey of 4 281 consumers showed shoppers on average spent or planned to spend about  300 over the Thanksgiving weekend  which ran from Thursday  Nov  26 through Sunday  Nov  29 
That is down from about  381 over the same weekend last year  although the federation said those numbers are not comparable because of a change in its survey s methodology  The survey also showed an equal number of U S  shoppers sought to buy items online as they did in physical stores over the Thanksgiving weekend 
Shares of Macys and Nordstrom have reflected a shift by consumers away from discretionary items like designer label clothes and cosmetics toward online spending and merchandise such as smartphones  televisions  home goods and travel 
Macy s stock has plummeted 39 percent this year while Nordstrom is down 22 percent and Tiffany   Co  N TIF  is 23 percent lower   all far worse than the benchmark S P 500 index s 1 percent gain 
On the other hand   Home Depot   N HD  has surged 29 percent in 2015 and discount store Dollar Tree  O DLTR  is up 6 percent 
The S P 500 retail index has risen 27 percent this year  with much of that gain driven by its largest component  Amazon com  O AMZN   which continues to undercut brick and mortar rivals and has seen its stock more than double this year 
Earnings expectations vary for the holiday shopping quarter  Lowe s on average is expected to grow its earnings by 29 percent from a year ago while video game store GameStop  N GME  is seen growing earnings by 9 percent  according to Thomson Reuters data 
Gap Inc  N GPS   which warned this month about weak sales and a strong dollar  is seen posting a 24 percent drop in fourth quarter earnings 
 You really have to bifurcate between the largely apparel retailers and hard goods retailers   said Anthony Chukumba  an analyst at BB T  N BBT  Capital Markets 
His top picks include discount retailer Big Lots  N BIG  as well as Best Buy  which specializes in the electronic goods consumers are buying these days and also has a compelling valuation at 12 times expected earnings  By comparison  Nordstrom trades around 17 times earnings and Target has a price earnings ratio of 15 
Polls going into holiday season have been mixed  A Reuters Ipsos survey found more people planned to cut holiday spending than to boost it  while Gallup reported Americans plan to spend an average of  830 each on gifts this season  up from  720 a year ago at this time 
U S  retail sales edged up a meager 0 1 percent last month after staying unchanged in both September and August  according to the Commerce Department 
FBR technology analyst Daniel Ives and his team planned to visit at least 25 Best Buys and other big box stores over the weekend in New York and other major cities to gauge consumer appetite for Microsoft  O MSFT  s Xbox One game console and Apple  O AAPL  s smartwatch  launched in April 
 It s not quantitative  but it gives you anecdotal data points that become part of the mosaic of your thesis about whether to be bullish or bearish on trends  names and products   Ives said 
Since 2008  early sales estimates following Black Friday and Cyber Monday have had little or no bearing on retail stock performance for the holiday quarter  according to a report by LPL financial 
The short term performance of stocks in the week after Thanksgiving has also been similarly inconsistent 
For the past three years  Wal Mart Stores  N WMT  has lost as much as 3 9 percent or gained as much as 2 6 percent in the week following Black Friday  according to Thomson Reuters data 
By comparison  the S P 500 has been flat to up 0 5 percent in the week following Black Friday for the past three years 

Amazon com s stock performance in the week following Thanksgiving has been even more erratic  It lost 8 percent last year  lost 2 percent in 2013 and jumped 5 percent in 2012 ",2015-11-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/holiday-shopping-unlikely-to-cheer-many-investors-373322,373322

15479,236994,TIF,Fair Trade Gold Q A   An Ethical And Political Niche,news,"By    Canada s Fair Trade Jewellery Company produced the above internal infographic in late 2013  It illustrates gold s route from informal artisanal miners in South America to the company s small North American clientele      
Fairtrade gold now comes from certified mining groups in Bolivia  Colombia and Peru  bearing a black logo certifying origin  Fairtrade International plans to expand its sourcing to marginalized miners in Africa  including some in Kenya  Uganda and Tanzania  potentially by the end of 2015 

We spoke to Fair Trade Jewellery Company CEO Robin Ghambir over the phone on the niche market for fair trade gold  His Toronto firm isn t affiliated with the UK based Fairtrade gold scheme  but became the first North American jeweller to enlist under that global scheme in 2011 
Q  Has emphasizing ethical gold boosted your sales  What s the market like now 
A  Not quite  You might think that being one of the first  you d be taking wheelbarrows of cash to a bank  But what you need to make this a success is more people carrying fair trade gold  Jewelry is local  and people don t want to buy it online  Very few are actually willing to make the long travels from the U S  to Toronto 
This will work and be successful when there s at least one store in every market that carries fair trade certified products  We are trying to start that by wholesaling our line to other jewelers Fairtrade gold isn t really available in the U S  We re starting to look at selling to other retailers there  There s nothing for them right now  They have customers coming in  but they don t have sustainable products  They don t have an answer to that question 
We are basically pioneering this product in the market  But I think this is an urban coastal market  So  mostly West Coast and East Coast  In the middle of the U S  and outside of urban centers in Canada  I don t think there s a market for this 
Q  Who are the U S  retailers interested in fair trade gold  Why isn t such gold widely available in the U S  
A  They d be independent retailers  not the larger jewelry companies or chains  The biggest challenge in this area is training staff  To work with our clients  I have to know how ore is mined  if it s alluvial or hard rock mining  I have to know the difference  I have to know how the ore is processed  with cyanide versus mercury I m pretty sure that some chains cannot sell this product  because they wouldn t invest in the necessary training 
For a commodity to be Fairtrade certified  the local Fairtrade body has to adopt it  When Fairtrade gold launched in 2011  in the UK   the Fairtrade office in the USA did not opt to carry gold  Consequently  such gold just wasn t available  Fair Trade USA later left the international Fairtrade system  so now they re doing it on their own  not under the unified international body or the logo everybody recognizes 
Fair Trade USA still hasn t done gold  and gold is a complicated product  They re used to doing coca  coffee  bananas  With gold  the process is quite different  With leaving the Fairtrade system  they probably have enough to do right now  aside from gold 
Q  Who are your customers 
A  People seeking out this product are called  deep green   They already know the issues and they ask tough questions about origins  If you can t answer those tough questions  you are not real to them  They see it as  greenwashing   deceptive marketing about the environmental friendliness of products  
There are essentially  deep greens  versus  light greens   Light greens are people who look for certifications and want the stuff  but are not necessarily political  They just want to feel good about their purchase 
But some people  i e  deep greens  want to feel political about it  too  That s fine because we re a value based company For example  some people who like the recycled gold we offer are against mining  They do not like mining  they don t like extractive processes  Other people just want Fairtrade 
Right now the demand is coming from women  I ve heard from guys who ve been told  based on their girlfriend s values   I don t care what you get me  but you have to get fair trade jewellery    Guys  basically and wisely  do what they re told  So that s kind of interesting 
Men who want this product are generally involved in some way in fair trade  Or they re professionals in the jewellery environment We do really well with engineers   there s this very tight relationship between engineers and fair trade 
Q  Does anyone ever complain about the little black Fairtrade stamp on the gold 
A  Oh no  not at all  That s a positive feature  I spoke to somebody who does estate and historical jewellery  She told me that this jewellery  bearing such a stamp  will later have historical value 
We are the first jeweller in North America  still only one of two  that has  official  Fairtrade gold  These are what are called signed pieces  They come from a recognized house with provenance  It s the first time that metals have had documented provenance  Combine those with  ethical  Canadian diamonds and it s the most ethical product you can buy 
Q  Fair trade gold creates more jobs per kilo of gold  according to your infographic  even though the supply chain is much shorter  How does that work 
A  It s because they don t use the same heavy machinery for extraction  There s a lot more hand labor in fair trade gold  and so it provides more employment  You could look at it in two ways   look at it as less efficient  or as supporting communities  employing more people to extract the same amount of gold 
Q  Isn t fair trade gold a mere fraction of the wider gold market 
A  Absolutely  These are early days for fair trade metals  It s very early days in this industry Notably  there is fair trade platinum  but there s very little of it  and we don t have any demand for it 
We are much  much smaller than the companies we compete against  like Tiffany   Co  NYSE TIF  Cartier SA  or Birks Group Inc  AMEX BGI   That s the level of the industry that we operate against  since we only work in 18 carat gold and platinum 
   
Awareness within the industry is very low right now  We don t want to put this product in somebody s stores if they don t know how to sell it  You can t just shove it in the showcase 
You need somebody who s passionate about the issues  who can explain it  They don t have to be political about the issues  but have to understand them at an intellectual level 
We re still struggling for trying to find something that explains the complexities in a easy to understand way We want to put this product out there  and we are willing to make no money on some products in order to build the business 
  
UPDATED  Greg Valerio  a UK activist who manages the Fairtrade gold scheme  told International Business Times that some of the 11 African pilot mines could be ready for certification by mid 2015  African artisanal miners will meet with major U S  and European jewellery retailers in Tanzania next week  he added 
 We re starting the process of international commercial integration  and that s very significant   Valerio told IBTimes  Little direct interaction between jewellery companies and small scale miners made easy exports a problem during Fairtrade gold s 2011 launch from South American miners  he said 
A reasonable starting figure for Fairtrade gold in the U S   which isn t now officially available  could be 50 kilos  according to Valerio  Gold traded at  1284 per ounce in New York on Wednesday  so 50 kilos amounts to  2 06 million of Fairtrade gold at that price 
 The American market will be the single biggest market for fair trade gold in the world   said Valerio   On that  I have no doubt  The American consumer is the biggest consumer of retail jewellery in the world by a long way  of finished jewellery products  gold and diamonds  ",2014-04-23,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/fair-trade-gold-q-a-–-an-ethical-and-political-niche-279098,279098

product costs and price increases taken across all product categories and regions  and  to a lesser extent  sales leverage on fixed costs resulting from the increase in worldwide net sales  SG A  selling  general and administrative  expenses rose 9  in the second quarter primarily due to increases in labor and other store related costs  as well as higher marketing spending  and SG A expenses

If you ask some retail shopping experts  the answer would be a resounding no  Consumers in the U S  are expected to spend an estimated  21 2 billion celebrating Mother s Day this year  according to the National Retail Federation  a spike of more than  3 1 billion from 2014  On average  an American consumer is expected to spend more than  172 50 on gifts for their mother  up by more than  10 from last year at this time  The spending frenzy is expected to be the highest in the United States in a dozen years 
Though Americans are expected to spend close to  2 0 billion on flowers during the holiday  a large percentage of mothers nationwide surprisingly prefer a thoughtful gift from their children over a colorful bouquet  When asked in a survey by DIY Father and Pro Flowers to name a gift they would like for Mother s Day  36  of respondents answered  something homemade   opposed to only 22 5   who coveted flowers 
Should a talented artist opt to construct a handmade card instead of running down the street to help add to Hallmark s coffers  This year  roughly 80  of all consumers are expected to purchase a card for their mothers  representing a total cost of  786 million  The majority of the purchases help feed Hallmark and its chief competitor American Greetings  In 2013  the two companies combined to control more than 90  of the market  according to Atlantic Magazine 
Nearly every mother  meanwhile  loves to add to her jewelry collection  a wont not lost on faithful sons around the country  Jewelry spending for Mother s Day is expected to surge to  4 3 billion  up from  3 6 billion last year  On Friday  shares in Tiffany   Co  NYSE TIF  inched up 0 67 or 0 76  to 88 65  Tiffany stock currently hovers at the low end of its 52 week range of 82 64 110 60

 NEW YORK  Sept 29  Reuters    The technology heavy Nasdaq
led U S  stocks lower on Thursday as investors continued to
fret about weakness in the global economy and Wall Street
looked set to limp to its worst quarter in three years 
 A vote by German lawmakers to beef up the crisis hit euro
zone s bailout package as well as better than expected data
from the U S  labor market did little to boost confidence
beyond an early lift that eroded throughout the day 
 The S P consumer discretionary sector index led
losses with sharp falls in luxury goods names Tiffany   Co
  down 8 percent at  63 91  and Coach  down 7
percent at  53 46 as investors worried about a slowdown in
China  On Thursday  China s benchmark stock index ended at a
15 month low 
  The general sentiment is that things are not all said and
done   said Joseph Greco  managing director at Meridian Equity
Partners in New York   There are still big concerns about the
consumer  about the housing market and labor market  about
Europe  
 Chinese Internet search engine Baidu   down 10 8
percent at  108 30  and other U S  listed Chinese companies
were among the biggest losers after a securities regulator
said the U S  Justice Department was investigating accounting
irregularities at Chinese companies listed on U S  exchanges

 Market volatility is likely to remain high as traders
react to European headlines and attempt to gauge the
commitment of governments and institutions as they work to
prevent a Greek default  End of quarter repositioning will
also influence market movement 
 The benchmark S P 500 index is expected to finish the year
down for the first time in three years as an escalating

 NEW YORK  Aug 28  Reuters    U S  stocks mostly slipped on
Friday after a weak consumer sentiment report offset positive
news from bellwethers Dell Inc and Intel Corp 
 Support from the two companies  however  let the Nasdaq
eke out a tiny gain 
 All three major indexes still posted their second weekly
advance  although the gains were relatively modest 
 With U S  stocks up about 50 percent from multi year lows
in March  investors are concerned that the rally may have run
its course  and that with many market players taking
last minute vacations  there aren t enough buyers to push
stocks up further 
 Consumer sentiment in August slid to a four month low on
worries about high unemployment and personal finances  a
Reuters University of Michigan survey showed  also curbing the
market s appetite for risk 
  Expectations are higher and any kind of data that doesn t
exceed forecasts with rosy numbers can t move the market  
said Alan Lancz  president of Alan B  Lancz   Associates in
Toledo  Ohio 
  I think the absence of buyers is triggering traders to
sell into the weekend  Next week is basically the last week of
the summer  and with more buyers away  there would be fewer
catalysts of bull momentum  
 Intel led the Nasdaq s major gainers and helped the index
nudge back into positive territory in late afternoon trading 
 Intel s stock climbed 4 percent to  20 25 after the chip
maker raised its third quarter revenue outlook on
stronger than expected demand for its microprocessors and
chipsets 
 Dell rose 1 8 percent to  15 93 and Marvell Technology
gained 5 percent to  15 36  after both companies reported
second quarter earnings late Thursday that beat expectations

 But the Nasdaq Composite Index inched up 1 04 points  or
0 05 percent  to close at 2 028 77 
 For the week  the Dow advanced 0 4 percent  while the S P

 The losses were broad based  with health care stocks

percent at  32 32  The S P health care index was off 0 9
percent 
 Among the blue chip Dow industrials  McDonald s Corp
ranked among the top losers  falling 1 percent to  56 07 
 A bright spot was provided by Tiffany   Co  which surged
11 3 percent to  37 57 in New York Stock Exchange trading
after it reported strong second quarter results and lifted its
outlook 
 Citigroup rose 3 6 percent to  5 23 and the S P financial
index  one of the few sectors among Friday s advancers  edged
up 0 2 percent 
 Troubled financials continued to dominate trading  Shares
of the two largest U S  home funding companies  Fannie Mae and

this week  Freddie Mac was up 7 1 percent at  2 40 and Fannie
Mae gained 6 3 percent to  2 04 
 The bailed out insurer American International Group Inc

 Earlier in the day  the S P 500 climbed to 1 039 47  its
highest intraday level since Oct  14  2008  before turning
negative after the consumer sentiment data 
 In other data released on Friday  a report from the
Commerce Department showed consumer spending edged up 0 2
percent in July  largely driven by the government s
 cash for clunkers  program  while personal incomes were flat
in June

 NEW YORK  May 26  Reuters    U S  stock index futures were
little changed on Thursday as investors looked ahead to data
that could shed light on the economy s health amid worries that
global demand was slowing 
 Equities have been pressured recently  with the S P 500
down 3 2 percent so far this month  Investors said Wednesday s
rally  which broke a three day losing streak  may not be enough
to overcome macroeconomic worries 
 In a sign of rising concerns about the economic outlook 
Goldman Sachs lowered its year end target for the S P to 1 450

 The preliminary estimate of first quarter gross domestic
product is due at 8 30 a m   1230 GMT  and is seen rising by
2 1 percent compared with the 1 8 percent rate previously
estimated by the government 
 Though the economy was seen expanding in the quarter
despite sovereign debt woes  geopolitical tensions and natural
disasters overseas  a weaker than expected reading could
exacerbate concerns about global growth 
  The GDP number will give us some insight into how the
second quarter is going so far  So if it disappoints  you could
see  the S P  fall by as much as 1 5 percent   said Peter
Cardillo  chief market economist at Avalon Partners in New
York 
 Cardillo noted that the number would reflect the impact
from Japan s earthquake  which could be a drag on
first quarter U S  GDP but could provide a boost for growth in
future quarters   The economy is going through a soft patch
now  but I think yesterday s movement to the upside will
probably carry forward   he said 
 Weekly jobless claims are also on tap  with 400 000 initial
claims expected  down from the 409 000 posted last week but
still considered high 
 S P 500 futures  rose 2 points and were even with
fair value  a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into
account interest rates  dividends and time to expiration on the
contract  Dow Jones industrial average futures  added 19
points and Nasdaq 100 futures  were flat

 NEW YORK  May 26  Reuters    U S  stocks were little
changed on Thursday following a rise in weekly jobless claims
that analysts said had been priced into shares 
 The claims data  along with a weaker than expected reading
on first quarter economic growth  added to the view that demand
was slowing globally 
 Initial jobless claims unexpectedly rose in the latest week
and remained at elevated levels  Gross domestic product rose at
an annual rate of 1 8 percent in the first quarter  unchanged
from the previous estimate and down from analysts  expectations
for more robust growth  For details  see  ID nCAT005446 
 ID nN26234110 
  This data confirms the soft patch that everyone is
concerned about  and even though claims data is choppy and
impacted by weather  it seems like claims are trending in the
wrong direction   said William Larkin  portfolio manager with
Cabot Money Management in Salem  Massachusetts 
 Larkin added that the data was priced into shares  and that
stocks had hit a floor  or technical support  that would
prevent further losses 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  was down 26 23
points  or 0 21 percent  at 12 368 43  The Standard   Poor s
500 Index  was down 1 39 points  or 0 11 percent  at
1 319 08  The Nasdaq Composite Index  was down 0 05
points at 2 761 33 
 In a sign of rising concern about the economic outlook 
Goldman Sachs lowered its year end target for the S P 500 index
to 1 450 from 1 500  citing margin concerns  The lower target
represents upside of almost 10 percent from current levels

 NEW YORK  May 26  Reuters    The euro fell to a record low
against the Swiss franc on Thursday on worries that Greece was
again teetering on the brink of financial crisis  driving a bid
for safe haven U S  government bonds 
 Comments from Eurogroup President Jean Claude Juncker
rattled markets and raised doubts about whether the
International Monetary Fund would release Greece s next round
of financial assistance at the end of June   ID nLDE74P1HC 
 After initially wobbling over the Greece worries  U S 
stocks squeezed out modest gains  but U S  crude oil fell more
than 1 percent on disappointing U S  economic growth and jobs
data 
 Still  the euro zone sovereign debt fears stuck with
investors 
  There has been a lot of back and forth between the EU and
the ECB on IMF aid to Greece  and that does not help the euro
at all   said Kathy Lien  director of currency research at GFT
Forex in New York 
 The latest U S  economic data underscored the view that the
country s recovery has hit a rough patch 
 The U S  economy grew at an annual 1 8 percent rate in the
first three months of this year  the Commerce Department said 
unchanged from an earlier estimate and weaker than most
forecasts 
 A separate report from the Labor Department showed the
number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits unexpectedly
rose last week by 10 000 to 424 000  For details  see

 The euro was down for a fifth day against the Swiss franc 
It fell as low as 1 22045 Swiss francs on electronic trading
platform EBS  and last traded down 0 5 percent on
the day at 1 2242 francs 
 Against the dollar  the euro changed hands at  1 4128
  up 0 3 percent on the day  It had earlier risen to
 1 42069 on EBS after an article in the Financial Times quoted
the chief of the European Financial Stability Facility as
saying China was  clearly interested  in buying bonds for the
Portugal bailout to be issued in mid June   ID nL3E7GQ04U 
 The U S  dollar  was down 0 5 percent against a
basket of major currencies 
 U S  benchmark 10 year Treasury note   prices
rose 20 32  with a yield of 3 06 percent  the lowest level
since Dec 7 
  For the U S  economy  it s like Groundhog Day like what we
saw a year ago   when the economy weakened after the end of the
first quantitative easing program  said Bob Baur  chief global
economist at Principal Global Investors in Des Moines  Iowa 
which oversees  235 billion in assets 
 Stocks brushed aside those concerns  and focused instead on
upbeat earnings from companies including Tiffany   Co  
whose shares gained 8 6 percent to  76 04  NetApp Inc s
 stock also was buoyed by strong results 
 Stocks have struggled in recent weeks to extend their
latest rally that began in September  The benchmark Standard  
Poor s 500 Index  has gained 27 percent since the end of
August 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  rose 8 10 points 
or 0 07 percent  to end at 12 402 76  The Standard   Poor s 500
Index  gained 5 22 points  or 0 40 percent  to end at
1 325 69  The Nasdaq Composite Index  advanced 21 54
points  or 0 78 percent  to end at 2 782 92 
 The MSCI Latin American index  rose 1 8
percent  adding to gains that have pulled it off an eight month
low reached on Monday  In Europe  the FTSEurofirst 300 index
 ended down 0 07 percent 
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange  the July crude
contract  fell  1 09  or 1 08 percent  to settle at
 100 23 a barrel  while Brent crude rose 12 cents to settle at
 115 05 a barrel 
 Gold was led down by a drop in euro priced bullion after
the single European currency came under sudden pressure 
although safe haven buying limited declines 
 Spot gold  declined to  1 520 40 an ounce  On
Wednesday  bullion prices rose to  1 532 10 their strongest
since May 4

shares tumbled on fears the European financial crisis could
spread havoc to other parts of the world

 NEW YORK  Aug 18  Reuters    Rising fears of another
recession hammered U S  stocks on Thursday  sending major
averages sharply lower in a return to the extreme fluctuations
investors endured a week ago 
 New worries about the health of European banks set the tone
before the market s open  and a dismal report on regional U S 
manufacturing fueled a downward spiral in which the Dow dropped
as much as 528 points  spurring a flight to safe haven assets
like gold 
 The Nasdaq ended more than 5 percent lower  the S P 500
more than 4 percent and the blue chip Dow off more than 3
percent 
  Are we going to go into recession  Most market
participants were looking for slow and steady growth  but the
statistics and the financial situation here and in foreign
economies have disturbed that view   said Richard Weiss  a
Mountain View  California based senior money manager at
American Century Investments 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  fell 419 63 points 
or 3 68 percent  to 10 990 58  while the Standard   Poor s 500
Index  declined 53 24 points  or 4 46 percent  to
1 140 65  and the Nasdaq Composite Index  dropped 131 05
points  or 5 22 percent  to 2 380 43 
 The losses resumed a slide in stocks that began in late
July and seemed to moderate in the last few days  In a more
worrisome sign  volume was heavier than on recent positive
days  with 11 4 billion shares changing hands  highest so far
this week 
 Volatility jumped  with the CBOE Volatility Index  or
VIX  a barometer of Wall Street anxiety  up 38 percent at
43 56  More investors were taking out protective positions
against declines in the market 
 The S P 500 is now off 16 4 percent from its April 29
closing high  but the benchmark index still ended above its
slump on Aug  9 at 1 101 54 
 Sectors associated with growth were hit hard  Top drags on
the Dow included shares of IBM   down 4 5 percent at
 163 83  and United Technologies   down 5 5 percent at
 68 12  On the Nasdaq  shares of Oracle  fell 8 3
percent to  25 19

 NEW YORK  Aug 22  Reuters    U S  stock index futures were
more than 1 percent higher on Monday following four weeks of
equity losses as stocks rebounded globally  led by defensive
shares 
 European stocks gained 2 1 percent  with defensive sectors
such as pharmaceuticals  telecommunications and utilities
leading a rally following last week s sharp losses  The MSCI
world equity index rose 0 4 percent    EU   MKTS GLOB 
 Equities have been pressured by growing concerns about the
economy  given a rash of weaker than expected data and the
ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Europe 
 Investors also looked ahead to a speech by U S  Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday at the central bank s
annual meeting in Jackson Hole  Wyoming 
 Some investors hoped the Fed will announce a new form of
stimulus  even as the central bank promised earlier this month
to keep interest rates near zero for at least two more years 
and said it would consider further steps to help growth  The
Fed said U S  economic growth was proving considerably weaker
than expected   FED AHEAD 
  This month has been about a lack of confidence  and if
Bernanke announces the injection of additional stimulus  that
will give the markets confidence that something is being done 
which should at least decrease some of the volatility we ve
been seeing   said Tim Speiss  head of personal wealth advisors
at EisnerAmper in New York 
 The S P has fallen more than 13 percent so far in August 
with recent volatility resulting in six days over the past two
weeks where the index has fallen at least 4 percent  Some
investors believe the speed and size of the drops suggested the
market could be oversold 
  Maybe the losses were too extreme of a reaction for some
of the stocks that got hit   said Speiss   The underlying
fundamentals remain quite good on some names  and this gives us
the chance to redeploy into some of those positions

 NEW YORK  Aug 26  Reuters    U S  stock index futures edged
lower on Friday as investors found few reasons to buy following
a volatile week and ahead of a speech from Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke on the economy 
 Stocks rallied early in the week as investors wagered the
Fed could announce a new program to combat softness in the
economy  That contributed to a three day rally 
 For three straight days  the S P has moved more than 1
percent  On Thursday  it fell as investors hedged themselves
against Bernanke s speech  as well as on continued concerns
about the U S  labor market and the state of the European
economy 
 Most analysts believe Bernanke  scheduled to speak on
Friday at 10 a m  EDT  1400 GMT   is most likely to outline
gradualist measures    disappointing those looking for a more
dramatic move  such as a fresh round of asset purchases  For
details  see  FED AHEAD 
  There has been some optimism that we would get something
supportive from the comments  but now it s settling in that
maybe we won t  which is where the slightly negative bias is
coming from today   said Peter Coleman  director of research at
investment bank JMP Securities in San Francisco 
 While uncertainty about what the Fed will do has driven the
recent volatility  many investors expect that volatility to
subside after his comments   ID nN1E77O0T2 
 S P 500 futures  fell 2 5 points and were below fair
value  a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates  dividends and time to expiration on the

points  and Nasdaq 100 futures  lost 3 points 
 The Dow is up 3 1 percent for the week  while the Nasdaq is
up 3 3 percent and the CBOE Volatility index  is down 7 6
percent  The S P is up 3 2 percent  but it remains to be seen
whether stocks can gather enough steam for an extended rally 
Analysts view 1 120 as a key support level for the index 
 Market participants also looked ahead later Friday to a
second reading on second quarter gross domestic product 
Economists expect the economy grew at a 1 1 percent rate in the
quarter  against the previous reading of 1 3 percent growth 
The data comes at 8 30 a m  EDT   1230 GMT 
 A final reading on August consumer sentiment is also on tap

 NEW YORK  Aug 28  Reuters    U S  stocks mostly slipped on
Friday after a weak consumer sentiment report offset positive
news from bellwethers Dell Inc  and Intel Corp
 
 Support from the two companies  however  let the Nasdaq
eke out a tiny gain 
 All three major indexes still posted their second weekly
advance  although the gains were relatively modest 
 With U S  stocks up about 50 percent from multi year lows
in March  investors are concerned that the rally may have run
its course  and that with many market players taking
last minute vacations  there aren t enough buyers to push
stocks up further 
 Consumer sentiment in August slid to a four month low on
worries about high unemployment and personal finances  a
Reuters University of Michigan survey showed  also curbing the
market s appetite for risk

  Expectations are higher and any kind of data that doesn t
exceed forecasts with rosy numbers can t move the market  
said Alan Lancz  president of Alan B  Lancz   Associates in
Toledo  Ohio 
  I think the absence of buyers is triggering traders to
sell into the weekend  Next week is basically the last week of
the summer  and with more buyers away  there would be fewer
catalysts of bull momentum  
 Intel led the Nasdaq s major gainers and helped the index
nudge back into positive territory in late afternoon trading 
 Intel s stock climbed 4 percent to  20 25 after the chip
maker raised its third quarter revenue outlook on
stronger than expected demand for its microprocessors and
chipsets   ID nN28172958

Poor s 500 Index  lost only 2 05 points  or 0 20
percent  to 1 028 93 
 But the Nasdaq Composite Index  inched up 1 04
points  or 0 05 percent  to close at 2 028 77 
 For the week  the Dow advanced 0 4 percent  while the S P
500 gained 0 3 percent and the Nasdaq rose 0 4 percent 
 The losses were broad based  with health care stocks
helping to lead the declines  Merck   Co Inc  was down
1 7 percent at  32 32  The S P health care index  was
off 0 9 percent 
 Among the blue chip Dow industrials  McDonald s Corp
 ranked among the top losers  falling 1 percent to

 A bright spot was provided by Tiffany   Co   which
surged 11 3 percent to  37 57 in New York Stock Exchange
trading after it reported strong second quarter results and
lifted its outlook   ID nBNG513912 
 Citigroup  rose 3 6 percent to  5 23 and the S P
financial index   one of the few sectors among Friday s
advancers  edged up 0 2 percent

Fannie Mae  gained 6 3 percent to  2 04 
 The bailed out insurer American International Group Inc
 rose 5 percent to  50 23  up 53 percent for the week 
 Earlier in the day  the S P 500 climbed to 1 039 47  its
highest intraday level since Oct  14  2008  before turning
negative after the consumer sentiment data 
 In other data released on Friday  a report from the
Commerce Department showed consumer spending edged up 0 2
percent in July  largely driven by the government s

 By Chuck Mikolajczak
 NEW YORK  May 24  Reuters    Wall Street may feel more
pressure in this holiday shortened week unless a raft of
economic data  including consumer confidence  home sales and
GDP  restores the optimism that had driven a two month rally
before it faded in the past few days 
 Investors cited the potential bankruptcy of General Motors
as a concern for the markets  as further job losses could
imperil the U S  economy  Such an event  even though it is
anticipated  would not help sentiment  which is already subdued
after the major U S  stock indexes fell on Thursday and Friday
due to worries about the U S  budget deficit 
 GM is facing a June 1 deadline to work out its issues with
creditors if it wants to avoid a bankruptcy filing  On Friday 
a spokesman for some of GM s creditors said the biggest
bondholders of roughly  27 billion in debt plan to reject GM s
current offer for a 10 percent equity stake 
  That s the biggest risk for the market here   said Paul
Mendelsohn  chief investment strategist at Windham Financial
Services in Charlotte  Vermont   We are going to lose a lot of
jobs as it is  with closing of dealerships both from Chrysler
and GM 
  A  GM  bankruptcy throws everything into chaos  
 Deutsche Bank analyst Joseph LaVorgna has forecast that a
General Motors bankruptcy could lop four percentage points off
of U S  gross domestic product 
 Since the markets peaked on May 8  stocks have given back
some of their gains over doubts about the speed of the economic
recovery  U S  stocks were higher through most of the session
Friday  but sagged at the end of the day as investors sought to
reduce positions heading into the three day Memorial Day
holiday weekend 
 For the past week  the Dow Jones industrial average rose
0 1 percent  while the Standard   Poor s 500 gained 0 5 percent
and the Nasdaq advanced 0 7 percent 
 For the year  both the blue chip Dow and the broad S P 500
are in the red    the Dow is down 5 7 percent and the S P is
down 1 8 percent    while the Nasdaq is up 7 3 percent 
 BUMPY RIDE AND BIG BOND AUCTION
 With investors skittish over the indebtedness of the United
States  stocks could be subjected to more volatility if the
allure of U S  assets dims further 
 The Chicago Board Option Exchange Volatility Index  or VIX 
best known as Wall Street s fear gauge  climbed 4 1 percent on
Friday to end above 30  a key psychological level  according to
analysts 
 This week  the U S  Treasury will auction  101 billion in
bonds  matching the record  with  2 trillion in new bonds
expected to hit the market in fiscal 2009 alone     
  What happens if the demand isn t there from the foreign
entities   said Alan Lancz  president of Alan B  Lancz  
Associates Inc  an investment advisory firm  based in Toledo 
Ohio 
  There s  2 trillion of U S  Treasuries owned by foreign
central banks  and if all of a sudden  they lose their appetite
for U S  Treasuries  there s only one way to pay this debt  and
that will be to increase interest rates  And then you get the
potential problem of higher inflation  a lower dollar and
higher interest rates  like we had in the 1970s  
 The S P 500 has risen 31 percent since hitting a 12 year
closing low on March 9  which some analysts said put it at risk
of a pullback  while the holiday shortened week could
exaggerate moves in the market due to light trading volume 
 U S  markets will be closed on Monday for the Memorial Day
holiday 
  Traditionally  the story has been  sell in May and go
away   We are heading into the summer doldrums   said Peter
Jankovskis  co chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments
LLC in Lisle  Illinois 
  But the other side of things is that also normally leads
to light trading volume and light trading volume can magnify
reactions  
 GDP  CONSUMERS  MOOD AND HOME SALES
 The economic calendar is fairly busy despite the four day
week  The data may prove to be the bright spot to reaffirm
investors  recent optimism that the recession is ebbing 
 Friday marks the preliminary reading of U S  gross domestic
product for the first quarter  GDP  which measures output of
goods and services within U S  borders  is forecast to shrink
at an annual rate of 5 5 percent  according to economists
polled by Thomson Reuters 
 Also on tap are readings on May consumer confidence and the
final reading for May on consumer sentiment from the
Reuters University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers 
 The housing market  whose slump has been at the center of
the economic downturn  will get more scrutiny when existing
home sales are released on Wednesday and new home sales are
released on Thursday  Both reports will cover April data 
 U S  existing home sales are estimated to have risen in
April to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 4 66 million
units  up from 4 57 million in March  according to the Reuters
poll  New home sales are projected to have inched up to an
annual pace of 360 000 units in April from 356 000 in March 
 Last week  the U S  Commerce Department said housing starts
fell 12 8 percent to an annual rate of 458 000 units  the
lowest since the government began keeping records in January
1959 
 DUDE  YOU RE GETTING DELL S RESULTS
 Earnings season has nearly come to a close  as 484
companies in the S P 500 had reported through Friday  leaving
just a handful of retailers  including Tiffany   Co and Costco
Wholesale Corp for this week 
 Of the 484 companies  65 percent beat analysts  estimates 
9 percent matched and 26 percent missed  according to Thomson
Reuters data 
 Also on the docket for this week is Dell Inc  The No  2 PC
maker said on Thursday that it is still cautious about
corporate technology spending  but plans to make acquisitions
and aggressively pursue enterprise customers in an attempt to
win back market share in the United States

 NEW YORK  Aug 28  Reuters    U S  stocks fell on Friday 
pressured after a weak report on consumer sentiment outweighed
some positive quarterly results and outlooks 
 A Reuters University of Michigan survey showed the final
reading for its August index of consumer sentiment slid to a
four month low on worries about high unemployment and personal
finances 
 The news came as the three major U S  stock indexes have
soared about 50 percent from multi year lows reached in early
March  prompting speculation that the stock market had gotten
ahead of itself 
  The market is starting to ask for proof the run up is
warranted   said Keith Springer  president of Capital
Financial Advisory Services in Sacramento  California 
 Without consumer spending  we can t have a meaningful
recovery  and investors are starting to get weary of consumer
spending not coming back  
 While the data pushed the markets into negative territory
after early gains  the Nasdaq s loss was limited by Intel  up
4 percent at  20 25 after the chip maker raised its
third quarter revenue outlook on stronger than expected demand
for its microprocessors and chipsets 
 Also lifting tech stocks were Dell Inc and Marvell
Technology  Both companies late Thursday reported
second quarter earnings that beat expectations 
 Dell shares gained 2 percent to  15 96  while Marvell was
up 4 1 percent at  15 23 
 Tiffany   Co surged 8 9 percent to  36 76 after it
reported strong second quarter results and lifted its
outlook 
  The fact that Tiffany and Dell    which represent tech
and luxury spending    failed to ignite the market shows that
traders are cautious  given the run the market has had   said
Jim Awad  managing director at Zephyr Management in New York 
  The fact that you can t make much progress with the two
companies shows that the market has done what it s going to
do   he added 
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 67 72 points  or
0 71 percent  to 9 512 91  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
shed 6 30 points  or 0 61 percent  to 1 024 68  The Nasdaq
Composite Index slipped 7 61 points  or 0 38 percent  to
2 020 12 
 Bennett Gaeger  managing director at Stifel Nicolaus in
Baltimore  credited the strength in tech for curbing the
Nasdaq s decline 
  Absolutely  Intel s outlook signals good things for the
sector ahead   he said  adding that investors were also
excited by Dell saying it saw seasonal order trends 
  Marvell said the same thing  which is good for the
holiday season and consumers   he said 
 An index of semiconductor stocks gained 1 6 percent 
 In other data released on Friday  a report from the
Commerce Department showed consumer spending edged up 0 2
percent in July  largely driven by the government s
 cash for clunkers  program  while personal incomes were flat
in June 
 The stock market turned negative after the release of the
consumer sentiment data  Previously  the S P had risen to
1 039 47  its highest intraday reading since Oct  14  2008

 NEW YORK  Aug 28  Reuters    U S  stocks mostly slipped on
Friday after a weak consumer sentiment report offset positive
quarterly results and outlooks  while some investors booked
profits after the Dow s eight day winning streak 
 But the Nasdaq clung to a tiny gain  with support from
bellwethers Dell Inc and Intel Corp 
 With the three major indexes up about 50 percent from
multi year lows in March  investors are concerned that the
rally may have run its course  and that with many market
players taking last minute vacations  there aren t enough
buyers to push stocks up further 
 Consumer sentiment in August slid to a four month low on
worries about high unemployment and personal finances  a
Reuters University of Michigan survey showed  also curbing the
market s appetite for risk 
  Expectations are higher and any kind of data that doesn t
exceed forecasts with rosy numbers can t move the market  
said Alan Lancz  president of Alan B  Lancz   Associates in
Toledo  Ohio 
  I think the absence of buyers is triggering traders to
sell into the weekend  Next week is basically the last week of
the summer  and with more buyers away  there would be fewer
catalysts of bull momentum  
 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 39 83 points  or
0 42 percent  at 9 540 80  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index was
down 1 95 points  or 0 19 percent  at 1 029 03  But the Nasdaq
Composite Index was up 2 96 points  or 0 15 percent  at
2 030 69 
 The losses were broad based  with health care stocks
leading the declines  Merck   Co Inc was down nearly 2 percent
at  32 24  The S P health care index was off 1 percent 
 Among the blue chip Dow industrials  McDonald s Corp
ranked among the top losers  falling 1 4 percent to  55 88 
 Intel led the Nasdaq s major gainers and helped the index
nudge back into positive territory in late afternoon trading 
Intel s stock climbed 4 2 percent to  20 29 after it raised
its third quarter revenue outlook on stronger than expected
demand for its microprocessors and chipsets 
 Dell rose 2 5 percent to  16 05 and Marvell Technology
gained 4 4 percent to  15 27  after both companies late
Thursday reported second quarter earnings that beat
expectations 
 But Novell Inc lost 6 4 percent to  4 41 on Nasdaq after
posting a slightly worse than expected decline in quarterly
revenue 
 Tiffany   Co surged 11 percent to  37 46 in New York Stock
Exchange trading after it reported strong second quarter
results and lifted its outlook 
  The fact that Tiffany and Dell    which represent tech
and luxury spending    failed to ignite the market shows that
traders are cautious  given the run the market has had   said
Jim Awad  managing director at Zephyr Management in New York 
 Citigroup rose 3 6 percent to  5 23 and the S P financial
index  one of the few sectors among Friday s advancers  edged
up 0 1 percent 
 Shares of the two largest U S  home funding companies 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  gained sharply  extending a trend
seen earlier this week  Freddie Mac was up 7 1 percent at
 2 38 and Fannie Mae gained 6 3 percent to  2 05 
 The stock market turned negative after the consumer
sentiment data was released  Previously  the S P 500 climbed
to 1 039 47  its highest intraday reading since Oct  14 
2008

15536,237051,TIF,Looking for a hot stock  Try centenarians  James Saft,news,"By James Saft
 Reuters    While the financial industry makes good money selling what is new  like IPOs  investors themselves very likely do better by sticking with the old  old companies  that is 
In an age of technological wonders and unicorn valuations for companies with little or no profit  investors can easily fall into the trap of over weighting new and buzzy companies and sectors 
The data tell a different story  with older companies actually outperforming the young  and really old ones  like a century or more old  doing exceptionally well 
U S  initial offerings in 2015 were a bit of a bust  generating an overall loss of 2 1 percent for the year  with 57 percent of issues ending the year lower than their debut price  according to Renaissance Capital data  And 2015 was not an aberration  earlier studies have shown that newly listed companies have underperformed the broader market in more than seven in 10 years since the early 1980s 
Contrast this to the performance of very elderly companies  which  Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  called  centenaries  in a recent study  Credit Suisse constructed a global index of 100 year old plus companies in historically stable industries like food  utilities and transportation and found quite strong results 
 Although historical share price performance statistics are no guarantee of future performance  we find it interesting that the  centenaries  have an exceptionally strong track record  These  old  companies have outperformed global equities by circa 500 bps annually since 2005 and by almost 300 bps during the past 12 months   Credit Suisse analysts Eugene Klerk  Richard Kersley and Brandon Vair wrote in a client note 
The New York Stock Exchange s Century Index  comprised of  1 billion plus capitalization U S  companies which are at least 100 years old  has also done well  outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average since its inception in May 2012 and  back tested  also outperforming major indices going back to 2000 
To be sure  the underlying causes of this outperformance of the aged are hard to know with certainty  much less if they will persist  Yet one thing stands out  unlike IPOs or the kind of recently hot companies which are forever being featured on financial television  old companies are not really sold aggressively to investors 
SEASONING MAKES A DISH
That s in part because they often  being utilities or breweries or train companies  don t have an exciting new story  It is also because old companies aren t money machines for Wall Street in the same way that new ones are  They simply require less investment banking  That leads  perhaps  to an imbalance of coverage tilted towards hot new sectors  and maybe even a bit more optimism about them in that coverage than is warranted  
Writing on behalf of Credit Suisse a year ago  Elroy Dimson  Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton of the London Business School observed the positive effect seen among  seasoned  British companies as compared to their junior peers 
If you define seasoning as time elapsed from IPO  the older the company  the better it does  Looking at British stocks 1980 2014  companies with 20 years  seasoning returned 61 pounds for every pound invested at the start  Companies with eight to 20 years  seasoning returned 49 pounds  those with four to seven years under their belts only 33 and those with three or less just 20 
This is striking in that it covers a period in which not just the British but the global economy has been revolutionized by technological change  How it could be that most of that benefit would go to frankly geriatric companies is hard to fathom 
Surely there is an element of over enthusiasm among investors for the new thing  leading them to overpay  and as in 1999 and 2000  fuel a bubble 
It is also true that much of the economic benefit of a technological revolution does not flow to those who  at first glance  appear to be the winners  Take the development of the Erie Canal  which for a brief time after it opened in 1825 revolutionized transport in the U S  Not only was the canal quickly made redundant by a newer technology  railroads  but even the early winners of its impact didn t have much time to enjoy its effect 
Shortly after the canal opened  farmland in Ohio boomed in price as grain could suddenly be much more cheaply transported to markets on the East Coast and in Europe  No sooner did Ohio farmers count their gains than huge new supply flowed in from farms further west  which were only economic now that transport was cheaper  Grain prices fell and investors in Ohio farmland were hurt and many ruined 
Contrast this to Tiffany   Co  NYSE TIF   founded in 1830 and delivering double the performance of the S P 500 over the past decade 
It may be that the very old got that way for a reason

15537,237052,TIF,Wall Street continues rally despite souring consumer sentiment,news,"Investing com   U S  stocks traded higher on Friday  on track to a five week winning streak that brought the blue chip index into positive territory for the year as oil continued to trade near three month highs 
At 15 51GMT or 11 51AM ET  the Dow 30 rose 100 points  or 0 58   while the S P 500 advanced 8 points  or 0 38   and the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite gained 22 points  or 0 46  
Oil continued a rally throughout most of the session on Friday that pushed the barrel of West Texas above  40 for the first time since December in the prior session on hopes that an agreement between OPEC and non OPEC members to freeze output would be reached at a meeting scheduled for April 17 in what would be the first global deal in 15 years 
There was relatively little news on Friday  but traders took note of a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report that suggested that West Texas could rise to  47 a barrel by June due to the upcoming  busy driving season  the drop in the dollar and declining U S  shale production  However  left out of many of the headlines  these experts added that the price could then fall back to  39 by September 
That said  markets will be wary of the Baker Hughes  data on U S  rig count to be released later on Friday  Last week  the data showed that the total number of U S  oil rigs hit a record low  while the number of active oil drilling rigs fell for a 12th consecutive week 
Crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange pared gains and traded flat at  40 20 a barrel by 15 55GMT or 11 55AM ET  while Brent oil still advanced 0 72  to  41 84  slipping from intraday high of  42 53 
On the macro data front  the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index unexpectedly fell for the third consecutive month  hitting a low not seen since last October  The survey s chief economist Richard Curtin blamed the decline on  concerns about prospects for the economy as well as the expectation that gas prices would inch upward during the year ahead  
In the first remarks from Fed officials since Janet Yellen s press conference on Wednesday  New York Fed president William Dudley applauded how bank supervision had brought the financial sector long way since the crisis  while Boston Fed chief Eric Rosengren spoke on operational risk management at a bank supervision conference in New York on Friday 
While neither of the two aforementioned Fed members spoke on the economy or monetary policy  St  Louis Fed president James Bullard is expected to comment on both topics in a speech at 18 00 GMT or 14 00ET

15551,237066,TIF,How a rebel Myanmar tin mine may up end a global supply chain,news,"By Yimou Lee and Joel Schectman YANGON WASHINGTON  Reuters    From a remote corner of northeastern Myanmar  an insurgent army sells tin ore to suppliers of some of the world s largest consumer companies  More than 500 companies  including leading brands such as smartphone maker Apple  O AAPL   coffee giant Starbucks  O SBUX  and luxury jeweler Tiffany   Co  N TIF   list among their suppliers Chinese controlled firms that indirectly buy ore from the Man Maw mine near Myanmar s border with China  a Reuters examination of the supply chain found  The mine is controlled by the United Wa State Army  UWSA   which the United States placed under sanctions for alleged narcotics trafficking in 2003  The seven companies extracting tin from the mine are all owned or controlled by Wa military and government leaders  Wa officials and people with close ties to UWSA leadership told Reuters  This potentially puts companies  which also include industrial conglomerate  General Electric   N GE   at risk of violating sanctions that forbid  direct or indirect  dealings with blacklisted groups  according to a former and a serving U S  official and lawyers with expertise in sanctions enforcement   Several sanctions experts said the U S  government was unlikely to fine companies who unwittingly used the Myanmar tin  Still  it may force them to shift to new suppliers  they said  A Treasury Department spokeswoman said U S  sanctions  generally prohibit U S  companies from engaging in any direct or indirect transactions or dealings with individuals or entities  on a blacklist  but declined further comment on specific circumstances  The situation illustrates the difficulties facing multinationals in monitoring supply chains that have grown increasingly complex  Following a 2012 U S  regulation  companies have spent billions of dollars scrutinizing whether certain minerals used in their products come from mines controlled by armed groups in Central Africa  But the regulations do not require them to assess the origins of minerals from other conflict zones  Apple  Tiffany and GE  and other companies contacted by Reuters  said that to fulfill those regulations they looked to an audit program designed by the industry group Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative  CFSI   A CFSI program director said the group was  aware of tin exports from Myanmar to other countries and of security and human rights issues in Myanmar   The group said it was updating its audit requirements to include  a broader definition of conflict affected and high risk areas    Tin supply chain expert at monitoring group Global Witness  Sophia Pickles  said companies must not wholly outsource due diligence responsibility to a scheme that has exclusively focused on central Africa   Companies  not schemes  bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that supply chains are responsible   she said  CIVIL WAR Most of the tin mined globally is used as solder in electronics  for making batteries and plating  The Man Maw mine roiled the global tin market when huge quantities of high grade ore were discovered around 2013  Annual production is now estimated at about 33 000 tons of tin concentrate  more than a 10th of global output of the metal   nL4N1CP013  The mine is controlled by the UWSA  the strongest of the myriad armed groups that have kept Myanmar in a state of near perpetual civil war for decades  Reuters visited the remote mine last month  the first international media organization to do so  Interviews with officials running the mine  UWSA leaders and executives at Asian tin suppliers  together with an examination of public disclosures of suppliers made by companies in regulatory filings  indicate Wa tin likely ends up in an array of products made by U S  and other international companies  Tin from Man Maw provides revenue critical to the survival of the self proclaimed Wa State and its rulers  who have refused to disarm or participate in Myanmar s peace process   There are dozens of trucks carrying tin ore to China every morning   the head of the Wa territory foreign affairs office  Zhao Guo An  told Reuters   Tin mining is the pillar of our economy  It s the biggest source of income   While Washington has lifted most sanctions on Myanmar  some have been kept in place  including those aimed at the UWSA  The group and several of its leaders are blacklisted under the Kingpin Act over accusations of trafficking in heroin and methamphetamine  UWSA leaders deny involvement in narcotics  saying the accusations are a smear by political opponents   nL3N1CC1L5  Peter Kucik  a former senior sanctions advisor at the U S  Treasury Department  said the findings highlighted the need for thorough due diligence    The facts suggest potential sanctions risk for the parties involved   Kucik said  Two companies in Apple s supply chain  the world s No  1 tin producer Yunnan Tin Co Ltd  000960 SZ  and leading Taiwan based solder maker  Shenmao  Technology  TW 3305   told Reuters that some tin they bought was from the Wa mine  Mandy Gan  a tin analyst from China s leading mineral research company  Asian Metal  and another tin expert  both of whom visited the UWSA mine this year  said many other Chinese smelting firms supplying global consumer goods makers also bought tin from the Man Maw mine  Sanctions experts said even the indirect use of the tin might be considered a violation of U S  sanctions law  which does not require authorities to prove intent  A U S  government official involved in Myanmar policy consulted on Reuters  findings said the government was likely to investigate any ties to the UWSA  Still  Washington based sanctions attorney Erich Ferrari  NYSE RACE  said it was unlikely the Treasury Department would initiate an enforcement action against companies for an issue so deep in the supply chain  Once the ties were publicized  however  authorities could impose penalties if the companies did not wind down the transactions and find new suppliers  he said  SUPPLY CHAIN The chain connecting some of the world s best known brands with a mine in one the most inaccessible corners of Southeast Asia has many links    For a GRAPHIC  click on     One key intermediary is state owned Yunnan Cultural Industry International  YCII   based in Yunnan  southwestern China  which said in a statement on its website that it enjoys  a long term  stable strategic partnership  with the UWSA statelet  YCII declined several interview requests   YCII is  in turn  a major supplier of tin to the world s top producer  Yunnan Tin  also based in Yunnan  Yunnan Tin supplies many companies  including big contract manufacturers such as Foxconn Technology Co  TW 2354  and  indirectly   Pegatron  Corp  TW 4938   whose clients include Apple  It also supplies major solder makers such as Shenmao Technology  also a supplier to Pegatron   Myanmar is not considered a conflict affected area by CFSI   As long as smelters present a certified sourcing document  that s acceptable for us   said Tim Lin  an executive overseeing sourcing at Taiwan based Shenmao  who said about a quarter of its supply of the metal came from Yunnan Tin  In the last two years  Yunnan Tin has also shipped more than 12 000 tons of metal to the United States  according to shipment data from U S  based trade tracking company Panjiva  More than 500 publicly traded companies in the United States say their suppliers use tin from Yunnan Tin or Yuntinic Resources  its San Mateo  California based division  according to a review of the supply chain disclosures consumer companies make to the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  Two members of Yunnan Tin s board  vice chairwoman Yang Yimin and secretary and vice general manager Pan Wenhao  confirmed in interviews that a  portion  of the company s tin came from the UWSA operated mine   We certainly buy tin indirectly from Myanmar   Pan told Reuters   We don t specifically pay attention to where they source their materials from   Yunnan Tin mixes the Wa tin with metal from mines in central and southwestern China  said Pan  before processing it into products such as tin paste  That means it is impossible to say for certain which shipments from the company contain Wa tin  but Pan estimated Yunnan Tin s purchases from the mine account for about a third of its total annual tin consumption  or at least 16 500 tons  Apple said in a statement it worked with suppliers to help them meet stringent standards   and those who are ultimately unable or unwilling to comply are removed from our supply chain    While we have no evidence of illegal tin from Myanmar in our products  we ll continue to investigate  address any issues we find and do all we can to raise standards and protect human rights   it said  Foxconn said it  enforced stringent supplier management requirements in accordance with international and local conflict minerals legislation and has proactively communicated these requirements to our suppliers   It added that less than 1 percent of its tin was procured from Yunnan Tin  all of which was used in products for a  single  non U S  based customer   Pegatron Corp said it carried out  annual due diligence on suppliers and encourage them to source from validated conflict free supply chains    Pegatron will continue working with customers and international organizations to investigate and source minerals responsibly   the company added  FROM JEWELRY TO APPLIANCES Companies that sell consumer products in the United States are required by the Dodd Frank Act to publish their suppliers of tin and other minerals   nL4N1DQ37M  Among the companies listing Yunnan Tin  Tiffany said one of its suppliers had indirectly sourced a  very small amount of tin  from the Chinese smelter for use in silver solder for jewelry and hollowware  The company added that  as Yunnan Tin was certified as conflict free by the CFSI   use of this smelter by our vendors is consistent with our Conflict Minerals Policy   
Starbucks said small amounts of Yunnan Tin metal  sourced from second or third party suppliers  went into the ovens in its coffee shops  The company had received no information indicating it was using minerals from Myanmar  a spokeswoman said  but was pushing suppliers for more detailed sourcing disclosures  A GE spokesman said the company strived to use ethical sourcing in its mineral supply chain  adding it had  noted the concerns raised by Reuters and will address them through our internal process and with our external partners   A spokeswoman from discount retailer  Target   N TGT  said in a statement it was  committed to responsible business conduct    We take these allegations very seriously  and we are looking into this   the statement said ",2016-11-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/how-a-rebel-myanmar-tin-mine-may-up-end-a-global-supply-chain-444076,444076

15620,237135,TIF,Vying for Vuitton  China s e commerce rivals seek luxury stranglehold,news,"By Sarah White and Pascale Denis PARIS  Reuters    China s online giants  Alibaba   N BABA  and JD com  O JD  are taking their battle for relevance in the lucrative luxury goods market to a new level  as they aim to crack e commerce tie ups with top brands that usually shun selling through third parties  From  Hugo Boss   DE BOSSn  to La Perla underwear  the online shopping giants have recruited dozens of labels since launching their rival luxury sites in mid 2017  touting their access to a trove of consumer data and their grip on local payments systems in the world s biggest market for high end fashion  But some of the most prized names have so far remained aloof  and the race is on to attract the likes of LVMH s  PA LVMH  Louis Vuitton  a brand notorious for only selling its handbags and other wares through its own stores and websites  Both are banking that even elusive outsiders will tire of trying to fly solo in China  where potential clients shop far more by mobile phone apps than in the United States or Europe  and those in smaller  far flung cities are hard to reach    It s a matter of time   said Xia Ding  the head of fashion at China s No 2 e commerce player JD com and of its luxury site Toplife  adding the platform had held talks with all major brands  That echoes a similar message from its bigger competitor Alibaba and its Luxury Pavilion platform  As they chase labels  the firms are willing to go where the likes of Amazon  O AMZN  will not  That includes giving them control over their image and prices   some of which  like  97 926 Tiffany  N TIF  jewels  have reached eye watering amounts   while offering advantageous fees compared with Western equivalents  And while some brands like Italy s independent Armani signed up early on to both sites  the platforms have since devised more elaborate deals to win over and retain others  Alibaba is developing a specific app for Chinese travellers with its most significant luxury client to date  Cartier owner  Richemont   S CFR  and its Net A Porter online shopping portal  and it teamed up with Italy s Moncler  MI MONC  to sell a collection of its fancy puffer jackets designed solely for Pavilion  Alibaba  behind mass market shopping sites Tmall and Taobao and YouTube equivalent Youku  has already bagged distribution or content sharing alliances ranging from U S  coffee behemoth Starbucks  O SBUX  to Walt  Disney   N DIS   JD   which counts Tencent Holdings Ltd  HK 0700   owner of social media platform WeChat  as an investor   also has partnerships with the likes of Walmart  NYSE WMT  and Alphabet Inc s Google  O GOOGL   helping it gain a foothold beyond China and Southeast Asia   In luxury  it has cracked some top brands at LVMH s rival  Paris based conglomerate  Kering   PA PRTP   signing Balenciaga  known for its luxury sneakers  and fashion house Saint Laurent on to Toplife   SOLO EFFORTS Vuitton  one of the market leaders in the luxury sector with annual revenues estimated at more than 9 billion euros  is fiercely protective of its distribution as a means of controlling prices and supply  That has helped Vuitton  and a handful of rivals such as Hermes   maker of  10 000 plus Birkin bags  sustain their status at the upper end of the luxury hierarchy  a high margin sphere to which others like Britain s  Burberry   L BRBY  aspire   In China  Vuitton   like Kering s Gucci or Hermes   has ventured online but on its own terms  with a WeChat store and a standalone e commerce site launched in 2017 that it says is doing well  though it does not publish earnings    Everyone told me you couldn t go it alone in China  that no one went to a  brands com  and I think we ve proven that to be incorrect   Ian Rogers  who runs the digital operations at parent LVMH   When you have a product people really want  they re going to get it the way that s possible to get it   Chinese customers are critical for Vuitton and its peers  already accounting for at least a third of all industry sales  Many are starting to spend more at home rather than on overseas trips  encouraged by government measures such as cuts in import duties  leading labels to lower prices accordingly  But while Vuitton has stores in 20 Chinese cities  it is relying like rivals on online sales to reach clients beyond that base    A third of potential buyers are in cities where there are no luxury stores  Their only access to products is e commerce   said Sebastien Badault  Alibaba s managing director for France   The group says it can give luxury brands visibility and access to those areas  and also crunch data from its more than 600 million online shopping clients to help them identify pockets of demand   EDUCATION PROCESS LVMH did not comment on what it would take for Vuitton to join forces with either of the Chinese players  The two offer some subtly different services  with JD also handling inventories and storage for those who want it  or offering to ease brands  set up within WeChat  a platform with a billion users   The sites offer to share client data and take commissions per sale  which at Alibaba s Luxury Pavilion sit at up to 5 percent  Badault said  That is in line with the broader online shopping sector in China  but lower than the 12 15 percent average on U S  or European equivalents  he added  JD declined to give details  Other LVMH brands have already taken the plunge  including several cosmetics labels such as Benefit  which retails on Tmall  Upscale fur house Fendi has experimented with a pop up store on JD s Toplife   a method used by the group to lure brands in    We re open to doing that because we know it s an education process   Ding said  adding that JD had constant exchanges even with the reticent brands like Vuitton  Hermes and Gucci   We are invited by them to give lectures  to share our findings and experience   PEANUTS Hermes has already signaled it could cave eventually   a major departure for a brand that also only sells in its own networks  Gucci has made its red lines clear  demanding more of a crackdown on fake luxury goods circulating on the likes of Tmall   JD and Alibaba will still have to persuade brands that their platforms can deliver  They aim to eventually reach a universe of 200 to 250 luxury labels  up from the 80 Toplife expects to have by year end or the 75 Pavilion now boasts   Moncler  which launched on Pavilion in late September  said in October it was happy with the project  though the impact on sales volumes was  not yet  material  But luxury players are also increasingly open about their struggle to break China s online market alone    Our business is on fire and when I look at the e commerce that we do  in China  it s basically peanuts   Fabrizio Cardinali  chief operating officer at Italy s independent Dolce   Gabbana  told a Financial Times Business of Luxury conference earlier this year   
 We need to find a way to break through  and it s not just for us  it s for everybody  ",2018-11-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/vying-for-vuitton-chinas-ecommerce-rivals-seek-luxury-stranglehold-1673353,1673353

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2 50   The S P 500 rose 2 34   while the Nasdaq Composite rose 2 95  
For months  market participants have feared that the Fed may overshoot on policy tightening  choking economic growth  But Powell allayed those fears  saying interest rates were  just below  neutral 
 Interest rates are still low by historical standards  and they remain just below the broad range of estimates of the level that would be neutral for the economy    that is  neither speeding up nor slowing down growth   Powell said

15656,237171,TIF,Kering crown jewel Gucci banks on high end gems for growth,news,"By Pascale Denis
PARIS  Reuters    Gucci  the luxury brand that powers most of parent Kering s  PA PRTP  profits  made its first steps in high end jewelery on Tuesday with a dedicated store in Paris   part of its bid to expand its reach after a blowout fashion makeover 
Sales at the Italian label have grown at a breakneck pace since a turnaround under designer Alessandro Michele over the past three years  beating most industry rivals even as the rate of expansion slowed to 20 percent in the first quarter 
With its sights on one day overtaking peers Louis Vuitton  owned by  Kering  rival LVMH  PA LVMH   or privately held Chanel as the biggest luxury brand by revenue  Gucci is branching into new areas  including by recently rolling out cosmetics 
Its high end jewelery venture will see it compete with heavyweights of that sector  including Richemont s  S CFR  Cartier and van Cleef   Arpels  with a specialized store on Paris  historic Place Vendome 
Gucci  best known for its handbags and as a clothing label  already sold gold based jewels in the 1 500 to 2 000 euro   2 260  range  Its new line  with pieces designed by Michele and inspired by mythical gardens and fauna  carries price tags of between 50 000 and 800 000 euros 
The push comes at a booming time for the jewelery market  with demand from Asian customers in particular riding high 
Estimated to be worth 18 billion euros globally by consultancy Bain   though branded jewelery represents a smaller chunk   it was the fastest growing segment of the personal luxury goods business last year alongside shoes  with worldwide revenues rising 7 percent 
 This is an attractive category with lots of blank space   Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said 
Gucci will have a long way to go to catch up with jewelery leaders  however   Cartier s sales are estimated at around 5 billion euros by analysts  ahead of U S brand Tiffany  N TIF   at  4 4 billion or LVMH s Bulgari at around 2 5 billion euros 
By contrast  Louis Vuitton  which branched into high end jewelery in 2012  is estimated to make no more than several hundred million euros a year from jewels  as is Kering owned jeweler Boucheron 
Paris based Kering also has brands like Pomellato  Dodo and Qeelin in this category  although jewelery and watches are its smallest division 
The group reports first half sales on July 25  with all eyes on whether Gucci can maintain its momentum ",2019-07-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/kering-crown-jewel-gucci-banks-on-highend-gems-for-growth-1913633,1913633

1  China s trade call
China s Commerce Ministry kept up the happy talk on trade  issuing a statement that China and the U S   had  reached consensus on properly resolving relevant issues  on a phone call with U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  It added that the two sides had agreed to stay in contact on the remaining points for a  phase one  trade deal 
However  the statement provided no further detail and markets reacted with a shrug  having already rallied on Monday in the wake of equally waffly statements about Chinese commitment to curbing intellectual property theft 
2  Liquidity fills Powell s glass
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell gave a strongly upbeat assessment of the economy in a speech on Monday evening in Providence  R I 
 At this point in the long expansion  I see the glass as much more than half full   Powell said in comments that all but ruled out any further cuts to interest rates for the foreseeable future 
He stressed though that the Fed remains data driven  and there s data aplenty due Tuesday  The October trade balance is published at 8 30 AM ET  1330 GMT   along with retail inventories  while S P Case Shiller house price data for September are due at 9 AM  to be followed an hour later by new home sales data for October

3  EBay continues M A flurry
eBay  NASDAQ EBAY  agreed to sell StubHub to Swiss based Viagogo for  4 05 billion  a deal that will go some of the way to appeasing activist investors Elliott Management and Starboard Capital who have been pressuring it to streamline since January 
The deal follows a flurry of activity on Monday that saw the confirmation of Charles Schwab s  NYSE SCHW  all share offer for TD Ameritrade  NASDAQ AMTD   LVMH   PA LVMH  paying  16 billion for Tiffany  NYSE TIF  and   Novartis   AG  SIX NOVN  buying Medicines Co   NASDAQ MDCO  for  9 7 billion

LONDON  Reuters    World stocks edged off their highest in almost two years on Tuesday  but kept record levels in sight  following fresh signs that the United States and China were working to end a trade war dragging on the global economy 
China s Vice Premier Liu He  U S  Trade representative Robert Lighthizer and U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin held a phone call on issues related to a phase one trade agreement on Tuesday  China said 
This  alongside a strong Hong Kong debut for Chinese e commerce giant  Alibaba  in the world s largest share sale this year  boosted markets in Asia  MIAPJ0000PUS   N225   AXJO  
MSCI s 49 country main world share index  MIWD00000PUS   touched its highest level in almost two years  before drifting lower as the European session wore on  Still  it remained less than 1  off record highs hit in early 2018 
European stocks  with the exception of London s FTSE  FTSE   were broadly lower  GDAXI   FCHI  and U S  equity futures also inched down  ESc1   1YMc1  as a note of caution returned after a strong rally fueled by trade talk hopes 
The pan European STOXX 600  STOXX  remained within striking distance of four year highs 
 The outlook is positive as world trade angst is the biggest negative out there  especially when you throw in loose policy  the pick up yields for equities versus bonds and the like   said Chris Bailey  European strategist at Raymond James in London 
 However  the residual issues are clear  The first is a reversal in world trade optimism  the second is that valuations become perceived as overstretched   this can easily happen given lackluster corporate earnings growth  
In Asia  Alibaba shares  HK 9988   N BABA  opened almost 7  higher in Hong Kong than their issue price and at a small premium to pricing in New York  The listing has been seen as a vote of confidence in Hong Kong after months of anti government protests that have rocked the financial hub 
A flurry of major acquisition activity has also supported sentiment in equity markets  with France s LVMH  PA LVMH  agreeing to buy U S  jeweler Tiffany  N TIF  for  16 2 billion and  Charles Schwab  Corp  N SCHW  set to purchase U S  discount brokerage TD Ameritrade Holding Corp  O AMTD  in an all stock deal valued at  26 billion 
ALL ABOUT TRADE
Still  it was the outcome of U S  China trade talks that remained the key driver for world markets 
The U S  dollar gave up earlier gains as some of the optimism over an agreement faded  slipping from a two week high of 109 205 yen  hit during Asian trade 
The euro was also a touch firmer at  1 10150  EUR EBS  
China s yuan   the currency most sensitive to the trade war   had risen to a one week high of 7 0181 against the dollar  but was last trading at 7 0388  
 China and the U S  agreed on a framework to resolve their phase one issue  which is just a way of saying that they did admin work   said Sebastien Galy  senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management 
The United States has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods in a 16 month dispute over trade practices that the U S  government says are unfair  China has responded with its own tariffs on U S  goods 
The next important date to watch is Dec  15  when Washington is scheduled to impose even more tariffs on Chinese goods 
Safe haven bond yields  DE10YT RR  nudged back down  also reflecting the more cautious tone among investors 
The 10 year U S  Treasury yield was last down 2 basis points on the day at around 1 75   US10YT RR  
Elsewhere  Bitcoin  BTC BTSP   the world s biggest cryptocurrency  dipped to  7 065  holding above six month lows hit on Monday after the People s Bank of China launched a fresh crackdown on cryptocurrencies

158298,379814,TIF,Why Tiffany Stock Surged 66  in 2019,news,"What happened
Shares of Tiffany  NYSE TIF  gained 66  last year  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence 
In October  Tiffany received an unsolicited buyout offer from LVMH Moet Hennessy    Louis Vuitton  OTC LVMUY   OTC LVMHF  for  120 per share in cash  That represented a premium of more than 30  over where the stock had been trading the week before  
Typically with acquisitions  the stock of the company being acquired will trade around the buyout offer until the transaction is complete  But shares of Tiffany currently trade well above the offer at  133  as investors are betting that another company may come along with a better deal  But that may not happen 
The reason for investors  hopes is that after initially receiving the offer from LVMH  Tiffany reportedly approached Berkshire Hathaway s Warren Buffett about bidding for the company  but the investing legend declined  

So what
As things currently stand  Louis Vuitton will sweep Tiffany into its arms  The jeweler will hold a special stockholder meeting in early February to approve the merger agreement  but unless another party makes a proposal  it seems like a done deal  The transaction is expected to close in the middle of 2020  assuming the deal is approved by shareholders  
The iconic jewelry store has struggled lately with lower spending from tourists and currency headwinds  Worldwide net sales of  1 billion were flat year over year in the third quarter  while net earnings were down 17  due to lower margins and a higher tax rate  But business trends seemed to improve during the holidays  with a marked shift in momentum in the Americas region  
Meanwhile  the global luxury goods market is doing well  and LVMH and its iconic Louis Vuitton brand have benefited  Revenue and earnings at LVMH have steadily marched higher over the last decade  which has led LVMH stock to significantly outperform shares of Tiffany  All in all  the deal looks like a good outcome for Tiffany shareholders

Now what
The addition of Tiffany is expected to fill out LVMH s position in jewelry and allow for further growth in the U S  market  In a statement  LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault said   We will be proud to have Tiffany sit alongside our iconic brands and look forward to ensuring that Tiffany continues to thrive for centuries to come  ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfkf5,2055325
158299,379815,TIF,Tiffany   Co  Shareholders Officially Agree to Let LVMH Take Over,news,"As was largely expected  shareholders of luxury brand Tiffany   Co   NYSE TIF  agreed to an amicable acquisition of the company by bigger rival LVMH  OTC LVMHF   OTC LVMUY   which owns high end brands like fashion label Louis Vuitton  Dior perfumes  Moet   Chandon wines  and others  The addition of Tiffany to the LVMH family will primarily bolster its jewelry business  though Tiffany   Co  also offers accessories  perfumes  and some items for the home 

News of a potential deal surfaced in October of last year  when LVMH confirmed it was in negotiations with Tiffany  LVMH announced an official offer in November  valuing Tiffany   Co  at  16 2 billion  or around  135 per share  A small number of Tiffany investors sought to block the acquisition  claiming documents filed with the SEC in mid December didn t include adequate information about the merger  including financial projections  Most shareholders are seemingly unconcerned about that paperwork  however  with LVMH reporting on Tuesday that Tiffany shareholders  voted overwhelmingly to approve  the union 
The buyout could reasonably be regarded as a graceful exit from a difficult situation  Though the Tiffany name is still well respected  that cachet has not translated into meaningful sales or earnings growth  Aside from the impact of a tariff war that has crimped tourism to locations where many Tiffany   Co  stores are located  younger consumers are increasingly disinterested in luxury goods just for the sake of luxury  Last year s top line of  4 44 billion matched 2018 s total sales  That s in contrast with LVMH  which broke its own record again last year by driving revenue of  60 billion  up 15  year over year ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pr0kn,2075876

158370,379886,TIF,3 Large Cap Funds To Buy As Wall Street Reaches Record Highs,opinion,Mutual fund investors  who wish to make the best of Wall Street s climb to record highs  could turn their attention to funds that invest in large capitalization companies  There are solid reasons to do that right now First  certain significant developments on the U S  China trade front indicate the possibility of the phase one deal by the end of this year  In addition  a string of mergers and acquisitions have also been instrumental in inducing optimism into Wall Street  Let us  therefore  consider a few such mutual funds Fresh Hopes for U S  China Trade Deal in 2019Wall Street has scaled new heights this week  thanks to some progress in the U S  China trade relationship  First  U S  national security advisor Robert O Brien s remarks on Nov 23 that a phase one trade deal with China could be approved before the end of 2019 boosted markets In fact  China also returned the optimistic tone on trade remarks on Sunday by  more protection to intellectual property rights  which is a crucial issue in trade negotiations between the United States and China  This renewed hopes in Wall Street after investors were left disappointed last week Considering that a phase one agreement is indeed successful  some of the imposed tariffs could be eliminated  This puts large capitalization companies on the forefront for gains as mostly the products and services of these companies are subject to tariffs at present In addition  Trump may decide not to impose the next batch of scheduled tariffs on Dec 15 after all  Since the existing tariffs have diminished corporate profit margins and slowed global growth  companies would definitely benefit from the overall tariff relief Mergers   Acquisitions to Push Wall Street HigherApart from the new found optimism around trade talks  much activity on the front of mergers and acquisitions  M A  also promises to boost the financial markets in days to come A number of top notch companies entered into M As this week  for example  LVMH Mo t Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE  LVMH   the world s biggest luxury goods company confirmed on Nov 25 that

158398,379914,TIF,Tiffany  TIF  To Report Q3 Results  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Tiffany  TIF  reports results for the quarter ended October 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This luxury jeweler is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 86 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 7  
Revenues are expected to be  1 04 billion  up 2 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 51  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Tiffany 
For Tiffany  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 17  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Tiffany will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Tiffany would post earnings of  1 05 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 12  delivering a surprise of  6 67  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

In Q2  TIF beat our earnings estimate by 6 67   but revenue of roughly  1 05 billion missed our estimate by 1 9   The company s Q2 earnings and revenue fell 4 27  and 2 55   respectively  The Americas and Asia Pacific regions both slipped in Q2 by 4  and 1   respectively  Japan was flat and Europe took a hit of 4  
The company s comparable sales were not safe from Y Y losses  the Americas dropped 4   Asia Pacific fell 3  and Europe tumbled 6   Executives said the results were again impacted by slowing spending on the part of Chinese tourists visiting other major world cities  Tiffany and Co  lowered its sales outlook to predict roughly flat comps and its brand evolvement will involve aggressive marketing spending over the next six months 
Going Forward 
The Y Y losses are projected to come to a halt in Q3 as consensus estimates predict earnings to rally 14 29  to  0 88 and for revenue to make a 3  climb to  1 04 billion  Revenues in the Americas and Japan is forecasted to spike 4 07  and 6 34   respectively  KCM estimates are anticipating sales in Asia Pacific to rise 7 48  while Europe will see a decline of 4 39   Comps for the Americas and Asia Pacific are both forecasted to increase by 4  and Japan sales are expected to jump 2   Looking ahead to the company s current fiscal year estimates  earnings are predicted to pop 4 98  on the back of a 1  revenue gain to  4 49 billion 
Tiffany and Co  is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and is trying to revitalize its company s growth  Despite the company s Y Y troubles  TIF has beaten our estimates three out of the past four quarters for an average EPS surprise of 5 08   The company has not been able to make any large gains this year as a result of its struggling growth  To turn things around  the company may have to spend aggressively on its brand s revival  which will put pressure on its bottom line in the short term  Time will tell if the company will utilize the right merchandising and marketing strategies and return to growth

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6 67   A quarter ago  it was expected that this luxury jeweler would post earnings of  1 01 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 03  delivering a surprise of 1 98  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Tiffany  which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Jewelry industry  posted revenues of  1 05 billion for the quarter ended July 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 78   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 08 billion  The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Tiffany shares have added about 2 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 14 5  
What s Next for Tiffany 
While Tiffany has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Tiffany was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

158447,379963,TIF,Tiffany  TIF  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Tiffany in Focus
Based in New York  Tiffany  TIF  is in the Retail Wholesale sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 15 43   The luxury jeweler is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 58 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 5   This compares to the Retail   Jewelry industry s yield of 0 65  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 88  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 32 is up 7 9  from last year  Tiffany has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 10 13   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Tiffany s current payout ratio is 48   This means it paid out 48  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  TIF expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  4 88 per share  with earnings expected to increase 5 63  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  TIF is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-07-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tiffany-tif-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200447046,200447046

158469,379985,TIF,Earnings Preview  Tiffany  TIF  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Tiffany  TIF  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This luxury jeweler is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 02 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 5  
Revenues are expected to be  1 02 billion  down 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Tiffany 
For Tiffany  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Tiffany will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Tiffany would post earnings of  1 60 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 60  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Tiffany doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-05-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-tiffany-tif-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200421698,200421698

At last check  Tiffany   Co stock is up 1  at  90 01  potentially turning a corner after a recent downtrend on the charts  The stock s latest leg lower was sparked by a late April rejection at its 320 day moving average  which sent TIF spiraling back below the  87 mark for the first time since early February last week  Longer term  however  the equity is 12  higher year to date 


Digging into Tiffany s earnings history  the stock has only closed higher the day after earnings in three of the last eight quarters    including a 23 3  surge this time last year  as well as a 3 1  gain in March  Over the past two years  the shares have swung an average of 7  the day after earnings  regardless of direction  This time around  the options market is pricing in a larger than usual 11 1  swing for Tuesday s trading

158473,379989,TIF,Tiffany  TIF  Q1 Earnings Surpass Estimates,opinion,"Tiffany  TIF  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 03 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 01 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 14 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1 98   A quarter ago  it was expected that this luxury jeweler would post earnings of  1 60 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 60  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Tiffany  which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Jewelry industry  posted revenues of  1 billion for the quarter ended April 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 60   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 03 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Tiffany shares have added about 12  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 9 5  
What s Next for Tiffany 
While Tiffany has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Tiffany was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 13 on  1 08 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 90 on  4 54 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Retail   Jewelry is currently in the bottom 11  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-06-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tiffany-tif-q1-earnings-surpass-estimates-200428173,200428173
158492,380008,TIF,Earnings Preview  Tiffany  TIF  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Tiffany  TIF  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended January 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on March 22  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This luxury jeweler is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 60 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 2  
Revenues are expected to be  1 34 billion  up 0 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 37  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Tiffany 
For Tiffany  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 21  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Tiffany will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Tiffany would post earnings of  0 76 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 77  delivering a surprise of  1 32  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Tiffany doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-03-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-tiffany-tif-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200398174,200398174

When looking at the last two reports  this luxury jeweler has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 9 16   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Tiffany was expected to post earnings of  0 76 per share  but it reported  0 77 per share instead  representing a surprise of 1 32   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 per share  while it actually produced  1 17 per share  a surprise of 17  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Tiffany lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Tiffany currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 21   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on March 22  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

158520,380036,TIF,Will Tokenizing Diamonds Improve Liquidity ,opinion,"The cryptocurrency market may be going through one of its roughest patches in history  but that does not mean that the disruptive power of the underlying technology  the blockchain  will follow the same path 
In fact  while crypto prices continue to fall  disruptive startups continue to explore ways to use the distributed ledger technology to disrupt different markets  We have already seen the various ways that blockchain is disrupting real estate  the precious metals market  and B2B transactions 
So  it certainly looks like there are no limits to what startups can do with blockchain technology  The wind of disruption has now spread to the luxurious products market  Startups are disrupting the diamonds industry by developing platforms that can monitor the supply chain and help improve liquidity in the market 
Addressing The Supply Chain Challenges
Investing in the diamonds market has been one of the trickiest forms of investments over the years  And just like the cryptocurrency market  the industry is clouded with some level of controversy  In some areas  diamonds have been linked to civil wars  while others have continued to point out how the black market plays a role  This  to some extent  affects the goodwill of the industry 
And from an investing perspective  diamonds have always posed the challenge of lack of liquidity in the market  This adds to the supply chain problems that continue to plague the industry  The market has also reportedly been flooded with uncertified diamonds  In fact  according to reports  non certified  loose  diamonds dominate transactions in the industry  This calls for more caution when investing in the gems market 
While there are legal organizations tasked with certifying diamonds  some investors still find themselves investing in these risky non certified gems  This has continued to create an imbalance in the market prompting industry experts to caution diamond investors against investing in diamonds that are not GIA certified 
However  with recent innovations in blockchain technology  a lot of these problems could be minimized or wiped out entirely  Companies have been trying to fix the perennial supply chain problem in the diamonds market  Some of the top players in this  exclusive market  have developed blockchain based platforms that will help to track diamonds from mine to the store 
The world s largest diamonds producer De Beer s is leading a group of fellow diamonds market players towards implementing a system that will help track high end diamonds  In May last year  reports indicated that the company had already managed to track more than 100 high value diamonds from mine to jeweler using its Blockchain based platform Tracr 
Venus Jewel  Rosy Blue NV  KGK Group  Diacore  and Diarough who joined De Beer s in this project are helping to create a new paradigm shift in the diamonds market that could help revolutionize the entire supply chain 
Earlier in the year  technology giant IBM  NYSE IBM  also announced the launch of a blockchain platform  TrustChain  IBM has teamed up with a consortium of companies involved in the diamonds market supply chain and wants to help jewelers to verify and track the originality of their gems before they sell them to their customers 
These platforms could help reduce the challenge of non certified diamonds in the market while at the same time putting diamonds in a system that could improve digitization of the industry 
Putting Diamonds In The Blockchain
In order to improve liquidity in the diamonds market  the first step will involve putting as many diamonds as possible in a distributed ledger  From here  it becomes easier to tokenize diamonds thereby bringing more players in the market 
Diamonds are generally expensive stones and making it possible to invest just buying tokens  then it becomes easier for more retail investors to get involved  Some companies in the market have already shown that this can be done by launching cryptocurrencies that are backed by GIA certified diamonds 
A good example  in this case  is Sparkle Coin  SPRK   which is diamond backed crypto that has allocated a  5 00 worth of GIA certified diamonds against each coin on offer  These diamonds are stored with some of the leading diamonds wholesalers thereby ensuring security  The company s blockchain platform tries to bridge the gap between  blockchain technologies  mainstream business  and general consumers by enabling secure B2B and B2C transactions through a powerful currency exchange  
When investors invest in this diamonds backed crypto  they do not invest in the diamonds market  However  they are actually investing in its disruptive tech that tries to bring about a seamless relationship between blockchain technologies  businesses  and consumers by securing B2B and B2C transactions through its crypto exchange 
Nonetheless  now with platforms like De Beer s Tracr and IBM s TrustChain helping to put diamonds in the blockchain  investors can leverage the same concept being employed by Sparkle Coin to launch certified diamonds tokens that are secured using the blockchain 
How Tokenized Diamonds Will Improve The Industry
The diamonds market is composed of a few giant manufacturers and several retail jewelers  The biggest of the giants is De Beer s and this gives it a certain level of monopoly  which is never good for business 
De Beer s chooses when to hike and lower diamonds prices thereby affecting the players in the supply chain  For instance  this past November  shares of Signet Jewelers  NYSE SIG  and those of Tiffany   Co   NYSE TIF  fell following news that De Beer s has cut prices for low end diamonds by 10  
Even more perplexing is the fact that it was not clear when the giant diamonds producer actually cut the prices  The company usually controls diamonds prices by restricting supply and not reducing prices  so when news of a price reduction pop up  it is usually unexpected by diamonds investors 
If diamonds can be put in the blockchain right from the mine  that gives investors access to the distributed ledger network  which will make prices more decentralized and harder for one player to dictate movements 
Conclusion
In summary  the cryptocurrency market might be going through a difficult patch with prices of most currencies tumbling to 2 year lows  Bitcoin appears to be locked below the  4 000 mark while Ethereum has been the most affected by the market wide plunge to go along with its own troubles 
However  the disruptive force of the blockchain technology is nowhere close to following in the footsteps of the pioneer crypto that made it popular  bitcoin  In fact  the popularity of the blockchain technology continues to grow enormously and as we have seen  more markets are up for the disruption 
The diamonds market could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the continued success of blockchain technology  Tokenizing diamonds could bring more players into the market through decentralization while at the same time ensuring the security of the supply chain  IBM s TrustChain and De Beer s Tracr have made the first steps to putting diamonds in the blockchain

158521,380037,TIF,Signet Stock Falls On Lackluster Holiday Sales   Lower View ,opinion,"Shares of Signet Jewelers Limited   NYSE SIG   lost sheen on the bourses and nosedived roughly 24 7  on Jan 17  2019  as investors fretted over the company s lackluster performance during the holiday season  This compelled the retailer of diamond jewelry to trim sales and earnings forecast 
Management stated that fall in sales of legacy collections  aggressive promotional environment and waning traffic during important gifting weeks of December were the primary reasons behind lower than expected results  Even the company s new merchandise assortment  digital marketing and omni channel efforts failed to deliver desired results 
Signet s total sales for the nine week period ended Jan 5  2019  decreased 2 5  to  1 835 4 million  while same store sales fell 1 3   On a constant currency basis  total sales dropped 1 9   Non same store sales during the festive season fell 0 6   E commerce sales increased 5 6  year over year to  222 3 million 
Meanwhile sales at North America and International segments declined 2 1  to  1 667 5 million and 11 7  to  156 4 million  respectively  Same store sales across the respective segments declined 0 7  and 7 3  
We note that same store sales across Kay  Jared  James Allen and Regional banners fell 0 8   8   0 2  and 14 6   respectively  However  the metric improved 2 9   16 9  and 4 5  across Zales  Piercing Pagoda and Peoples  respectively 
The dismal results compelled management to lower view  Signet  which competes with Tiffany   NYSE TIF    now expects fourth quarter fiscal 2019 same store sales to decline in the band of 1 6 2 5  compared with previous forecast of down 1 5  to up 1 0   Management now projects adjusted earnings between  3 77 and  3 92 per share for the quarter compared with  4 35  4 59 anticipated earlier 
For fiscal 2019  same store sales are now expected to be flat compared with the prior estimate of flat to up 1   Adjusted earnings are projected in the band of  3 53  3 69 per share compared with earlier view of  4 15  4 40  Management now expects capital expenditures between  165 million and  175 million compared with prior guidance of  165  185 million 

 
Bottom Line
Signet s dull holiday season and subsequent trimming of guidance hurt investor sentiment and it will come as no surprise if shares slide further in the coming days  In the past three months  shares of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company have plunged 52 8  compared with the Zacks  industry s decline of 24 3

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Tiffany currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 13   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on November 28  2018 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-11-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-tiffany-tif-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200362829,200362829

2018 results  which marked the company s tenth straight quarter of positive earnings surprise  However  sales fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate after surpassing the same in the five successive quarters  Although top line increased year over year  it failed to check the decline in the bottom line The company hinted that net sales grew due to increased spending by local customers  however  lower spending by foreign tourists  mainly Chinese  remains a drag  Management also highlighted that increased investment spending hurt the company s quarterly earnings  while gross margin expansion and lower effective tax rate favorably impacted the same Tiffany reiterated its fiscal 2018 earnings projection but trimmed its comparable sales  comps  guidance Q3 HighlightsThe company s quarterly earnings of 77 cents a share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny but declined roughly 4  year over year  Net sales came in at  1 012 4 million  up almost 4  from  976 2 million in the prior year quarter  However  the reported figure came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 052 million Notably  the top line gained from sales improvement across most product categories and in

  respectively  On the contrary  sales across Designer Jewelry declined 8   Increase in jewelry volumes led to mid single digit jump in net sales  in spite of lower spending by Chinese tourists in the

of diamonds and favorable product input costs  These were partially offset by higher investment spending  Operating margin contracted 430 basis points to 12 5   thanks to increased SG A expenses SG A expenses rose 15  to  502 9 million during the quarter primarily due to higher marketing spending  rise in labor and incentive compensation  store occupancy and depreciation expenses  Apart from marketing  Tiffany increased its expenditure in technology  visual merchandising  digital and store presentations Management also revealed intentions to increase investments in various areas  in a drive to reach its long term growth potential  This is expected to lead to a considerable rise in SG A costs  which is likely to increase at a rate higher than sales for the remaining part of the year

158572,380088,TIF,Here s How We Discovered This Disruptive Gold Stock  Before It Went Public,opinion,"If you ve run into difficulties lately finding the best gold stocks to invest in  you re not alone  Sentiment has been down  But there are still some very attractive opportunities out there in the goldfields  one of which I want to share with you 
First  a quick recap  The price of gold tested support of  1 200 an ounce on Monday as the U S  dollar strengthened to a 16 month high  propelled by expectations of additional interest rate hikes  A stronger greenback  remember  weighs on gold as well as a number of other commodities  including oil  since they re priced in dollars  I ve inverted the dollar s values in the chart below so it s easier to see this relationship 

Gold miners have felt the pressure  too  In the 12 month period as of November 12  the FTSE Gold Mines  which reflects the stock performance of producers from around the world  lost 17 66 percent 
This may have made it challenging for some gold investors to find promising stocks  As such  assets have dropped  Gold and precious metal ETFs in North America saw net outflows of 58 metric tons in 2018 through October 31  according to the World Gold Council  WGC  
But selling now is the wrong move  I believe  Gold stocks appear to be highly undervalued relative to the S P 500 Index  and a sharp drop in the market could strongly boost demand for the yellow metal  This means it might be time to consider accumulating 
Meet Mene  Gold Jewelry DisruptorFor investors who wish to increase their exposure to gold  I believe our Gold and Precious Metals Fund  USERX  is an attractive option with a history of strong performance  USERX is actively managed  meaning we rely on fundamentals and on cultivating relationships with management teams to decide which companies go in and out of the fund 
One of those companies  the one I hinted at earlier  is a newcomer to the industry Mene Inc 
You might not have heard the name Mene yet  but you could soon enough  especially if you re in the market for fine jewelry 
Founded in 2017 by Roy Sebag  co founder of gold financial services firm Goldmoney  and Diana Widmaier Picasso  granddaughter of you guessed it Pablo Picasso  Mene s mission is to disrupt the gold jewelry market by selling directly to the consumer and pricing its merchandise fairly and transparently  Unlike traditional sellers like Tiffany   Co  NYSE TIF   and Cartier  which sometimes have high premiums  Mene prices its jewelry based on the changing value of gold  It then charges a 15 percent to 20 percent design and production fee on top of that 
What also sets the company apart is that its jewelry from earrings to necklaces  bracelets to charms is made of 24 karat gold or platinum  No alloys  no insets of diamonds or other stones  That s done to help the pieces retain their value over time 
Here at U S  Global Investors  we believe gold is money and a timeless investment  Mene  which takes its name from the Aramaic word for  money   has clearly run with that idea  going so far as to trademark the phrase  investment jewelry  
It s a business model that seems to have resonated with consumers and investors alike  In its first 10 months of operation  Mene did as much as  7 million in sales in more than 53 countries  as of October 2018 
Active Management Can Help You Invest in Attractive Companies Before the Street Does The reason I tell you this is to highlight our potential ability to find and invest in little known yet promising companies before they become overvalued  In the case of Mene  we managed to get in even earlier  before shares in the company were made available to the public 
Mene went public on the S P TSX Composite earlier this month  But thanks to active management and our industry relationships  we were able to buy shares privately seven months ago  So even before its stock was available to retail investors  Mene accounted for 2 46 percent of the Gold and Precious Metals Fund  USERX  as of September 30 
For the one year  five year and 10 year periods  USERX beat its benchmark  the FTSE Gold Mines Index  as of September 30  2018  You can see its performance here USERX holds an incredible four star rating overall from Morningstar as of September 30 in the Equity Precious Metals category  It also holds four stars for the three year  five year and 10 year periods  based on risk adjusted returns

158578,380094,TIF,Analysts Estimate Tiffany  TIF  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Tiffany  TIF  reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 28  2018  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This luxury jeweler is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 76 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5  
Revenues are expected to be  1 05 billion  up 7 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 14  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Tiffany 
For Tiffany  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Tiffany will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Tiffany would post earnings of  1 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 17  delivering a surprise of  17  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

158693,380209,TIF,Tough Time For Retail Jewelry Stocks  Tiffany Breaks The Mold,opinion,Jewelry has long been an item of fascination for women  However  the sparkle and glitter of gems is not enough  when it comes to the financial world  Instead  investors actually look at several other things such as fundamentals  past performance  along with the broader economic factors  all of which play a crucial role in their investment decisions  industry  which currently occupies bottom 7   246 out of 265  position among the Zacks Classified industries  has not been a spectacular performer  So far this year  the industry has declined 2 2   while the Zacks categorized  sector and the S P 500 Index has witnessed a gain of 17 4  and 10   respectively  The industry has been grappling with waning store traffic  stiff competition from online retailers and unwillingness of consumers to spend exorbitantly on discretionary items So far in the year  jewelry stocks like Signet Jewelers Limited   NYSE SIG   and Movado Group  Inc    NYSE MOV   have declined 38  and 21   respectively  Meanwhile  Tiffany   Co    NYSE TIF   has done exceptionally well with shares gaining 19 2  Why is Signet Losing Sheen Signet Jewelers  bearish run in the bourses can primarily be attributed to 10th straight quarter of top line miss  dismal same store sales and muted outlook  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  stock has indicated that lower spending on jewelry has been hampering its performance  quite evident from its first quarter fiscal 2018 results  wherein  both the top line and bottom line lagged estimates and declined year over year No wonder  management reiterated its bleak outlook for fiscal 2018  The company expects same store sales to decline in the range of low to mid single digit  In fiscal 2017  same store sales had declined 1 9   Further  it anticipates earnings per share between  7 00 and  7 40 for the current fiscal year  in comparison with fiscal 2017 figure of  7 45 Disappointing results and the murky outlook were enough to trigger a downtrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate  In the past 30 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter and fiscal 2018 has declined by 9 cents and 33 cents to  1 11 and  6 77  respectively Why Movado Lacks Lustre Another stock  which is still struggling to make its way out of the woods  is  Movado Group  Investors remained concerned about this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company whose top and bottom lines have been declining  Despite its focus on cost containment  the company s earnings in first quarter fiscal 2018 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a wide margin of 90  and also plunged 94 7  year over year  In the first  second  third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  the company s bottom line declined 24   46   1 1  and 45   respectively  The top line  which has declined in the all the four quarters in fiscal 2017  witnessed a fall of 13 2  in first quarter fiscal 2018 In fiscal 2018  Movado anticipates net sales in the range of  515  530 million  down from the fiscal 2017 and 2016 net sales of  552 8 million and  594 9 million  respectively Why Tiffany Continues to Sparkle While Signet and Movado have succumbed to industry headwinds  Tiffany appears to be a lone fighter  Tiffany s omni channel platform  store expansion plans  tapping of new markets and venturing into new revenue generating areas has facilitated it to outperform the industry  Tiffany is well positioned to augment its top and bottom line performance in the long run by leveraging capital investments made in the last several years in distribution  manufacturing and diamond sourcing processes  The company is also looking at other revenue generating avenues  and this includes expansion of watch business Tiffany had earlier notified that its long term objective is to attain ROA of at least 10  and ROE of at least 15   Additionally  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company delivered fourth straight quarter of positive earnings surprise  when it posted first quarter fiscal 2017 results   You can see  Tiffany  Signet   Movado Scorecard  Source  Zacks comFrom the above table it is evident Tiffany looks to have a clear advantage  in terms of fundamentals  past and future performance  However  the catch here is that both Signet and Movado have the advantage of being a smaller entity with more scope for market share growth if they set their strategies right Zacks  Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public  certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of

158807,380323,TIF,Fed Leans To Move As Markets Sleep,opinion,"If a participant in a time machine was looking back in history and comparing the events of financial markets from 2016 to 2015  they probably would not be able to tell one from another  especially if they were comparing the actions of the Federal Reserve  If you might recall way back when  about 12 months prior  our inflation  oops  deflation fighting heroes  nobody knows which one these days   were debating on when they should raise interest rates  Should lift off take place in September  or December  Fast forward one year  during a policy speech in late August at posh Jackson Hole  Wyoming  Mrs  Yellen and her deputy  Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve Stanley Fischer  commented the case for additional tightening was strengthening  It seems on the proportional scale of importance of the dual mandate  improved employment totals the last two months have more significance than piddling inflation figures  Fed fund futures show a quarter point raise moving to over 40  in September and over 60  for December  A key difference between last year and this year is  in case you forgot  this little event called an election  We all know the Fed never takes into account politics when it makes its policy decisions  Of course it doesn t  why would anyone think such a thing
In any event  markets continue to slumber on after the policy speech  Participants make the comparison between allocating capital to the United States  which saw second quarter GDP come in at a slow 1 1   or other parts of the globe  where negative nominal interest rates are the central banks prescription to fight the commodity bust and slack demand  Very much like the similarity with Fed policy  in the markets  Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman picked up their disagreement about who is doing what with Herbalife  NYSE HLF   just like a few years ago  Bill says Carl will sell  Carl says Bill is wrong  he loves his position  even bought more yesterday   In other news related to specific companies  Signet Jewelers Ltd  NYSE SIG  and Tiffany   Co  NYSE TIF  reported quarterly results  Signet lulled while Tiffany s shined  primarily because expectations were so low for Tiffany s and the Signet management told us people were not getting married because of the comments of our fabulous presidential contenders 
In the health care space  the big news came from Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   where it decided to raise the price of its Epipen product  The public outrage was palpable  as the price increase has gone from 50 bucks to now nearly  600 a year over a ten year time frame  Anecdotally  my daughter had a classmate with the nut allergy that Epipen is the cure for  and for others with similar kinds of extreme allergies  this is the only product offered to cure these life threatening events  Ever the morally upstanding person  Hillary Clinton brought attention to the whole industry with her comments about greedy pharmaceutical companies taking advantage of taxpayer funded research with the outrageous price increases  Naturally  the whole health care sector  or close to it  sold off some 
The issue is complex as drug companies have to spend nearly a billion dollars or more to bring a drug to market and go through the three trial phases to get approval by the FDA  As a public company  most research for promising drugs does not prove commercially viable and the capital outlays show minimal return  So  when a drug makes it through the process  the company now has a product to help compensate for those which fail  Drugs with no competitors  or those in the orphan classification  yield staggering prices  and Epipen is a primary example  The pharmaceutical sector in the United States remains the global leader and I see very little changing this for the foreseeable future  although the political football surrounding pricing is going to have a high profile with both candidates

158832,380348,TIF,Jewelry Store Stock Earnings Preview  SIG Vs  TIF ,opinion,"Today s video takes a closer look at the jewelry corner of the retail market  an area that is definitely facing some questions 
This area of the retail world has been struggling for quite some time  much like its peers in the broader retail space  However  the outlooks remain poor for companies here  and there are still questions about growth in this corner of the market 
That is why this industry has a bottom 15  industry rank  and why many companies have  sell  ranks right now  But what about some of the top companies reporting this week  Let s take a quick look at some of the big names ahead of their reports below 
 
Tiffany   Co  NYSE TIF 
It has definitely been a rough time for TIF  and it has a very ugly track record in earnings season too  The company has missed estimates in three of the last four reports  while earnings estimates appear to be on a continued downtrend as well  This is again a case where you just need to hope that expectations are just too low  but with a  sell  ranking  it is hard to have high expectations even with a  B  fundamental score for this stock TIFFANY   CO Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Signet Jewelers  SIG  
SIG has been doing a little bit better than TIF lately  but things still haven t been great  Yes  the company does have a better track record in earnings season  but estimates have been trending lower in recent sessions here as well  But with a recent move to  sell  territory  it is hard to like this one either  but it at least appears to be slightly more optimistic than TIF at this time SIGNET JEWELERS Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

158866,380382,TIF,This Beaten Down Stock Is Ready For A Comeback,opinion,"Buy low  sell high   it s the mantra of every successful investor 
Me  I m constantly looking for beaten down stocks  But I don t want just any company that s been crushed  After all  trying to catch falling knives will make a bloodbath out of your portfolio 
No  it has to be a stock primed for a big comeback  One that has strong and growing fundamentals  Investment legend Benjamin Graham preached this approach 
I like to call them  comeback stocks  
Today s chart presents a perfect example of a beaten down company that s ready for takeoff    Tiffany   Co   NYSE  NYSE TIF  
As you can see in this week s chart  Tiffany s gross margin has been steadily rising  It comes thanks  at least in part  to a whopping 32  drop in diamond prices 
See  those beautifully compressed pieces of coal make up a big portion of cost for Tiffany s  And as the price of diamonds decreases  the company margins increase 
Lower costs  higher profits 
So why is Tiffany down 18 5  year to date 
The company whiffed big time in its most recent quarter  missing on both sales and earnings  It also lowered its guidance for the year   One positive note  Tiffany was able to lift its dividend 12 5   
A lot of the recent negativity is due to the stronger U S  dollar  Many of Tiffany s stores are located abroad  A powerful greenback means less is brought home after local currencies are converted 
Now add in economic pullbacks in China and Europe  It s easy to see why sales took a hit 
But these are temporary problems  With input costs on diamonds continuing to fall  this could be a perfect opportunity to get in on the stock 
I looked at Tiffany s financials compared to its peers  Check out the table below  The company is outperforming its industry peers on several metrics 

Pay special attention to the value metrics like price to earnings  P E   price to book  P B  and price to free cash flow  P FCF   When gauging a potential comeback stock  the lower these numbers the better 
The only spot where Tiffany is underperforming its peers is price to sales  P S   But  as I said  that s likely a temporary situation 
Don t be surprised if Tiffany is a top performer in the second half of the year  The numbers indicate a comeback is right around the corner ",2016-06-05,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-beaten-down-stock-is-ready-for-a-comeback-200134002,200134002

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations   

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  

Tiffany s  TIF  Prospects Bleak  Buy These Retail Stocks Instead

Tiffany   Co      remains deeply entrenched in the bearish territory as the stock has lost its value by nearly 18  in the past six months  Investors need to exercise extreme caution when it comes to the stock as it is unlikely to show any major improvement in the near future  Let s delve deeper and try to find out what is taking this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company down 

	Tiffany s dwindling top line and bottom line performances remain the primary concern for investors  A look at the company s fiscal 2015 results unveils that earnings per share fell 7 9  and 3  year over year in the third and the fourth quarter  respectively  Net sales also declined 2 2  and 6   respectively  over the same period 

	Fiscal 2016 also witnessed a rough start with a year over year decline of 21  in earnings per share and 7  in net sales in the first quarter  A mature domestic market  foreign currency headwinds and cautious consumer spending continue to pose concerns 

	Following the dismal performance  management provided a muted outlook for fiscal 2016  Management anticipates earnings per share for fiscal 2016 to decrease by a mid single digit percentage from the prior year  The company had earlier forecast earnings per share for fiscal 2016 to be flat to down in mid single digits  Tiffany now projects fiscal second quarter earnings to decline at the same rate as the fiscal first quarter  The company estimates fiscal 2016 worldwide net sales to decrease by a low single digit percentage 

	Tiffany s earnings estimate revisions provide a clear picture of analysts  opinion about the stock  In the past 30 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 has declined by 3 5  to  3 61 per share  Also  over the same time frame  the estimates for fiscal second quarter have moved down to 72 cent from 80 cents 

	With Tiffany s share price tumbling and estimates witnessing downward revisions  it would not be prudent to keep the stock in your portfolio  at least for the time being  But for now  how about being a wise investor  Let s look for some retail stocks that could prove to be great additions

158868,380384,TIF,Tiffany Has A Bling Bling Triple Bottom,opinion,"Retail is dead if you aren t Walmart  NYSE WMT  or Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   but a chart pattern is a chart pattern and what you have on Tiffany  NYSE TIF  is a gorgeous triple bottom with just the right amount of sparkle to it  
The  60 level seems to have insane amounts of  there  because every time it has touched the level going back to January  it has held on like a rock  Now granted  the volatility in this stock can get crazy  and I think if you buy it  you run the risk of another massive non Amazon  non Walmart  retail sell off 
So know the risk  and know that a guidance lower by TIF or an ugly downgrade by some random bank could easily hit this stock 
On another  but not quite related topic  I ve never quite understood the fascination with diamonds  Sure they are nice and clear  but it seems now Tiffany s and other jewelers are so desperate to find new ways to sell diamonds to a cash strapped population that they take the ugly yellow stained diamonds and market them as some kind of must have diamond for the masses 
And why do women need diamonds for that matter  in the first place  Do they really expect it to make the marriage better simply because the rock is heavier on their finger  A divorce rate over 50  says that diamonds aren t adding anything to the marriage

158894,380410,TIF,Will Q1  16 Mark The Bottom For S P 500 Earnings Growth ,opinion,"The headline continues to be the  64 000 question  regarding SP 500 earnings 
The reason the probability for SP 500 earnings bottoming in Q1  16 is starting to gain some traction is the action in commodities  and the action in the US dollar  which is slowly weakening 
No question the drag on SP 500 earnings the last 18 months  has been Energy and the Basic Materials sectors  but even the  core SP 500 earnings   ex Energy and Basic Mat  has declined from  9  in Q1  15 to roughly 2 5   and this chart needs to be updated  as of Q4  15   In the linked blog post  find the attached spreadsheet showing Q4  15 earnings expectations   ex  a number of factors  
The big puzzle the last 6 months has been the commodity collapse and how it has impacted not just the credit markets  but also the Financial sector and stock market sentiment  Corporate high yield has rallied sharply the last few weeks presumably as the commodity complex has rallied considerably  which   if sustained   should also ultimately benefit the Financial sector  and given the trade the last few years  Emerging Markets   Heard directly from one person at lunch this quarter  in a lending capacity for a major bank   the regulators came through and had us write down to zero any Energy related credit  whether current and performing  or not   
Per Briefing com  the Dollar Index traded down to 96 and change this week  The dollar index hit a high of just over 100 on March 22nd  2015  in a dramatic strengthening that started in October  2014  and was coincident with the drop in the price of crude  The strengthening in the dollar index was truly historic from October  2014  to March 22nd  2015 in terms of the degree of strengthening  which wreaked havoc on SP 500 revenue and revenue guidance in 2015   I think it was Bespoke that noted the unprecedented degree of dollar strengthening last March  15  
Which metric do I think is more important   Well  between the two  I d prefer to see commodity prices continue to stabilize  particularly crude  However the dollar slowly weakening   I think   will provide some sentiment and psychological relief for executives around forward guidance for the rest of 2016 
The Fed meeting this week could be  bullish on America  for all you oldies who remember the Merrill Lynch slogan of the late 1970s  Given employment  some nascent stirrings in inflation  and the jobless claims number this week  which was very strong  the Fed could be closer to another 25 bp s than many might think  and that some of the SP 500 weakness could be attributed to the slow withdrawal of liquidity  Ultimately a  normalization  of interest rates  as long as it is relatively slow and measured  is a good thing for the US economy and the stock market 
SP 500 earnings data  by the numbers   courtesy of Thomson Reuters   
Forward 4 quarter estimate   120 67  down from last week s  120 95

Overall weaker spending on top of macroeconomic volatility and reluctance to offer promotions hasn t fared well for the jewelry retailer moving forward 
What are you expecting for   
Despite being a girl s best friend  diamonds and jewelry have lost their sparkle lately  In the past few years demand for jewelry related products have substantially declined  Unsurprisingly  Tiffany   Co s  TIF  earnings have suffered as a result  leading to misses on the top and bottom line in each of its last 2 quarters  Early indications suggest the company s fourth quarter earnings won t do much to reverse this pattern  In fact  Tiffany s has seen a good deal of unfavorable revisions activity lately  with EPS and sales estimates down 10  each in the last 3 months  As a result  The Estimize community is looking for EPS of  1 40 on  1 21 billion in revenue  right in line with the Street on the top and bottom line  Compared to the year prior this predicts as a 7  decline in profitability while revenue is expected to shrink by 6   Poor earnings have cost shareholders  with the stock falling 19 6  in the last 12 months  Overall weaker spending trends in the U S  on top of macroeconomic volatility and the reluctance to offer promotions doesn t bode well for the jewelry retailer moving forward 

Just ahead of their fourth quarter earnings  Tiffany   Co indicated sales fell 6  and comp sales fell 7  thanks to a weaker than expected holiday season  In an effort to reconcile its losses  the company announced its intention to cut jobs as it struggles to revitalize growth  The biggest obstacles have been slowing economic growth in China  currency headwinds and an overall weaker spending environment  Tiffany s traditional reluctance to discounting or promotions has helped its cause either  In a bid to expand its offering and stimulate growth  Tiffany has been investing heavily into designing and marketing gold and silver products that appeals to younger consumers  Fortunately  Tiffany holds a significant position in the global jewelry market which could weather a negative surprise this Friday

158896,380412,TIF,Q1 2016 Could Be Earnings Turning Point,opinion,"The above link to Factset s great discussion on S P 500 margins  dated March 18  2016  supports my thesis from March 12  2016  that Q1  16 will likely be the trough for year over year earnings declines for the S P 500 
Frankly  the two go hand in hand really  If margins improve   and as long as revenue remains stable  earnings should improve as well 
My thesis  or educated guess really   based on studying S P 500 earnings data for 15 years was based on two principles 
Commodities are bottoming  including crude 
The dollar will continue to gradually weaken over 2016  even with rate hikes 
Leaps of faith for sure  but commodity and dollar sentiment keep me leaning against the crowd  Of course  my position could very well be wrong too 
My own forecast for 2016 s S P 500 return of 10  or more could be wild eyed fiction  and get me kicked right in the teeth  but the job market s strength continues to be an unambiguous positive in my opinion 
Jeff Miller s latest post showed a chart of the declining labor market slack  Jeff does seminal work every weekend  I actually think a little inflation  whether commodity or wage induced would be good for the US economy  It will be interesting to see CPI data with this jump in crude to  40   that will eventually show up in gasoline prices I would imagine 
Even though crude oil and other commodity prices were getting shelled yesterday  it looks to me like the 5 year commodity bear market is coming to and end  Like all major bottoms  and tops  it is a process 
Another anecdotal data point  which I use because it is earnings related  is that a number of companies I follow  with February  16 quarter end  that have already reported quarterly earnings  showed either strong growth  i e  FedEx  NYSE FDX   Oracle  NYSE ORCL   or were not nearly as weak as expected  i e  Tiffany  NYSE TIF   What was impressive about FedEx was that they beat on revenue too  Very important  Nike  NYSE NKE  missed on revenue   Long FDX  ORCL  NKE 
All the commodity ETFs  such as those for crude oil  IYE  XLE   copper  JJC   Emerging Markets  EEM  VWO   and Brazil  EWZ  are hitting their overhead 200 day moving averages  They were at key levels yesterday

158897,380413,TIF,Why You Should Watch Tiffany   Co  Carefully,opinion,"Tiffany   Co   NYSE TIF  disrupted its string of quarterly losses with surprise positive earnings in 4Q2015  However  the management acknowledged the existence of difficulties and projected 1Q2016 earnings to fall 15  to 20  followed by another decline of 5  to 10  in 2Q2016  It is only in the back half of 2016 that the management of Tiffany anticipates improvement in financial performance 
This Tiffany analysis article discusses the company s strength and weaknesses to enable you make informed investment decision regarding the stock  But first is a brief recap of Tiffany s financial performance for the last quarter 
4Q2015 summary
Tiffany   Co   NYSE TIF  posted 4Q2015 EPS of  1 46  outpacing the consensus estimate of  1 40 but falling short of the year ago EPS by 3   Revenue of  1 2 billion for the latest quarter pulled back 6  from the corresponding quarter a year ago and topped the consensus estimate  Unfavorable foreign exchange movement was largely responsible for the topline hit 
2016 outlook 
Tiffany   Co   NYSE TIF  is hoping for 2016 revenue to increase in low single digit on constant currency basis or remain flat as the previous year on reported basis 
The chart below shows Tiffany s revenue for the last five quarters 

What s exciting about Tiffany 

Solid brand appeal

Tiffany   Co   NYSE TIF  products need no introduction among jewelry buyers  It takes years and massive investment to create a recognizable brand and Tiffany has done it and it can now reap the benefits  Tiffany is well positioned to leverage its strong brand appeal to beat the competition and fuel growth over the long term  The company has also recently focused on expanding distribution network  thus paving the way for more sales 

Geographic diversification

As Tiffany   Co   NYSE TIF  diversifies its product mix  the company has also been active in diversifying its geographic markets  In the recent years  the company has focused on expanding its business in Canada  Mexico  Brazil  Russia and the Middle East  The expansion into more international markets should further boost Tiffany s international revenue that currently account for nearly 50  of its total annual sales 
A diversified geographic footprint also helps the company to spread market risks 

Small store concept

Tiffany   Co   NYSE TIF  has figured out that it could drive sales by targeting customers with low cost jewelry products  The idea is that the company could use the lower price strategy to drive sales in emerging markets and further boost its international penetration  The strategy could also enable the company to offset the advantage that the competition may have enjoyed over it in low cost market  Additionally  the lower price points would also increase customer traffic and Tiffany can seize the opportunity to upsell those customers to its more expensive products that attract higher margins 
As a way to increase the sale of the small ticket products  Tiffany is in the process of opening 11 new small stores this year 

E commerce

Tiffany   Co   NYSE TIF  is also leveraging the power of the Internet to help fuel sales by providing customers a convenient way to shop online  In fiscal 2015  the company reported that e commerce accounted for 6  of its net worldwide sales 

Positive shareholder orientation

Tiffany   Co   NYSE TIF  returns value to shareholders through a combination of dividends and shares repurchase  The company has also consistently sweetened its quarterly dividend payout over the last 13 years with the last coming in May 2015 when it boosted dividend payout by 5   Early this year  the board of Tiffany authorized repurchase of  500 million worth of shares over the next three years 
Tiffany has demonstrated that it could continue to sweeten shareholder returns if its expansion efforts produce more free cash flow 

Forex tailwind

As much as unfavorable foreign exchange movements have produced pain and suffering for Tiffany in the recent years amid strengthening dollar  the tide could change  Foreign currencies such as the Japanese yen and the common market currency Euro have recently demonstrated strength against the greenback and that should produce favorable results for Tiffany  Stronger foreign currencies make Tiffany s products more affordable in the international markets and that should fuel demand and sales  Today  Tiffany generates more than 50  of its sales outside the U S 
What s worrying about Tiffany 

Macroeconomic risks

Because Tiffany   Co   NYSE TIF  sells discretionary products  demand for its products is closely tied to people s ability to spend on such items  But unfavorable macroeconomic conditions such as high unemployment rates  limited access to credit and increase in the cost of fuel and energy tend to douse customers  purchasing power and could produce weak demand for Tiffany s products 

Forex headwind

As Tiffany   Co   NYSE TIF  expands abroad and generates a significant amount of its revenue outside the U S   it also gets more exposed to foreign exchange headwind  When the U S  dollar is stronger  Tiffany s products become more expensive for international buyers and the company has to cut prices to boost demand but that ends up hurting margins  Additionally  a stronger dollar means that international sales are worth less than they should when converted to USD 

Foreign tourists

A substantial portion of Tiffany s domestic sales are generated by foreign tourists to the U S   but a stronger USD tends to limit the flow of foreign tourists to the U S  because of the higher travelling costs  As such  Tiffany could face a sales squeeze if weakness in foreign tourist inflow persists 

Tough times in Europe

The recent wave of terrorist attacks in Europe has complicated the business picture for Tiffany   Co   NYSE TIF  on the continent  Not only did the attacks people s travel plans  but also hurt businesses and led to loss of income for some  As a result  demand for discretionary products suffered as recently confirmed by several Europe luxury companies reporting in 1Q2016 

Pressure in Asia Pacific

Economic slowdown in China is expected to continue weighing negatively on Tiffany sjewelry business  Tiffany reported 8  decline in comparable sales in Greater China in 4Q2015 
Although Japan has traditionally been a bright spot for Tiffany  the strengthening of the Japanese yen in the recent months could limit sales to tourists flowing into the country 
Takeaway
There are several odds stacked against Tiffany   Co   NYSE TIF   but the company enjoys unique advantages that it can draw to drive growth and profitability in the coming quarters ",2016-05-19,InvestCorrectly,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-you-should-watch-tiffany---co.-(nyse:tif)-carefully-200130934,200130934

What are you expecting for  
Diamonds may be a girl s best friend but they haven t been one for investors  In the past few years demand for jewelry has substantially declined  led by a strong U S  dollar  weakness in China and changing spending habits  Consequently  jewelers like Tiffany have seen earnings fall for 4 consecutive quarters 
The stock hasn t been too far behind  down 25 6  over the same time frame  Unfortunately  investors should expect more of the same when Tiffany s reports first quarter earnings this Wednesday 
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings of 69 cents per share on  922 64 million in revenue 1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line but  2 million below on the top  Earnings per share estimates have dropped 13  in the past 3 months on negative sentiment towards quarterly earnings  Compared to a year earlier  this reflects a 14  decline in EPS with revenue projected to fall 4  

Throughout 2015  Tiffany s results were pressured by the strong U S  dollar  macroeconomic volatility and changes in consumer spending habits  Currency headwinds negatively impacts both non U S  sales and tourist spending in the United States  Early indications are these problems will persist throughout fiscal 2016  In its most recent analyst call  management guided minimal growth on a constant currency basis with earnings ranging from unchanged to a mid single digit decline 
On the other hand  there are a number of bright spots for Tiffany s  The company s efforts to bolster its omnichannel platform and open new stores should bode well  Meanwhile  on a constant currency basis  sales and comparable store sales increased across its international markets  Asia Pacific  Japan and Europe  Taking currency headwinds into account  this turns negative across the board  For now  a dwindling top and bottom line remains a primary concern for the company and its investors

158919,380435,TIF,Gold And Silver  Headline Events Don t Always Cause Big Price Moves,opinion,"The Familiar Story
It is unquestionably true that through the second  third  and fourth quarters of 1979  Bunker and William Herbert Hunt acquired a lot of silver  perhaps 100 million ounces of the physical stuff  During that fourth quarter  silver prices rose dramatically  and by January 1980 they stood at an unheard of  50 an ounce   As I write this review  more than 35 years later  silver is selling at between  14 and  15 an ounce  
Also by January 1980  as von Leib writes   the mere arrival of  the Hunts   Prudential  L PRU  broker on the  Comex  floor   would send the fuckin  metal limit bid   
Commercial users of silver  from Tiffany  N TIF  to Kodak  N KODK   were of course unhappy with the notion that a critical input of theirs was getting squeezed  Silver was either impossible to get or absurdly expensive for such manufacturers and retailers  Also unhappy of course  were the other traders whose positions the Hunts were squeezing 
On January 21 the Comex board declared the short squeeze an emergency  requiring unusual remedies  It raised margin requirements  with retroactive effect on all positions  and it voted to allow liquidaton only trading  That meant  long speculators couldn t buy any more  They could only sell 
The worm turned  The value of silver  and long positions on silver futures  fell sharply over the next couple of months  and the leveraged position of the Hunts made for a severe cash squeeze on the former squeezers 
In late March  the Hunts proved unable to meet a margin call  That set off a panic in the markets  the silver markets first  and then commodities markets quite generally  A consortium of U S  banks stepped in to help the Hunts pay their margin call and calm the atmosphere  Time called this  Wall Street s worst panic in nearly two decades  
Adding to the Story 
To this familiar story von Leib adds two points 
The stupidity venality of the Hunts wasn t the problem  or at any rate not the only problem  The situation became a crisis when and because  financial regulators and exchange officials   changed the  rules of the game  to impact the outcome   not just to protect a market s integrity   Exchange officials were on the front line  and the brunt of the charge falls on them  though the CFTC backed them up  The attitude of the exchange was that its honchos didn t like the prices they saw  so they d regulate them away 
Another point von Leib stresses here  traders  and so the market they constitute  learned and incorporated a lesson  Metals traders in particular learned to  tail  their cash and carry trades with a small extra long position as a hedge  They learned to set the size of that tail by the relevant metal s price at interest rates  adjusted to match with the remaining life of the arb play 
I ve focused here on the Hunt silver crisis because of its intrinsic drama and because it is fairly typical of von Leib s story telling  But  to be clear  there is much else of value in this book 
Headlines and Realities
One of von Leib s main themes  running through the many stories of a long career in the markets  is that the relationship between headline making events and market moves isn t simple  For example  consider gold  It is often seen  and marketed  as a  safe harbor  investment  When the political diplomatic world looks scariest  people  should  want gold more  and its price should  rise  That would be the case if the headline pricing relationship were a simple one  but it isn t 
For example  in October 1981 a squad of heavily armed Egyptian soldiers led by Lieutenant Khalid Islambouli assassinated that country s President  Anwar Sadat  This was  says von Leib with some understatement   arguably an important geo political event   It was certainly a headline event around the world and  should  have pushed the price of gold up  But it didn t  Or hardly so  gold rallied briefly  but soon headed sharply down 
Likewise with the silver price moves of 1979 80  There was a temptation then  and to some in retrospect there is a temptation even now  to attribute its volatility to the headline making Iranian hostage crisis of the day  But with the one drama the other had almost no connection 
The only valid generalization one can draw from such events is that a headline event works as a catalyst  when conditions are right for a big price move anyway  Or as von Leib puts it   when the market is off sides or in a vulnerable position  even the most innocuous piece of news can have a huge impact   otherwise   not so much ",2015-11-20,AllAboutAlpha,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-hunts’-silver-play,-and-other-stories-from-the-recent-past-271964",271964
158935,380451,TIF,Tiffany   Co  And The Global Economy,opinion,"After spending all of 2015 year to date in a dull trading range  shares of Tiffany   Co   NYSE TIF  were sparkling this week on the back of a better than expected earnings release 

So  with the market now trading sideways and investors getting skittish  might TIF stock be a diamond in the rough 
Let s take a look 
Tiffany   Co  s results look a lot less glittering and fabulous when you dig into the numbers  Total sales were actually down 5  in the quarter ended April 30  pulled lower by weak overseas sales  particularly in Japan  And earnings per share dropped 16   from  0 97 to  0 81 
So  if sales and earnings were both down  what explains investor enthusiasm for TIF stock this morning 
I have two words for you  expectations and comps 
We ll start with expectations  Tiffany   Co  set the bar very low going into this release  In March  TIF said that it expected revenues to be down by as much as 10   So being down  only  5  looks fantastic by comparison 
Tiffany   Co  actually had a respectable quarter in the Americas and Europe  where sales were up 1  and 2   respectively  over the same quarter last year  Excluding the effects of a strong dollar  European sales were actually up 21  and same store sales were up 17   For a continent that is still struggling to shake off the effects of its worst recession since the 1930s  that s nothing short of amazing 
It s in Japan that the numbers start to look ugly  Total sales were down 30   due in part to the collapsing value of the yen  But even excluding currency effects  Japanese sales were down 18   Same store sales were down 24  
This is where the comps come into play  The Japanese numbers look particularly bad because they are being compared to artificially high numbers from the previous year  Japanese consumers went on a spending binge in the first quarter of last year in anticipation of Shinzo Abe s sales tax hike  On April 1 of last year  the Japanese sales tax rate jumped from 5  to 8   so Japanese shoppers took a  now or never  approach to high end shopping  Spending fell off a cliff in the quarters that followed  so Tiffany   Co  s Japanese comps should look a lot better next quarter 
So  what are the takeaways here 
The good news is that European luxury shoppers are opening their wallets again and that the worst damage has already been done to Japanese sales  The bad news    for Tiffany   Co and for American luxury retailers in general    is that the strong dollar is a major headwind 
A little over half of Tiffany s reported sales come from overseas  but the number is actually a lot higher than that  Foreign tourists make up a high but hard to quantify percentage of domestic U S  sales  particularly in the flagship New York store of Breakfast at Tiffany s fame 
In a roaring market for luxury goods  the effects of a strong dollar could be overcome by even stronger foreign sales  But that s not our situation today  Japan is still limping along  and China s growth is slowing  It also doesn t help that conspicuous consumption is pass  in China after the government s crackdown on bribery and gift giving 
So  Tiffany   Co  and its peers will be operating in a very difficult environment for as long as the dollar remains strong 
What about TIF stock  Tiffany is an iconic brand and a wildly profitably company  But with shares fetching 25 times trailing earnings and 20 times next year s expected earnings  the stock is by no means a screaming bargain  On a good pullback  TIF stock is worth considering  But for now  it might be best to leave it in its pretty blue box

Tiffany s started as a luxury goods brand for the American aristocracy but over the past 175 years has expanded into one of the world s most recognizable luxury good brands  with 40  of its business conducted overseas and close to 300 stores worldwide  However  its multinational footprint may prove troublesome in the volatile global currency environment  Many investors speculate that the strong dollar will not only hurt global sales but also negatively affect the buying power of tourists who come to the U S  Tiffany s slowed growth in its top 2 geographical locations  Americas and Japan  has caused some serious concern  With nearly 9  of Tiffany s sales coming from its flagship store in Manhattan  and nearly 3  coming from its Tokyo Ginza store  it will be crucial to see if Tiffany s can maintain its same store sales 
In an effort to combat the slowing demand for high end luxury products  Tiffany s started increasing their presence in the affordable luxury segment  Their lower priced Atlas collection has gained increasing visibility  and nearly half of Tiffany s jewellery sales now come from products with prices under  1 000  However  this has caused great debate within the community  Some investors criticize Tiffany s for diluting their prestigious image by expanding and are concerned that affluent customers will leave as a result of the lack of exclusivity while others believe that Tiffany s little blue box will be able to maintain its iconic allure  Investor concerns are not without reason  Michael Kors Holdings Limited  NYSE KORS   for example  has more than doubled its retail space devoted to discounted products and is now considered overexposed  Their stock price has also fallen more than 60  to  40 a share compared to its peak of around  100 per share in February of 2014 

Tiffany s definitely has a difficult task ahead of itself but it appears that the large jeweller still has room to grow  While Japan is most likely a saturated market  the rest of Asia  namely China and India seem to have a growing appetite as more and more people begin to accept the concept of Western diamonds and jewellery  For now  investors are sitting on edge for Tiffany s results tomorrow which will give clues as to what s in store for the future of the company ",2015-08-27,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-we-no-longer-eating-breakfast-at-tiffany’s-263107,263107

As you look at Howard s spreadsheet  check the S P 500 dividend yield  The S P 500 dividend yield is STILL very close to the U S  10 Year Treasury yield  even after last night s close  the S P 500 rose 27 79 yesterday  to close at 2 081  
The Fed Model  which tracks the S P 500 Earnings Yield  see above  versus the 10 year Treasury still leaves stocks as a screaming buy versus the 10 year Treasury  given the 5 83  versus 2 10  spread  What the Fed Model is telling us  whether you believe it or not  is that interest rates could rise substantially  and not put too much of a dent in the S P 500 from a valuation perspective 
In 1997  when Greenspan first referenced the model in his speech  the 10 year Treasury was yielding about what the earnings yield is on the S P 500 today  5 7   5 8    And the S P 500 earnings yield was near 2   about where the 10 year Treasury is trading today   Hmmm  
Yesterday s S P 500 rally took the key benchmark back over the 50 day moving average  We get Oracle s  NYSE ORCL  earnings Tuesday night  Fed Ex  NYSE FDX  Wednesday morning  Lennar  NYSE LEN   Tiffany  NYSE TIF  and Nike  NYSE NKE  later in the week

158965,380481,TIF,Airline Industry Ascended To New Records In 2014,opinion,"Just as the U S  economy is in full recovery mode  so too is the airline industry  It s lately made an impressive about face from only a decade ago and  in 2014  soared to several new benchmarks  This industry is flying high again  In 2014  a record 98 million passengers flew to foreign destinations on U S  carriers  Meanwhile  662 million traveled domestically by air  the highest number since 2007  According to the U S  Department of Transportation  the percentage of seats filled in 2014 climbed to 83 4 percent another fresh record  This year  the daily number of available seats for international bound flights out of the U S  will rise to an all time high of over 350 000  That s 20 000 more seats per day than were available just last year  And the success stories just keep on coming  Air travel in March and April is typically strong  but this season is expected to be the strongest since before the recession  I often travel through Houston  and it s a good case study to illustrate the boom in air travel demand  domestic as well as international  In 2014  the city s two main airports  the 46 year old George Bush Intercontinental Airport it was renamed in 1997 and William P  Hobby Airport  both broke passenger traffic records that had been set in the previous year  Intercontinental saw an increase of 9 2 percent in international travelers and 3 6 percent in domestic fliers  while Hobby s total traffic for the year rose to 11 9 million passengers an all time high for the fifth straight year  All told  over 53 million people from around the globe passed through these two Houston airports  And yes  you guessed it that s another new record  
Waxing Wanderlust
Some of the key factors driving this unprecedented air travel demand are an expanding U S  economy  rising personal incomes and the highest consumer confidence level since before the recession  In a recent poll  the travel website TripAdvisor surveyed 44 000 people around the world on a number of travel related issues  Of the Americans who participated  67 percent reported that they were planning an international trip for leisure  up from 50 percent last year  TripAdvisor also wanted to find out where participants had been in the last 12 months  where they planned on going in the next 12 months and what their dream destination was  Although Australia topped the list of ideal vacation spots  followed closely by the U S   less than 5 percent said they had actually made the trip down under  On the other hand  about 20 percent of respondents  or close to 8 800 people  said they had visited the U S  in the last year  while the same percentage of people said they would likely travel to the U S  in the coming months  Air travel between the U S  and China is expected to increase now that multi entry visas for citizens of both countries have been extended from one year to 10 years  International flights out of China have already been trending steadily upwards for years  a result of a growing middle class  The visa policy revision should help ramp up Chinese outbound air travel even more  As I pointed out last month  Chinese travelers are the world s highest spenders while on vacation  The average Chinese visitor spends between  6 000 and  7 200 per trip to the U S  The visa revision is welcome news not only for airlines such as Air China  but also hotels  restaurants  car rental companies and others in the travel and leisure services industry  It should also be a tailwind to luxury retailers that are increasingly setting up shop in international airports 
The  Sixth Continent  and Luxury Shopping 
For the first time in 2013  more than one billion people traveled internationally  prompting luxury brand executives to name this cohort  the sixth continent   With there being such a huge surge in captive consumers  we are entering a golden age of luxury shopping opportunities in airports that might very well supplant tacky souvenir shops and cell phone accessory kiosks  In many airports around the globe you re now just as likely to pass by a Coach  NYSE COH  store or a Tiffany   Co  NYSE TIF  as you are a Cinnabon  According to retail consultancy firm Verdict Retail   are expected to grow 73 percent between 2013 and 2019  at which point the entire global market will be worth an astounding  59 billion  Leading the way are beauty products and alcohol  as shoppers seek to avoid value added taxes and duties  Paris based advertising firm JCDecaux  after conducting a  of people s airport spending habits in eight countries  found that the three most frequently purchased types of merchandise were fashion items  cosmetics   high end fragrances and general accessories  This is a clear sign that luxury shopping while travelers await their connecting flights is becoming more of the norm rather than the exception 
Focusing on Shareholders 
It s easy to forget that between 2005 and 2008  about 70 percent of the U S  airline industry was operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection  including leaders such as Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   The industry s recent recovery is in lockstep with many other once struggling industries that were forced to consolidate and restructure their businesses following the 2007 2008 financial crisis  How things have changed since then  As I pointed out here  airlines posted some of their best earnings ever last year  Many are now turning their attention toward making investors happy by paying dividends  boosting earnings per share and buying back their stock  According to SEC filings  10 U S  airlines including Delta and Alaska Air Group Inc  NYSE ALK     are collectively paying down massive amounts of debt  A recent Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  equity research report finds that  U S  airline stocks are trading at comparatively attractive valuations relative to the S P 500  The discount is 48 percent   It adds   Not only are the U S  airlines generating more growth  we expect their cash returns on cash invested  CROCI  to improve the most in 2015   compared to previous years  It will be challenging indeed for the industry to meet these expectations  Last year  after all  was  unusually strong   according to management consultancy firm Oliver Wyman  But airlines have so far charted a very promising course  Disclosure  Please consider carefully a fund s investment objectives  risks  charges and expenses  Past performance does not guarantee future results  Stock markets can be volatile and share prices can fluctuate in response to sector related and other risks as described in the fund prospectus  Foreign and emerging market investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and less public disclosure  as well as economic and political risk  By investing in a specific geographic region  a regional fund s returns and share price may be more volatile than those of a less concentrated portfolio  Gold  precious metals  and precious minerals funds may be susceptible to adverse economic  political or regulatory developments due to concentrating in a single theme  The prices of gold  precious metals  and precious minerals are subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredicted international monetary and political policies  We suggest investing no more than 5  to 10  of your portfolio in these sectors  The S P 500 Stock Index is a widely recognized capitalization weighted index of 500 common stock prices in U S  companies  There is no guarantee that the issuers of any securities will declare dividends in the future or that  if declared  will remain at current levels or increase over time  All opinions expressed and data provided are subject to change without notice  Some of these opinions may not be appropriate to every investor  By clicking the link s  above  you will be directed to a third party website s   U S  Global Investors does not endorse all information supplied by this these website s  and is not responsible for its their content ",2015-03-17,Frank Holmes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-airline-industry-ascended-to-new-records-in-2014-245195,245195
158966,380482,TIF,Will Tiffany s Beat ,opinion,"Tiffany   Co   NYSE TIF   is set to release it s FQ4 2014 results before tomorrow s opening bell  The Estimize consensus is calling for EPS of  1 55  a number that has fallen 4 cents just this month alone and is still above the Wall Street expectation of  1 50  Revenue estimates of  1 33B are just slightly ahead of the Street s consensus for  1 30B 

The luxury retailer already released results for the holiday season  and the numbers weren t pretty  Worldwide sales of  1 02B in November and December fell 1  from the same time in 2013  On a constant currency basis  sales did increase 3   but comparable store sales were flat  The geographic breakdown makes Tiffany s pressure points more apparent  Asia Pacific continued to be the strongest region  with revenues increasing 7   driven by China and Singapore  Even Europe saw a slight uptick in sales of 1   Weakness  however  was found in the U S   which saw a sales decline by 1   and of course Japan which was down 16  

Tiffany   Co  derives less than half of its of sales from the U S   meaning it heavily relies on the global economy for a majority of its revenues  Like so many of the other multinationals that have reported this season  Tiffany will again be hit this quarter by the stronger dollar  The issue was noted in third quarter results  with a softening seen in Asia  but that region in particular seems to be on track for a strong holiday quarter  The biggest concern for the luxury retailer continues to be the decline of luxury good sales in Japan due to the consumption tax increase that kicked in on April 1  2014 
The stock has plummeted since the beginning of the year  now down 80   On December 31  shares of TIF closed at  106 86 and now hover around the  86 mark ",2015-03-20,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/with-tiffany’s-stock-already-tarnished,-could-an-earnings-beat-restore-i-245683",245683
158967,380483,TIF,Strong Dollar Blamed For Tiffany Revenue Dip,opinion,"Tiffany   Co  NYSE TIF  shares dropped nearly 4  on Friday 
Shares closed at  82 93  or  3 44 lower than the previous day 
The stock is now down more than 22 3  this year  That puts it just above Tiffany s 52 week low of  82 75 
The sudden dip came on the heels of the company s fourth quarter earnings report  Tiffany reported that quarterly sales fell for the first time in five years 
It turns out that tourists refuse to visit the company s flagship store in Manhattan  which drives about 40  of Tiffany s sales 
Why are they steering clear 
Tiffany claims that tourists aren t coming to the Manhattan store because the U S  dollar is so strong right now 
Of course  the dollar has become a key theme in each earnings report since the middle of 2014 
The Dark Side to the Dollar s Strength
A stronger dollar transfers demand from the United States to other economies around the world 
Which means that U S  companies relying heavily on foreign customers could face significant headwinds in 2015 
The prices of American products become more expensive relative to local currencies as the dollar continues to gain strength 
This is exactly what happened to Tiffany 
Now  while Tiffany achieved solid growth in net sales and net earnings for the full year  the fourth quarter results were less impressive 
The company said Q4 revenue declined 1  to  1 3 billion  which is the lowest year over year revenue growth rate since 2012   when the company s revenue grew by 2  
Worse still  the company s revenue numbers are well below the Q3 estimates for this quarter  where analysts  consensus was  1 36 billion 
Net income for the quarter was  196 2 million  or  1 51 per diluted share 
But for TIF shareholders  the most concerning item to be gleaned from the company s financial reports is management s outlook for the rest of 2015 
Lower Guidance Doesn t Bode Well
The company expects the strong dollar to continue wreaking havoc on the company s finances  resulting in a low single digit percentage increase for the full year when reported in U S  dollars 
TIF now expects corporate profits to fall 30  in the current quarter  while stabilizing in the following quarters  resulting in  minimal growth  for the full year 
But the company s outlook seems too optimistic   even for Wall Street 
In anticipation of a prolonged strong dollar  Wall Street lowered the company s Q1 2015 estimates by 11 5   while also lowering the fiscal year 2016 results by 9  to  4 47 per share 
With Tiffany   Company shares sitting near 52 week lows and the stock showing oversold in the weekly charts  what s an investor to do 
That s easy 
When a stock is trading at 57 9x trailing earnings   or nearly three times the average price to earnings ratio of companies in the S P 500   investors should certainly stay away until the company s outlook improves

158969,380485,TIF,A Tale Of 2 Luxury Retailers,opinion,"Before tomorrow s opening bell we get Q1 results from two high end luxury retailers  Michael Kors  NYSE KORS  and Tiffany   Co   NYSE TIF   While the former is expected to post strong results  the same can not be said for the latter 
For the first quarter  the Estimize community expects Michael Kors to post earnings per share  EPS  of  0 93  2 cents better than the Wall Street expectation  Revenue estimates are roughly in line at  1 1B  This would mark year over year growth of 19  on the bottom line and 18  on the top line  the company has recorded nothing less than double digit growth on each of these measures since they IPO d in late 2011  Despite strong fundamentals  there seems to be a disconnect with how the stock has traded  down around 20  for the year on speculation that Kors might come undone like competitor Coach  Unlike Kors  Coach has reported very weak fundamentals for several quarters now  yet up until recently saw large upward movements in their stock price on hopes that the accessories retailer was turning things around  The fear surrounding Kors at the moment is that their items are becoming too accessible  The line sells at the very high end  but also at the mid tier level  Selling at those lower price points makes commonality a risk  which can remove the value and cache from the brand 

On the other end of the luxury spectrum is Tiffany  While the Estimize community is looking for EPS of  0 81  12 cents higher than the Street  that number has fallen dramatically in the last few weeks  and will likely fall further before tomorrow s report  Revenues of  971M are above the Street s estimate for  927M  This would mean a decrease in profits of about 16  and a fall of 4  on the top line  Management is looking for even steeper year over year declines of 30  and 10   respectively  on account of the stronger dollar  The stronger dollar hurts Tiffany in two ways  First off  the luxury retailer derives close to half of its sales from overseas  therefore repatriation of those sales to the US dollar reduces the top line  Management also worries that the rise in the dollar will impact US sales  Tiffany relies on wealthy travelers to shop in their upscale stores in this country  but fear that the stronger dollar may cause international tourists to be more conservative with their discretionary income ",2015-05-26,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-tale-of-two-luxury-retailers-252969,252969
158991,380507,TIF,Gold  A December To Remember ,opinion,"One wonders if we ll look back upon this December as an inflection point for Gold  To be saved by the Swiss   who pending their referendum  at this writing  are polled at only 38  pro Gold   else roiled by Oil on the heels of its worst down day since the Black Swan of 2008  And if  tis the latter    per some perceiving the global economy slipping into deflationary depression    our concern has long been  twould be a Gold negative  Which in turn  given the stock market s being a helping hedge against inflation may well tip it into a crumbling ledge rife of deflation   et voil   we d see the S P 500 correct some  50  for a third time in the past dozen years   and not surprisingly so with earnings  by our honest calculation  running about half what they ought be up here in the stock market stratosphere   Of course  Gold s mitigant to the delirium of deflation is as presented above in the Scoreboard  And some view the  difference  therein as conservative 
Either way  what if they gave a party but nobody came  In a best efforts attempt  we so tried to do a week ago in penning  Gold Measures Set to Regain the Mid 1200s   Nice try  but it didn t happen  Yet  perhaps by the time many of you read this  at least we ll know if the stalwart citizens of Switzerland have    contra to the polls    come to the aid of the party  else have thrown Gold headfirst down the skeletal ice chute of their reknowned Cresta Run  ingloriously exiting at 130kph onto the St  Moritz parking lot and disintegrating dead stop into a snowplow s steel blade    Tape at 11     The thrill of victory  else the agony of defeat 
And yet  we continued to do our modest part this past week in writing to no less than eight Swiss  family  members  encouraging their voting  JA   in tomorrow s  Sunday s  referendum requiring die Schweizerische Nationalbank to maintain a minimal 20  Gold asset base  forbidding the bank to sell Gold  and repatriating that which it has stored abroad   assuming such host countries    in thinking they re doing the Swiss a favour    have not already discarded the Gold as a  near useless mineral   
Indeed a week ago  we d a whole rash of technical measures poised to pop positive for Gold    and we still do    however the party  at least momentarily  has been put on hold  short of being thrown out in the cold  Again  blame it in part on the deflating price of Oil  It certainly has come off the boil with the United States ramping up our own production such as to lower StateSide importation of OPEC Oil to levels not seen in 30 years  Yet a glance at the daily Gold Oil ratio from 2001 through yesterday  Friday  does suggest these two massively influential markets as not being that excessively priced vis   vis one another   

   and therefore we re not exactly diving into the deflation dumpster as may be other analysts  especially per Gold s gross  mis pricing  via our scoreboard at the top  Moreover  despite public perception that Gold s best days are behind it  here s a fast quizzical fact you can pull on your friends  which market has corrected the most from its all time high  Gold   41   or Oil   54   
 But  mmb  Silver has been down as much as 70  from its all time high    
Squire  you did have to bring that up  non  But he s right folks  Gold  whilst grossly undervalued by Dollar debasement alone  pales in comparison to Sister Silver s being senselessly slogged through the stenchiest of sewers  the average Gold Silver ratio from 2010 to date is 56x  today  tis 76x 
Indeed  unless you re the Bond  the S P  or to an extent even Gold  you ve had a dourly deflative year  Here are our BEGOS Markets Standings from January to date with December in the balance  Note how Oil was ranked in 5th place just at the end of Q3  but has since plummeted to last place at  33  

In fact  let s next zoom in on the last 21 trading days  one month   Below are the daily bars of Gold  Silver and Oil from a month ago to date  If you think Gold had a  bad hair day  yesterday   something to which Sister Silver has  for herself  become quite accustomed   look at Oil  And if you re a short term trader   dare I say with reasonably large attachments   this could well be your December to Remember 

Now we proceed to the latest view of Gold s weekly bars and the ever annoying Short parabolic trend  price still having to yet crack above the declining red dots  As we re wont to say  nothing  save for the only up stock market  moves in a straight line  and let s face it  Gold had just put in three firm up weeks  all with strong closes into their respective Fridays  So this pullback here appears perfectly normal  whether  tis being accorded to  1  hesitancy ahead of a Swiss renaissance that Gold is money  or 2  Oil s pointing to a deflationary depression  or 3  simply just a little good old ebb within the flow of price  Or all three  Problematic of course is that we Gold Bulls are getting quite fed up with red ebb 

So from the current price of 1167 back up through 1204 is all Gold needs to travel toward flipping the parabolic trend back to Long  but to quote Herv  Villechaize   So close     and yet  so far     The Man With The Golden Gun   Eon Productions   74  
Yesterday s pullback notwithstanding  another technical measure which had all but turned positive by week s end is Gold s Price Oscillator study  Here in this graphic of daily bars since better than a year ago  green represents when the Price Oscillator is positively disposed and red when negatively disposed  And were it not for Friday s decline  the bars were set to go green at the ensuing week s open  rather than having now been shoved down the garbage disposal 

Still  as earlier displayed in the BEGOS Markets Standings  Gold year to date is off but  3 1   To be sure  price presently being some  39  below its All Time High  1923  is a bit of bother given the proliferation of debased currencies and dissemination of dangerous derivatives  But as  tis month s end and we next turn to the percentage tracks of Gold versus its precious metals brethren  the metal itself clearly has just the least of the negative tilts   Course  the brethren    HUI Gold Bugs Index  XAU Philly Exchange Precious Metals Index  GDX miners exchange traded fund and RGLD Royal Gold    do out  accelerate Gold in both directions 

This next graphic is a two panel display of the 10 day Market Profiles for both Gold  left  and Silver  right   their settling prices being the white bars at 1167 0 and 15 365 respectively  Obviously there is overhead drilling to be done to reclaim that which both these markets had prior to Friday  but given these are precious metals markets  they can rise just as swiftly  if not more so  than they ve fallen  So in seeking upside goals  Gold s broadest profile bar is 1198 0   which is just six points below the parabolic flip price of 1204   and for Silver  tis 16 250 

Now obviously  indeed logically being pro Gold  let not our spirits be deflated over deflation  for should it become material   twill in turn inflate us to becoming elated over inflation  assuming one holds Gold  or better yet  adds to one s pile  Let s take a quick global glimpse 
1  Germany s Consumer Spending may have just barely swerved Deutschland away from Q3 recessionary concerns  however next door in France  words of warning have been sent down from the European Community Bank that Le Coq and like nations need implement further unpopular economic reforms and austerity programs  which when they all go wrong shall surely keep the  uro tumblers a printin  
2  Japan s inflation rate just hit a yearly low as did its  en follow in tow against the Bucko  Seems that the Bank of Japan toward getting up to its 2  inflation target  with The Land of the Rising Sun sinking into recession  shall surely keep the  en tumblers a printin  
3  Stateside  our economy may be on its best six month stretch in a decade  but  tis reported that we consumers who materially drive The Land of the Free are simply not that participative given the slow pace of earnings growth  As one New York based economist put it this past week   A lot of the data suggest we re not still in the wake of the Great Recession and financial crisis  but consumers have not forgotten those times     People are quite terrified of what happened in 2008 and 2009   Who can blame them  A would be repeat inevitably shall send the Dollar tumblers a printin  
Finally  if you think Gold  the EuroCurrencies  Copper  Silver and Crude Oil are having a hard go of it  then pity even more poor Tiffany   Co  having missed forecasts for their Q3 earnings  To where might this lead  From luxury to austerity  Given France s citizenry already having to deal with the latter  will we see them mobbing the front door of the company s store on Paris  Rue de la Paix  begging for bargain priced baubles  If only we could bring back Audrey Hepburn ",2014-11-30,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold:-a-december-to-remember-234117,234117

159007,380523,TIF,As GDP Falters  3 Retail Stocks To Power Your Portfolio,opinion,"GDP Falters  3 Retail Stocks to Power Your Portfolio
Who doesn t like a positive return from ones portfolio  particularly when the economy does not show favorable signs or the market mood is indecisive  Investors exercise extra caution while choosing their portfolio but surety of return is not guaranteed every time 
Here  we will discuss 3 retail stocks that can enrich your portfolio in an economy which is still undergoing recovery  The third and final data for real gross domestic product  GDP  revealed a 2 9  decline in the first quarter of 2014  thus taking away some sheen from the economy  which had barely started to look stronger 
Market watchers believe that the contraction stemmed from an inclement weather condition that locked consumers indoors  hampered production and construction activities  and led to soft home and auto sales  Consumer spending  which accounts for over two third of the U S  economic activity  also grew a moderate 1  in the quarter  down from the 3 1  jump anticipated 
However  economists believe that the softness in the first quarter was only temporary  They are hopeful that a much favorable weather condition now  an improving labor market  recovery in the housing market and surging demand  will translate into strength in the U S  economy as the year progresses 
Scaling down of the bond buying campaign for the fifth time to  35 billion  rising consumer confidence  85 2 in June 2014 from 82 2 in May 2014  and unemployment rate standing at its 5 year low of 6 3   hint at a rebounding economic activities  Thus we turn our attention to the Retail Wholesale sector which remains a lucrative investment opportunity 
3 Prominent Picks 
We suggest investing in Tiffany   Co   NYSE TIF    the renowned jewelry maker  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock has amassed a year to date return of roughly 9 4   and is expected to witness earnings growth of 14 7  in fiscal 2014 and 13 4  in fiscal 2015 
Though the stock looks a bit pricey with a forward P E  price to earnings  multiple of 23 49x  it should not disappoint investors given the company s long term expected earnings growth of 13 6   This New York based company had registered an average positive earnings surprise of 15 2  over the trailing four quarters 
Restoration Hardware Holdings  Inc   NYSE RH   a home furnishings retailer  is another stock to bet on  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock has amassed a year to date return of 37 2  and has a long term earnings growth rate of 28 6   Shares of this Corte Madera  CA based company trades at a forward P E of 38 81x  which is expensive but attractive from an earnings growth perspective  The company had registered an average positive earnings surprise of 37 0  over the trailing four quarters

159008,380524,TIF,Is This Luxury Retailer Affordable ,opinion,"The top one percent are spending and don t really care about the other 99   For the retail sector and particularly the luxury brand stocks  this is welcome news 
High end jeweler Tiffany   Co   NYSE TIF  pleased investors and Wall Street on Wednesday after reporting better than expected results and increasing its fiscal 2015 earnings estimate for the second time  Consumers in the Americas  Asia  and Europe are spending in the retail sector 
While Tiffany is now near the top of its 52 week range and near a fair valuation  there are a couple of other luxury brand stocks that may be worth a look 
In the luxury apparel and accessories area  Coach Inc   NYSE COH   a former darling of Wall Street  is struggling just above its 52 week low  While there could be a speculative contrarian buying opportunity with Coach  the anemic revenue outlook would make me think twice  Fiscal 2015 revenues are estimated to contract 11 4  and rebound a mere 3 3  in fiscal 2016  These are not good metrics  unless you want a speculative trade  I would be looking elsewhere in the retail sector 
For a much better luxury apparel buying opportunity in the retail sector  you could take a look at a stock like Michael Kors Holdings Limited  NYSE KORS   which is my favorite in this area  The stock is currently struggling and down 18  from its 52 week high of  101 04 on February 25  2014  which suggests it could be a good buying opportunity
Concerns of slower great rates have been hurting the stock  but the reality is that the growth continues to be excellent  especially for a company with a market cap of more than  16 0 billion 
Michael Kors has underperformed the S P 500 with a gain of 15 6  over the past 52 weeks  compared to a 22 7  advance in the broad market index 

While the growth is slowing  the company continues to deliver better results than Wall Street estimates  The seller of high end handbags  clothing  and accessories in the luxury retail sector has beaten the consensus estimate in four straight quarters 
In the fiscal first quarter earnings season  Michael Kors delivered a 43 4  year over year jump in sales to  919 2 million and beat the earnings estimate after reporting earnings of  0 91 per diluted share   0 10 above the Thomson Financial consensus estimate 
The issue is that the revenues in the recent fiscal first quarter declined from more than  1 0 billion in the previous fiscal third quarter  however  they have still grown over the previous quarter 
Michael Kors reported fiscal first quarter revenues surging 30  in the North American retail sector  including an 18 7  jump in comparable store sales  In the European retail sector  the company s products are sizzling hot with revenue growth of 128  and comparable store sales growth at a staggering 54 2  
For fiscal 2015  Thomson Financial estimates predict revenue growth of 31 0  for FY15 and 21 4  for FY16 a slower growth rate  but still pretty impressive 
I would not bet against Michael Kors in the luxury retail sector

159009,380525,TIF,Is Gold Knocking On Intrinsic Value s Door ,opinion,"From 2008 through 2011  Gold was a hotly debated subject within financial circles as we acclimated to the idea that the Fed could double and triple its balance sheet and somehow not debase the dollar  On the one hand there were gold bugs who said that gold was the only true form of money based on the precedent of thousands of years of economic history   On the other side there was the intelligentsia  which argued that gold was a  barbaric relic  utilized by uncivilized people and that its value was purely psychological 
At first  gold bugs had the advantage in the debate    between 2008 and 2011 gold s price rose by 150   But since then  the price has fallen by 35  from its peak   Indeed  as gold prices collapsed and stocks soared  the gold debate has seemingly faded from the discourse 
Derivative And Psychological
I ve often thought that both sides of the gold argument had the gold market mis analyzed   The intelligentsia s argument was flawed because  at the most basic level  the value of all goods and services  e g  a soda  cars or a massage  are just as psychological as the value of gold   The value of companies    which generate profits by producing goods and services    are just a derivative of that psychological   hedonic   value 
On the other hand  the gold bugs were wrong because gold doesn t have significantly greater monetary characteristics than anything else that has tradeable value   Think about it  You can probably get people to do things for you if you promise to give them an iPhone  too 
Fashionably Set
Gold is a product like any other and its underlying value is tied to its hedonic value just like everything else   The hedonic value of gold  which sets the intrinsic value of the metal based on its value as jewelry   Certain consumers will pay money to adorn themselves in gold because they think it looks pretty   The price at which they are willing to do that sets the price for the rest of the gold market 
With that view of the gold market  Tiffany   Co   NYSE TIF  said something about gold on its earnings call last week that made me take notice   The company noted that sales of gold jewelry were strong 

 we re pleased that fashion jewelry unit sales are benefiting from strength in gold jewelry  

If  A  Then  B 
If jewelry demand is picking back up  it could be a sign that the price of gold has gotten closer to its intrinsic value 
In 2011  prices soared such that gold jewelry sales slowed meaningfully   Now  though  gold may be starting to look more affordable again  especially when the buyer looks at a savings account that has been increasing with the stock market 
Because stocks have risen and gold prices have fallen  the price of gold relative to stocks has fallen back to 2008 levels   And that can be taken as a rough proxy of what the cost of gold looks like relative to a person s discretionary savings   Gold is a luxury purchase  typically made when someone feels flush with cash   As the stock market has risen  more people are feeling more financially secure  And since the price of gold hasn t risen at the same pace  gold may look cheap on a relative basis ",2014-09-03,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-gold-knocking-on-intrinsic-value's-door-224668,224668
