21148,242663,STC,Is Stewart Information  STC  A Good Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Stewart Information Services Corporation   NYSE STC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Stewart Information has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 04  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 54  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Stewart Information s current PE level puts it much below its midpoint of 20 03 over the past five years The stock s PE however compares unfavorably with the Finance Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 59  This indicates that the stock is overvalued right now  compared to its peers Meanwhile Stewart Information has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 14 95  which is much lower than the current level  So  so it is fair to say that a more value oriented path is ahead of the stock in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Stewart Information has a P S ratio of 0 54  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 38x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is much below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Stewart Information currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Stewart Information a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Stewart Information might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of A  This gives STC a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  While the current year estimate has seen one upward and no downward movements  the next year estimate has seen no upward and one downward movement over the past two months This has had a mixed effect on the consensus estimate  While the current year consensus has shot up 9 2  over the past two months  the next year estimate has plunged16   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Stewart Information Services Corporation Price and Consensus   Such mixed analyst sentiments is the reason the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and it is the reason why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineStewart Information is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Besides a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 42  of more than 250 industries   with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about the stock Also  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for Zacks rank  industry rank  past industry performance and analyst sentiments to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Free  Zacks  Single Best Stock Set to

21160,242675,STC,Sangoma Drops  But Investors Should Proceed With Caution,opinion,As the market advances  it becomes more difficult to find value  Individual stocks are rising  offering investors opportunities to cash out  One stock bucking this trend is Sangoma  STC   a profitable net net which has lost one third of its value since November  Trading for  9 million  Sangoma has current assets of  13 million  including  4 5 million in cash  versus liabilities of under  2 million  At the same time  the company has earned about  600 thousand in the last 12 months  There is no shortage of information about what Sangoma is up to  Management  touting the company s latest products  awards and business  wins   It is very clear from the company s filings that the intent is to grow by adding more products to the company s portfolio  expenses have been ramped up to meet this goal  This can be a good thing  If some of the company s new products take off  the company could see sales rise without a commensurate increase in costs  as the company is already incurring increased costs associated with the new products   But at the same time  there is a risk of failure here that is more than meets the eye  You see  the company has been capitalizing  rather than expensing  a great deal of its development costs  Over the last year  these capitalized development costs have risen some  300 thousand  equal to about half of the company s reported profit over the same time period  This capitalized account now stands at some  2 3 million  which could be a write down waiting to happen  Unfortunately  write downs are nothing new to this company  Over the last two years  the company has recorded about  5 5 million in one time expenses  including accelerated amortization of patents  impairment of Goodwill  and legal fees  Of course  none of these intangibles exist as current assets  As a buyer of a net net  you may not care about such sunk costs and intangibles  But recall that as an investor you don t get to decide what happens to the cash that  is  on the balance sheet  If the past is any guide  this cash may yet be converted into another risky intangible  rather than be returned to you   Sangoma is cheap  At the same time  it remains risky because intent and past actions forebode losses in the future  As such  this one could go either way  Good luck Disclosure  No position,2013-01-19,Saj Karsan,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/sangoma-drops,-but-investors-should-proceed-with-caution-151508",151508
21161,242676,STC,Insurance Stock Q3 Earnings On Oct 20  TRV  STC  BRO  FAF,opinion,With the onset of the Q3 earnings season we have seen 6 8  of the S P 500 Index reporting financial results so far  Earnings of these 34 index members  accounting for 8 9  of the index s total market capitalization  have inched up 1 3  on 2 9  higher revenues as per the latest Zacks  report  While 79 4  of these companies delivered positive earnings surprises  64 7  managed to beat revenue estimates The Finance sector has started the Q3 earnings season on a strong note  In fact  the financial performance of the companies from this sector that have already reported their results  5 6   reflect 1 3  earnings growth and a 2 9  increase in revenues  Moreover  the beat ratios  100 0  for both earnings and revenues  compare favorably with the S P 500 The Finance sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  is highly diversified and includes several industries like insurance  banks  financial transaction services  to name a few  Of these  the insurance industry is poised to display an impressive performance owing to the absence of any significant catastrophe losses in Q3  Hence  we expect insurers to witness better underwriting results alongside considerable improvement in underwriting income and combined ratio Despite headwinds like the growing uncertainty regarding the Fed rate hike and persistently low interest rates  the insurance companies are cushioned by their broader invested asset base  Another positive is their well diversified product and service portfolios  which should drive premiums higher  Favorable pricing is another tailwind With as many as 244 companies due to report their quarterly results this week  including 80 S P 500 members  we expect a clearer insight into the performance of the sector  Meanwhile  let s take a look at how these four insurers might fare when they report their quarterly numbers on Oct 20 The Travelers Companies  Inc    NYSE TRV   is
