13172,234687,CSGP,A Misunderstood And Overvalued Growth Stock,opinion,"Despite being in business for nearly thirty years  and having a core product dependent on manual human labor  this company is priced like a high flying Silicon Valley start up with disruptive new technology  With organic growth slowing and an acquisition strategy picking up the slack  we think expectations for future profit growth embedded in the stock price have moved beyond what the company can reasonably be expected to achieve  We see an unbalanced risk reward scenario that does not favor investors  CoStar Group  CSGP   271 share  is this week s Danger Zone pick 
Acquisitions Drive Growth and Margin Volatility
CoStar Group Inc   NASDAQ CSGP  has grown revenue by 18  compounded annually over the past ten years  Most of this growth  86  in dollar terms  has come over the past five years and has been heavily influenced by the acquisition of four real estate listing websites totaling  1 7 billion in deal value  90  of the  1 7 billion went to goodwill and other intangible assets  After tax profits  NOPAT  have grown 26  compounded annually over the past decade due to an increase in NOPAT margins from 6  in 2006 to 12  in 2016 
NOPAT margin has recovered from 2015 s deep decline  which was driven by high marketing costs to promote newly acquired brands  CSGP now generates a similar NOPAT margin  12   on  864 million of TTM revenue as it did on  212 million of revenue in 2008  11    This lack of meaningful operating leverage should give investors pause when considering the potential for future margin or return on invested capital  ROIC  improvement  Per Figure 1 below  CSGP has failed to earn the cost of capital for over five years 
Figure 1  ROIC Is Below WACC

Free Cash Flow Consumed by Acquisitions
Over the past five years  CSGP has burned through  1 2 billion of cumulative free cash flow  FCF   largely due to the acquisition strategy of rolling up commercial real estate and apartment listing websites  More recently  the pace and size of acquisitions has slowed  and FCF has increased to  126 million over the trailing twelve months  Despite this increase  the stock s 1  FCF Yield remains below the S P 500  2   and its data information provider peer group  3   
ROIC Depressed by Inefficient Balance Sheet
CSGP s current 6  ROIC  TTM  is in fourth quintile of our coverage universe and is well below the data information provider peer group  median 12  ROIC  and the S P 500  18  ROIC   At first glance  CSGP s low returns seem counterintuitive given a NOPAT margin  12   in the top half of S P 500 companies and NOPAT growth of 26  compounded annually over the past decade 
However  while margins look reasonable  the balance sheet does not  Invested capital has increased by 30  compounded annually over the past decade  from just  124 million in 2006 to  1 7 billion today  The exploding balance sheet makes margin improvement well beyond current levels imperative to value creation  If balance sheet efficiency  e g  invested capital turns  revenue invested capital   declines  then margins have to rise enough to offset that decline  otherwise  ROIC declines even if margins rise 
Per Figure 2  CSGP generated a 17  ROIC in 2008 with a NOPAT margin of 11  on 1 5 invested capital turns  However  CSGP s current NOPAT margin of 12  only translates into a 6  ROIC given the decline in invested capital turns to 0 5  Figure 3 displays the significant disconnect between margins and capital turns since the company began the acquisition campaign in 2012 
Figure 2  Decline in Invested Capital Turns Is More Than Rise in NOPAT

ROIC Valuation Regression
Per Figure 4  ROIC explains nearly 80  of the valuation difference among the selected data and information provider peer group  Despite CSGP s relatively low ROIC  6  vs  12  median for the peer group   the stock trades at a significant premium as shown by CSGP s position above the trend line in Figure 3  If CSGP stock were at parity with the group  it would trade at  130 share   52  below the current price

Executive Comp Aligned with the Wrong Metrics
We know from Figure 3 above  and numerous case studies  that changes in ROIC are directly correlated to changes in market value  Accordingly  we favor executive compensation plans that use ROIC to measure performance to ensure executives  interests are aligned with shareholders  interests  Revenue and non GAAP performance targets can be an incentive to sacrifice profitability for volume  or worse  engage in acquisitions that destroy shareholder value 
CSGP executive compensation plans are tied to exceeding their own internal expectations for metrics they define  such as adjusted EBITDA  cash incentives   non GAAP net income  restricted stock grants  and three year revenue growth  adjusted for stock price performance  restricted stock grants  
When the focus shifts from organic growth to acquisitions and non GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA  it is time for investors to call out management s self serving incentive structure  CSGP s executive compensation plans incentivizes management to invest capital in sub optimal ROIC endeavors in order to achieve revenue or non GAAP earnings targets  Per Figure 5  the implications are clear  CSGP has generated  272 million of negative economic earnings over the past five years  while GAAP earnings have risen considerably

Competitive Pressures Likely to Build  Putting Margin Expansion at Risk
First mover advantage is imperiled by failing to identify and counter new competition  While much attention has been paid to the explosion of financial technology startups  the rise of real estate technology startups has been less noted  Investors allocated over  1 billion to such firms over the past few years and almost half of the top 100 real estate technology companies are less than five years old  This increasing number of real estate technology startups seems likely to challenge CSGP s market share or at least its margins 
Given that significant margin expansion is required for CSGP to drive ROIC improvement  we view the company s balance sheet dynamics as a meaningful competitive disadvantage  The bloated balance sheet  and resulting low ratio of invested capital turns  will make it more difficult to counter competitive pressures by competing on price or ramping up investment in new product development 
Figure 6  Balance Sheet Inefficiency Represents Competitive Disadvantage

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
While CSGP is currently generating the highest NOPAT margin  12   of the past decade  it came one year after posting the lowest   2   due to cost containment issues tied to the build out of new initiatives  particularly advertising and promotion costs  Questionable spending continued into 2016  perhaps best characterized by a  5 million Super Bowl ad  featuring rapper Lil Wayne  no less  for a very niche product vs  one with a wide audience  We remain cautious on the level of spending required to maintain revenue momentum  and think market expectations are overly optimistic on potential margin improvement 
Bull Case  Based on Hope
The Bull Case for CSGP is based on a continuation of solid organic revenue growth in the core commercial real estate  CRE  data business with accelerating revenue growth in the apartment listings business  We are cautious on growth prospects for the core business due to market saturation and are not sold of the long term prospects of apartment listing websites  a business with naturally low barriers to entry 
The market for CRE data is much smaller than the residential side of the market  We believe CSGP has limited upside with the largest CRE firms  C B  Richard Ellis  Jones Lang LaSalle  etc   while pricing the product above where many smaller  regional CRE brokerage firms find it an attractive value 
The bull case is also predicated on margin expansion due to management s focus on generating 40   incremental adjusted EBITDA margins  on new revenue growth  We believe investors should view this flawed metric skeptically and remain focused on NOPAT margins 
In order to generate ROIC above the weighted average cost of capital  WACC   CSGP must now generate a higher NOPAT margin than it ever has historically  This challenge requires significant additional revenue without growing expenses or investing significant additional capital  Even if CSGP were to operate at the average NOPAT margin of the five highest performing companies in Figure 4  a 25  NOPAT margin  over 2x CSGP s current level   the resulting 13  ROIC would remain well be below the average 24  ROIC generated by the same five companies 
Bear Case  Classic Poor Risk Reward Trade Off
The Bear Case for CSGP is based on the combination of extremely high market expectations for future cash flows and the misleading nature of the firm s GAAP and non GAAP earnings when compared to economic earnings 
In addition  the expectation of increased competition for CSGP s core CRE data products from new market entrants  slowing growth in the core business due to market saturation and the questionable long term outcome of investing heavily in apartment listing websites add to the bear case  We believe that all of these concerns have merit  but do not believe any necessarily have to go badly against the company for the stock to underperform 
As such  CSGP represents a classic poor risk reward trade off  We prefer to buy stocks with low expectations  and sell stocks with high expectations  The expectations for revenue growth and margin expansion reflected in expectations for CSGP represent a very high bar for organic growth and management execution  and ignore the various risks and economic profit realities of the company s acquisition activities to date 
Is CSGP Worth Acquiring 
The proprietary value of the core product  CoStar Suite  49  of revenue  is debatable while the digital apartment listing business is crowded and competitive with low barriers to entry  While CSGP does operate an array of well trafficked real estate websites  the real engine behind the core database product  CoStar Suite  is the large department of  1 600 researchers and contractors engaged in labor intensive data collection and manual entry  cold calling  public records searches  field visits  etc   
While CSGP is the dominant player in CRE data and apartment listings  we do not believe CSGP has the kind of proprietary  tech  value that occasionally results in companies selling at nonsensical multiples to much larger acquirers  Could an S P Global  SPGI  consider beefing up their commercial real estate data offerings via acquiring CSGP  Yes  Could SPGI make economic sense of acquiring CSGP in anything other than a take under  The math makes it very unlikely  given that a deal for CSGP at the current price would be very dilutive to SPGI s ROIC from both a NOPAT margin and balance sheet perspective 
Walking Through the Acquisition Value Math
To begin  CoStar Group has liabilities of which investors may not be aware that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers suggest 

 152 million in off balance sheet operating leases  2  of market cap 
 44 million in outstanding employee stock options   1  of market cap 
 11 million in deferred tax liabilities   1  of market cap 

After adjusting for these liabilities we can model multiple purchase price scenarios  Even in the most optimistic of scenarios  CSGP is not worth the current share price 
Figures 7 and 8 show what we think S P Global  SPGI  should pay for CSGP to ensure it does not destroy shareholder value  S P Global could immediately integrate CoStar s data to bolster its real estate data offerings and bring increased scale to the business  However  there are limits on how much SPGI would pay for CSGP to earn a proper return  given the NOPAT or free cash flows being acquired 
Each implied price is based on a  goal ROIC  assuming different levels of revenue growth  In each scenario  the estimated revenue growth rate in year one and two equals 14   which is the consensus estimate of revenue growth in the next two years  For the subsequent years  we use 14  in scenario one because it represents a continuation of next year s expectations  We use 18  in scenario two because it assumes a merger with SPGI could create revenue growth through increased sales   marketing efforts and a larger customer base 
We conservatively assume that S P Global can grow CoStar s revenue and NOPAT without spending anything on working capital or fixed assets beyond the original purchase price  We also assume CoStar immediately achieves a 20  NOPAT margin  which is the average of SPGI and CSGP s current NOPAT margin  For reference  CoStar s current NOPAT margin is 12   so this assumption implies immediate improvement and allows the creation of a truly best case scenario 
Figure 7  Implied Acquisition Prices For SPGI To Achieve 7  ROIC 

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
Figure 7 shows the  goal ROIC  for SPGI as its weighted average cost of capital  WACC  or 7   Even if CoStar can grow revenue by 16  compounded annually with a 20  NOPAT margin for the next five years  the firm is worth less than its current price of  273 share  It s worth noting that any deal that only achieves a 7  ROIC would be only value neutral and not accretive  as the return on the deal would equal SPGI s WACC 
Figure 8  Implied Acquisition Prices For SPGI To Achieve 25  ROIC

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  
Figure 8 shows the next  goal ROIC  of 25   which is SPGI s current ROIC  Acquisitions completed at these prices would be truly accretive to SPGI shareholders  Even in the best case growth scenario  the most SPGI should pay for CSGP is  45 share  84  downside   Even assuming this best case scenario  SPGI would destroy over  7 billion by purchasing SPGI at its current valuation  Any scenario assuming less than 16  CAGR in revenue would result in further capital destruction for SPGI 
Very High Expectations Embedded in Valuation
Despite consensus expectations for 2017 2018 revenue and EPS being lower now than one year ago  the stock has outperformed the S P 500  rising 45  YTD and 23  over the last year  At the current price  we believe CSGP s valuation embeds a dangerous level of market expectations due to the chasm between historical financial performance and the expected performance implied by its market value 
To justify its current price of  271 share  CSGP must maintain current NOPAT margins of 12  and grow NOPAT by 13  compounded annually for the next 23 years  In this scenario  CSGP would be generating over  15 billion in annual revenue  over 2 5x S P Global s  SPGI  current revenue  The market for CSGP s current products is simply not large enough for such a scenario to be plausible 
Even if we assume CSGP can more than double its NOPAT margin to 25   the average of the top 5 performing companies in Figure 4  and grow NOPAT by 17  annually for the next decade  the stock is still worth only  167 today   a 38  downside risk  This scenario assumes CSGP grows revenues to over  2 billion in ten years from  864 million  TTM   or  10  compounded annually 
Each of these scenarios assumes CSGP is able to grow revenue  NOPAT and free cash flow without increasing working capital or investing in fixed assets  This assumption is unlikely  particularly in light of Figure 3  but allows us to create very optimistic scenarios that demonstrate how high expectations in the current valuation are 
CSGP Offers No Yield to Shareholders
CSGP does not currently pay a cash dividend nor have a buyback program in place  As such  the stock offers none of the downside protection that a solid shareholder yield can provide  Given the level of risk we see in the valuation and forward expectations  this downside protection could be sorely missed 
Insider Trading and Short Interest Trends
Insiders own 3 7  of outstanding shares  including a 0 5  interest held by CEO Florance  Ownership has been diluted by acquisition issuance over time while insiders have been steady net sellers for well over a decade  Insiders owned 1 8 million shares or 10 3  in 2004 compared to 1 2 million today  We could not find a single open market purchase by an insider over the same period  Short interest is not high at 3  of outstanding shares or 5 6 days to cover  The level of short interest has bounced around from 2  to 6  over the past few years

13173,234688,CSGP,Infosys MD   CEO Vishal Sikka Steps Down  Shares Tumble,opinion,In a sudden move  Vishal Sikka stepped down as the chief executive officer and managing director of Infosys Limited   NYSE INFY   earlier today  citing conflicts that deteriorated into mudslinging under an anonymous name  The move led to deep unrest among investors  causing shares to plunge 10 8  at one point in pre market trading The surprise move came amid intensifying animosity between the board and the co founders  led by NR Narayana Murthy  It seems that a seven month long confrontation between the company s founders on one hand  and Sikka and the board on the other  culminated into this drastic move  This is the second time that Infosys has plunged into a leadership crisis  after the founding members

stream of distractions and disruptions over the recent quarters  which were becoming increasingly personal and negative  as of late  as one of the leading reason for his step  He asserted that the  very public noise around us  had created a shaky atmosphere  making it difficult for management to function effectively Differences had been simmering between Murthy and Sikka for quite some time now  with the former repeatedly disparaging Sikka s policies Infosys Limited Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   In recent months  Infosys  founders  including Murthy  have criticized the company s leadership  focusing on executive pay packages and alleged lapses in corporate governance  Other issues which the founders took offense to  included allegations of impropriety in the 2015 acquisitions of Panaya and Skava Systems In an email last week  Murthy reportedly addressed some of his advisers that he had been told by at least three independent directors of Infosys that Sikka was less CEO material and more CTO  chief technology officer  material  He also reportedly condemned the Infosys board for not upholding governance standards Further  Infosys founders  who still own 12 75  of the company  had questioned Sikka s recent pay raise and the size of severance payouts given to some other executives  including former finance head   Rajiv Bansal Infosys expressed profound distress by the unfounded personal attacks on the members of the management team  through anonymous letters that surfaced in recent months Sikka s TermWhen Sikka took over the helm  Infosys was lagging behind industry growth  Under his leadership  Infosys revenues jumped from  2 13 billion in first quarter 2015 to  2 65 billion in first quarter 2017  with strong margin performance and sustained cash generation  Sikka s focus on profitable growth delivered an increase in liquid assets  including cash and cash equivalents  from  4 9 billion in June 2014 to  6 1 billion in June 2017 Infosys also rolled out over 25 new services under Sikka  which helped bolster revenues significantly However  the company s growth has slowed down sharply  after having soared in Sikka s first two years  Consequently  Infosys  share price has also underperformed the industry in recent times  Infosys  shares have inched up 0 2  in the past year  grossly underperforming the  s average gain of 27 1  Moving ForwardThe Indian IT bellwether has named U B Pravin Rao as interim chief executive officer and managing director  while Sikka will continue as executive vice chairman  Rao was the chief

13191,234706,CSGP,REIS Inc  Announced Continued Strong Renewal Rates Leading ,opinion,"Reis  Inc  reports preliminary financial results for the quarter ended December 31  2014 
Reis Inc  NASDAQ REIS   a leading provider of commercial mortgage and real estate research and analytics  reported revenue of  10 7 million for the quarter ending December 31  2014  up 16 5 percent from the same quarter a year ago  This was the 19th consecutive quarter of increased revenue 
REIS generated 100 percent of its revenue from subscriptions  and the continued strong revenue performance is due to that subscription revenue  2014 TTM annual renewal rates were 87 percent overall  and 89 percent for institutional subscribers 
According to CEO Lloyd Linford  since January  2011  EBITDA has grown at a CAGR of 14 3 percent and revenue has grown at a CAGR of 15 4 percent 
This earnings release follows the earnings announcements from the following peers of Reis  Inc    TechTarget Inc  NASDAQ TTGT   CoStar Group Inc  NASDAQ CSGP   Blucora Inc  NASDAQ BCOR   TheStreet Inc  NASDAQ TST   and Thomson Reuters Corporation  NYSE TRI  
Highlights
Summary numbers  Revenues of USD 10 73 million  Net Earnings of USD 1 52 million  and Earnings per Share  EPS  of USD 0 11 
Gross margins narrowed from 84 15  to 80 67  compared to the same quarter last year  operating  EBITDA  margins now 21 58  from 30 76  
Earnings decline largely a result of non operational activity  pretax margins improved from 16 87  to 21 37  
The table below shows the preliminary results and recent trends for key metrics such as revenues and net income growth 

Market Share Versus Profits
Companies sometimes focus on market share at the expense of profits or earnings growth 
Compared to the same quarter last year  REIS US s change in revenue of 16 48  surpassed its change in earnings  which was  90 65   This suggests perhaps that REIS US s focus is on market share at the expense of bottom line earnings  However  this change in revenue is better than its peer average  pointing to perhaps some longer lasting success at wrestling market share from its competitors  and helping Capital Cube look past its weaker earnings performance this period  Also  for comparison purposes  revenues changed by 2 45  and earnings by 34 86  in the quarter ended September 30  2014 

Earnings Growth Analysis
The company s year on year decline in earnings was influenced by a weakening in gross margins from 84 15  to 80 67   as well as issues with cost controls  As a result  operating margins  EBITDA margins  went fro 30 76  to 21 58  in this time frame  For comparison  gross margins were 85 45  and EBITDA margins were 30 91  in the quarter ending September 30  2014 

Margins
The company s earnings decline is largely a result of non operational activity  As a matter of fact  the company showed increases in operating  EBIT  and pretax margins  EBIT margins improved from 17 15  to 21 58  and pretax margins widened from 16 87  to 21 37

Another day  another gap and today s gap lower was just the start of what was a very weak day 
Now  we are oversold so some consolidation would be best 
We are still on track to put a nice low in by mid October or so and then we can pile into the right stocks and more importantly  the right stocks at the right time 
It s been a while without any real trades but it s soon to pay off 
That said  I did short a bit today in Advaxis Inc  NASDAQ ADXS  at 12 40 and CoStar Group Inc  NASDAQ CSGP  at 170 and I did hold some overnight in small size

We saw a gap higher today as we continue to work off the oversold levels that arose after Mondays selloff 
We are near levels where we can begin to move lower once again and I am cash once again 
My Advaxis Inc  NASDAQ ADXS  short from 12 40 to 10 worked like a charm but CoStar Group Inc  NASDAQ CSGP  stopped me out at cost today so no big deal 
I ll take that type of trade any day  especially when it happens so quickly in only a couple of days 

I can t see SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY  moving above the 192 50 resistance level on this consolidation phase 
I do not think a low is in yet for us yet 
A little more consolidation between 187 50 and 192 50 would give us a nice bear flag to move lower from and that should spark the fall that will give us the low we can begin to move higher out of  but only time will tell for sure ",2015-10-01,Warren Bevan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/building-the-bear-flag-266738,266738

13686,235201,CSGP,Infosys Notifies  2B Buyback Program  Shares Stretch Losses,opinion,"The board of Infosys Limited   NYSE INFY   announced a  2 billion share repurchase program a day after the   This move reflects an initiative to improve stakeholder returns for the Indian software exporter  after heightened tensions between the board and the founders led by ex Chairman N R Narayana Murthy resulted in Sikka s quitting 
Asia s second largest software services developer plans to repurchase as many as 113 million shares at Rs 1 150 apiece  per an exchange filing  Investors actually lost  3 5 billion as Infosys s market value plunged on Friday in the wake of Sikka s step down  The repurchase price represents a 25  premium to Friday s closing price 
Despite this generous offer  the shareholders  response was lukewarm at best 
Sikka s resignation had led to a deep unrest among investors  causing shares to decline 10 8  at one point before paring the losses to end at 7 2  lower  Even now  Infosys shares are continuing their downward trend  having fallen 5 4  in today s pre market trading at the time of writing 
Simply put  the repurchase price might have appeared more attractive  had Sikka s resignation the previous day not led to the plummet of Infosys shares to historic lows 
Infosys s shares have lost 6 4  in the past year versus the  s 17 8  average gain 

Experts opine that Infosys faces a major business disruption due to a high profile CEO s exit  bitter ego battles between top management and a co founder  plus the reputational damage suffered because of a possible securities fraud charge  These factors could affect new business acquisitions in the key markets and allow rivals to grab the company s existent market share 
Also  potential clients may refrain from making deals with Infosys until there is more clarity on who will replace Sikka and what the strategies and vision of the new CEO might be 
Sikka had taken over the reins of India s second largest software and outsourcing company in June 2014  Over time  he had been instrumental in realigning the company s consulting business toward strategy consulting  During his term  Infosys had increased its  100 million clients from 12 to 19  The company s large deal wins rose from  1 9 billion in 2015 to  3 5 billion in FY17 
Per news reports  Infosys is struggling with deep rifts formed within the board  Plus  the board s relationship with the company founders has been splintered  Perhaps  it is time for the company to revamp the board completely in order to restore investors  confidence 
The road ahead for Infosys looks long and difficult  The company needs to begin anew with recruiting the right CEO and MD  which seems a daunting task in the light of a possible disparity between what the founders expect and what the shareholders probably want to see in their new leader

13836,235351,CSGP,Will Macerich s  MAC  Efforts Paint A Brighter Picture In 2020 ,opinion,The bears have been in control of The Macerich Company s   NYSE MAC   shares throughout this year  In fact  so far in the year  shares of this S P 500 member have depreciated 39 4   as against the  s and index s rally of 11 3  and 25 2   respectively   The company s portfolio of premium malls is situated in vibrant U S  markets and densely populated areas  with affluent consumers having significant disposable incomes  However  investors have considerably lost their confidence in Macerich  thanks to the declines in annual revenues and funds from operations  FFO  for three consecutive years  In fact  investors have had an even rougher run during this time frame  when the stock slumped 62 5  on the bourse Notably  share prices of a company reflect not just the underlying business fundamentals  but also indicate investor sentiment  Further  the revenue and FFO trends are much more meaningful indicators of performance  and the retail apocalypse  near term bottlenecks and declines in FFO per share resulted in a wipeout for this stock Year to Date Price PerformanceMoreover  management s projection for 2019 adjusted FFO per share of  3 50  3 58  lower than the reported 2018 tally of  3 85  has further flared up investor skepticism 2019 NemesisLike other retail REITs  there has been no escape from industry shortfall for Macerich in 2019  The e commerce boom has taken a toll on brick and mortar retailing  forcing retailers to reconsider their footprint  This has been a pressing concern for retail landlords like Macerich  Kimco Realty   NYSE KIM    Taubman Centers  Inc    NYSE TCO   and SITE Centers   NYSE SITC    which have been hit hard by store closures and retailer bankruptcies  Such tenant fallouts adversely impact occupancy levels and leasing spreads for landlords In fact  according to a Costar Group   NASDAQ CSGP     announced store closures for the current year totaled more than 10  500 stores as of November 2019 Further  Forever 21 s bankruptcy filing will affect 15 of Macerich s stores occupied by the retail brand  This  along with the lease termination with Sears  will likely result in rent reductions and deceleration of same store net operating income growth In fact  the company anticipates a dilution of 8 cents due to lost rents from anchor lease terminations  primarily from Sears  in its 2019 FFO per share  Additionally  a charge of 15 cents is included in management s 2019 FFO per share guidance  in order to incorporate the impact of change in lease accounting rules  adoption of ASC 842  Moreover  past asset sales have been thwarting the company s operating results  Macerich has been disposing weaker performing malls for the past few years and accordingly  management expects around 3 cents per share of dilution from the 2018 dispositions  Will 2020 Bring Better Tidings Despite the short term challenges that Macerich is witnessing  the company s current robust business trends position it well for long term growth In fact  Macerich s dominant shopping centers in vibrant retail destinations will likely be able to tide over the retail blues  Additionally  amid evolving mall environment  the company is actively adapting to enhance its traditional business model  It has resorted to omni channel modeling  It is also reducing exposure to department stores and aiming at creating a more vibrant portfolio by embracing more diverse uses Accordingly  Macerich has been innovative in leasing its mall space to co working space providers  digital retailers  who want to open their first physical store  as well as newer types of tenants  in a bid to offer unique shopper experience  Through these efforts  the company is recapturing the previously vacated anchor boxes The company has also been active on the redevelopment front  through which it is undertaking unique and transformative densification projects focused on repurposing the properties as well as improving merchandizing mix  These efforts are boosting demand and leasing at its properties  In fact  during its third quarter 2019 earnings call  management noted  we continue to experience very good leasing volumes with year to date leasing activity up 29  compared to last year  These apart  the company s enviable productivity metric trends indicate that it will continue attracting tenants  Over the past 10 years  the average base rent has increased from  40 67 to  61 16  4  CAGR   while sales per square foot grew from  407 to  800  6 5  CAGR  CBRE Group s retail  for 2020 states that retail store openings will exceed closures in the upcoming year  This is projected to result in positive net absorption and rent growth in majority of the markets traced by the company  This suggests that the brick and mortar sales still constitute anessential part of the total retail sales  though the share has declined steadily Stock Down  But Company Far From OverAlthough Macerich s share price has precipitated significantly  the company appears to be taking all appropriate measures as a REIT shopping center operator  It has high productive assets in strategic locations and has undertaken apt moves to maximize the value of these properties Moreover  the 2020 Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company srevenues and FFO per share projects year over year growth of 3 1  and 1 9   respectively  hinting at a brighter 2020 You can see  Hence  as its fundamentals remain strong  Macerich s beaten down stock price and cheap valuation will steer interest of value investors Note  Anything related to earnings presented in this write up represent funds from operations  FFO    a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2020In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you like to know about our 10 top tickers for the entirety of 2020 These 10 are
