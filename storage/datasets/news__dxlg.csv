2952,224467,DXLG,Wal Mart To Name China Head As CEO Of Its UK Chain ASDA,opinion,"In order to save its struggling U K  division Asda  Wal Mart Stores Inc    NYSE WMT   is reportedly planning to appoint China head Sean Clarke as the Chief Executive Officer   CEO   of Asda this week  Clarke will take over the new position on Jul 11 
Clarke will replace Andy Clarke  who had said in an earlier Retail Week interview that Roger Burnley from rival Sainsbury Plc will serve as the Chief Operating Officer of Asda  Burnley will take up this role in October  Andy Clarke  who has served Asda for 20 long years  will take up an advisory role to the retailer for the remainder of 2016 
We note that Asda s underlying sales performance has declined since the past seven quarters amid a price war with other discounters that has squeezed its profits  The expansion of these discounters also took away Asda s position of U K  s cheapest mainstream grocer 
The CEO of Wal Mart s international unit has entrusted Clarke with a big responsibility  given his experience and expects him to turn around Asda s results  He has worked for retailers in Japan  Canada  and most recently  China WAL MART STORES Price and Consensus   Wal Mart operates more than 11 500 retail units under 72 different banners in 28 countries and e commerce websites in 11 countries  Wal Mart s stores offer almost everything which is of day to day use  enabling it to keep the number one spot  on the basis of revenues  on the Fortune 500 list for the fourth year in a row 
However  we note that the Bentonville  AR based company is facing severe challenges and has been showing signs of acute weakness since the past few quarters  While increased investments in technology in order to compete with Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   and an increase in pay for its workers are helping to boost sales of this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company  it is also increasing its expense burden 
The retail giant is making efforts to understand the evolving needs of its customers to regain their confidence  and thus boost sales  However  higher labor costs along with the company s efforts to overhaul its stores and invest in its online operations will weigh on its earnings in the near term

Improving Comps Sales Growth at Wal Mart U S   Wal Mart is seeing positive comps at Wal Mart U S  for the past seven quarters  after delivering negative comps since the third quarter of fiscal 2013  Traffic improved for six consecutive quarters  owing to the company s efforts to modernize its stores to boost traffic  Traffic also increased due to moderate improvement in consumer spending  The lower gas prices have eased consumer spending power a bit  the impact of which is seen in improved traffic at stores  Many of the U S  customers are also using their tax refunds in shopping  Wal Mart s efforts to change its stores as per consumers  demand helped the retailer attract some of the shoppers  In fact  the company continues to expect positive comps year over year at Wal Mart U S  in fiscal 2017

We note that the company s shares have been tumbling since the beginning of this year  Many firms have also filed a class action lawsuit against Iconix  In Dec 2015  the company announced that it has received a formal order of investigation from the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission   SEC    pertaining to some accounting treatment related to certain international joint venture transactions  It has been accused of misleading investors by underreporting the cost of its brands and overstating its earnings and revenues by engaging in irregular accounting practices related to the booking of its joint venture revenues and profits  free cash flow  and organic growth 
Though the company restated its historical statements along with the fourth quarter 2015 results  these issues have adversely impacted growth 
Not only that  Iconix has delivered sluggish results throughout 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016  Both earnings and sales have declined year over year in the last five consecutive quarters due to sluggishness in the women s  men s and home segments  In the women s segment  the largest component of the decline was the wholesale business  with some pressure on the Rampage brand  There was continued weakness across the men s portfolio 
The company expects these issues to persist in 2016 and also anticipates higher expenses in the year
