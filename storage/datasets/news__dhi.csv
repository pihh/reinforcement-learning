179735,401251,DHI,Homebuilder Horton sees 2020 home sales above estimates  shares rise,news,"By Sanjana Shivdas
 Reuters    D R  Horton Inc  N DHI  topped expectations for profit and revenue in the fourth quarter and forecast 2020 home sales above analysts  estimates  as cheaper mortgage rates buoyed demand from buyers  sending shares in the biggest U S  homebuilder up 3  
Home sales rose 9 2  to 16 024 units in the quarter  underpinning a 10 cent beat on profit as it predicted it would sell more than 60 000 homes next year 
JMP Securities analyst Peter Martin said that lower official interest rates and the company s strategy of building more affordable homes had eased some of the tensions hurting its results a year ago 
 Last year this time we had the highest pessimism because of rising interest rates  people were pulling back on affordability and builders were out of homes at the lower end price points   he said 
 If they  Horton  can keep supplying homes at a lower price point  and stay in the current range of interest rates  I think they are going to have a very nice year  
The Federal Reserve has lowered borrowing costs twice this year to offset headwinds caused by more than a year long trade war between the United States and China  and slowing global growth 
Horton  which builds roughly 10  of all new U S  homes  said it expects sales in 2020 to be between 60 000 and 61 000 homes  compared with analysts  estimates of 59 737 homes 
Orders  an indicator of future demand  rose 14 1  to 13 130 homes in the quarter 
U S  homebuilding tumbled from a more than a 12 year high in September  but single family home construction rose for a fourth straight month  suggesting the housing market remains supported by lower mortgage rates even as the economy is slowing 
Horton also forecast 2020 revenue between  18 5 billion and  19 0 billion  compared with estimates of  18 58 billion 
Net income attributable to the company rose 8 4  to  505 3 million  or  1 35 per share  in the quarter ended Sept  30  Revenue rose 11 7  to  5 04 billion 
Analysts on average had expected a profit of  1 25 per share on revenue of  4 86 billion  according to IBES data from Refinitiv ",2019-11-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/homebuilder-horton-sees-2020-home-sales-above-estimates-shares-rise-2018742,2018742

entire D R  Horton team for your focus and hard work  We are incredibly well positioned to continue growing and improving our operations  This concludes our prepared remarks  We will now host questions  Questions   Answers  Operator Operator instructions  Our first question today is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG Carl Reichardt    BTIG    Analyst I wanted to ask  something you guys often have talked about is the idea of getting your cash back out of your investments in land within two years  And with some of your peers moving to some of the products and markets that you serve  I m just curious as to your perspective  David  on the land market in general for affordable homes and your ability to continue to run the model where you re getting cash out in two years David Auld    President and Chief Executive Officer Well  the cash out in two years is something we stayed with through from the downturn on  And I can tell you that  that model has worked very well for us  And I don t see that changing  And as to the overall market for buying land  again  it comes back to the people we have embedded in these markets and the relationships they have with the land owners  And we feel very good about our opportunity to replace what we re building through  And through this market has seen that happen over and over and over again  So   Carl Reichardt    BTIG    Analyst Great  And then on similar lines looking like start you re going to pick up with order strong for lots of folks  I m curious as to your perspective on the labor market subs  in particular  and what you re seeing and thinking about in terms of the potential for increases in cost there this year as these orders get built out David Auld    President and Chief Executive Officer I think there s always going to be that pressure on the cost side  Definitely  labor is getting tighter and I think going to restrict a lot of people s ability to deliver houses  Again  it goes back to the kind of the operating profile we adopted and continue  and that is consistent starts throughout the community  expanding the labor base via efficiency  not necessarily just bodies  and we feel very good about what we ve accomplished  We have a very loyal trade base  I think I said on the last call  our traders don t have to go chase their pay checks  So all of that combines to put us in a great position  So is it going to be a problem  I think less so for us than other people OperatorOur next question is coming from John Lovallo from Bank of America Merrill Lynch John Lovallo    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst The first one on the order ASP a little bit over  300 000 in the quarter  That was up pretty nicely year over year  And I know you mentioned that there s some normalization off of a challenging period last year  But just curious  if we kind of break down that number  is it kind of regional and product mix driven  Or are you taking pricing on a like for like basis Jessica Hansen    Vice President of Investor Relations Part of it is regionally driven  If you look at our orders this year  the South Central was down 2  in terms of just the mix  the overall mix  And that s actually our lowest ASP region  So we continue to expect just modest sales price increases as we move throughout the year enough to cover our cost increases  But on a like for like basis  nothing significant in the way of price John Lovallo    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst OK  That s helpful  And then just curious how you re thinking about the Forestar investment  It s a    plan is to kind of continue to dilute your stake through issuing equity out of Forestar or are you now considering or any plans to potentially sell down your actual ownership position Bill Wheat    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes  We re still on track with our plan there  John  to ultimately deconsolidate Forestar  We were pleased when they were able to issue their first primary equity offering in September  which diluted our position down from the original 75   Here in December  we re sitting at 65   We would expect additional equity issuances from Forestar over time that could continue to dilute our position  And then as we ve also said  all along  there s a potential that we could sell some of our shares  And at the point in time that we are ready to do that  we will have a plan in place that will complement the primary equity issuance  And those two things together would result in further dilution in our ownership position OperatorOur next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman   Associates Alan Ratner    Zelman and Associates    Analyst So first one  I think last quarter  you guys commented just when you thought about the full year  your best guess at that point would be that gross margins would be kind of similar in that 21  range  and you obviously hit that this quarter  and 2Q guidance is similar as well  So just first off  is there any changing in thinking in terms of the progression in margins through the year  Obviously  a very strong sales environment  So how should we think about as the year progresses  what happens to margin Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer I think we re going to see consistent margins into the second quarter  And then  frankly  as usual  this time of the year  the spring selling season will really dictate where margins go in Q3 and Q4  Early returns on the spring selling season have been very positive  So we re confident in giving our guidance of consistent margins into Q2  but we re going to have to wait and see what happens in the next several weeks Alan Ratner    Zelman and Associates    Analyst Great  I appreciate that  Second question  if I look at your homes in inventory  That s been  at least on a year over year basis  been trending lower for the last several quarters  I think this quarter  you re down about 10  year over year  And obviously  last year was elevated a bit because of the sales  the tougher sales environment  But are you seeing a greater component of sales coming from to be built  Or have you changed your thought process at all in terms of the optimal number of specs per community that would be translated into that type of decline we re seeing  Or are you trying to ramp that higher as the spring gets under way Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Yes  A couple of things going on with that number  Alan  One  the comparison to the prior year  We re actually down 5   We changed the way we report homes in inventory to exclude the model homes  So last year  where were we last year  like  31 800 Bill Wheat    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 31 800 Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer 31 800  and so this year  we re at 30 200  So we re down slightly from last year  And last year may have been a bit elevated with the softer sales and operating environment we saw in the fourth calendar quarter of  18  Another thing we ve talked about is getting better at turning our housing inventory to drive a higher return with those investment dollars  And then we re also seeing the ability to push starts in as we re seeing demand come on  We re not noticing any kind of a difference in the mix between to be builds versus our spec starts  continuing probably an 80 20 consistent approach to that OperatorOur next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI Stephen Kim    Evercore ISI    Analyst First question I had for you is on the land spend  The land spend was fairly high relative to our expectations this quarter  And I m talking specifically on the acquisition number of  890 million  And as you know  as a percentage of revs  that was probably the highest we ve seen in six years  And given your discipline and given your outlook on the business and your intention to basically get a return on that spend within 24 months  it seems that there s a fair amount of optimism that s implied by that strong land spend  So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that  Maybe break that down for us  at least qualitatively  in terms of    was that strong land spend fairly equally distributed across the country  Were there certain opportunities that emerged in a particular region  or a particular product type that garnered a lion s share of that  If you could just talk about the relatively strong land spend in greater detail Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Sure  Stephen  As you know  you study our land spend  there is some lumpiness kind of from quarter to quarter  and so one quarter  just based on the timing of when deals close and when they get ready to go and being our business plans  there can be a bit of lumpiness there  One thing I would point out is that over half of our land acquisition spend is four finished lots  And so we continue to dedicate a lot of our spend to finish lots which turn very quickly  And so I would really just attribute  I wouldn t say there s necessarily any changes in our plans  but I would attribute a bit of this to bit of a lumpiness  point out that finished lots are a heavy part of the spend  But then we are optimistic  We do see growth certainly in fiscal  20  And right now we still see a very good underlying fundamentals for the business  And so we re still actively replenishing our land and lot supply Jessica Hansen    Vice President of Investor Relations And we have to replenish it at a faster rate as we continue to grow our sales and closings pace  So you ve seen our owned lot count remained relatively flat for quite some time  So it s really just a function of having to replenish at a faster rate Stephen Kim    Evercore ISI    Analyst Great  Yes  that s helpful  The second question relates to the broader macro environment or rather the broader environment with respect to housing policy  We ve seen some interesting moves here as of late  We ve seen the average DTIs  the high DTIs and high LTV lending  be curtailed or reined back by the FHFA  And yet  we ve also just heard the CFPD weigh in here and suggest they re going to move to an APOR spread versus the DTI  I was curious as to whether or not you have looked into this  Some of what we ve heard is that the move to the APOR spread would actually be stimulative to entry level housing  top of the dropping rates  that would seem to be extremely favorable for your business  And I was curious if you had looked at that at all  and if you have any view on whether or not these broader factors may be positive for your business  the way it would appear to us Jessica Hansen    Vice President of Investor Relations Sure  High level  I think we d agree with what you re saying  That being said  it s super early and out there  and it s not something that we ve spent a lot of time on  I m sure a mortgage company would have a much more detailed response for you  But anything that continues to improve mortgage standards and makes it easier for people to get into a house  clearly  would be a benefit to our business  That being said  as David mentioned in his opening  financing availability is still good  I mean people that should be buying houses are who are buying houses today  And we re not necessarily in favor of people with significantly high DTIs or really low credit scores being in a house because we re very cognizant of what happened last cycle  and we don t want any repeat of that OperatorOur next question is coming from Truman Patterson from Wells Fargo Truman Patterson    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst Let me just throw in congrats on the good quarter as well David Auld    President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you Truman Patterson    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst So your guidance is for mid  to high single digit closing growth  You bumped up the high end a little bit  But is there anything structurally limiting you from going above the high end of that guidance  particularly on the land side  I m thinking availability of lots  your ability to get lots developed  And that also includes municipality constraints  delaying community openings that might create any kind of gap outs Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Yes  so we re really excited about the way this year started off  the first quarter and through the first several weeks of January  and we have increased our guidance as a result of that  Structurally  it s a question of the lots that are out in front of us  We feel good about the community positioning we have  getting some communities opened  But right now  we re not going to increase our guidance based on where we are today in the spring selling season  but we will certainly look to deliver all the homes we can at the best returns we can do in fiscal  20 Truman Patterson    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst OK  So put another way  there s nothing structurally limiting you on the land side from going above that if the market is a bit healthier than what you expect as of today Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer I mean there s a finite number of homes we can build over the next 8 5  nine months and deliver by September 30 Truman Patterson    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst Yes Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer But we re comfortable with our guidance range today  And we re just going to have to see what the spring is going to give us and where we end up in our inventory positioning in March and into April and May Jessica Hansen    Vice President of Investor Relations Our guidance already incorporates the higher housing inventory turnover than what we did last year  So it reflects an improvement in terms of building  selling and closing more houses this year than last year  which is what we continue to be focused  is those efficiencies in the business  but that is what limits further upside to our current guidance Truman Patterson    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst OK  And then sticking on the land side  Your option lots jumped nicely this quarter as you all continue rotating toward more option land  How should we think about where that growth comes from  Is it primarily through Forestar  Is it more of an even balance between Forestar and your third party developers  And then any way you can put out a target over the next couple of years  what you think you can get that option land bank as a percentage of total up to David Auld    President and Chief Executive Officer We re not going to set a hard target  Internally  we talk about goals  but that s an internal conversation  And it s kind of a balanced program  I think the Forestar platform is  again  built out  We re very happy with the progress we re making there  But we are also equally focused on our third party developers  And they re a part of the D R  Horton family  And that pipeline continues to get better and bigger  And so it s a collection of the two  Primarily  it s just focus  We re treating capital as if it s a precious commodity  And we re going to try to treat it better than anybody else in the industry OperatorOur next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays Matt Bouley    Barclays    Analyst So I wanted to ask on the SG A side  since your guidance implies sort of flat percentage year over year  Although you are growing the top line and kind of managing that inventory positioning  is there any reason why we wouldn t see a bit more leverage  And how should we think about that beyond the next quarter Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Yes  to the extent we re delivering on our closings guidance and showing mid  to high single digit growth in revenue  we do expect to see leverage on our SG A and improvement year over year  We re very pleased with the 30 basis points we saw in the first quarter  Based on what we see today and the volume we see in Q2  we do expect SG A to be relatively flat with last year in Q2  But overall  we do expect some leverage for the year Matt Bouley    Barclays    Analyst OK  Appreciate that  And then as you just mentioned  I believe  to the prior question  Your guidance for the Q2 closings does imply kind of a continued uptick on that conversion of your inventory positioning  But you did also mention earlier that labor is kind of not surprisingly getting tighter  So can you speak a bit about that balance  And what exactly are you guys doing on the ground that supports that improving efficiency David Auld    President and Chief Executive Officer It gets back to me  it gets back to relationships with the trade base  And for the last    I don t know  Ever since the downturn  we ve had a steady and consistent level of production going in our communities  And so our trade base has gotten better at building the houses  And when they re not out there chasing work  they can build more houses with    what I look at is the same labor  We build more square footage with the same labor hours  So it s a process  It s something we ve worked on all the way through this cycle  I think early on  we felt like labor is going to be the constraint on housing  And we have done  I think  a great job of managing the trade base and making sure that those guys were making money  and we were still delivering houses at a reasonable cost Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Matt  the other thing we look at here  and we watch sort of from a high level perspective is what our build times are doing and our process when we start a house to we get it completed and then closed  And we re not seeing those times elongate  which would be real  more acute indicators of labor shortages in various markets  So the long standing deep relationships we have with a lot of the labor suppliers  combined with the more efficient plan set  if you will  in our communities and focus on the first time homebuyer and affordability has driven our ability to continue to turn houses a little bit better  and we re going to see a lot of improvement in that metric this year OperatorOur next question is coming from Michael Rehaut from JP Morgan Mike Rehaut    J P  Morgan    Analyst Again  congrats on the quarter  The first question I had was on your outlook for the year for community count and sales pace  I believe last quarter  you talked about    and correct me if I m wrong  but you d expect community count  average community count for the year to be up year over year  low single digits  I was wondering if that s still the expectation  I believe it s been flat sequentially more or less for the last few quarters  But I guess  the expectation would be to drift upward a little bit  And then also on the sales pace  you had a nice improvement year over year  And I was just curious if that was more driven by market conditions or certain product or geographic mix shifts and how you think about the next quarter or two Jessica Hansen    Vice President of Investor Relations Sure  So when we think about community count  Mike  it s the hardest one for us to predict  quite honestly  which is why we never give formal guidance on it  I think our base case book would be that we would anticipate it to tick up at some point as we move throughout the year  But when that inflection point actually happens  it s hard to call exactly  In terms of the sales pace  As we mentioned in the script  that does reflect the moderation in demand we saw in late calendar 2018  So we did have    although we generally don t talk about comps  we did have a relatively easy comp when you look at that  And what our guidance reflects for the year from a closings perspective  would infer that our sales year over year increase is going to moderate from Q1  And it ll fluctuate  Q2  Q3  Q4 in a range that supports that closings growth guidance that we ve alluded to Mike Rehaut    J P  Morgan    Analyst No  That s helpful  I guess  secondly  going through you picture  maybe piggybacking off an earlier question of owned versus optioned  maybe said a different way  your lot option percentage has  obviously  a huge amounts of progress  impressive progress over the last few years  Now it s kind of been in that low 60s type of range  60  to 61   62  maybe  over the last three  four quarters  that increase over the last few years has been a big  big driver of your improved return profile  Just trying to get a sense of over the next two or three years  certainly  you re not going to do the same type of degree of change on the lot option profile as you have before  Maybe it ll drift up a little bit  I do recall you guys talking about a 70  number  perhaps  but maybe now that s not as concrete  but how should we think about  over the next two or three years  the next big lever of improvement in returns  Would it be more from a share repurchasing standpoint  Or are there other levers that perhaps we re not thinking about Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Yes  Mike  we expect it to be just continued incremental improvement on all fronts  We do expect to continue to    and our goal is to continue to push an option percentage upward  We re not going to set necessarily an upward target  but we do expect to incrementally improve that as Forestar grows  builds out its platform even further  That s going to continue to be of that growth story as well as expanding relationships with our developers  We ve already alluded to on this call  we re expecting to turn our housing inventory faster this year  And so that s going to be an incremental lever in terms of returns this year  And then as our operations are more efficient and generate more cash  that gives us more flexibility on the capital allocation side  And so over the last several years  we have instituted an increasing level of share repurchases and dividend payouts to shareholders  which has enhanced our ROE  And so as we continue to incrementally improve over the year  I think each one of those levers is going to allow us to continue to incrementally improve both operational returns and returns to shareholders OperatorNext question today is coming from John Micenko from SIG John Micenko    Susquehanna International Group  LLP    Analyst I wanted to revisit the pace question a little bit more  1Q here  this was  I think  probably the high watermark since the crisis on sales pace  And I m curious  the guide would suggest that pace will continue to improve through the year  maybe at a slower clip  But the improvement    looking past year over year with the easy comps  but the improvement over the last four or five quarters  is that all product segmentation  Or are you seeing lift across all your product types  I m curious if there s any regional differential that could drive maybe incremental pace improvement through the latter half of this year  maybe into next year Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer I think we re seeing generally increased absorptions at our more affordable price points  whether that s the entire community or certain plans within more the traditional Horton branded communities  We are not heavily exposed to the luxury end of the market  So we re not experiencing if there is any lift there or not lift going on there  We can t speak to that very well  But across all of our geographies  we re feeling pretty good about the traffic  pretty good about the demand in the most recent quarter and in the quarters leading up to it John Micenko    Susquehanna International Group  LLP    Analyst And then maybe the January trend in the last couple of weeks  would it be consistent with what we saw in the fiscal first  Or does that build sort of continue in the most recent couple of weeks Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer I d say we ve seen normal seasonality week to week as we ve progressed in January  It seems like historically  people talked about Super Bowl Sunday being the kickoff to the spring selling season  And we ve noticed the past few years that seems to be starting a little bit earlier  And maybe it s because the Cowboys did make the playoffs  people are buying houses sooner  So we re excited for the Chiefs  And I think   David Auld    President and Chief Executive Officer And the 49ers Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer And yes  speak on opportunity John Micenko    Susquehanna International Group  LLP    Analyst Yes  Just one more for me  A couple of the job sites you ve got  it looks like you re trying to build a team on the single family rental side  Can you just refresh us on the strategy there and the thoughts owned versus build for others  and how you re thinking about the business today Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Yes  We re currently thinking about the business  We re still early stages on it  and we re trying to get in and really understand the operations of the business and see where we add the most value to that process  Today  it s probably more dipping our toe in the water on the down side  But we are certainly looking at it hard  and have not shut the door on any possibility today OperatorOur next question is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets Ken Zener    KeyBanc Capital Markets    Analyst So you beat your closing guidance  I assume that was on higher intra quarter order closings  Can you confirm that  And what was the percent of intra quarter order closings in this 1Q versus last year Jessica Hansen    Vice President of Investor Relations You are correct that  We beat that  This quarter  it was 40  that we sold and closed in the same quarter  which is slightly higher than we would typically do  I don t know that I have last year  Last year  it was 37  Ken Zener    KeyBanc Capital Markets    Analyst OK  And then related to that  Is there any shift in terms of    I mean that s where I expect to see efficiency showing up  So could you talk about if there s anything that you re thinking about in regards to that increase in that percent and talk about the margin spread that you re    or the trend that you guys have been seeing between the backlog closings and specifically the intra quarter closing units Jessica Hansen    Vice President of Investor Relations Yes  on the first part  Ken  I would say it s pretty much in line with what we would expect  especially with the number of completed specs that we have  That allows us the opportunity to sell and close more homes within a quarter  So I would expect that trend to continue  Last year  in the second quarter  we actually sold and closed 45  homes in the same quarter  sold and closed  If you look at the margin differential  That stayed relatively consistent in that there is a slight differential and a slightly lower margin on specs than there is build jobs  That being said  really  the only big differential is on our completed specs that have been completed and unsold for a period of multiple months  So the earlier we sell it as a spec  the tighter that differential is  And as a reminder  about 80  of what we closed in a quarter  started as a spec  When you see that 21  home sales margin we reported this quarter  That s by and large a spec gross margin Ken Zener    KeyBanc Capital Markets    Analyst Why is that spec margin a bit lower first backlog if there s price appreciation  I mean what is this moving  Is that you have to discount it  that seems inconsistent with order strength Jessica Hansen    Vice President of Investor Relations No  it s that we re underwriting to a return  And as we turn our spec housing more quickly than build jobs  we re able to work for a slightly lower gross margin and get an equivalent return  In a build job  you re actually going to lose the price appreciation if you lock in before you start construction  So we like selling more in real time and capturing that margin as we move along the way Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Ken  a lot of our build job sales are actually sales of homes that we had planned to start anyway  They were in the production planning process to start  They just had not started yet  but they were released to sale on the sales floor  Our average time in backlog for a customer that s in a build job is not terribly long because our homes  generally  we re building to an affordable price point  homes build fairly efficiently  And so the customer is not sitting for a long period of time going through a large design selection process  lengthy permitting process until we get to a start  A lot of these homes will be starting very soon after they sign the contract  So it s a very tight margin differential between just a traditional spec sale to marketplace Ken Zener    KeyBanc Capital Markets    Analyst I appreciate that  And if I could  one last question  Did you guys pull most of your permits in California to get ahead of the solar mandate David Auld    President and Chief Executive Officer I don t think so  We re responding to the market out there  And I mean  certainly  the solar mandate is going to increase cost  but pulling a permit and building a house when there s not a market for it is going to create a whole lot us return than pay any additional costs  So it s just kind of business as usual for us out there Jessica Hansen    Vice President of Investor Relations And the solar mandate was  we ve known about that for several years that we ve had the ability to prepare and that s in our underwriting  and we knew those costs were coming and is more and more homes are being built with solar  our base case expectation is that those costs will come down OperatorOur next question is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James Buck Horne    Raymond James    Analyst Quick question  Could you just put a color on percentage of communities that you were able to raise price on  on a same plan basis Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Buck  we don t have that information in terms of fracking across our neighborhoods  We really have empowered our local operators to be looking to meet the market to drive return  and that is certainly a function of pace and margin  and they re looking to maximize that at every community  every week  every day  frankly  as looking at what that pace is  And that s nothing that we re managing centrally  So we don t really have the ability to give you that color today Jessica Hansen    Vice President of Investor Relations When we talk about a lot  our revenues per square foot  that s a metric people    we ve consistently reported  and we haven t given that yet today  Year over year  our revenue per square foot was up about 3   And our stick and brick costs were down about 0 5   Sequentially  our revenues per square foot in our stick and brick costs per square foot were essentially flat Buck Horne    Raymond James    Analyst OK  That s helpful  That s great  And switching over to just the multifamily investment  Just curious if you could provide any potential quarterly timing of expected sales or closings  Or how do you think of potential gains on sale from the multifamily division  either this year or next year  How do you plan on growing that investment going forward Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Sure  In terms of timing  we expect to close a total of two projects in fiscal 2020  We closed our first one here in Q1  We did state that one of our communities is substantially complete  And so in the process of stabilizing the rental situation and marketing it  So we would expect to close that one later in fiscal 2020  Don t have a specific quarter guide for you on that  And then we do expect the investment level in DHI Communities to grow this year  We expect it to grow approximately 100  from the point at the start of year over the course of this year as their pipeline is growing and their number of projects will begin to grow more directly over the course of fiscal 2020  which will ultimately result in some future years delivering more than two a year  But the lead time  the pipeline on those deals is two to three years long  So we re still a couple of years out from a significant increase of volume of project sales in DHI Communities OperatorOur next question today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW Jade Rahmani    KBW    Analyst With respect to single family rental and multifamily  do you have any interest  Does the company have any interest in creating a permanent capital vehicle to hold those assets  In my experience in the REIT sector  the highest valuation is described to continual recurring earnings rather than gain on sale type earnings where it s unpredictable to the market  Just curious as to your thoughts on that Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Yes  Just on that  Jade  and that s something we re aware of that as well  And that s one of the things that we re studying as we get further into this business  Our goals early on have been to ensure that we have a strong efficient operating platform for beginning with multifamily  And as we look at the single family rental space  we re looking to do the same thing there  As we get that established  we then look to growing the platform and setting the capital base for it  And so as we look at the medium and longer term plans for setting the capital base for both of those businesses  That s certainly something that we will be considering for the longer term Jade Rahmani    KBW    Analyst Turning to financial leverage  I was wondering if the total debt to capital at slightly below 20  is in line with your long term target  Or do you think there s potentially improvement in that ratio in years to come Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Where we are today  we don t expect to increase our leverage  As we are generating cash and adding to our equity base that our leverage would not increase from here and we could see further decreases  Our stated maximum leverage is 35  or below  But obviously  we ve got a lot of headroom on that today  but that does give us room that in certain scenarios  we would leave ourselves some room to invest further and increase leverage  But we don t see that in the short run OperatorOur next question is coming from Rohit Seth from SunTrust Rohit Seth    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    Analyst Can you give us an update on what s happening with the Freedom brand  Any color on that buyer segment David Auld    President and Chief Executive Officer We continue to work on that product offering presentation  better lifestyle  It s something we re happy with  I think it will be a larger and larger portion of our of deliveries in the future  It s a growing demographic  And we think we can provide a product in lifestyle that people are going to move into Rohit Seth    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    Analyst Would you say  are you expecting a ramp in that business in your annual guidance  Or is that annual guidance more driven by kind of that entry level buyer David Auld    President and Chief Executive Officer It s still the entry level buyer driving the market  The Freedom brand for us is part of our long term  meet the needs of as many buyers out there as we can  And I think as the market moves  it will become a more and more important part of what we re doing Rohit Seth    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    Analyst Understood  And then second question  on your gross margin guidance  21   Can you maybe break out the cost buckets there  What s your lever  cost inflation expectation  material costs and then like cost Jessica Hansen    Vice President of Investor Relations Really just more of the same  So modest increases  I d say labor has stayed in the low single digit percentage range  Now that we ve kind of cycled through the lumber headwinds that we had  materials we essentially would expect to be neutral  We always have some categories where costs are going up  But our purchasing teams do a fantastic job of finding other categories to lower our costs and offset whatever increases we re not able to push back on  And then land really have been kind of a low to mid single digit percentage increase  at least on a per square foot basis  And that really is not expected to change either  I mean land costs aren t coming down  As home prices rise  land costs typically follow  So really just more of the same in  20 is what we experienced in  19  If you take out late calendar  18 in the incentive environment and the lumber costs that we cycled through Rohit Seth    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    Analyst OK  Understood  And then what is the expectation for the tariff impact or no impact  Or what do you have in there Jessica Hansen    Vice President of Investor Relations Neutral  We ve got price protection on almost everything  If there is a modest impact from any of the tariffs  we ve identified ways to offset that OperatorOur next question is coming from Mark Weintraub from Seaport Research Mark Weintraub    Seaport Global Holdings LLC    Analyst You mentioned the very positive early returns on spring selling season  Was that largely just a reference to strong orders in January  Or was there other things that color that comment Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer The primary thing is the order trends  I mean that s the first read we re getting on what s coming through  And they re coming in at a great pace that we ve expected  And we re seeing good seasonal build week to week with that  And anecdotally  we re not hearing about any pushback or pressure on pricing from the customer side in the marketplace today Mark Weintraub    Seaport Global Holdings LLC    Analyst Kind of following up on that  obviously  as Jessica just mentioned  you have a fairly benign cost environment now  If as things heat up  labor does go higher  materials go higher  etc    do you have a sense as to what type of pricing power you might have in the current environment  And really  I recognize it s always a question of pace versus price  But I guess  at some points in time  when you try and push pricing  you have a bigger impact than at other times  And certainly  we saw that in the last year or two  Do you think that we ve created a bit more cushion in the environment so that there would be more leeway on price if costs start to go up  Or do you think we haven t exited that environment Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Feel really good about the market conditions we re seeing today and the buyers that are coming in and their urgency to buy  So I would say we have some cushion to work with in that  But again  we re not just looking at a margin number  It is a return number  as you alluded to before  the pace versus price  And so driving the communities at the planned absorptions  we found  drive the highest returns  And then the activity that begets that coming out of buyers seeing activities  seeing momentum drive generally some pricing power and some margin expansion  executing at the community level  And that s really where our focus is  And as it s rolling up  we ve seen pretty consistent margins in the last couple of quarters  and we re looking at that into next quarter  We re optimistic about spring  and that s going to tell us where margins ultimately go for this year Mark Weintraub    Seaport Global Holdings LLC    Analyst OK  Great  And one last one  Where are your thoughts on offsite manufacturing as a way to potentially mitigate or improve the labor side of things in time Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer A lot of our homes today are put together with trusses  roof trusses that are manufactured offsite  Others  we re doing wall penalizations in certain markets  And it s something we continually evaluate to look at the most efficient from both a time and a cost perspective as to how to deliver the home at the best value to the buyer  So we re always evaluating it  We haven t seen a sea change in the economics of that today  Most of our homes are probably stick framed with trusses  would be probably the broad generalization to say  But there are some markets where we still build roofs on site  So it s varied across the country OperatorOur next question is coming from Jay McCanless from Wedbush Jay McCanless    Seaport Global Holdings LLC    Analyst Just two questions on incentives  What are you guys doing with incentives now and more importantly  what are you seeing from your competition Bill Wheat    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Pretty stable environment there  Certainly  on a year over year basis  our incentives are down significantly  But over the last couple of quarters  been pretty stable  It s a normal environment where there s usually some level of incentives related to closing costs  And then community by community  there could be some specific incentives  but nothing out of the ordinary  certainly  in our business  And really  we re seeing a pretty rational environment across other builders as well  Not hearing anything out of the ordinary David Auld    President and Chief Executive Officer Yes  I d say the market is good  People are  as Bill said  performing rationally  It is good time to be a home builder Jay McCanless    Seaport Global Holdings LLC    Analyst Absolutely  My second question  just talking about what your average lots per community is right now  and are you expecting that to trend up just to get the higher year over year unit closures you talked about the guidance Jessica Hansen    Vice President of Investor Relations It slightly trended up here over the last couple of years  Jay  as our absorptions have improved  That does allow our underwriting to hit our standards and do slightly larger communities  So I would say that is incorporated in what we re expecting for fiscal  20  But that s really just been more of the same of what we ve experienced each of the last few years  Multiple product types and larger communities allows us to drive more absorption  So I don t have our current average lot size or lot count  Rough  I would say  probably 150  200 lots  But obviously  we ve got significant variation in that  We ve got communities that are 30 lots  we ve got communities that are 1 000 lots Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer And some  more options  some  more owned Jessica Hansen    Vice President of Investor Relations Yes Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer There s a big mix there OperatorOur next question is coming from Alex Barrun from Housing Research Center Alex Barrun    Housing Research Center    Analyst Yes  I guess I just want to circle back a little bit to the guidance  Over the last two quarters  orders have been double digits and a little bit off of that was maybe easier comp  But I guess  I m just curious you guys just being conservative this early in the spring selling season basically  given the single digit order growth guidance or delivery guidance Jessica Hansen    Vice President of Investor Relations So Alex  not to be repetitive  but really  it is a function of where we sit today  the number of houses we have  the number of houses we had going into the year  We did have a much easier comp this quarter compared to late calendar last year when the market was completely different of what it is  And to remind everyone  we heavily incentivized into December and really  into the spring to continue the sales increases that we saw  I think we were the only builder in calendar 4Q of  18 that had up quarter  Our sales were up about 3   And that really was just a function of how heavily we incentivized in December to get there  So October and November  you can read into  were very tough months  And that led into a good comp this year  And 19  up  though  I mean it s a good market  as Mike s alluded to several times  and we feel very good about the market today  But we sit here today  We haven t seen the spring selling season  We ve got 5  fewer houses in the ground  So if we re able to push and get a few more starts in and the spring is stronger than expected  could there be a little of upside potentially  but we don t see a whole lot  And we did already raise the higher end of our guidance by about 500 homes Mike Murray    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer And on balance  we re looking at much stronger returns in fiscal 2020 because we re still seeing a good pace  Even at the guidance level  we re seeing a good pace at better margins  better returns and a better turn of our inventory this year as well  So we re very pleased with our positioning with a good market backdrop and with our plan for the year Alex Barrun    Housing Research Center    Analyst Got it  And then you mentioned that the best returns come from maintaining the sales pace pretty strong  So could we necessarily be that you re not seeking to push prices too much to not upset that strong sales pace Jessica Hansen    Vice President of Investor Relations It depends on the community  Alex  And it really just depends  If we ve got another community  replacement community ready to go behind it  we re going to most likely push more pace than we are priced because that s the best thing we can do is continue to turn our inventory  generate more revenue and profits in a shorter period of time  But if it s in an area of the country where we don t have a replacement community  or for whatever reason  that community is not replaceable  We re going to be more likely to push price  So it s always a balance community by community OperatorWe ve

afternoon  everyone  and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call  We appreciate your interest in DHI We made significant progress this past year in building a strong foundation for future revenue growth and the long term success of the company  We delivered more product innovation in 2019 than the company had delivered in the prior five years combined  And we intend to accelerate the pace of innovation in 2020  as the industry leader in the growing market for matching technologists with employers We also strengthened our go to market strategy as our new Chief Revenue Officer  Arie Kanofsky added top notch sales leadership to his team during the fourth quarter  While at the same time  standing up new Dice commercial sales teams in Denver and New York  These investments in further strengthening our product offering and our go to market strategy position us well to generate sustained long term revenue growth in the future Now let me elaborate on some of the things we accomplished this past quarter and year  Let s start with the progress we made in our product offering  We closed out the year having delivered over 20 marquee product releases and dozens of minor releases in 2019  the taste of our product development is increasing in 2020 as a result of our investments in adding additional engineering talent  as well as the transformation of the engineering team to a domain driven engineering model For Dice  in the fourth quarter we delivered multi location search and completed an update of its application management workflow  During the quarter we also completed the transition of all Dice clients to talent search 4 0  completing a customer migration that started in 2018  The complete makeover of the Dice client experience over the past year  including IntelliSearch  Candidate Match  pay per view pricing  job management  job search  job alerts and now  multi location search are delivering improved Dice engagement metrics for both clients and candidates Our eFinancialCareers marketplace capabilities continue to grow with thousands of messages sent between candidates employers on our new messaging platform in the fourth quarter  Our eFinancialCareers messaging service allows recruiters and candidates to chat in real time on the platform  During the quarter  we also launched an upgraded candidate profile on EFC with new fields for candidates to share career experience and goal information These added features give candidates the ability to build their personal brand and gain trust on our platform  These features highlight the transition we are making from being a simple job board to becoming a dynamic marketplace for matching technologists and employers Clearancejobs continues to take the lead in driving new important capabilities  In the fourth quarter  Clearancejobs delivered new dashboards for both employers and candidates that provide insight into their profile performance  network reach and IntelliSearch based recommendations to improve their connections As I ve stated in the past  Clearancejobs is our most robust product offering from both a user experience and feature perspective and it has generated solid double digit revenue growth for many quarters  As such  we are taking the industry leading product features from Clearancejobs and implementing them in Dice and eFinancialCareers platforms  By creating more value for clients and candidates  we are building the foundation from which we can begin to accelerate revenue growth across all our brands Looking ahead  we have a clear product roadmap in front of us for each of our platforms  We are working now to add recruiter profile and messaging to Dice and IntelliSearch and Candidate Match to eFinancialCareers  We expect those features to be live in the first half of this year  Clearancejobs has a number of features planned for 2020 to advance the Cleared Network with a focus on further automating recruiter workflow  We expect to launch favorites in the first quarter  This feature will allow clients to keep tabs on top candidate prospects receive alerts when they are active  engage when they are receptive to contact Now let s talk about the significant progress we made this year in improving our go to market strategy  In 2019  we tested the concept of selling to customers who have their own internal recruiting programs through a new Dice commercial accounts team  We were extremely pleased with results and announced on our last earnings call that we would be significantly expanding this team We also announced the hiring of a new Chief Revenue Officer to drive this go to market expansion  Arie Kanofsky joined DHI on October 23rd with demonstrated experience scaling high performance sales teams and a strong background in selling software products within the recruitment industry  While Arie has only been here a little over three months  he has already made a significant impact by adding top notch sales leadership to his team and standing up new sales teams in two new geographies Based on studies conducted with Burning Glass  we believe that there are tens of thousands of specific commercial targets for our product across tech and non tech companies  We believe this market research demonstrates a significant growth opportunity for DHI With this in mind  we added several new salespeople to our commercial accounts team in the fourth quarter  roughly tripling the size of this team  This new sales team will ramp over the course of 2020 and we are excited to see the results of their efforts We believe we have a better tool than our competitors for companies that are hiring technologists and are confident that with our improved product offering and go to market strategy  we can grow our revenue at or above the market growth rate  Market research shows that the online recruiting industry is projected to grow 7  annually from 2018 to 2024  And the tech professional subset is forecast to grow at a faster rate of approximately 12  annually  While this growth won t happen overnight  we are confident in our plan and continue to make significant progress One of the things that gives us confidence looking ahead is that  we continue to see our candidate registration and visible profile metrics improve as a result of our enhanced marketing programs  The heart of our value proposition is delivering high quality candidates to our clients  In the fourth quarter  our digital marketing channels drove significant growth in new candidate activity with year over year increases in candidate registrations  which have led to an increase in visible profiles  The growth in visible profiles is significant because it s the first time in years that this metric has shown growth highlighting the growing trust candidates have in our platform We are incredibly excited about the market opportunity in front of us  We believe the investments we had made in 2019 and will continue to make in 2020 are positioning DHI for long term revenue growth as the industry leader Last  but certainly not least  I m pleased to introduce our new CFO  Kevin Bostick  Kevin joined us at the end of 2019  Kevin s demonstrated track record of leading companies through growth initiatives coupled with his strong history of delivering operational improvements will serve DHI well as we execute on our growth plan I also want to thank Luc Gregoire who served as our CFO since November  2016 for his immensely important financial leadership and overseeing the divestiture of our non tech brands and building out a strong Investor Relations program  Luc served as a steady partner for me when I joined the company and I thank him for his many contributions With that  let me turn the call over to Kevin who will take you through our financials and then we ll take any questions you may have  Kevin Kevin Bostick    Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Art  and good afternoon  everyone  Let me start by saying how excited I m to join the stellar management team at DHI  With our significant product innovation and improved go to market strategy  we are well positioned to address the large opportunity for growth ahead of us  I look forward to contributing to our success With that  let s jump right into the quarterly results  For the fourth quarter  we reported total revenues of  37 7 million which was up 1  from the third quarter and down 1  year over year when you exclude the impact of foreign exchange  Dice revenue was  23 3 million in the fourth quarter  up 1  sequentially and down 3  year over year  We ended the fourth quarter with a little over 6 000 Dice recruitment package customers  which is down 1  sequentially and 3  year over year  While this overall number is down  I want to point out that almost all of those lost customers had annual recurring revenue of  5 000 or less per customer By comparison  during the quarter  we saw gains in larger contract size customers with both staffing and recruitment clients  as well as commercial accounts  The growth in the number of large customers drove an increase in the average monthly revenue per recruitment package customer  which was up 1  year over year to  1 144 or approximately  13 700 on an annual basis  This is significant as over 90  of Dice revenue is recurring and comes from recruitment package customers Our customer renewal rate was 70  for the fourth quarter up 3 percentage points year over year  and our revenue renewal rate was 81  up 2 percentage points compared to the same period last year Fourth quarter revenue for eFinancialCareers was  7 8 million down 4  from the third quarter and 6  year over year  when excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates  Prices again negatively impacted our performance for eFinancialCareers where we saw a slowdown in recruiting volume across the United Kingdom and European financial industry  The ongoing protests in Hong Kong also slowed down our contracting there Clearancejobs fourth quarter revenue was  6 6 million  an increase of 5  sequentially and 16  year over year  This continued solid double digit revenue growth year over year  which we have seen for several years now is reflective of CJ s strong innovative products and competitive differentiation Turning to operating expenses  fourth quarter operating expenses were  33 3 million  representing a reduction of  2 3 million or 6  year over year  This was primarily driven by  2 1 million of consulting costs in the fourth quarter of 2018 associated with our cost savings project  The cost savings identified during that project are helping to fund the current ramp up of our sales and engineering capabilities As Art mentioned  we are seeing excellent early traction from the Dice commercial accounts team  In addition to our new CRO  we added several new sales reps to this team during the fourth quarter  As a result  this will drive increased sales expense in the coming quarters  We also additional engineering talent in the fourth quarter to accelerate the deployment of new product features  which will drive some increase in both product expense and capital expenditures in the coming quarters Tax expense for the fourth quarter was approximately  700 000 resulting in an effective tax rate of 16  for the fourth quarter  which includes the benefit from certain discrete tax items  Our full year tax    effective tax rate was 23  which was 2 percentage points lower than our expected rate of 25  Net income for the fourth quarter was  3 5 million or  0 07 per diluted share compared to net income of  2 9 million or  0 06 cents per diluted share a year ago  This quarter s earnings per share had a  0 01 benefit from discrete tax items  Last year s earnings had a  0 01 detriment from disposition related and other costs partially offset by discrete tax items  Excluding those items on a normalized basis  EPS for the quarter was  0 06 versus  0 07 last year Adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter was 23  up 1 percentage point from the same quarter last year  We generated  3 9 million of operating cash flow in the fourth quarter down  2 3 million from the prior year quarter driven by the timing of certain large vendor payments that occurred at the end of 2019 At the end of the quarter  our total debt was  10 million resulting in net debt of  4 6 million  Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was  51 6 million down 8  from a year ago as a result of more flexible billing practices introduced over the past two years  When we add the unbilled portion of our contracts to deferred revenue  our committed contract backlog at the end of the quarter was up 8  from the end of the fourth quarter last year  which was primarily driven by the timing of closing contracts As part of our share buyback program  we repurchased approximately 231 000 shares during the fourth quarter  This leaves roughly  5 million remaining of the current  7 million buyback program which runs through May 2020  We ll continue to opportunistically repurchase shares  but we ll also carefully evaluate our best use of cash and prioritize investing in our business  We continue to believe our buyback program is appropriate given our current valuation and is also can help offset the dilutive impact of stock based compensation Let s turn to our outlook for 2020  We expect the combined impact of both the new product features we are delivering and the investment in sales and marketing will drive improved performance and move revenue into positive year over year growth territory later this year for both DHI as a whole and the Dice brand For eFinancialCareers  while there may be some stability in Europe from the recent UK elections  we are being cautious and for the time being expect some geopolitical impact  For Clearancejobs  we expect continued strong growth going forward Looking specifically at the first quarter of 2020  we expect year over year performance of total revenue to be similar to the Q4 2019 year over year performance  We expect macroeconomic headwinds to continue to impact EFC in the first quarter and the added concern of the coronavirus has created more uncertainty  especially on our Hong Kong region Throughout 2020  we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to be 20  given our increased investment in engineering capacity and ramp up of our sales resources to accelerate revenue growth  We expect an increase to the current run rate of capital expenditures in the first quarter as a result of our investment in product and engineering head count  As a reminder  our capital expenditures are mostly made up of the capitalized portion of salaries of our development staff To recap  the substantial changes we have made over the past year have helped stabilize our total revenues  And with our ongoing investments in innovation and sales we are building a stronger foundation upon which to grow  We are confident that our plan is putting us in a position to begin generating long term revenue growth later this year  We remain focused on the continued execution of our business plan and look forward to reporting on our progress throughout the rest of 2020 And with that  let me turn the call back to Art Art Zeile    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Kevin  I d like to close by once again thanking our employees around the globe for their hard work this last quarter  It is a pleasure to be part of such a great team With that  we re happy to take your questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  We ll now begin the question and answer session  Operator Instructions   And the first question will come from Kara Anderson with B  Riley FBR  Please go ahead Kara Anderson    B  Riley FBR    AnalystSure  Hi  good afternoon or evening for you guys  I just wanted to start by asking on the outlook  So if I sort of look at your top line performance in the fourth quarter and then think about the first and second quarters of this year versus your expectations for growth and not really until the back half  Why really the implied deceleration from 4Q  was it all EFC or is there anything else to call out there Art Zeile    President and Chief Executive OfficerI would say that EFC presents the biggest headwind and challenge for us right now Kara  And specifically  as I explained in the past  we viewed EFC s APAC region to be a significant engine for growth at the beginning of 2019 that decelerated quite a bit as the year went forward and they experienced the protests and now the coronavirus But I d say  it s fair to say that our biggest headwind is with EFC and the APAC region  As everybody is well aware  there s also still a concern about what happens next with Brexit  but I d say that  we ve seen a good amount of bookings activity in the back half of December  even post the Tory s successful election there  So we feel more confident about that particular region Kara Anderson    B  Riley FBR    AnalystI guess if I could just follow up on that  Are you expecting any kind of change then from Dice  from the fourth quarter into the first half of the year Art Zeile    President and Chief Executive OfficerWe re not forecasting any specific up tick in Dices performance per se in this first quarter  We looked at this as a quarter where we ve tripled the size of the commercial accounts team starting at the beginning of the quarter  but they re still on a ramp to essentially become effective in attaining the right kind of performance to their quota plan  So again  I d say there was no major change expected for Dice Kara Anderson    B  Riley FBR    AnalystYou kind of led me right into my next question  I just wanted you to go over the size of the commercial team  how that s tracking versus your initial expectation  Maybe my recollection is off  but seems like maybe you re growing more than you were anticipating  Maybe if you could just go over that for me  that d be helpful Art Zeile    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  And from a historical perspective that might be useful to take a look at 2019  We initiated this team in February and we effectively went through a couple of changes of leadership over the course of the year  And we also were more segmented where now we have a commercial accounts team that focuses on new business  gaining new customer relationships where    and one that effectively focuses on renewal  So  we put the expansion of that team on hold in the third quarter as we are looking for a Chief Revenue Officer  I m a big believer that the new Chief Revenue Officer has the right to format the team  the way that he believes it should be formatted and for the future health of the organization And so  Arie Kanofsky came on board in October  so roughly at the beginning of the fourth quarter  he affirmed the strategy of expanding that team  We focused on the new business component of that team  roughly tripling it to around  I d say  20 individual performers  And so  that s again  only one part of the team because the team also consists of folks that focus on renewing existing relationships and then also part of the team that focuses on client success  but it s the part of the team that has the long term revenue impact  They re effectively looking at this Burning Glass list of targets  looking at those particular customers that have the largest need  They have the largest number of open tech job postings and then approaching them saying that we have the right solution to find those individual technologists And so again  we would expect that that team over the course of 2020 as they re ramping their training  as they re ramping their effectiveness  that they return Dice to a growth posture Kara Anderson    B  Riley FBR    AnalystWhat is the typical ramp up period  I guess in one or maybe years forward Art Zeile    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  we look at it as three to four quarters  That s the general timeframe Kara Anderson    B  Riley FBR    AnalystOkay  And then the last question for me and I ll let someone else take some questions  On Clearancejobs  I think last year you were piloting about six government agencies  If I recall correctly  how are those going  And then if they re going well  are you close to any sort of contracts Art Zeile    President and Chief Executive OfficerI would say that we actually exceeded expectations for that pilot program where we have over a dozen pilots  As you probably know the government can t establish a contract when it was in continuing resolution  which luckily is no longer the case  We have a military and governmental budget  And so now we are engaging this first quarter and hope to have those pilots become long term contracts The contract cycle  the sales cycle and the administrative logistics to get to a signed contract are obviously a little bit more lengthy when you deal with government agencies  But we think that it s fair to say that it s going to happen in the first or second quarter of this year  that you re going to start to see those pilots convert Kara Anderson    B  Riley FBR    AnalystGot it  Thank you very much Art Zeile    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you very much  Kara  I really appreciate it  Thanks for your questions as always Operator Operator Instructions  The next question comes from Josh Vogel with Sidoti  Please go ahead Josh Vogel    Sidoti and Company    AnalystThank you  Hi  Art and Kevin  Good afternoon  I guess my first question is  taking into account the investments in the sales team and product engineers and I guess given the generally tight labor market  I was curious if you are having a tough time finding the right personnel  notably when we think about engineers and maybe on a bit of a tangent  what are you doing to retain your top talent Art Zeile    President and Chief Executive OfficerGreat questions  I can answer both those questions  I ll tell you that in the summer of 2019  our CTO  Paul Farnsworth put together a very thoughtful plan that would staff up teams based on domain expertise  And that s what we call domain driven engineering And so  each one of these subject matter teams has a requisite set of positions  They range from the tech lead to QA to senior and junior developers to a scrum master  There is a product manager that is always focused on effectively putting together the requirements that are being used by that team  So it s a big effort We started in August and I d say that we are two thirds of the ways staffed for that expansion of our engineering efforts  And our HR team has done a wonderful job  Our VP of Talent and Recruiting is Jodi Addison and she made this her highest priority for the second half of 2019  And again  I look at it as a huge win that we re about two thirds of the way through our hiring plan Now  we do a lot to retain our talent  obviously  in today s environment that is a key to success for any organization when the unemployment rate for the entire United States is at an all time low and effectively for the technology world  it s practically zero  So I think it comes down to having the right kind of culture  the right kind of mission  celebrating successes  All of those things are additive to making an environment that people want to grow their career in In fact  another part of it is truly growing career  we had over a 100 people that were promoted internally last year in a team of roughly 550  And I think people take notice and understand that there are real great opportunities here at DHI and we make those available to them  So thanks for the question Josh  because it s super important for the way that our team dynamic works Josh Vogel    Sidoti and Company    AnalystYes  And thank you for the insights on that  Looking at the guidance  the adjusted EBITDA guidance and thinking about the expected costs tied to these increased investments  maybe this is more for Kevin  If you could just give us maybe a timeline of how this should play out as the year progresses  I mean  can we assume this is more first half driven and could we see a meaningful margin expansion back to that 20  to 23  range  we ve seen as of late  especially as years    year over year revenue turns positive Art Zeile    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  And as we stated  we are making the investment in engineering resources and in sales  When you think about the nature of our business  which is effectively a recurring revenue business  the additions every month of new business are additive  but they really start having  a bigger impact as you have multiple months of growth  And so  we do expect us to start returning to some of the previous EBITDA margins as we exit the year  It might be tough to say an exact quarter by quarter analysis  but yes  we will start to see us trending toward those numbers toward the end of 2020 Josh Vogel    Sidoti and Company    AnalystOkay  great  And shifting gears a little bit  you had a comment about the number of subscribers were down year over year and sequentially  but all those    that we re no longer clients  they were    I think you said had about 5 000 annual revenue  I m just curious how many of the 6 000 clients are at that 5 000 threshold Art Zeile    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo let me take a crack at explaining how we look at our customer set and segment it  and then I ll hand it over to Kevin for the exact answer to that question So big picture wise  we understand that different size customers act differently in terms of their churn characteristics  And we segment customers  5 000 from less per year  15 000 to  5 000   30 000 to  15 000  Phonetic  and  30 000 and above  And we feel like those stratifications of our customer set really do have different behaviors and different performance  especially when it comes to churn We know that the  5 000 and under maybe trialing the use of the Dice platform and have only a certain set of needs and they go away  because those ones are satisfied and they don t need technologists the next year or the next period  We also know that  for example  in the staffing recruiting world  if we find a customer that is taking a  5 000 or less package they are probably a really small shop  We re talking about one or two recruiters and those customers are less stable to begin with and they might run into business problems  And that s the reason why the churn becomes evident for that particular strata But again  the way that I look at this is that  it s healthy for us to see larger customers stay with us  It s healthier for us to engage with larger customers to begin with in the sales process  And I think that we re seeing that bear out by virtue or even just looking at the numerical average revenue per customer per month or per year I will hand it over for additional comments from Kevin Kevin Bostick    Chief Financial OfficerSorry  Yeah  Josh  I ll need to get you that exact number  I don t have that in front of me  but I will get that for you Josh Vogel    Sidoti and Company    AnalystOkay  no worries  Art  you had commentary about candidate registrations and just other visible metrics that have been improving  I m just curious  what are you doing to drive candidate acquisition  anything new or different that you weren t doing a year ago or any planned initiatives for 2020 Art Zeile    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo for the purpose of our value proposition bringing new candidates to our site is incredibly important  I would say that it is the domain of both product and marketing  but a lot of our marketing effort is really focused on that  And we have seen a watershed and improvement in all of our marketing channels under the leadership of Michelle Marian  our Chief Marketing Officer There are multitude of ways that we engage with candidates  One of those ways is that  we have paid media  paid advertising on places like Facebook  which is pretty typical for a lot of different companies  But we also use affiliate networks  We also have search engine optimization  email campaigns  a number of different channels I would say the one channel that is really showing market improvement at the end of 2019 and moving into 2020 is what we call a CRM or our email marketing channel led by a gentleman named Tim Zee  And he has done a remarkable number of campaigns to test engagement with candidates and we ve seen several of those campaigns become very successful  I think that s going to be a breakout channel for us in 2020 Josh Vogel    Sidoti and Company    AnalystAll right  Thank you  I ll hop back in the queue Art Zeile    President and Chief Executive OfficerAbsolutely  Well  thank you very much for the questions  Josh  Nice talking to you OperatorLadies and gentlemen  this concludes our

An S P index of U S  homebuilders was down 4 6 percent at 3 39 p m  in New York  its largest loss in almost a month  While wages are beginning to rise  home prices have been surging for years as buyers compete for a shrinking inventory of listings 
 At some point the combined cost of higher home prices and higher rates will begin to limit what home shoppers can afford to spend   Zillow Senior Economist Aaron Terrazas said in a statement about the Fed s decision 
 Deteriorating affordability may lead some buyers to lower their overall buying budget  increasing demand    and prices    for the types of less expensive homes that are already highly sought after   Terrazas wrote 
Concern over interest rates and a potential housing downturn is spreading  a survey by Zelman   Associates finds 
The market still has plenty going for it  with a crowd of millennials entering prime homebuying age 
 People are worried about affordability in general  with rising prices  and now you add in higher mortgage rates   Morningstar Inc  analyst Brian Bernard said in a phone interview   But as long as we have a good economy  I think it s OK  
Bernard said homebuilders such as DR Horton Inc  NYSE DHI   are offering houses with millennial friendly prices that will help keep business strong even if rates continue to rise at a moderate pace ",2018-06-13,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/rising-rates-put-us-homebuilders--and-investors--in-a-spot-1491965,1491965

Low Mortgage Rates Stimulate New Home Sales  4 PicksThe struggling housing market is steadily gaining footing  thanks to historically low mortgage rates  After upbeat builder sentiment along with soaring housing starts and existing home sales August data  the latest new home sales data for the month echoes the same sentiment On Sep 25  the Commerce Department stated that sales of newly constructed single family homes for August  accounting approximately 11 5  of total U S  home sales  grew 7 1  from July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 713 000 units   the second highest level this year  Notably  August sales beat the consensus forecast of 659 000 by 8 2   and grew 18  from the year ago period Declining mortgage rates  moderating home prices  rising wages and the Federal Reserve s dovish stance are reinforcing the U S  housing market Post the release of upbeat data  the Invesco Dynamic Building   Construction ETF and iShares U S  Home Construction ETF gained 1 2  each  while the SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB  ETF increased 1   Shares of notable homebuilders such as Hovnanian Enterprises  Beazer Homes USA  KB Homes and Toll Brothers rallied 19 5   4 2   3

Northeast tumbled 3  and 5 9   respectively  from the July figure Again  the supply of new homes dropped 1 2  from the prior month to 326 000  Nonetheless  housing inventory increased 2 5  from a year ago  It would take just 5 5 months to deplete the current supply of homes  down from 5 9 months in July 2019 and 6 3 months in August 2018 Homebuilders to Counter ChallengesThe housing industry is highly sensitive to interest mortgage rates fluctuations  Per the recent Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey  30 year fixed mortgage rate dropped 120 basis points over a year to an average rate of 3 73  The latest housing statistics   housing starts and building permits   rose an impressive 12 3  and 7 7  in August from July  respectively  the highest level since mid 2007  Moreover  existing home sales jumped to a 17 month high in the same month Although the housing space is caught in the year long trade tussle between the United States and China and is facing shortage of land and skilled labor  August s data has been quite a breather  Additionally  the Federal Reserve s interest rate cut last week for the second time this year to mitigate an economic slowdown is fueling a trend of mortgage refinancing and thereby lending support to household spending 4 Top Housing PicksRebounding home sales data clearly shows that an increasing number of buyers are expressing interest in

179837,401353,DHI,Is D R  Horton  DHI  A Profitable Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put D R  Horton  Inc    NYSE DHI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  D R  Horton has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 76  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 54  If we focus on the long term PE trend  D R  Horton s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 13 6 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  Moreover  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Construction Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 16 69  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that D R  Horton has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 11 84  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  D R  Horton has a P S ratio of about 1 08  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 27 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  D R  Horton currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes D R  Horton a solid choice for value investors For example  the PEG ratio for D R  Horton is just 1 08  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 28  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  DHI is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though D R  Horton might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and Momentum Score of A  This gives DHI a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current year has seen 15 upward revision in the past sixty days compared to no downward revision  while the full year 2020 estimate has seen 14 upward revision compared to two downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current year consensus estimate rose 7 2  in the past two months  whereas the full year 2020 estimate increased 5 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below D R  Horton  Inc  Price and Consensus   Notably  the stock with a long term EPS growth rate of 11  and favorable estimate trends has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which is why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineD R  Horton is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  the Zacks Rank  2 company flaunts a robust industry rank  among the top 12    which indicates that the broader factors are favorable for the company So  value investors might want to delve deeper in this stock as it appears to be a compelling pick 5 Stocks Set to DoubleZacks experts released their picks to gain  100  or more in 2020  One is a famous cutting edge food company that is  hiding in plain sight   Swamped with competitors and ignored by Wall Street  its stock price floundered  Now  suddenly  it acquired a

179939,401455,DHI,U S  home sales near 10 year high as mortgage rates rise,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  home resales unexpectedly rose in November  reaching their highest level in nearly 10 years  likely as buyers rushed into the market to lock in mortgage rates in anticipation of further increases in borrowing costs  The third straight monthly increase in existing home sales  reported by the National Association of Realtors on Wednesday  suggested housing would contribute to economic growth in the fourth quarter after being a drag in the previous two quarters   The strength in home sales  if it holds  will provide a big boost for consumer spending in 2017 and makes us more confident about our outlook for stronger growth next year   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York  Existing home sales increased 0 7 percent to an annual rate of 5 61 million units last month  the highest sales pace since February 2007  October s sales pace was revised down to 5 57 million units from the previously reported 5 60 million units  Economists had forecast sales slipping 1 0 percent toa 5 50 million unit pace in November  Sales were up 15 4 percent from a year ago  They rose in the Northeast and South  but fell in the Midwest and West last month  Mortgage rates have surged in the wake of Donald Trump s victory in the Nov  8 presidential election  Trump s proposal to increase infrastructure spending and slash taxes is seen as inflationary   Since the election  the interest rate on a fixed 30 year mortgage has increased about 60 basis points to an average 4 16 percent  the highest level since October 2014  according to data from mortgage finance firm Freddie Mac  Mortgage rates are expected to rise further after the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last week by 25 basis points to a range of 0 50 percent to 0 75 percent  The U S  central bank forecast three rate hikes next year  The prospect of higher mortgage rates could be pushing undecided buyers into the market  But the combination of higher borrowing costs and rising house prices  which are outstripping wage growth  could hurt home sales   House prices have been marching ahead amid a chronic shortage of properties for sale  The median house price was  234 900 last month  a 6 8 percent increase from a year ago   Economists  however  expect higher mortgage rates to have a minimal impact on home sales as the labor market nears full employment and the economy strengthens   AT A CROSSROADS   This is a housing market at a crossroads   said Stephen Phillips  president of Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  Home Services in California    The higher mortgage rates we ve seen since the election will likely slow activity and price increases  but faster income growth might more than offset that trend as we look toward next year s spring market   A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a home increased 3 percent last week from the previous week  The dollar  DXY  was trading lower against a basket of currencies after the data  while prices for U S  government bonds rose  U S  stocks were slightly weaker  with the Dow Jones industrial average  DJI  still hovering near the 20 000 mark  The PHLX housing index  HGX  rose 0 30 percent as shares in the nation s largest homebuilder  D R  Horton Inc  N DHI   gained 0 32 percent  Last month s increase in home resales means more brokers  commissions  which are included in the residential component of the gross domestic product report   The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP rising at a 2 6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter  The economy grew at a 3 2 percent pace in the July September period   Existing home sales remain constrained by a persistent shortage of properties available for sale  Last month  the number of unsold homes on the market fell 8 0 percent from October to 1 85 million units   Supply was down 9 3 percent from a year ago and has now declined for 18 straight months on a year on year basis  At November s sales pace  it would take 4 0 months to clear the stock of houses on the market  down from 4 3 months inOctober  A six month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand   Housing inventory could remain an obstacle  with a report last week showing a plunge in home construction in November  With supply tightening  house prices notched their 57th consecutive month of year on year gains in November   Rising house prices are increasing equity for homeowners and encouraging some to put their homes on the market  but making it more difficult for first time buyers to purchase homes

179952,401468,DHI,What To Expect From RPM International s  RPM  Q2 Earnings,opinion,RPM International Inc    NYSE RPM   is scheduled to report second quarter fiscal 2019 results on Jan 4 In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 39 5   In fact  RPM International missed the consensus mark in two of the trailing four quarters  with average negative earnings surprise of 13 2  How are Estimates Faring Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is currently pegged at 66 cents  remaining unchanged over the past 30 days  This reflects a decrease of 5 7  from the year ago earnings of 70 cents per share  Revenues are expected to be  1 4 billion  up 6 1  year over year Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement RPM International Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Key FactorsRising raw material costs have been marring the company s bottom line over the past few quarters  thereby creating pressure on gross margins  Particularly  cost of silicones  asphalt  epoxy and acrylic resins is increasing significantly  Gross margin in the fiscal first quarter decreased 190 basis points year over year  Resultantly  the company s earnings decreased 39 5  in the last reported quarter to 52 cents  Also  unfavorable foreign exchange  one time legal costs and additional charges related to 2020 Margin Acceleration Plan added to the woes RPM International anticipates these trends to persist in the fiscal second quarter as well That said  the company has been aggressively pursuing price increases to offset the increasing material prices and protect its gross profit margins  The company anticipates an improvement between its raw material costs and pricing   product mix  starting from the fiscal second quarter Meanwhile  RPM International s cost saving initiatives bode well for its bottom line performance  The company has been undertaking various initiatives to reduce expenses  The initiatives include plant consolidation plans primarily at Rust Oleum  merging IT system  centralizing more of its back office functions and rationalizing its manufacturing footprint  The company is expected to benefit from strategic acquisitions Segment wise  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Industrial segment revenues  accounting for more than 50  of its total revenues  is pegged at  732 million  indicating a rise from  703 million recorded in the year ago quarter but decline from  782 million in the last reported quarter  The segment is expected to gain from robust construction activity  stable international environment outside Brazil and the North American waterproofing business The consensus estimate for Specialty segment s revenues is pegged at  205 million  reflecting a year over year improvement of 4 1  and sequential growth of 6 2  Meanwhile  the company s Consumer segment revenues are estimated to reach  449 million  reflecting an increase from  415 million in the year ago quarter  while declining from  485 million in the last reported quarter  Improved product line  market share gains  higher advertising campaign for new product placements and the recent purchase of Miracle Sealants are expected to drive growth What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not suggest that RPM International is likely to beat estimates in the quarter to be reported  That is because a stock needs to have a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here  as you will see below Earnings ESP  The Earnings ESP for the company is 0 00  as the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at 66 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  RPM International currently has a Zacks Rank  2  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell

179953,401469,DHI,What To Expect From Acuity Brands   AYI  Earnings In Q1,opinion,Acuity Brands  Inc    NYSE AYI   is slated to announce first quarter fiscal 2019 results on Jan 9  before the opening bell The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1 9  in the last reported quarter  However  the company reported negative earnings surprise in two of the trailing four quarters  with average miss of 1 86  How are Estimates Faring Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is currently pegged at  2 16  trending downward over the past seven days  Nonetheless  this reflects an increase of 11 3  from the year ago earnings of  1 94 per share  Revenues are expected to be  931 7 million  up 10 6  year over year Acuity Brands Inc Price and EPS Surprise   Let s See How Things are Shaping Up for This Announcement Acuity Brands is poised to benefit from its diversified portfolio of innovative lighting control solutions and energy efficient luminaries  In fiscal 2018  Acuity Brands introduced almost 100 new product families to its industry leading portfolio  thereby gaining market share in product categories and sales channels  Sales volume in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 grew approximately 13  year over year  backed by continued efforts to expand customer base  along with the introduction of new products and solutions Notably  Acuity Brands is expanding its geographic borders and product portfolio through acquisitions and joint ventures  In fiscal 2018  the company spent  163 million on acquisitions  namely Lucid Design Group and IOTA Engineering  Its buyout of IOTA  the industry leader in emergency lighting and power equipment for commercial and institutional applications  will enhance market leadership in this lighting category  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  it offloaded the Spanish lighting business  Carandini  in view of the challenging lighting market In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  shipments of lighting fixtures in the United States were flat to slightly down from the year ago period  In fact  the company remains cautiously optimistic for fiscal 2019  Per third party forecasts and leading indicators  the North American lighting market is likely to increase in low single digits in fiscal 2019 Acuity Brands has been facing issues that led to lower gross margins  In fact  its adjusted gross profit margin in the last reported quarter declined 350 basis points  bps  from the prior year period  This was primarily due to unfavorable price mix as well as higher input costs for certain items  particularly steel and oil based components  Particularly  price mix reduced its adjusted gross profit margin by 280 bps in the quarter  This trend is likely to continue in the to be reported quarter as well  Nonetheless  Acuity Brands expects

179992,401508,DHI,A Wobbly Edifice As Builders Break Down And Data Weaken ,opinion,"I saw a flicker of hope for home builders in the May Housing Market Review  Traders decided to snuff that flicker out very quickly afterward  When I wrote June s housing market review and described a  struggling flicker   the iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  was once again bouncing off the bottom of 2018 s trading range  That last rally hit a wall at the 200 day moving average  DMA   With ITB once again trying to bounce off the 2018 low  the trading range looks intact but signs are growing of an underlying bias to a breakdown 

The iShares US Home Construction ETF  ITB  continues to bounce along the 2018 lows as its 200DMA slowly transitions from pivot to resistance in the middle of a trading range 
The chart shows the deeply negative reactions to the latest round of collective housing data  Prior to July  the reaction to the earnings report of home builders held larger sway on ITB  This time around  the economic data took on at least as much significance as the earnings data  Moreover  the reaction to earnings was surprisingly and sharply divergent 
On the positive side  DR Horton Inc  NYSE DHI  overcame the recent sharp sell off in home builder stocks to soar 11 6  in the wake of its latest earnings report  Only 200DMA resistance slowed down the follow up buying  
Earnings for D R  Horton  DHI  saved it from a major breakdown to a fresh 10 month low  Can the stock next overcome 200DMA resistance 
PulteGroup Inc  NYSE PHM  initially sold off to a new 10 month low  Perhaps aided by the strong rally in DHI  PHM recovered sharply  However  sellers returned on Friday and closed the stock just above the lows for 2018  PHM has been a particular disappointment since a promising breakout in June and then the last rally which seemed to recover the rising 200DMA pivot  
Pulte Home  PHM  is precariously close to a major  and very bearish  breakdown to new multi month lows 
The earnings for Meritage Homes  MTH  got a reception similar to PHM s earnings  The follow up selling on Friday was much milder  increasing the odds ever so slightly that MTH may find a bottom with its latest earnings report 
 
Meritage Homes  MTH  broke down below its trading range only to get  saved  by its earnings report 
TRI Pointe Group  Inc   TPH  got the worst reception of all for home builder earnings last week  TPH plunged 7 7  on extremely high volume  including the high volume selling that preceded earnings  The stock confirmed a bearish breakdown from 200DMA support  TPH now sits near an 11 month low and is close to reversing all its gains from the October breakout 
 
Sellers slammed TRI Pointe Group  TPH  into a bearish confirmation of a major 50 200DMA breakdown and resistance 
Two major builders had important breakdowns last week without requiring a special kick from earnings  KB Home  KBH  and Toll Brothers  TOL   Both stocks confirmed on going downtrends for 2018  
KB Home  KBH  suffered a major and bearish breakdown last week  KBH closed near a 10 month low which aligns with the pop the stock got from October earnings 

Toll Brothers  TOL  has become one of the worst relative performers in the home builder group  Its breakdown took the stock to a 16 month low  It closed at a 15 month low  The big October  2017 breakout is a distant memory 
Even performance leader LGI Homes  LGIH  trades at a near 10 month low  Investors are clearly closing calibrating their selling across the sector with so many stocks around 9 to 11 month lows  From the technical perspectives of the components  ITB looks like an index doomed to set lower lows in due time  Along with this bearish trading action  the market continues to express its disbelief in any good news from home builders and continues to anticipate a bearish turn in the housing market data  Collectively  July s housing market data may have delivered the first definitive signs of that turn 
While housing starts surged in May and left no doubt that home builders were confident as ever  the subsequent plunge in housing starts in June appear to temper that enthusiastic interpretation 
Single family housing starts for June were revised upward from 936 000 to 944 000  a third straight month of significant upward revisions  Still  June starts plunged month over month by 9 1  to 858 000  the lowest level of the year  On an annual basis  single family housing starts were practically flat at a  0 2  change  This drop is the first year over year decline since a 2 0  decline in August  2016 
 
Suddenly  it looks like time is running out for housing starts to surpass 2017 s peak by year end

Over the 8 months prior to May  regional year over year changes in starts exhibited wide dispersion  For May  housing starts were very strong across the board  For June  the Midwest stood out as a large loser  The Northeast  Midwest  South  and West each changed 6 3    17 0   3 1   and 1 4   In other words  the headline slowdown in starts was largely driven by the particularly poor performance of the Midwest region 
Existing Home Sales   June  2018 A third straight month over month decline and a fourth straight month of year over year declines in sales for existing homes helped further dampen the mood for the stocks of home builders even though limited inventories continue to be the dominant story constraining existing home sales 
The February existing sales numbers ended a 2 month sales decline and softened a bit my alarm bells  In March  monthly sales continued to increase  but the year over year change was a decrease  For April  both monthly and year over year changes were declines  May recorded similar declines and put existing home sales right back in  yellow  cautionary territory  June s double whammy of a third monthly decline coupled with a fourth year over year decline  puts existing home sales in  red  territory 
The seasonally adjusted annualized sales in June of 5 38M was down 0 4  month over month from 5 41M in sales for May  downwardly revised from 5 43M   Year over year sales decreased 2 2  and once again stayed consistent with the current trend of decelerating existing home sales 
 
Existing home sales dropped back to recent lows 
  As of the March  2018 data  the NAR further reduced historical data to just 13 months  For historical data from 1999 to 2014  click here  For historical data from 2014 to 2018  click here  Source for chart  National Association of Realtors  Existing Home Sales   EXHOSLUSM495S   retrieved from FRED  Federal Reserve Bank of St  Louis  July 28  2018 
The routine description for existing sales is usually sales decline because of a shortage of inventory and sales increase in spite of inventory shortages  The National Association of Realtors  NAR  pulled the inventory card yet again and emphasized that underlying demand is strong but high pricing tempered sales 

  There continues to be a mismatch since the spring between the growing level of homebuyer demand in most of the country in relation to the actual pace of home sales  which are declining The root cause is without a doubt the severe housing shortage that is not releasing its grip on the nation s housing market  What is for sale in most areas is going under contract very fast and in many cases  has multiple offers  This dynamic is keeping home price growth elevated  pricing out would be buyers and ultimately slowing sales 
Realtors  throughout the country continue to stress that there s considerable pent up demand for buying a home among the millennial households in their market Unfortunately  they re just not making meaningful ground  and continue to be held back by too few choices in their price range  

The NAR was so dour about the inventory situation in its report that it actually downplayed the first year over year increase in inventory since June  2015 when  as the NAR noted in its press conference  the  taper tantrum  sent bond rates soaring and scared away a lot of homebuyers  This  cross over  is something the NAR anticipated for late summer or fall  and a dynamic I suspected given persistent monthly increases in inventory   so the NAR should have been triumphant and optimistic  The NAR chose instead to reemphasize that current inventory levels are insufficient 
The press conference contrasted the absolute inventory negativity with the expected cautious optimism about inventory potentially bottoming  The NAR also put a laser focus on housing markets without affordability issues to point out the strong demand and sales in those places  So  the NAR took solace in seeing inventory increase in the super hot markets of Seattle and Denver 
The 1 95M existing homes for sale represents a year over year increase of 0 5  and ends 36 straight months of annual declines  Inventory increased from May to June by 4 3   a SIXTH straight monthly increase  Despite these gains  the supply crisis continues to run deep at 4 3 months of supply at the current sales rate  up from 4 2 a year ago and 4 1 in May  The key  of course  is whether a new trend is underway AND whether the absolute increase in inventory presages a demand slowdown  I will be particularly concerned if the price relief that SHOULD come with higher inventory does not help drive up sales levels 
The share of sales going to first time buyers stayed flat at 31   This share was 33  in April  30  in March  29  in February and November was 33   So while the NAR raises alarms about first time buyers   for example  in June s report   The abrupt hike in mortgage rates this spring  along with price appreciation and competition being the strongest in the entry level part of the market  is why first time buyers are not as active as they should be and their participation remains below its historical average    I think there is more noise than signal in these data  The share percentage is just bouncing around  Note that last September was the first time in two years where the share dropped below 30  
The average share for first time homebuyers for 2016 was 35   The NAR s 2017 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers reported an average of 34  for 2017  Investors purchased 13  of homes in June  down from 15  in May  Investor sales averaged a share of 15  in 2017 and 14  in 2016 
Existing home sales increased in just one region  Northeast  4 0   Midwest  3 1   South 0 4   West  5 0  year over year  As usual  regional sale fluctuations had no relationship to the on going price run ups  Last month s price decline in the Northeast looks like a true outlier  The West had a particularly extreme price gain relative to the sales drop  The year over year price changes were relatively robust  Northeast 3 3   Midwest 3 5   South 2 7   West 10 2  
June s 5 2  year over year increase in the overall median price of an existing home delivered the 76th consecutive month with a year over year increase  The median price of  276 900 is significantly higher than May s  264 800 and is a third straight new all time high 
Single family sales declined 0 6  on a monthly basis and decreased on a yearly basis by 2 3   The median price of  279 300 was up 5 2  year over year 

In February  new home sales barely eked forward  New home sales were resurgent in March  April sales did not keep pace on a monthly basis but delivered a strong year over year performance  In a stark contrast to existing home sales  new home sales in May surged on a monthly and year over year basis  For June  new home sales contrasted existing home sales with another year over year increase  The monthly decline is not a surprise given May s surge  Still  new home sales made a new low for the year 
The Census Bureau revised May sales of new single family homes downward from 689 000 to 666 000  a third straight month with a sizable downward revision  New home sales for June decreased 5 3  month over month and increased 2 4  year over year to 631 000  Year over year gains regularly hit double digits since 2012  last November s 26 6  jump was the highest since February  2015 when new home sales soared 29 8  year over year  May broke a string of four months of single digit gains which represented a concerning deceleration in new home sales  That deceleration continued with June s numbers 
 
New home sales have essentially flat lined in 2018 
j Source  US  Bureau of the Census  New One Family Houses Sold  United States  HSN1F   retrieved from FRED  Federal Reserve Bank of St  Louis  July 28  2018 
In December  the inventory of new homes dropped to 5 2 months of supply  A market for homes is in balance at 6 months of supply  February s inventory stood at 5 9 months  It proceeded to decline as low as 5 2 in May  For June  inventory jumped back to 5 7 days of sales 
May s median price of  313 000 was an actual year over year decline  The average price also declined 2 6  year over year  June delivered a second straight set of declines  The median price declined 4 2  year over year  and the average price declined 2 0  year over year  These declines are a curious contradiction to the relentless price increases for existing homes 
On a regional basis  new home sales exhibited extreme divergence with the Northeast and May on polar opposites of the scale  After a string of very strong gains since August  the very volatile Northeast finally ran out of gas in January with a 44 2  year over year plunge  For May  the Northeast dropped by 16 3  and bounced right back in June with a 20 9  gain  The Midwest ended two straight months of very strong gains with a more modest 7 6  increase in June  The South gained 8 1  year over year  The West cooled off from January s blistering 33 2  year over year gain to gain 3 1  year over year for February  The West heated up again in March with a 24 7  jump  The West stayed hot in April with an 18 9  gain in sales  For May  the West cooled off by eking out a 0 6  gain and took a plunge in June with a 15 0  drop 
Home Builder Confidence  The Housing Market Index   July  2018
In the April housing market review  I explained why I would not have thought much of March s slight decline in the Housing Market Index  HMI   At 70  the HMI was still higher than it was for most of 2017  For July  the HMI stayed at 68 for the second straight month  The components of the HMI moved in each possible direction   The HMI index measuring current sales conditions remained unchanged at 74  Meanwhile  the component gauging expectations in the next six months dropped two points to 73 and the metric charting buyer traffic rose two points to 52   Together  these components still show a pattern of languishing in 2018 and increase the significance of the HMI s slip from 70 to 68 
The statement from the NAHB in May was very positive with a big caveat for rising prices  For June  the NAHB made an even bigger issue of lumber prices by shining a spotlight on trade actions that have driven those prices higher  For July  the NAHB chose not to single out any specific factor driving up the construction costs that    make it increasingly challenging to produce homes at competitive price points  especially for the entry level market where inventory is most needed  
 
Along with consumer sentiment  the components of the Housing Market Index  HMI  are just idling to languishing 

While the overall HMI stayed flat  the Midwest was the only region to remain flat as well  The Northeast fell 2 points  at 56 it is only two points above its low for 2018  The South managed to jump 2 points  The West fell 3 points to 73  a low for the year  Given the plunge in new and existing home sales in the West  the notable decline in confidence confirmed that something could be amiss again in the West  Prices are likely overdue for some kind of correction  but nome builders are not likely in a good position to sustain significant price drops given cost hikes which tend to be worst in the West 
Parting thoughts While the picture ever slowly deteriorates for the housing market and especially the home builder stocks  there is a curious mix of positives and negatives in other data sources 
The biggest cautionary tale comes from gross private domestic fixed residential investment which includes residential construction like new single family and multi family houses  manufactured housing  or mobile homes   While market headlines celebrated the 4 1  GDP growth in the second quarter  the underlying data provided indications that this strong growth will not last long  Most relevant for this post is the actual 1 1  DECLINE in private fixed residential investment in Q2  While this investment declined 1 0  in Q2 of 2017  Q2 of preceding years were strong and positive  Moreover  Q1 2018 delivered a 3 4  decline  A chart of the year over year changes makes the deceleration plain and clear 
 
Real domestic fixed residential investment has been on a decelerating trend since peak annual growth in 2012 and 2013  A drop through zero will raise major alarm bells given the pattern from the last two recessions

International investment in U S  real estate also delivered a big blow to the housing market data  According to the NAR   International sales in the U S  totaled  121 billion from April 2017 to March 2018  a 20 percent decline from a year ago   Moreover  the share of sales to foreign buyers and recent immigrants dropped from 10  to 8   For context  just 5 countries make up 49  of all sales to foreign buyers  China  Canada  India  Mexico  and the United Kingdom  Chinese nationals lead the way at a 6th straight year while buying the most expensive homes at a median price of  439 100  If existing trade war tensions remain high between the U S  and China  I expect Chinese nationals to pull back further on U S  real estate investments 
Perhaps U S  first time home buyers will pick up the slack  Freddie Mac reported earlier this month  First Time Buyers Finally on the Rise   The message from Freddie Mac runs a bit counter to the NAR s despair over existing home sales data for these buyers that seems to bounce all over the place without a definitive trend 

 According to Freddie Mac s first quarter mortgage data  first time buyers represented 46 percent of its purchased loans  the largest share in recent history and up from 42 percent a year ago  

Freddie Mac sees a large driver in the the swell of maturing millennials moving into household formation despite the existing headwinds 
This optimism matches Freddie Mac s overall bullishness on the housing market  In its July update on its 2018 outlook  Freddie Mac delivered the following unwavering forecast 

 The pace of existing home sales has been disappointing this year  as tight inventory conditions continue to suppress overall activity despite solid demand  Conversely  new home sales continue to rise  with homebuilders increasing production   albeit slowly  Our forecast for total home sales  new and existing  remains unchanged  We expect modest sales growth over the next two years  with 6 27 million sales in 2018 and 6 44 million in 2019  

Even with strengthening sales  Freddie Mac thinks annual price growth will actually slow from 6 7  this year to 4 8  next year 
Time will of course tell very soon whether this important juncture of the housing market will lead to new bearish lows or will somehow turn around enough in time for the seasonally strong period starting in November  I finished adding to my off season trades with the last Housing Market Review  I even took profits on my Redfin  RDFN  position as I suspect the stock will falter under the sheer weight of the declines in home builders stocks  The short side of my ITB calendar call spread expired worthless a week ago as I had hoped  Too bad the prospects for the long side of of the calendar spread are so poor 
Be careful out there

180007,401523,DHI,Should Value Investors Pick D R  Horton  Inc   DHI  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put D R  Horton  Inc    NYSE DHI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  D R  Horton  Inc  has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 19 9  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts D R  Horton  Inc  s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 14 7  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that D R  Horton  Inc  has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 2  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for D R  Horton  Inc  s stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  D R  Horton  Inc  has a P S ratio of about 1 0  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  D R  Horton  Inc  currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes DHI a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though D R  Horton  Inc  might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of A  This gives DHI a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen 12 estimates go higher in the past sixty days and three lower  while the full year estimate has seen 15 upward and two downward revisions in the same time period This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen about 1 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 2 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below D R  Horton  Inc  Price and Consensus    Even though D R  Horton  Inc  has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineD R  Horton  Inc  is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  top 5  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite positive estimate revision activity  investors should wait for industry trends to turn around first   When it does  this stock could be a compelling value pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock

Earnings estimates for the current and next year moved north in the past 60 days by 3 9  and 2 3   respectively  This signifies that analysts are optimistic of the company s future earnings growth  despite much apprehension about the impact of a rising interest rate scenario In the last reported quarter  D R  Horton delivered yet another solid performance  Earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  courtesy of a solid housing market scenario  Homebuilding revenues increased 16  year over year on a 15  rise in home closings in the quarter  New orders rose 13  in units as well as value  increasing across all the operating regions Gross and pre tax margins improved 100 basis points  bps  and 80 bps  respectively  in the quarter  The company reported earnings of 91 cents per share  higher than the year ago profit level of 60 cents  Meanwhile  the company s raised guidance on revenues  pre tax margin and cash flow from operations for the year is equally encouraging  Growth DriversWith accretive acquisitions  robust backlog and cost saving initiatives  D R  Horton is expected to perform well in fiscal 2018  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the current fiscal stands at  3 71 per share  which is expected to grow 35 4  year over year on 14 7  revenue growth Acquisitions have been an important growth driver for the company  The  558 million buyout of 75  shares of Forestar Group will help D R  Horton expand its operations in Texas  which is currently witnessing positive housing momentum  It is also expected to contribute around  1 billion in annual revenues over the next five years This homebuilder s quarter end sales order backlog  under contract  increased 8 4  to 15 841 homes  Backlog value increased 9  to  4 8 billion  Meanwhile  the company has plans to boost investments for replenishing its land and lot supply in 2018 to support revenue growth  The company expects its homebuilding operations to invest approximately  4 billion in lots  land and development in fiscal 2018  This will surely give a major boost to its top line Separately  management has been making consistent efforts to reduce both construction and selling  as well as general and administrative  SG A  expenses  It controls construction costs by designing homes efficiently  and also obtaining construction materials and labor at competitive prices  In the first six months of fiscal 2018  SG A expenses improved 30 bps year over year to 9 1  and are expected to be around 8 7  for fiscal 2018 Proficient cost management is expected to give a boost to the

the best way to maximize profits and returns  In the trailing 12 months  as of Mar 31  2018   D  R  Horton s homebuilding return on inventory was 17 6   depicting an improvement of 160 bps from 16  a year ago HeadwindsRising material and labor costs  as well as competitive pricing pressure are major causes of concern Moreover  recently  the Federal Reserve hiked funds rate for the second time this year by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1 75 2   Chances of two more rate hikes this year are also high  The rate hike was imminent  given stable economic scenario backed by low unemployment and solid wage growth  That said  the rise in interest rates comes at a time when home prices are increasing  owing to supply constraints and increased raw material costs Mortgage rates are surging in proportion to U S  government bond yields  in anticipation of higher rates of inflation and further monetary tightening by the Fed  Rising mortgage rates may dilute the demand for new homes Though myriad problems have been decelerating the homebuilding industry of late  the larger picture is convincingly strong  Consumer demand is robust  courtesy of an improving economy  modest wage growth

180049,401565,DHI,Easier mortgage rules  stable rates bring back U S  home buyers,news,"By Sagarika Jaisinghani  Reuters    Many U S  home buyers are returning to the market after almost a year as interest rates stabilize and regulators propose more relaxed rules on mortgage lending 
U S  homebuilders D R  Horton Inc and Toll Brothers Inc reported jumps in orders this week at rates not seen since last year 
 We re definitely seeing a lot more purchase business than we have in the past   said Matt Hackett  underwriting manager at Equity Now  a New York based mortgage lender 
Interest rates fell in October to their lowest since June 2013 after rising steadily for the past year  Although up slightly since  they are still at historic lows 
New rules proposed will allow Americans to buy homes with down payments as low as 3 percent 
 The buyers realize that they re never going to get this kind of low interest rate environment   said David Crowe  chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders 
Wayne Wellington  a 47 year old inspector at the Broward County housing authority in Florida  said he wanted to upgrade his current house for a larger property before rates spiked 
 Interest rates look like they re on the verge of moving up a little bit and I ve got to capitalize now on these wonderful rates   he told Reuters 
The improvement in buyer sentiment is bringing much needed relief to homebuilders  which reported an underwhelming spring selling season this year  Spring selling is to homebuilders what the holiday season is to retailers 
 First time home buyers are the ones missing from the marketplace  and  part of the reason we ve had a relatively slow recovery in housing  Some relaxation in the overly restrictive lending standards will bring the first time home buyer back   Crowe said 
The Dow Jones U S  home construction index rose about 4 percent this year to Monday s close  after doubling between January 2012 and January 2014 
Five of the largest U S  homebuilders   D R  Horton  Toll Brothers  Lennar Corp  PulteGroup Inc and KB Home   trade below their intrinsic values  according to StarMine

180065,401581,DHI,U S  new home sales fall  services sector activity cools a bit,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    Sales of new U S  single family homes fell for a second straight month in July  but a surge in the stock of properties on the market and a moderation in price increases should help to stimulate demand in the months ahead 
Other data on Monday showed activity in the vast services sectors slowed again in August  The reports  however  did little to change views the economy is on a strong growth path  against the backdrop of relatively strong job growth and manufacturing activity 
New home sales slipped 2 4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 412 000 units  the lowest level since March  the
Commerce Department said  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales at a 430 000 unit pace last month 
The weak new home sales pace is at odds with other data that have suggested the housing market recovery is back on track  New house sales data  however  is volatile month to month because of a small sample 
Data last week showed a jump in new home construction in July  Home resales also rose to a 10 month high in July 
Compared to July last year  new home sales increased 12 3 percent 
In a separate report  financial data firm Markit said its preliminary services Purchasing Managers Index dipped to 58 5 this month from 60 8 in July 
A reading above 50 signals expansion in the services sector  Despite the slight cooling in activity  businesses were upbeat about prospects in the year ahead 
That fits in with expectations of sturdy economic growth in the second half of 2014 and through early next year 
U S  financial markets shrugged off the weak data  The S P 500 vaulted to a record high  crossing the 2 000 threshold for the first time  The dollar was up against the euro

A run up in mortgage rates  as well as a shortage of homes on the market  weighed on housing in the second half of 2013 
But housing inventory is picking up and home price appreciation is slowing 
The inventory of new houses on the market increased 4 1 percent to 205 000 units  the highest since August 2010  With supply increasing  the median home price increased only 2 9 percent from a year ago 
At July s sales pace it would take 6 0 months to clear the supply of houses on the market  That was the highest since October 2011 and compared to 5 6 months in June 
Six months  supply is normally considered a healthy balance between supply and demand 

Last month  new home sales jumped 8 1 percent in the South  but fell in the Northeast  West and Midwest

180072,401588,DHI,The Real Estate Bubble Looks Eerily Like Early 2006,opinion,"We called the real estate bubble top in late 2005  just before it began to burst in early 2006  So did Jim Stack  a newsletter writer in Whitefish Montana 
Now Jim has a Housing Bubble Bellwether Barometer that s flashing a sell signal after going up 80  last year  All our alarms are going off as well 
The Confidence Indicator for the National Association of Home Builders Wells Fargo is at its highest reading in 18 years  higher than it was in early 2006 
The Case Shiller National Home Price Index is now higher than the peak in early 2006  and looks like a carbon copy of the last bubble 
All of this is to say  things are looking dangerous in the real estate market 
Look at this chart 

The chart measures home prices versus the CPI  Consumer Price Index   Robert Shiller proved that real estate prices correlate with inflation long term  In fact  Shiller was the only other forecaster  alongside us  who called the housing bubble last time 
In 2017  prices went up 7  while inflation went up 1 9  
This index is 34 3  above the CPI  almost exactly like the 35  premium in early 2006 
These two bubbles couldn t be more similar in time frame  overvaluation  and advances if they d be computer constructed  yet almost no one sees a problem here  When will people ever learn 
Mainstream economists and forecasters are bubble blind again 
The best sector of the S P 500 last year was  of course  homebuilders   up 74 8  
Starter home companies are doing the best as that s where the supply is tightest and the demand the strongest 
Yet  home builders have been leaning more towards the high end of the market and aging Baby Boomers for higher profits 
LGI Homes  NASDAQ LGIH   is a good example of a company that has nailed the low end markets  It was up a whopping 161  in 2017  The largest homebuilder  DR Horton Inc  NYSE DHI   was up 87   that could be a great short in the next few months  
But like I said  alarm bells are sounding 
There are two potential  pins  that could trigger a collapse in real estate 
The first is mortgage rates rising from around 4  towards 5  
The second is the fact that property taxes are no longer deductible  That hurts the bubbliest states like California  New York  and New Jersey 
My bubble model would suggest that home prices go back to their point of origin  at worst  or  most likely 85  of the way  That suggests a loss of 42  to 49   That s worse than the 34  crash from 2006 into 2012 
And my model says it should take as long to deflate as it took to build   or about six years or into around 2023  just like last time 
That s a long way away down 
We re finalizing a special real estate ebook at this very moment  It contains details of the countries and states most at risk in the bubble  and how much each stands to lose when this situation turns bad  We ll be sending details about this as soon as its ready  so watch out for that ",2018-01-24,Harry Dent,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-real-estate-bubble-looks-eerily-like-early-2006-200282903,200282903

 NEW YORK  Aug 26  Reuters    U S  stocks declined slightly
on Wednesday  as investors took a breather after a strong
rally earlier in the week  despite strong reports on new home
sales and durable goods 
 For the third consecutive day  equities briefly bounced
after favorable news  but the gains fizzled 
  I cannot say I m surprised if we do nothing much late in
August  when the trading volume is nothing  especially when
we ve run up as much as we have   said Linda Duessel  market
strategist at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh 
 The S P 500 is on track for its sixth straight monthly
rise  The benchmark index has gained about 52 percent from
12 year lows set in early March 
  We re at a crossroads   said Rob Stein  managing partner
at the Chicago based Astor Asset Management   Economic data
has improved slightly while the market has improved more than
slightly  This means the data will need to catch up to the
market  or the market may be ahead of itself and needs to
correct  I think it ll be the latter

 Durable goods orders jumped 4 9 percent  the largest
advance since July 2007  the government said  Excluding
transportation  durable goods rose 0 8 percent  slightly below
expectations 
 Still  industrial stocks dipped Wednesday  in part because
Chinese officials said they would take steps to curb
overcapacity  The Dow Jones Heavy Construction index fell 2 1
percent  with Jacobs Engineering down 3 6 percent at  44 73 
 One of the top drags on the Nasdaq was Apple Inc  down 1 4

according to industry sources  Nokia s U S  listed stock was
up 3 7 percent at  13 09 
 In earnings related activity  Williams Sonoma shot up 10 3
percent to  17 07 after it posted a surprising second quarter
profit 
 Topping the Nasdaq s list of biggest percentage decliners
was the stock of Concurrent Computer  which sank 18 7 percent

trends to continue in the first quarter

the Standard   Poor s 500 Index to a 10 month high on Friday

data pointing to an economic recovery 
 The July employment data boosted stocks across the board 
with financial shares leading the charge  The S P financial
sector index rose 3 7 percent  JPMorgan Chase   Co shot up 5
percent to  42 78 and led the Dow higher 
  One of the weakest links in the economy has been
employment  The data today was  strong  enough to trigger
enthusiasm   said Craig Peckham  equity trading strategist at
Jefferies   Co in New York 
  What this means is that consumer spending will be up and
others  sectors  will come along as well  
 The nonfarm payrolls data showing fewer than expected job
cuts in July comes on the heels of strong readings on housing
and manufacturing earlier this week 
 The first profit in seven quarters for American
International Group Inc also lifted financial stocks as the
insurer s shares jumped 19 2 percent to  26 86 
 AIG s profit news reassured investors that the company 
rescued by U S  taxpayers during the financial crisis  was
showing signs of life  At Thursday s close  the stock was up
nearly 70 percent since the beginning of the week 
 The Dow Jones industrial average was up 134 90 points  or
1 46 percent  at 9 391 16  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index was
up 16 20 points  or 1 62 percent  at 1 013 28  The Nasdaq
Composite Index was up 31 34 points  or 1 59 percent  at
2 004 50 
 Before the opening bell  the Labor Department said U S 
employers cut 247 000 nonfarm jobs in July    far less than
the 320 000 expected and the smallest decline in a year 
suggesting the recession was abating 
 The July unemployment rate slipped to 9 4 percent from 9 5
percent in June  the first time the rate has fallen since
April 2008 
 The hard hit housing sector got another boost after shares
of Beazer Homes USA Inc soared nearly 18 percent to  3 90 a
day after reporting a third quarter loss that was much
narrower than expected 
 Goldman Sachs also added U S  home builder D R  Horton Inc
to its  conviction buy  list  saying the company is best

federal housing stimulus  D R  Horton s stock gained almost 8
percent to  13 53

numbers suggesting a recovery  and an earnings season with

 NEW YORK  Aug 7  Reuters    U S  stocks rallied on Friday 
pushing the Standard   Poor s 500 to a 10 month high as the
July jobs report was less bleak than feared and underpinned

180102,401618,DHI,3 Reasons Momentum Stock Investors Will Love D R  Horton  DHI ,opinion,"Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  but this can be very tough to define  There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard  and which are not really quality indicators of future performance  Fortunately  with our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term This method discovered several great candidates for momentum oriented investors  but today let s focus on D R  Horton  Inc    NYSE DHI   as this stock is looking especially impressive right now  And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice  we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for DHI s status as a solid momentum stock below Longer Term Price Change for D R  HortonWhile any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics such as performance over the past three months or year   and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful And in the case of DHI  the results are quite impressive  The company has beaten the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 36 5  to 22 5   while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year  putting up a gain of 73 6   Clearly  DHI is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors  D R  Horton  Inc  Price
   Quarter EPS Estimate Change for D R  Horton StockWhile looking at price performance or full year earnings can be essential to understanding a momentum stock  you shouldn t forget about the current quarter EPS and the trend in estimates there  This change can signal how a stock might perform in the next earnings season  which is obviously vital for momentum investors Right now  DHI is seeing a nice trend over the past month when it comes to this quarter s earnings estimate projections  In the time frame  EPS estimates for D R  Horton have gone up by 6 3  compared to a flat industry average move  suggesting that not only is DHI heading in the right direction  but it is seeing an increase relative to the industry too DHI Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors  we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends  A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock  and we have actually been seeing that with DHI as of late Over the past two months  19 earnings estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the full year  while we are also seeing that eight estimates have moved upwards with no downward revision for the next year time frame  These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate  as two months ago  DHI was expected to post earnings of  3 12 per share for the full year  though today it looks to have EPS of  3 22 for the full year  representing a solid increase which is something that should be welcome news to would be investors Bottom LineGiven these factors  investors shouldn t be surprised to note that we have DHI as a security with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and a Momentum Score of A  You can see  So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction  definitely keep DHI on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well positioned to soar in the near term Investor Alert  Breakthroughs Pending A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization  Billions of dollars in research have poured into it  Companies are already generating substantial revenue  and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight  and so are big potential profits for early investors  Zacks names 5 stocks to buy now ",2017-11-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-momentum-stock-investors-will-love-dr-horton-dhi-200269114,200269114
180103,401619,DHI,Housing Market Review  Tax Driven Angst Transforms Into Rally ,opinion,"The last Housing Market Review covered data reported in October  2017 for September  2017  At the time  I lamented having too small an exposure to home builders while the entire sector rallied nearly non stop  I was counting on seasonal patterns to deliver at least one buyable dip ahead of the seasonally strong period starting in November  The briefest of dips did arrive in the form of angst over the Republican tax reform bill  In a pattern familiar in this bull market  the angst lasted exactly one day before these stocks resumed their rallies 
The iShares U S  Home Construction ETF  NYSE ITB  has not traded higher since early 2007  ITB is up a whopping 57  year to date with a large chunk of that gain coming since the September breakout to a new high  ITB is up 23  since then 

The iShares US Home Construction ETF  ITB  continues along an uptrend defined by its upper Bollinger  Bands  BBs  
I thought the selling was the beginning and not the end of a choice entry point  sellers lack follow through  Once ITB completed a reversal of the one day loss  I assumed the next phase of the rally was underway  D R  Horton  NYSE DHI  was a key tell as the home builder which fared the best in the middle of the one day sell off  DHI closed near flat after a sharp intraday bounce that day  DHI erased that marginal loss in two days and returned to the racetrack from there  In just ONE MONTH DHI is up another 13  

D R  Horton  DHI  barely flinched in the face of tax reform angst  The monster rally continued apace from there  DHI trades at an all time high  first set two months ago in October 
With my hand  forced   I fired up my buying plan  I focused on the stocks that looked  cheap  before and after the day of angst  I finally made the plunge into Five Point Holdings  NYSE FPH  and M D C  Holdings  NYSE MDC   MDC in particular experienced the double whammy of reporting less than stellar earnings news on the day of angst  The stock is still working on its own complete reversal  Per my trading plan  I bought after the 200 day moving average  DMA  appeared to hold as solid support 

Five Point Holdings  FPH  is now pivoting around its IPO price  The angst over the tax reform plan seemed to wash out the  last  sellers 

M D C  Holdings  MDC  had a near picture perfect bounce of 200DMA support  The stock quickly proceeded to break through 50DMA resistance and then successfully test it as fresh support 
The day of angst stopped me out of my position in Tri Pointe Group  NYSE TPH   set to preserve my profits   but I decided not to climb back in  Interestingly  TPH lost 2 6  on Friday  December 1st when ITB managed to GAIN 0 7  on its bounceback from earlier selling in the day  Other regional builders like Century Communities  NYSE CCS  and LGI Homes  NASDAQ LGIH  also ended the day with losses  I will be watching for a potential divergence going forward 
I am still taken aback by the breathless gains in home builders this year  For four years  ITB churned with a seasonal bias that allowed me to cycle through multiple bullish trades  I was clearly not quite prepared for a distinct change in the trading behavior  Panning out  I see that 2017 was a major breakout year with similarities to 2012 when home builders surged off major lows  The between years served as a very extended period of consolidation with a slight upward bias  The big question for 2018 will be whether 2017 priced in years of subsequent good news just as 2012 did for the 2013   2016 period  Unlike 2012  home builders are at highs in sentiment  home prices are relentlessly increasing  inventories are tight  labor and materials are tight  and demand is quite strong  At least housing bears still expect the market to collapse at any minute 

The weekly view of the iShares US Home Construction ETF  ITB  shows two one year long rallies have dominated the post recession recovery 

   October  2017 Single family housing starts for September were revised upward from 829 000 to 833 000  October starts increased month over month by 5 3  to 877 000  On an annual basis  single family housing starts eked out a gain of 0 7   the lowest year over year growth rate since August  2016   1 4   


The uptrend in single family housing starts continues albeit at a slowing annual growth rate 
After three months of wide deviations  the regional changes were more uniform for the previous three months  Wide deviations returned for September and October  The Northeast  Midwest  South  and West each changed  13 2   10 4   3 0    5 6  respectively in October  For September these percentages were  respectively  17 7   10 5    5 6   and 26 1   The strong starts in the West came to an abrupt end but were undoubtedly due for some cooling  The South is bouncing back from the hurricanes in Florida and Texas 
   October  2017
The routine description for existing sales is usually sales decline because of a shortage of inventory and sales increase in spite of inventory shortages  For October  2017  the National Association of Realtors  delivered a slight twist by applauding another small monthly increase in sales but complained that lack of inventory caused a year over year decline in sales 

 Job growth in most of the country continues to carry on at a robust level and is starting to slowly push up wages  which is in turn giving households added assurance that now is a good time to buy a home While the housing market gained a little more momentum last month  sales are still below year ago levels because low inventory is limiting choices for prospective buyers and keeping price growth elevated  

For January 2017  existing home sales rose to levels not seen since February  2007  In February 2017  existing home sales dropped sharply and then rebounded sharply in March to a new post recession high  Now  sales are on the decline and for the second month in a row went negative year over year 
The seasonally adjusted annualized sales of 5 48M were up 2 0  month over month from 5 37M in sales for September  revised down from 5 39M   Year over year sales decreased 0 9  consistent with a recent pattern of deceleration since April  November 15 4   December 0 7   January 3 8   February 5 4   March 5 9   April 1 6   May 2 7   June 0 7   July 2 1   August 0 2   September  1 5   So October s annual drop provided a final confirmation of a top in sales for 2017 

Sales of existing homes are on the upswing again 
The share of sales going to first time buyers increased to 32  from 29   First timers made a reassuring rebound after declining in September below 30  for the first time since September  2015  Year to date this share was stuck in the low 30s  The average for 2016 was 35  and the NAR s 2017 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers reported an average of 34  for 2017 
The absolute level of inventory of existing homes fell year over year for the 29th straight month  During the press conference  the NAR noted that October set a record low absolute and relative inventory level across all Octobers since data collection started in 1999  Recall that during the June press conference  the NAR talked about a housing crisis in supply in some housing markets  The 1 80M homes for sale represented a whopping 10 2  decrease from the previous October and a 3 2  decrease from September s 1 90M  The string of year over year declines has been remarkable  starting from 2016 August  10 1   September  6 8   October  4 3   November  9 3   December  6 3   January  7 1   February  6 4   March  6 6   April  9 0   May  8 4   June  7 1   July  9 0  August  6 5   and September  6 4  
In December  inventory hit 3 6 months of sales and a new absolute low measured from 1999 when the NAR began tracking  At 3 9 months of sales  relative inventory dropped precariously close to the record  September s inventory was 4 2 months of sales  During the press conference  the NAR repeated its appeal for getting more supply into the market  The NAR warned that the market cannot afford multiple years of price increases that outpace wage growth at the same time mortgage rates go up 
Investors purchased 13  of existing homes in October  a decline from September s 15  but within the recent range 
For October  regional areas experienced mixed year over year results as the Midwest and the South were the big drags  Northeast 0   Midwest  1 5   South  1 8   West 0 8   All regions logged substantial year over year jumps in their median price  Northeast 6 6   Midwest 7 1   South 4 6   West 7 8  
October s 5 5  year over year increase in the overall median price of an existing home incredibly represents the 68th consecutive month of year over year increases  The median price of of  247 000 is up slightly from September s  245 100 and a step closer to August s record  253 500 
Single family sales increased 2 1  on a monthly basis and decreased on a yearly basis by 1 0   The median price of  248 300 was up 5 4  year over year  the past six months have delivered similar year over year gains 

New single family home sales declined in July steeply enough to threaten a break of the years long uptrend  August s hurricane impacted sales numbers seemed to seal the fate of that uptrend  And then September happened  despite broad based declines in existing home sales in September  new home sales soared on both a year over year and month over month basis  October delivered a repeat performance 
The Census Bureau revised September sales of new single family homes downward from 667 000 to 645 000  which means that September s reported 17 0  year over year jump was instead about 13    New home sales for September increased 6 2  month over month and soared 18 7  year over year to 685 000  Year over year gains have regularly hit double digits since 2012  October s jump was only the highest since March of this year  New home sales hit a new post recession high and have not been this high in 10 years  Note well that year to date new home sales have increased 25  while they increased 37  during the 4 year period of consolidation for ITB  Sales were up 57  from December  2012 to the previous post recession peak in July  2016 

In October  2017  new home sales soar to a fresh post recession high 
In September  sales were strong enough to drive new home inventory from 6 1 months of supply to 5 0 months  October s inventory slipped slightly to 4 9 months of supply  A market for homes is in balance at 6 months of supply  so the market is further unbalanced  August s inventory was the highest since October  2011  so the current numbers represent a remarkable change in character  I wondered out loud about a downward revision for September s number  I have to do the same for October  Perhaps a downward revision of sales will occur for the next report 
Despite the sales jump  the median price actually decreased  the average price continued its upward march   The median price of  312 800 returned close to August s  revised   311 700 and was a 3 3  decline from September s median  The median price decreased 3 3  year over year  The downward shift in the median came from a huge rise in the share of homes sold in the  200 000 to  299 999 price range and a large drop in the share of homes sold in the  300 000 to  399 999 price range  Small gains in higher price brackets did not compensate for the downward shift 
On a regional basis  new home sales brought a convincing end to divergent behavior  The Northeast experienced its THIRD month of sharply higher sales with a 64 7  year over year gain  compare to 65 2  for August and 54 8  for September   The Midwest increased 16 2   The South put hurricane woes behind it with a 14 0  increase  The West soared 20 1  year over year 
In March  builder confidence soared to a new 12 year high at 71  For the remainder of the year  the HMI hovered just under that 12 year high  November s reading of 70 marked a near return to that 12 year high  The hurricane related drag on sentiment is clearly a distant memory  and The National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  dropped any mention of the hurricanes  Instead  it returned to its boilerplate applause for the strong demand for housing and warning about the headwinds facing builders    lot and labor shortages and ongoing building material price increases  
The single family  SF  detached next six months was the one of the three components of the Housing Market Index  HMI  that actually lost ground  it backed off by a point from a 12 year high  The two point gain for the traffic of prospective buyers was its biggest since March  Despite a small retreat in consumer sentiment  the odds of HMI hitting a new 12  year high this year still look good  One more month to go    Certainly the Spring selling season will deliver higher levels  

The components of the Housing Market Index  HMI  generally pushed higher even as consumer sentiment slowed down a bit 

For May and June  there was an interesting disparity in the regional changes in HMI  In May  the West finally broke out from the flatline of the previous 4 months with an 80 reading  The West plunged in June back to 71 to a near 1 year low and since then has inched its way higher  The West hit 77 for November  The Northeast surged  out of nowhere  to 63 from 49  The previous high for the year was 53 in March  The Northeast HMI was last this high 12 years ago  At 72  the South HMI hit a new high for the year by one point  The Midwest is the regional laggard as it stayed flat with October s 65 reading and is still 7 points behind its March high 
Parting thoughts While the stocks of home builders quickly left behind the angst of the Republican tax reform legislation that reduces the tax incentives of home ownership  the NAR remains emphatic in its opposition to the tax bill  During its press conference for October existing home sales  the NAR claimed that the removal of tax incentives for home buying presented a wildcard that threatened an otherwise positive outlook for 2018  In   the NAR called the House s version of the bill a tax increase for middle class Americans 

 Make no mistake  middle class homeowners will see their home values fall if this proposal moves forward  while large corporations walk away with the bulk of the tax cuts 
American homeowners shouldn t have to pay for corporate tax cuts with their home equity  It s a matter of basic fairness  1 3 million Realtors  have known since the beginning  and America s 75 million homeowners are just beginning to learn  that homeowners will be the ones paying the tab  Realtors  will do our part to spread the word as we work with the Senate to address this impending assault on homeownership  

With the Senate passing its own version of tax reform in the middle of the night December 2nd  the NAR shut down the call to action and replaced it with a eulogy of sorts called    

 The U S  Senate today passed tax reform legislation that the National Association of Realtors  believes puts home values at risk and dramatically undercuts the incentive to own a home  

The NAR estimates a 10  drop in home values and even more in high cost areas 
On November 17th   

 Though NAHB believes the Senate tax legislation is better for the housing sector  like the House  it fails to provide a meaningful incentive for homeownership for the middle class  

The NAHB did find some redeeming qualities in the bill 

 The Senate tax plan would  however  protect important provisions to boost the production of affordable housing  including the Low Income Housing Tax Credit and the tax exempt bond program  The Senate plan would also provide sufficient tax reductions for small businesses to enable them to remain major drivers of job growth and maintain a level playing field with large corporations  

The on going rally in home builders either reflects the hope that the NAR and NAHB can still convince Congress to stay the knife on housing incentives and or a belief that the industry s fears are unwarranted  Presumably  the first real test will come during the 2018 Spring selling season  Until then  I will remain content with my refreshed  albeit small  housing positions  Any new positions will likely be short term in nature like the hedged trade I implemented on KB Home  KBH  
My first set of call options on KBH were too early  and the position withered away as KBH went into a consolidation period  I sold the position ahead of expiration at a loss  I immediately rolled into a new set of call options  The second time was a charm as I notched a double when my limit order to sell executed on Thursday s rally extension  The put options still have some small residual value  With a January expiration  I will treat them as an on going hedge on bad fallout from tax reform  My expectations for the impact of this legislation will continue to evolve in coming weeks and months  but I am heavily biased to believe the industry over the politicians and their economists 

KB Home  KBH  crept higher for most of November before accelerating into a 3 day surge and breakout  Sellers came out in force on Friday  can KBH continue rolling to fresh 10 year highs 
 Technicians will note the healthy breakout from a Bollinger Band  BB  squeeze that formed in the wake of the day of angst  
Be careful out there   and look out for a very important earnings report from Toll Brothers  TOL  this week

180105,401621,DHI,Top Ranked Construction Stocks That More Than Doubled The SP,opinion,The construction sector witnessed a dynamic 2017  Rising residential demand along with a rebounding U S  economy eased political and economic challenges The Year So FarThe construction sector has demonstrated stability through 2017 and witnessed sustainable growth amid various challenges  It goes without saying that President Donald Trump was the biggest factor  Investors were expecting faster growth based on Trump s assurance of significant tax cuts  higher infrastructure spending and lesser regulations Although the momentum slowed a bit later  the S P 500 index topped the milestone of 2 500 for the first time on mid September  surpassing the 266  rise during the 1949 56 run  per Bloomberg  Notably  the surge came in the aftermath of hurricanes Harvey   Irma  depicting strong complacency in the stock market Although public construction declined in 2017  it can get back into the positive territory with expansions in terminals and runways  airport construction  as well as with public education construction spending  On the other hand  residential spending increased 6 6  in the first 10 months of 2017  reinstating its stature  per the latest report from the U S  Census Bureau So far  it has been a good 2017 for the housing market and the trend is expected to continue in 2018  courtesy of improving economy  modest wage growth  low unemployment levels  positive consumer confidence  a tight supply situation and escalating rent costs  Consumer Confidence  a key determinant of the economy s health  improved significantly in November  reaching its highest level in 17 years  Again  there are signs of increased inclination of home purchases among millennials  a generation that had to some extent refrained from entering the market Despite the repeated hikes of the Federal Reserve s interest rates  optimism surrounding the housing market remains largely unaffected  The U S  economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 3  in the July September quarter  marking the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2014 and a nice pickup from the second quarter s 3 1   Notably  it is the first time since 2014 that the U S  economy has witnessed growth of 3  or more for two straight quarters Will Supply Shortage   Labor Hurdles Restrain the Positive Momentum What is plaguing the industry of late is the inventory shortage prevailing in the U S  real estate market and the upward pressure it is creating on prices in several parts of the country   fell in the third quarter of 2017  according to a National Association of Home Builders or NAHB survey  Meanwhile  labor shortage along with rising land and labor costs pose a threat to the companies  margins Nonetheless  economists are of the opinion that the rebounding U S  economy accompanied by low level of unemployment  4 1  in November  will keep the momentum alive for the sector as a whole  November figure was the lowest since December 2000  The United States has added jobs for 86 straight months  the longest streak All these positive factors have helped the construction sector to grow nearly 23 3  this year  higher than the broader market s  S P 500  rally of 19 3   Notably  investing in the  might sound profitable right now  as it falls within the top 6   1 out of 16 sectors  of the Zacks Industry Rank  which hints

180107,401623,DHI,5 Construction Stocks That Crushed The Market In 2017,opinion,As we bid adieu to 2017  let s take a look at how the construction sector fared this year and what s in store for 2018 Overall  2017 was a great year for the construction sector buoyed by robust gains from home building investments and a rebounding U S  economy  Especially  optimism surrounding the construction sector grew manifold post President Donald Trump s victory  since one of his key priorities was driving infrastructure investments  This optimism is likely to continue in the near term  thanks to the long awaited tax cuts  which are likely to be passed this week In total  spending on construction increased 4 1  year over year in the first 10 months of the year  per the latest report from the U S  Census Bureau  Although spending on government projects declined 3 4  year to date  it grew 3  in October  the biggest one month gain in three years  with spending at the federal  state and local levels rising  Government project spend is expected to increase in 2018 with the Trump administration s  1 trillion infrastructure spend program  which is yet to materialize  On the other hand  residential spending increased 6 6  in the first 10 months of 2017  While a few projects like multifamily housing are gradually losing ground  others like office buildings  education facilities  and transportation terminals are in high demand Insights Into the Sector s Prospects for 2018U S  construction starts are expected to climb slightly in 2018  according to Dodge Data   Analytics  2018 Dodge Construction Outlook  A 3  increase to  765 billion is expected  following a similarly modest 4  rise to  746 billion  is estimated for 2017 The forecast further entails 3  increase in public works construction spending  higher than 1  growth in 2017  Highways and bridges projects are likely to get a boost as federal funding is rising owing to the FAST Act  Again  reconstruction efforts related to hurricanes Harvey and Irma are also adding to the expectations Also  residential construction activities stepped up this year and the trend is expected to continue in 2018  courtesy of improving economy  modest wage growth  low unemployment levels  positive consumer confidence  a tight supply situation and escalating rent costs  Per the study by Dodge Data   Analytics  4  gain is expected for residential building  2  for nonresidential building  while nonbuilding construction is expected to stabilize following two years of decline However  a few market pundits are of the opinion that the Trump administration s efforts toward overhauling the tax code could undermine any potential improvements in affordability in the housing market and make housing less attractive  The GOP tax bill allows interest payment deductions on mortgage debt up to  750 000  down from the current  1 million That said  the December reading of the confidence level of homebuilders speaks of the industry s strength  The confidence level among the nation s homebuilders ended 2017 on a high note as the housing market index  HMI  was at 74 in December  This marks the highest reading since 1999 Builders seem to be shaking off worries related to the Republican tax plan  and apparently believe that the business incentives in the plan are likely to offset the negatives  The legislation promises many practical changes in a number of areas  but it will surely have a major positive impact on corporate profitability Per the Zacks Earnings Trends  earnings for the construction sector are likely to witness 20 3  growth in 2018  up from the expected 14 9  increase in 2017  Revenues are likely to improve 9  in 2018  compared with 9 5  growth estimated for 2017 Strong Economy and Labor Market Act as CatalystTrump had vowed to double economic growth through an ambitious stimulus program featuring tax cuts  deregulation and higher infrastructure spending  Both markets and investors responded positively to this  The aura exists  as is evident from the broader market s performance The S P 500 index topped the milestone of 2 500 for the first time in mid September  surpassing the 266  rise during the 1949 56 run  per Bloomberg  Notably  the surge came in the aftermath of hurricanes Harvey   Irma  depicting strong complacency in the stock market  Again  the Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved up 5 000 points this year   the biggest annual gain in its history   and is moving closer to another major milestone of 25 000 The world s largest economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 3  in the July September quarter  2nd estimate   marking the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2014 and up from the second quarter s 3 1   Again  further decline in unemployment  4 1  in November  will keep the momentum alive for the construction sector  The November figure came in the lowest since December 2000 All these positive factors have helped the construction sector to grow more than 24  this year  higher than the broader market s  S P 500  rally of 20 1   We note that the construction sector has been a major contributor to the S P 500 s growth story Investing in the  might sound profitable right now  as it falls within the top 31   5 out of 16 sectors  of the Zacks Industry Rank  which hints at further growth 5 Construction Stocks that Outpaced the MarketWe bring five

180127,401643,DHI,Not A Stock Picker s Market Even If You re Long Like Me,opinion,"A couple of months ago  I decided to do a little experiment  Frustrated with eight years swimming against the stream  I asked myself     what if I went ahead and bought equal amounts of every single stock in my Bull Pen watch list  that is  stocks with good looking bullish patterns   So I set up a spreadsheet with the prices on September 15th and have been tracking it ever since  Here s what it looks like  the grand totals are at the top  

As you can see  even in just a couple of months  there are some pretty impressive gains  such as over 30  from homebuilder DR Horton  NYSE DHI    However  there is some weakness too  and once you add it all up  it comes to a gain of only about 3 5  over a two month period 
This isn t exactly electrifying  The plain old boring SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY  yielded exactly the same return over that timespan  I guess I can at least conclude that although I m not playing along with the bull party  I m not exactly missing one whole hell of a lot either  If you think the market is cheap  ha    just buy SPY and be done with it  It certainly isn t a stock picker s market  judging from the fact that the average gain is  almost to the hundredth of a decimal point  the same as SPY ",2017-11-19,Tim Knight,https://www.investing.com/analysis/long-like-me-200266464,200266464

180151,401667,DHI,Should Value Investors Pick D R  Horton  DHI  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put D R  Horton  Inc    NYSE DHI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  D R  Horton has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 8  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts D R  Horton s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint  which is 14 9  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 5  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that D R  Horton has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 3  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for D R  Horton s stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  D R  Horton has a P S ratio of about 1 2  This is noticeably lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  D R  Horton currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes DHI a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though D R  Horton might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of A  This gives DHI a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past thirty days and thirteen lower  while the full year estimate has seen a similar trend in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 4 7  in the past one month  while the full year estimate has slipped 1 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below D R  Horton  Inc  Price and Consensus    This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineD R  Horton is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a decent industry rank  top 29  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  Nonetheless  over the past one year  the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed

180168,401684,DHI,DHI Beats But Housing ETFs Tumble  Why ,opinion,"D R  Horton   NYSE DHI    one of the biggest and well known homebuilders in the nation  came up with upbeat fiscal third quarter 2017 results on July 26 before the bell  Both earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate  read  
However  its  in three quarters diluted the impact of the earnings beat  Along with this  easing momentum in the U S  new home sales segment made matters worse  Shares fell about 1 9  post earnings release 
Let s take a look inside the headline numbers 
The company reported earnings of   beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 75  Earnings grew 15 2  year over year driven by higher home sales  Total revenue  homebuilding and financial services  of  3 78 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 71 billion by 5 2   Total revenue also increased 16 8  year over year  read    
Homebuilding revenues of  3 68 billion increased 17  year over year  helped by higher home deliveries  The company registered growth across all the regions comprising East  Midwest  Southeast  South Central  Southwest and West 
Inside Home Sales in June
New U S  single family home sales rose for the second successive month in June with purchases in the West skyrocketing to about a   However  downward revisions to sales growth for the previous three months hinted at cooling of the housing market 
May s sales pace was cut down to 605 000 units from the previously reported 610 000 units while June recorded a 0 8  increase to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 610 000 units  With this  sales in June missed economists  prediction of 1 4  growth to 615 000 units 
To add to the woes   plunged to an eight month low in July  indicating no meaningful recovery in the already under pressure home inventory market  If this was not enough  existing home sales  in June on less availability of properties that shot up prices 
Market   ETF Impact 
The subtle bearishness over such an important homebuilding stock may cause a slack in housing ETFs over the coming days  Overall improvement of the housing sector also seems to be rocky as evident from home sales data  read    
However  the Fed remained dovish and yields are on the lower side at the current level  This may work wonder for the sector  Investors should also note that the sector is well positioned from the Zacks Rank point of view  The Zacks Industry Rank of DHI is in the top 8  at the time of writing and the Zacks Sector Rank is in the top 25   read    
Housing ETFs mainly include SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB  ETF  and iShares U S  Home Construction ETF   WA ITB    DHI takes first spot in the 45 stock ITB with a 12 41  weight and the first position in the 37 stock XHB with 4 87  exposure 
In a nutshell  investors who want to bet on the Fed s dovishness but worried about dull order growth at D R  Horton  may easily take the ETF route for investing  This is because a basket approach always safeguards investors from stock specific volatility  ITB was down about 0 8  on July 26  while XHB was down about 0 03

180201,401717,DHI,Choppy Action To Start Week  Growth In Services Sector Activity Slows,opinion,"U S  equities finished the first trading day of the week by posting only modest losses  as a plethora of political and geopolitical uncertainty appeared to keep investors in wait and see mode  including the upcoming election in the U K  and European Central Bank monetary policy decision  Treasury yields and the U S  dollar were slightly higher  along with gold  while crude oil prices were lower  Reports that U S  services sector activity slowed but continued to show growth also may have also contributed to keeping investors on the sidelines 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  declined 21 points  0 1   to 21 184  the S P 500 Index decreased 3 points  0 1   to 2 436  and the NASDAQ Composite lost 10 points  0 2   to 6 296  In moderate volume  699 million shares were traded on the NYSE and 1 7 billion shares changed hands on the NASDAQ  WTI crude oil declined  0 26 to  47 40 per barrel and wholesale gasoline was  0 04 lower at  1 54 per gallon  Elsewhere  the Bloomberg gold spot price added  0 64 to  1 279 81 per ounce  and the dollar index  a comparison of the U S  dollar to six major world currencies  was 0 1  higher at 96 81

Herbalife Ltd   NYSE HLF  69  issued Q2 and full year earnings per share  EPS  guidance that came in below estimates  despite raising its outlook for these periods  while lowering its sales outlook for the current quarter as it transitions to new Federal Trade Commission  FTC  rules  Shares were noticeably lower 
The markets payed close attention to the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting  and Loxo Oncology Inc  NASDAQ LOXO  70  surged after the company announced upbeat results from a clinical trial of its cancer treatment  However  Bristol Myers Squibb Co   NYSE BMY  52  came under pressure amid mixed results from the company s treatment for various types of cancer 
Growth in services sector activity slows slightly  factory orders dip
The May Institute for Supply Management  ISM  non Manufacturing Index declined to 56 9 from April s unrevised 57 5 level  and compared to the Bloomberg forecast of a decline to 57 0  A reading above 50 denotes expansion  New orders and business activity slowed month over month  m m  but remained solidly in expansion territory  while employment jumped 6 4 points to 57 8  Prices fell 8 4 points to 49 2  The ISM said comments from respondents continue to indicate optimism about business conditions and the overall economy 
The final Markit U S  Services PMI Index was revised to 53 6 in May from the preliminary 54 0 level  where it was expected to remain  but was up compared to the 53 1 figure posted in April  The release is independent and differs from ISM s report  as it has less historic value and Markit weights its index components differently 
Services sector activity  which accounts for a majority of U S  economic growth  continues to suggest expansion despite the festering political and monetary policy uncertainty  Both political uncertainty and Fed policy changes could contribute to increased volatility  but solid economic and earnings growth  both in the United States and globally  should help the bull market to continue  We suggest looking past the political rhetoric for the most part and focusing on economic developments and the long term stability the United States provides 
Factory orders declined 0 2  m m in April  in line with expectations  while March s figure was upwardly revised to a 1 0  increase  April durable goods orders  preliminarily reported two weeks ago  were adjusted to a 0 8  decrease from the preliminarily reported 0 7  decline 
Final Q1 nonfarm productivity    came in flat on an annualized basis  versus expectations of a 0 2  decline  Also  unit labor costs rose 2 2   versus the forecast calling for a 2 6  gain 
Treasuries finished lower  as the yield on the 2 Year note ticked 1 basis point  bp  higher to 1 30   the 10 Year note was up 2 bps to 2 18   and the 30 Year bond rate increased 3 basis points to 2 83  
Today s data comes ahead of next week s Fed monetary policy decision  which is highly expected to deliver a Fed rate hike  while the potential beginning of the process of the Fed shrinking its bloated balance sheet later this year is also being eyed 
Tomorrow s economic calendar will be light  with the only report of note being the Labor Department s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey  JOLTS   with economists forecasting that the measure of unmet demand for labor showed 5 73 million jobs were available to be filled during April  down slightly from the 5 74 million posted the month prior 
Europe  Asia lower on U S  data and political and geopolitical uncertainty
European equities finished lower  though volume was lighter than usual as several markets were closed for holidays  including in Germany and Switzerland  The global markets continued to grapple with lingering geopolitical uncertainty in the wake of the weekend s deadly attack in London  while the political front also garnered attention ahead of this week s U K  election as Brexit negotiations continue and votes loom in Italy and Germany later this year  Recent polls have showed the U K  race tightening  causing some of the uncertainty to flare up 
The markets also await this week s monetary policy meeting by the European Central Bank  In economic news  U K  auto sales and services sector output both disappointed the markets  The euro was lower and the British pound was higher versus the U S  dollar  while bond yields in the region were mixed 
Stocks in Asia finished mostly lower as the markets digest Friday s softer than expected employment report in the U S   which weighed on the U S  dollar  while political and geopolitical uncertainty lingered  The U K  is set for an election this week  on the heels of this weekend s deadly attack in London  while several Middle East countries cut ties with Qatar  citing terrorism related issues

180202,401718,DHI,NVR s Homebuilding Impresses  Higher Costs To Hurt Margins,opinion,On Jun 21  2017  we issued an updated research report on NVR  Inc    NYSE NVR    one of the country s largest homebuilding and mortgage banking companies The company s solid business model  strong homebuilding operations and positive housing outlook make the stock even more attractive  However  rising costs  weak margins and rising interest rates might be dampeners Key PositivesThe company is engaged in the construction and sale of single family detached homes  townhomes and condominium buildings through two of its business segments  Homebuilding and Mortgage Banking Shares of NVR have rallied more than 48  year to date  beating the Zacks categorized  industry s gain of 25 8   The company is poised to gain traction in 2017 on the current positive housing scenario  Factors such as steady job and wage growth  a recovering economy  historically low interest mortgage rates  rising rentals  rapidly increasing household formation  and a limited supply of inventory  point at continually strong demand in 2017 This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s homebuilding segment  comprising 98  of the total revenue  has been performing well for the last few years as is expected to continue doing so this year and in 2018  Notably  NVR s Homebuilding revenues increased 13  in 2016 from 2015  primarily on a 12  year over year increase in the number of settled units  The increase in the number of settled units was attributable to a 14  hike in backlog unit balance entering 2016 compared with 2015  You can see  The positive momentum continued in the first quarter of 2017  with the company reporting an 11  year over year increase in Homebuilding revenues  New orders in the quarter grew 7  and settlements rose 8  from the first quarter of 2016  Backlog of homes sold but not settled as of Mar 31  2017 increased on a unit basis by 9  and 13  on a dollar basis compared with Mar 31  2016 NVR s robust performance is largely attributable to its disciplined business model  focused on maximizing liquidity and minimizing risk  Unlike other homebuilders  NVR s sole business is selling and building quality homes by typically acquiring finished building lots  without the risk of owning and developing land in a cyclical industry NVR s 2017 EPS is projected to grow 24 8   more than the industry s average EPS growth of 17 3   Meanwhile  the company s sales growth in 2017 is projected to be about 10 6   higher than the industry s growth of 7 6  HeadwindsNVR s results have been volatile for some time now despite the company s reputation as one of the group s consistently performing bellwethers  We believe the company s margins will remain subdued throughout 2017  as its end markets are not likely to experience significant pricing power to offset cost inflation  NVR also expects continued gross margin pressure over the next several quarters due to higher cost Meanwhile  rising interest and mortgage rates  as well as land and labor shortages  raise concerns  as do rising material prices  At present  skilled labor shortages are a cause of concern for major homebuilders like NVR  D R  Horton Inc    NYSE DHI    Toll Brothers Inc    NYSE TOL   and PulteGroup Inc    NYSE PHM    Labor shortages are resulting in higher wages while land prices are on the rise due to limited availability  There could be more inflation ahead as well  This is eating into homebuilders  margins Zacks  Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public  certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services  Would you like to peek behind the curtain today and view them Starting now  for the next month  I invite you to follow all Zacks  private buys and sells in real time from value to momentum   from stocks under  10 to ETF to option movers   from insider trades to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises  we ve called them with 80   accuracy   You can even look inside portfolios so exclusive that they are normally closed to new investors ,2017-06-20,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/nvr's-homebuilding-impresses,-higher-costs-to-hurt-margins-200196672",200196672
180219,401735,DHI,DHI Tanks Despite Beat  How To Treat Housing ETFs ,opinion,"D R  Horton   NYSE DHI    one of the biggest and well known homebuilders in the nation  came up with upbeat fiscal second quarter 2017 results on April 20 before the bell  Both earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate  read  
However  lower than expected guidance couldn t do justice to the company s Q2 outperformance  Shares fell about 3 2  in the two trading sessions  as of April 21  2017  post earnings release Let s take a look inside the headline numbers 
The company reported earnings   beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 59 by 1 7   Earnings grew 15 4  year over year driven by higher home sales  Total revenue  homebuilding and financial services  of  3 25 billion came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 09 billion by 5 2   Total revenue also rose 17 5  year over year 
Homebuilding revenues rose 17  year over year  Home sales increased 17 6  year over year thanks to higher home deliveries  Home closings leapt 15   The company reported growth across all the regions consisting of East  Midwest  Southeast  South Central  Southwest and West 
Outlook 
The company projected total revenue in the range of  13 6  14 billion versus the prior expectation of  13 4  13 8 billion  As per an article published on   the guidance was below the consensus estimate of  13 84 billion 
The article on barrons went on to explain that  investors are worried that that sales forecast implies a slowdown in the second half of the year  a fact that management blamed on difficult comparable sales  
Another report from Wedbush indicated  as reported by   that  DHI is partially offsetting input cost hikes with incremental price increases  but with some input costs  lumber  cement and copper  up 20  to 40  Y Y   their  gross margin estimate of 19 8  is slightly below management s gross margin guidance for approximately 20    Probably this is why  DHI stock a took a beating despite strong Q2 earnings results 
Market   ETF Impact 
The subtle bearishness over such an important homebuilding stock may cause a slack in the housing ETFs over the coming days  However  overall developments of the housing sector and the Fed move on policy tightening are also important in deciding the fate of these ETFs  read    
Investors should also note that the sector is well positioned from the Zacks rank point of view having been in the top 25   Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 20   DHI has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  with a VGM  Value Growth Momentum  score of A 
If this was not enough  existing home sales touched a  in March  So  these impressive figures may call for sound trading of housing ETFs in the coming days  read  4   
Housing ETFs mainly include SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB  ETF  and iShares U S  Home Construction ETF   WA ITB    DHI takes first spot in the 44 stock ITB with an 11 76  weight and fifteenth position in the 37 stock XHB with 4 38  exposure 
In a nutshell  investors who want to bet big on the optimism surrounding the housing sector but worried about the slightly dull DHI guidance  may easily take the ETF route for investing  This is because a basket approach always safeguards investors from stock specific volatility  ITB was down about 0 5  in the last two days  as of April 21  2017   while XHB was up 0 6  in the same time frame

180268,401784,DHI,EMCOR  EME  Posts Striking Q3 Earnings Beat  Guides Up,opinion,"EMCOR Group Inc    NYSE EME   posted an incredible beat in its third quarter 2016 results  as its adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 85 cents per share  exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents by nearly 12   The figure also fared impressively year over year  surpassing the year ago tally of 66 cents by 28 8  
The robust bottom line performance was driven by an impressive organic growth across the company s segments  along with streamlined costs and superior operational execution  The company raised its 2016 guidance for the third consecutive time  on the back of impressive backlog levels and an increasing traction in the U S  construction and industrial services markets 
Net income from continuing operations came in at  51 9 million  up 24 2  compared with  41 8 million in the prior year period 
Inside the Headlines
The company reported record revenues for the quarter  which rose an impressive 13 2  year over year to  1 923 million  and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 868 million significantly  Strong revenue growth in the quarter was primarily driven by broad based  robust organic performance across the company s domestic segments  along with solid contribution from its recent acquisitions 
The U S  Construction segment  up about 24  year over year  sustained its robust momentum and delivered revenue and operating income growth  driven by the U S  Mechanical Construction business  up 19   
The company s U S  Building Services segment grew 6 2  year over year  driven by strong performance in our mobile mechanical services operations  The U S  Industrial Services revenue was relatively flat year over year  as a significant project neared completion 
Geographically  revenues from total U S  operations jumped 15 5  year over year to  1 850 million  However  revenue growth from the United Kingdom building services was much less impressive  plunging 25  year over year to  73 million in the face of continued headwinds from foreign exchange rates 
As of Sep 30  2016  EMCOR s backlog stood at a  3 9 billion  up 3 7  year over year  driven by the continued recovery of the non residential construction market  A rise in the backlog of U S  Mechanical Construction and Building Services segments more than offset the dip in backlog for U S  Electrical Construction  U S  Building Services and U S  Industrial Services segments  resulting in overall growth 
From an end market perspective  the company witnessed growth in backlog for the commercial and healthcare markets  which was somewhat offset by the declines in industrial  water and wastewater  hospitality and transportation sectors 
EMCOR s non GAAP operating income in the third quarter rose 23  year over year to  86 1 million  Operating margin for the quarter expanded 40 basis points year over year to 4 5  
Liquidity   Cash Flow
EMCOR s cash and cash equivalents totaled  504 6 million as of Sep 30  2016  compared with  486 8 million as of Dec 31  2015  Long term debt and capital lease obligations were  378 4 million  declining from  297 6 million recorded on Dec 31  2015 
Cash flow generated from operating activities for the nine month period ended Sep 30  2016 came in at  128 9 million  up from  95 6 million in the year ago quarter 
Acquisition
In the second quarter of 2016  EMCOR completed the acquisition of Ardent Services  L L C  and Rabalais Constructors  LLC  collectively called Ardent  for a price of  205 million in cash  Ardent is an established provider of electrical and instrumentation services to the energy infrastructure market in North America 
EMCOR integrated Ardent into its U S  Electrical Construction and Facilities Services segment 
Ardent will fortify EMCOR s market leading position in electrical construction and services  and will also serve to expand its capabilities in the energy and industrial sectors  particularly in the gulf coast  western and mid continent regions 
The company expects the Ardent buyout to be marginally accretive to EMCOR s 2016 earnings  with the accretion increasing to at least 10 cents per share in 2017 
Guidance Raised
Encouraged by its solid top line performance  accretive acquisitions and increasing traction in the U S  construction space  EMCOR s management raised 2016 guidance  with adjusted earnings from continuing operations now projected in a range of  3 10  3 20  up from previous projections of  2 90  3 10 per share  
Also  buoyed by the current size and mix of its backlog and overall positive market conditions  EMCOR raised its 2016 top line guidance  For full year 2016  the company now expects revenues to be roughly  7 5 billion  up from prior projections of a range of  7 4 billion  
EMCOR GROUP INC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   Our Take
This was a solid year so far for EMCOR  as the company set new records for revenues  operating income and net income  Outstanding performance in the construction segment  building services and UK segments set the tone for strong future growth  as is reflected in the company s raised guidance 
Also  a healthy balance sheet position and increasing backlog added to the company s strength  indicating bright future prospects  Moreover  increasing traction in the U S  construction and industrial services markets bode well for the company 
Apart from this  we believe that the company s diversified business structure  along with its concerted efforts to explore beyond traditional shop related operations for tapping other profitable areas like food processing and power  will drive long term growth 
EMCOR currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Stocks to Consider
Some better ranked stocks in the broader construction sector include MasTec  Inc    NYSE MTZ    DR Horton Inc    NYSE DHI   and Orion Group Holdings  Inc    NYSE ORN   
MasTec  carrying a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   has registered a remarkable positive average surprise of over 51 5  over the four trailing quarters  driven by three huge beats  You can see  
DR Horton carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and has a decent earnings beat history  having surpassed estimates twice over the trailing four quarters for an average beat of 3 5 
Orion Group  also carrying a Zacks Rank  2  has registered a remarkable positive average surprise of over 101 2  over the four trailing quarters  driven by a massive beat

which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 17 by 2 6   It had reported a loss of  7 02 per share in the year ago quarter Adjusted earnings  excluding divested businesses  for the quarter came in at  1 28 per diluted share Inside the HeadlinesThe company reported third quarter 2016 revenues of  2 776 million  marginally beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 771 million  However  revenues fell 16 4  year over year The lackluster top line performance during the quarter was largely a result of revenue declines across all of the company s segments  Also  absence of revenues from the previously divested nuclear operations compounded the fall Gross profit decreased 13 5  year over year to  326 6 million  while gross margin contracted 40 basis points to 11 8  The company booked new awards worth  2 716 million during third quarter 2016  compared with  4 billion in the prior year quarter  The decline in new award wins was largely attributable to cautionary spending on part of the large clients who continue to defer investments due to softness in energy markets Noteworthy new awards for third quarter 2016 included a maintenance award for two landfills and a major oil sands producer in Northern Alberta  Canada  This was followed by a  350 million EPC contract from a renowned electric power holding company Segmental RevenuesRevenues from the Engineering and Construction segment came in at  1 660 million  down 14 7  on a year over year basis  largely due to the absence of revenues from the divested nuclear operations business line  New awards in this segment were  1 492 million in the quarter  reflecting a decline of 38  from the comparable quarter last year Fabrication Services quarterly revenues totaled  513 million  declining 19 9  year over year owing to the winding down of several storage tank projects in the U S   South America and the Asia Pacific region  along with lowered engineered projects activity  Moreover  unfavorable timing of new awards aggravated the revenue fall in this segment  Also  new awards received by this segment plummeted drastically  down 73   to  226 million at the end of the third quarter compared with  841 million in the prior year quarter Technology revenues were down 23 5  year over year to  90 5 million  dragged primarily by lower catalyst volume and the timing of new awards  However  this segment won over  119 million of new contracts in the quarter  reflecting growth of nearly 22 4  Capital Services revenues declined 16 9  year over year to  513 million  reflecting lower construction services activity in

The company surpassed estimates in three out of the past four quarters  resulting in an average positive surprise of 8 47  D R HORTON INC Price and EPS Surprise
   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors to Consider
D R  Horton expects to deliver a strong performance in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 on the back of its robust backlog position and well stocked inventory of land  lots and homes 
D R  Horton s order trends have been steady for the past few quarters  a trend which is expected to continue in the soon to be reported quarter 
After weak numbers in the first quarter  home closings increased 12  in the second  We expect the improved trend to continue in the third quarter  which coupled with continued pricing gains should result in higher home sales 
Gross margins have remained weak due to higher costs    mainly labor    and an unfavorable product mix  A higher proportion of Express Homes in home closings are unfavorably impacting the product mix and thereby gross margins  We do not expect any significant gross margin improvement in the third quarter  For the third quarter of fiscal 2016  management has projected gross margin in the high 19  to 20  range 
Selling  general and administrative expenses  SG A  expenses have been going down on better fixed cost leverage as revenues increase  The improvement is anticipated to continue which should help profits  SG A ratio is expected to be in a range of 8 9  to 9 1  in the third quarter 
Earnings Whisper
Our proven model does not conclusively show that D R  Horton is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  However  that is not the case here as you will see below 
Negative Zacks ESP  D R  Horton s Earnings ESP is  1 52  as the Most Accurate Estimate stands at 65 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 66 cents 
Zacks Rank  D R  Horton s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise 
Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Rank  4 and 5  Sell rated stocks  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies in the broader construction sector that can be considered as our proven model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

180322,401838,DHI,Housing Market Review  All About The New Home Sales,opinion,"The last Housing Market Review covered data released in March  2016  At the time  the iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  was accompanying the market on an extended rally from the February lows  Resistance at the 200 day moving average  DMA  slowed down the advance  In April  ITB cleanly broke through resistance only to come to a halt after a promising gap up  I took profits on a few more positions in home builders as  wound down down  ITB stayed resilient and hung around just long enough until a double catalyst of soaring new home sales and strong earnings from Toll Brothers Inc  NYSE TOL  generated a fresh breakout on tremendous volume 
iShares US Home Construction  ITB  breaks out from 50 and 200 day moving average resistance on buying volume that has not been this large since the recovery from August s flash crash 
Suddenly  the trade on home builders has taken on new life even as time ticks down to the next rate hike from the Federal Reserve  From a strictly technical perspective  ITB is a strong buy all over again  buying on all dips as long as ITB stays above 50 and 200DMA support makes plenty of sense  I have adjusted my strategy accordingly 
   April  2016
In the last Housing Market Review I noted how a plunge in housing starts completed a series of bad signs in housing indicators  This month  starts stabilized to cling to the overall uptrend  Given the breakout in new home sales  see below   starts should succeed in keeping close to trend 
Privately owned housing starts for 1 unit structures came in at 778 000 for April  The March 1 unit starts were revised downward to 753 000 from 764 000  So  the month over month change was a gain of 3 6   The year over year growth was 4 3   The chart below shows the strong uptrend remains in place 

After a large tumble  housing starts cling to the current uptrend
Source  US  Bureau of the Census  Privately Owned Housing Starts  1 Unit Structures  HOUST1F     May 19  2016 
The West stood out as the big loser for this report  Single unit starts dropped 14  from March  the second monthly drop in a row  Year over year  starts in the West dropped 20   My concerns for the West region continue to grow as a result of this poor all around performance  On the other hand  the South completely surprised me with an astounding 16  year over year jump that was also a 9  monthly gain  Is a new migration from the West to the South underway 
Existing Home Sales   April  2016
With April delivering a second straight month of gains for existing home sales  February s large month over month drop is confirmed as a blip  Despite the gains  the National Association of Realtors  NAR  was back to worrying about constrained housing supply and increasing prices 

 The temporary relief from mortgage rates currently near three year lows has helped preserve housing affordability this spring  but there s growing concern a number of buyers will be unable to find homes at affordable prices if wages don t rise and price growth doesn t slow  

With the momentum returning in time for the Spring selling season  single family homes performed well with a 6 2  year over year gain  The 4 81M homes sold was 0 6  above March s pace  Total existing home sales had an interesting regional mix on a year over year basis  The Midwest and Northeast soared 12 1  and 17 5  respectively  However  both the South and the West experienced slight declines of 2 7  and 1 7  respectively  While the South gets a pass given strength in other categories  this breakdown keeps the West on my  caution  list 
The wild ride for exiting home sales may be ending on a high note

Although housing inventory increased 9 2  from the prior month  inventory is still down 3 6  from a year ago  Over the last two months  inventory has had greater year over year and monthly drops  Yet  months of inventory increased again  this time from 4 4 to 4 7 months of supply  This level remains far short of the 6 months typically indicative of a balanced market  As a result  prices continue pushing upward  April s 6 3  year over year increase in the median price of an existing home represents the 50th consecutive month of year over year increases 
Individual investors dropped again as a share of sales  from February s 18  to March s 14   to April s 13   This share is still above the 12  trough in August  2015  Recall that February s 18  share was the highest since April  2014 
First time homebuyers trickled higher  Their share of purchases increased from 30  in March to 32  in April  The average for 2015 was 30   Perhaps as interest rates move higher again  first timers will come out in a larger numbers to get ahead of the rate cycle 
 video report not available at the time of writing 
New Residential Sales   April  2016 This month was ALL about the new home sales  Sure existing home sales were encouraging  but new home sales blew the roof off  Frankly  I was expecting nothing but disappointment given the lukewarm housing numbers in recent months 
New single family home sales for April soared 16 6  above March s level and a whopping 23 8  year over year  This is a dramatic turn around from three straight monthly declines which housing bears overplayed  The 619 000 new homes sold takes the housing market all the way back to January  2008 when sales hit 627 000 in the first month of the Great Recession  I earlier assumed new single family home sales would settle into a range  This breakout stands out as very bullish  but I want to see home buyers sustain this momentum in coming months before I get too excited  For example  did the industry pull in future sales somehow  Regardless  this burst of buying could also put the seasonal trade on home builders back in play  Stay tuned on that one New home sales surge to a level unsurpassed since January  2008

New home inventory plummeted to 4 7 months after sitting at 5 8 months for two straight months  The next big question is whether home builders will use this surge in activity as an opportunity to more aggressively push prices in strong markets 
Three of the four regions contributed to April s strong performance  While the Northeast  South  and West jumped 323   18   and 24  respectively year over year  the Midwest was a big laggard by managing a 9  decline  Given the Northeast contributed so heavily to April s performance  I am expecting May to deliver numbers more in line with the range going into April  The Northeast is off to a hot start this year with year over year changes of 100    4   and 30  in the first three months of the year  The West has proven exceptionally volatile with year over year changes of  24    10   and  21  to start the year  Perhaps May will prove to be a down month and further contribute to more tame aggregate new home sales 
Home Builder Confidence  The Housing Market Index  May  2016
The Housing Market Index  HMI  has essentially flatlined with a reading of 58 for the fourth consecutive month  Underneath this stabilization is the encouraging sign of single family detached 6 months continuing a very slight rebound  The single family detached present is still locked in a downtrend  This persistent drop is VERY surprise in the context of the strong new home sales for April  thus  one more reason to expect May sales to return to recent norms  The rebound in the traffic of prospective buyers has flattened out  The Spring selling season failed to renew upward momentum in the HMI  In the last Review  I noted that the numbers seemed to confirm a plateau for HMI  I believe in this projection even more firmly now 
The Spring selling season completely failed to breath new life into home builder sentiment
Source  The National Association of Home Builders  NAHB 
In May  the three month moving averages for regional HMI scores for the South and Midwest perked up by a point and reversed the previous month s one point loss  The West stopped the 2 point bleed from the previous month by holding steady  The Northeast was the laggard with a 3 point loss that follows a 2 point loss in the previous month  Given the apparent slowing in the West  I am surprised sentiment there did not continue to decline as it has in the Northeast  The overall decline in sentiment in the Northeast contrasts with the strong year over year showing there so far in 2016 
Parting thoughts Until this review  I had concluded that the data and trading technicals were flashing signs of caution for trades on home builders  I even claimed  I just think the odds for near term upside no longer out weight the near term risks I think ITB has plateaued for the seasonal trade   I now find myself with just two remaining positions  TRI Pointe Homes Inc  NYSE TPH   still maintaining patience  and Toll Brothers  TOL  
In the last review  I labeled Toll Brothers as a  huge enigma  given its low valuation and steep discount to recent multi year highs  The market s positive response to TOL s earnings was encouraging  but it only returns the stock to around its price during the last Review  The strong buying volume and fresh 50DMA breakout suggests TOL should stay above water for a while 
Toll Brothers  TOL  jumps 8 7  in a post earnings move the places the stock back to levels last seen in April
With the builders having such a good day  I reviewed my entire list of housing related charts  Surprisingly enough  DR Horton Inc  NYSE DHI  is the only stock of the bunch that is cleanly clearing out overhead resistance  If I go for another individual stock   not likely as long as the seasonal trade home builders is inactive   DHI will top the list 
D R  Horton  DHI  is bullishly positioned above resistance  Note however how the market has initially responded negatively to the last two earnings reports 
Be careful out there

180323,401839,DHI,Can Surging Housing ETFs Withstand Fed Hike Worry ,opinion,"Sales are picking up in the housing sector with the spring selling season in full swing  New U S  single family home sales logged the biggest leap in  in April  Sales of new single family homes rose 16 6  to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6 19 000 units in April  which is more than an eight year high 
	Moreover  existing home sales rose for the second straight month in April  beating the consensus estimate of  units for the month  Sales rose 1 7  from the revised level of March  If this was not enough  the median sales price inched up 9 7  year over year to  321 100 in the month  while the average sales price climbed 6  to  379 800 What Drives Home Sales 
	A healing labor market coupled with improving wage gains must have helped buyers to go on a house buying spree  Hourly earnings in April rose 0 3  month over month and 2 5  year over year  The 5  unemployment rate and positive momentum in average wage growth explains the surge behind home sales 
	Moreover  the U S  economy has delivered a host of upbeat economic readings in the field of retail and consumer sentiment  This speaks about buyers  positive outlook on economic well being  read    
	Added to this  mortgage rates are presently at subdued levels  The monthly average commitment rate of 30 year fixed rate mortgages was   down from 3 69  seen in March and 3 67  recorded in April 2015  as per Freddie Mac  The mortgage rates are way below the historical levels  read    What Lies Ahead  
	With growing possibilities of the Fed hiking rates in a month or two  fears of rising mortgage rates will be back into play  Considering a likely Fed move  even if mortgage rates rise in the latter half of the year   as is widely anticipated   housing should still be reasonable 
	Apartment rental rates have jumped considerably in the last few months  Overall  rents rose  between April 2015 and April 2016  If the trend continues  the lure for home buying should be more than renting 
	Also  even if mortgage rates rise post Fed hike  it would be much lower than the historic levels before 2000  Mortgage rates of about 7  to 8  were usual then for the month of April  read    
	Yes  low inventory is still an issue for the housing sector which is why prices shot up amid higher demand  But we believe that the supply scenario should improve ahead given an increase in buying  Notably  housing earnings released in the last one two months also came in strong  read    Play the Sector

180345,401861,DHI,Buy Housing ETFs on Upbeat Earnings  Existing Home Sales Data,opinion,"The housing sector appears in a great shape as evident by the recent volley of decent data points and upbeat earnings  Spring has been really good for the sector as existing home sales rose  registering gains in all the four regions in March and breezing past economists  projection of a 3 5  rise  An improving supply scenario  a healing job market and a still low interest rate environment made this recoil possible 

The sector also falls in the top 41  in the Zacks Industry Universe   If this was not enough  housing earnings released lately also point to a surge in the key spring selling season  Below we peek into the assuring earnings picture of the sector  read    
Inside Housing Earnings
D R  Horton    NYSE DHI     one of the biggest and well known homebuilders in the nation  came up with solid fiscal second quarter 2016 results on April 21 before the bell and raised its profit guidance  The housing company s earnings and sales beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate  Shares inched up 1 15  in the key trading session of April 21  read    

D R  Horton s adjusted earnings of  0 52 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 47 and grew 30  year over year driven by strong profits and higher home sales 

Homebuilding revenues of  2 7 billion increased 15 5  while total revenue  homebuilding and financial services  of  2 77 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 68 billion  Home sales also expanded 15 8  year over year to  2 69 billion backed by both pricing gains and higher home deliveries  Net sales orders increased 10  

While the company retained the fiscal 2016 revenue guidance  it raised the expectation for pre tax profit margin to a range of  from its previous expectation of 10 5  to 11 0   SG A ratio is now expected within 9 0 9 2   which is better than 9 2 9 4  projected earlier 
Another construction company PulteGroup Inc  NYSE PHM      also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues in the first quarter of 2016  for the second quarter in a row  First quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of  0 24 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 19  Moreover  reported earnings increased 60  from the year ago quarter on the back of higher home sales and lower share count  Its revenues of  1 43 billion  up 26 6  year over year  beat the estimate of  1 36 billion ETF Impact 
The bullishness over such an important homebuilding stocks like DHI and a overall beat from PHM should shower gains on the broad housing ETFs  These include SPDR S P Homebuilders ETF     iShares U S  Home Construction ETF    and PowerShares Dynamic Building   Construction Fund    with a Zacks ETF Rank  2  Buy   read    
DHI has 4 46  weight in XHB and takes the first spot in ITB with a 12 01  weight  PHM takes 4 37  of XHB and 7 71  of ITB  There is another product  UBS ETRACS ISE Exclusively Homebuilders ETN     the underlying index of which invests 9 91  of its weight in D R  Horton and 8 64  in Pulte Homes  HOMX has a Zacks ETF Rank  3  Hold  
Bottom Line 
DHI has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and a Growth and Value score of  B  each while PHM has a Zacks Rank  3 but a Value score of  B  and Growth score of  F   So  if investors find it tough to decide whether they should go for these stocks or not as investing matrices are mixed  they can easily bet on the afore mentioned top rated ETFs 

Agreed  the  and permits data for March were underwhelming  But several analysts are downplaying this reading and are hopeful of an  April rebound   Thus  investors who believe that companies like D R  Horton can establish a wining trend ahead can invest in housing ETFs like XHB and ITB  Investors can always go for a single stock pick  but a basket approach will safeguard them against stock specific volatility and gives industry wide exposure

180375,401891,DHI,Is This Lagging Sector Ready To Lead ,opinion,"Fundamental And Technical Alignment 
From a probability perspective  the best investment ideas tend to be those with improving fundamentals and improving technicals  charts   On the fundamental side  the news has been improving for homebuilders  From Fox Business 

DR Horton Inc   NYSE DHI   the largest U S  homebuilder  reported better than expected quarterly revenue and said orders jumped 38 percent  suggesting an uptick in housing demand  The company  which caters to people buying their first or second homes  said the number of homes sold rose 25 percent to 8 612 in the fourth quarter ended Sept  30  Luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers Inc   NYSE TOL  said on Monday its orders jumped in terms of both dollars and units for the first time in four quarters 

From Laggard To Leader 
The weekly chart below shows the performance of homebuilders relative to the S P 500 Index  The trend turned against homebuilders in early March 2014  Since the October low in stocks  rather than lagging  homebuilders have been leading  The three steps required for a bullish trend change are nearing completion   1  a break of a trendline   2  a higher low  and  3  a higher high  The weekly higher high does not officially go into the books until this Friday  meaning homebuilders still have some work to finish 

Similar improvement can be seen when comparing the performance of homebuilders to a basket of bonds  ARCA AGG   

We would hope that investing in homebuilders would be better than a strategy to short the S P 500  NYSE SH    Until recently  that was not the case as the  NYSE ITB  SH ratio was making a series of lower highs and lower lows  see chart below   The trend is trying to turn in the favor of homebuilders 

How Do We Use All This 
Investing is about probabilities  The improving fundamental and technicals in the housing sector tell us the odds of success in that sector are also improving  It should be noted that even if the weekly trends continue and homebuilders lead  that does not remove normal retracements and pullbacks from the equation  The odds of good things happening in homebuilders are better today than they were in early October  From a bigger picture perspective  the improvements in the market s tolerance for risk outlined on  and November 7 still apply ",2014-11-12,Chris Ciovacco,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-this-lagging-sector-ready-to-lead-232265,232265
180377,401893,DHI,Christmas Inspired Buys,opinion,"Kris Kringle  aka Santa Claus  played incredibly well by Edmund Gwenn  played a major role in convincing little Susan Walker  played by Natalie Wood  what Christmas was really about and along the way proving he was the real deal  He did this at THE  NYSE Macy  s store at 34 street in Manhattan  That store is still going strong  a national chain and the stock is giving you an entry point in its trend higher 

The weekly chart shows that the next leg higher will target a move to 73 50 and there is support from a rising and bullish RSI and MACD  The Point and Figure chart suggests that may just be a first move as it carries a price objective to at least 86  But that is not the only trade inspired buy this movie 

Remember how it ends  Susan Walker makes her mother pull over in front of a house for sale and immediately knows that Santa left it for her and her mother  Doris  Maureen O Hara  and her suitor Fred  John Payne   This was a DR Horton  NYSE DHI  house  And D R  Horton stock is also ready to move 

This stock has been moving in a tightening symmetrical triangle since May last year  and approaching the top  It recently retraced 38 2  of a completed bearish Shark harmonic and is moving back up  You could buy it against a stop loss at the December low or wait for a break over the triangle  By the way  that would target a move to 36 
Merry Christmas to everyone ",2014-12-24,Gregory W. Harmon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/christmas-inspired-buys-236801,236801
180378,401894,DHI,3 Homebuilder Dividend Stocks With Hidden High Yields,opinion,"With all of the recent market volatility and dividend cuts in Energy related dividend stocks  income investors are looking to other sectors for income stability 
 We maintain  which feature many high yielding stocks for each sector  
Although it s not known for having any high dividend stocks  you may want to consider the Housing industry for some income plays and potential price appreciation 
We ve found 3 homebuilder stocks which have been beating the S P 500 over the past week  month and quarter  Two of these three stocks have also outperformed the market over the past year 
Strong Growth Ahead in Housing  Economists are predicting a big rise in household formations in 2015  a key figure for Housing  IHS predicts that 2015 will see the addition of 1 08 million new households  with economic growth driving up the rate of new formation  Single family housing production is expected to rise 26  in 2015  DR Horton Inc  NYSE DHI  and PulteGroup Inc  NYSE PHM  both get a large part of their revenue from sales in warmer states  where home sales growth is expected to continue to outpace national growth  at a pace of 24   Toll Brothers Inc  NYSE TOL  caters more to the upscale market  and has good exposure to the high end areas of New York City and Washington  DC 
Dividends  PHM cut its quarterly dividend from 2009 through 2012  and reinstated in August 2013 at   05  It maintained it at   05 until December 2014  when it raised it by 60   to   08  TOL doesn t pay a dividend yet  but  as you ll see further below  it does have attractive options yields 
Covered Calls Options  You can greatly improve upon these quarterly dividends by selling options  These 3 trades all have call premiums which pay much more than PHM s or DHI s next quarterly dividends  In fact  the DHI call option pays over 15 times DHI s next 2 quarterly dividend payouts 
Since its  26 00 call strike is   86 above DHI s  25 14 price per share  this trade also offers you some potential price gains  Here are the income and gains yields for the 3 main scenarios in this trade 
Cash Secured Put Options  In addition to giving you immediate income  selling cash secured put options below a stock s price can also give you a lower breakeven for a stock  However  you won t receive any dividends  as you would when selling covered call options  As with selling calls  your account will usually be credited for the option premiums the same day  vs  waiting for the quarterly dividends 
Valuations  All 3 stocks have strong earnings growth forecasts for their coming fiscal year  Given their low forward PEG values  PHM and TOL look more undervalued than DHI on a PEG basis 
Earnings Dates  DHI and PHM should be reporting later in January  TOL has the best record for earnings beats over the past 4 quarters 
Financials  It s a mixed bag here  with DHI leading for Return On Equity  but PHM leading by far on ROI
