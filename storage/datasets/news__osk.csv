Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Please turn to Slide 3  and I ll turn it over to you  Wilson Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerThank you Pat  Good morning everyone  I m going to start by welcoming Mike Pack who will soon be joining our executive leadership team  As you are aware  they Dave Sagehorn  our long standing CFO and my partner on earnings calls and investor meetings  will be retiring this spring  We re fortunate to have somebody Mike s caliber stepping into this important position  Mike has been with Oshkosh since 2006 and for the last eight years  has been the Vice President of Finance of our Fire   Emergency segment  He has been a major contributor to the success and record operating income margins that  that segment has achieved  We all look forward to Mike assuming the bigger leadership role in the coming months  I ll share some comments on my friend Dave later in this call We are pleased to announce a solid first quarter and a good start to the year as we kick off 2020  First quarter earnings per share of  1 10 was in line with our expectations and supportive of our full year outlook  but down compared to last year s first quarter  Our team members were focused on executing and delivering on our commitments in light of tough comps in the Defense segment and expected moderation of demand in our Access Equipment segment  I m proud of the efforts of all Oshkosh team members and our people first culture in helping deliver these results  It s still early in the year  but there are a number of positive items that give us confidence in reaffirming our full year earnings per share estimate range of  7 30 to  8 10 that Dave will talk about in more detail in a few minutes Some of those items include the first quarter results that were in line with our expectations as I noted  This provides a stable start to the year  Our Access Equipment team successfully concluded negotiations with most of their key rental company customers  John will talk more about that  Three of our segments had backlog levels of at least  1 billion as we exited the quarter providing good visibility into the upcoming quarters  And finally  we ve seen signs of stabilization in macroeconomic data  and it appears that many economists are lowering their odds of a recession happening in the US in 2020  These examples illustrate what we consider Oshkosh to be a different integrated global industrial  All in  we re pleased with how the year has started and continue to believe the 2020 will be another good year for the Oshkosh Corporation Please turn to Slide 4 to begin a discussion for each of our business segments  I ll start off with the Defense  Our Defense segment highlights for the quarter led by the continued ramp up of JLTV production as we deliver these high tech  next generation defense vehicles to our US government customer  We are on track to produce 4 000 to 4 500 JLTVs in 2020 as both the US Army and Marine Corps continue to integrate these units into the forces During the quarter  we received the JLTV order for just over  800 million that includes a small number of units for the country of Montenegro  This is important because it represents the first order we received for international JLTVs  There are a number of other potential JLTV international orders in various stages of progress that we expect will be finalized in the coming quarters  It s a very exciting time for the JLTV team  and they are working hard to successfully execute this important program  Government testing continues on the FMTV A2 program  and we are pleased with the improvements that the vehicle is demonstrating  We are still producing the current A1P2 version and expect to do so into 2021 before we begin the transition to the next generation version  the A2 In December  President Trump signed the fiscal 2020 budget  which included favorable funding for Oshkosh defense programs  Both the FMTV and FHTV programs were funded higher levels than the original FY  20 President s budget requests  These additional funds  approximately  66 million and  100 million respectively  will benefit our defense business primarily in 2021 and beyond Let s turn to Slide 5  And I ll pass it to John to discuss our non defense segments John C  Pfeifer    Executive Vice President   Chief Operating OfficerThanks  Wilson  And good morning everyone  Our Access Equipment team delivered impressive results for the quarter despite lower sales  The team did a great job effectively managing the lower demand level  achieving higher operating income and higher operating income margin  Sales were lower year over year in North America  Europe  Africa and Middle East regions  but in line with expectations  We are seeing more moderation of orders than we originally expected in Europe  and we ll continue to monitor that region  The Asia Pacific region led by China continued to be a bright spot with strong sales growth again this quarter  The catalyst in China remains product adoption  which is driven by safety and productivity improvements provided by these products We are expanding our production capacity in China  which we expect to be completed in the next year to support this vibrant and growing market  We concluded annual negotiations with most of our key rental company customers during the quarter  The negotiations went largely as expected with demand requirements supportive of our outlook for the year  We booked orders of more than  1 3 billion this quarter  the third highest order quarter in this segment s history and exited the quarter with backlog of slightly more than  1 billion  While both Q1 orders and ending backlog are down from last year  there has been moderation in the rate of decline  Additionally  we continue to believe the market is reverting to a more normal order pattern after several years of unusually large orders early in the fiscal year The team at JLG is busy building new machines that are ANSI 92 20 compliant  although the effective date of the new requirements is now March instead of the previously planned December 2019  There have been several pushouts for the safety standard  and we remain hopeful that the compliance date will not move again Another key event takes place in March  With once every three years construction equipment trade show  CONEXPO  we will be introducing new innovative products and services at this show as we host customers and other visitors from around the world  We look forward to seeing you in Las Vegas  If you plan to travel to the show  it will be a very special and worthwhile event Please turn to Slide 6 for a discussion of the Fire   Emergency segment  Our Fire   Emergency team posted a solid quarter characterized by strong order growth and an all time high backlog  but they also dealt with some challenges caused by a supplier issue during the quarter  One of Pierce s suppliers was not able to meet its delivery commitments  which led Pierce to modify its production schedules  The team was able to adjust production to best serve our fire department customers  but this led to lower than expected sales as well as production inefficiencies  Fortunately  this supplier challenges now behind us and we do not expect it to impact full year results As I just mentioned  both orders and backlog were very strong this quarter  Year over year  orders were higher by more than 70   leading to a record backlog of just over  1 1 billion at the end of the quarter  These figures are even more impressive when taken in context against the current sluggish international order environment  particularly in countries where trade dynamics have slowed demand for US fire trucks  When these trade issues get sorted out  we expect improved international order rates as well  Looking to the remainder of 2020  we continue to expect flattish to slight growth in the fire truck market in North America and maintain our positive long term outlook for the business Please turn to Slide 7  and we ll talk about our Commercial segment  Our Commercial team is off to a good start in 2020 as they continue their simplification journey to strengthen operating income margins  The concrete mixer team launched a new flagship front discharge mixer  our S series 2 0 in 2019 and is ramping up production from pilot phase  The new model builds on the rich legacy of the product  but also brings measurable improvements in visibility  maneuverability  payload and serviceability  to name just a few of the key features  Orders have been strong  and the team will be displaying the vehicle to customers with the upcoming World of Concrete and CONEXPO shows in Las Vegas RCV orders were up in the quarter  evidencing a continued solid RCV market  Concrete mixer orders were down  but we attribute that to our simplification strategy and timing as several large customers placed orders for the upcoming construction season in January this year versus December in fiscal 2019  We continue to expect the RCV and concrete mixer markets in 2020 to be similar to 2019 at levels even with or slightly above the long term average for RCVs and below the long term average for concrete mixers accompanied by some continued choppiness This wraps it up for our business segments  I m going to turn it over to Dave to discuss our first quarter results and outlook for 2020 in greater detail David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThanks  John  and good morning everyone  Please turn to Slide 8  As Wilson noted  first quarter results were in line with our expectations  We commented on our last earnings call that we expected first quarter results to be meaningfully lower than last year  Importantly  however  these results support our unchanged earnings per share outlook for the full year that I ll discuss in a few minutes Consolidated net sales for the quarter were  1 7 billion  down 6  from the prior year quarter  Lower Access Equipment sales were the primary driver of the lower consolidated sales  Access Equipment sales reflected rental company customers in North America slowing down their capital expenditures for fleet growth  Sales in the EAME region were also down from the prior year  while the segment experienced continued strong sales growth in the Asia Pacific region  Defense sales growth in the quarter reflected the continued JLTV production ramp  partially offset by lower FHTV sales  Fire   Emergency sales were lower  due to favorable sales timing in the prior year  And Commercial segment sales were slightly higher than the prior year  driven by a higher mix of package sales  partially offset by lower concrete mixer sales Consolidated operating income for the first quarter was  109 1 million or 6 4  of sales  compared to  160 5 million or 8 9  of sales in the prior year quarter  Access Equipment was the standout from an earnings perspective as they delivered  2 6 million higher operating income and 160 basis points higher operating income margin on a 13  decline in sales  Favorable price cost  favorable product mix and improved operational efficiencies more than offset the negative impact of lower sales As we expected  Defense operating income declined significantly compared to the prior year  The decline was more about last year when Defense received a very large order for JLTVs  Upon receipt of that order  the Defense team recorded the cumulative catch up adjustment to the program margin to reflect a near doubling of the number of units on contract  The Defense team received the JLTV order again in the first quarter of this year  but the quantity of units ordered was not as large as last year and the impact of the cumulative adjustment to the program margin was not as large For comparison  the orders    order this year increased the quantity of units ordered life to date of the program by slightly more than 25  compared to a doubling of the quantity ordered life to date when the order was received last year  Additional drivers of the lower year over year results for this segment include a higher mix of JLTVs as that program continues to ramp production  a favorable resolution of contract compliance matters in the prior year that didn t repeat this year and higher new product development spending  There were quite a few drivers for the year over year change in Defense results this quarter  but the important thing to keep in mind  however  is our full year outlook for this segment has not changed Fire   Emergency first quarter operating income declined compared to last year  due to the lower sales volume  along with higher SG A costs  an adverse sales mix and inefficiencies related to the previously discussed supplier issue  These were partially offset by positive pricing Commercial segment first quarter operating income compared to the prior year reflects an adverse product mix  higher new product development spend and a prior year favorable warranty reserve adjustment that did not repeat  partially offset by improved price cost Earnings per share for the quarter was  1 10 compared to adjusted earnings per share of  1 61 in the first quarter of 2019  Lower earnings per share was driven largely by the lower sales and the impact of the large JLTV order received in the prior year  First quarter results benefited by  0 06 per share from share repurchases completing in the    completed in the prior 12 months Please turn to Slide 9 for a review of our updated expectations for fiscal 2020  As noted earlier  we are maintaining our full year earnings per share estimate range of  7 30 to  8 10  First quarter results that were in line with our expectations support the unchanged full year earnings per share estimate range  Additionally  Access Equipment orders in the quarter were also in line with what we are expecting  However  we are slightly reducing the high end of the Access Equipment estimate    sales estimate range by  50 million to  3 75 billion to reflect lower expected sales in the EAME region versus our previous expectations  At the same time  we are increasing the high end of the operating income margin estimate range by 25 basis points to 12 5  as we believe the segment can deliver the previous implied operating income on the slightly lower sales  We believe backlogs in our other segments also support our full year outlook for the individual segments and overall We re reaffirming the estimated tax rate of 21 25  to 21 50   although we currently believe the rate will be near the high end of the range  Our estimated capital expenditures of  150 million remain unchanged as does our free cash flow estimate of  450 million  We repurchased a small amount of shares in the first quarter and continue to expect that we will return half of our free cash flow this year to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases Turning to the outlook for the second quarter  we expect flattish sales compared to the prior year as Defense sales growth should offset lower Access Equipment segment sales  We expect earnings will be modestly lower compared to the prior year  reflecting the mix impact of higher Defense sales and lower Access Equipment sales I ll turn it back over to Wilson now for some closing comments Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Dave  Another solid quarter  driven by our teams  execution  We reaffirmed our outlook for 2020  which includes expectations for solid earnings per share in the year when demand in our largest segment will be down  We have the right strategy with the move and believe we can manage our businesses to deliver solid sales and earnings performance despite the lower demand in our Access Equipment segment  And we believe we are investing in the right places to best position Oshkosh to take advantage when conditions improve in that market Also  we ll take this opportunity to thank Dave  This will be his last quarterly earnings call  We re going to miss him  Dave helped lead our Company through numerous economic and industry challenges and he partnered with all of our leadership at Oshkosh to make Oshkosh the great company it is today  We appreciate all of his many contributions and the support he will provide even after he begins his next chapter  We are truly grateful for the hard work  dedication to task and commitment to integrity and teamwork the Dave has demonstrated in his 20 years with our Company  Thank you  Dave I ll turn it back over to Pat to get the Q A started Patrick Davidson    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Wilson   Operator Instructions  Operator  please begin the question and answer period of this call Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  We will now be conducting a question and answer session   Operator Instructions  Thank you  Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies  Please proceed with your question  Stephen Volkmann  your line is live Stephen Volkmann    Jefferies    AnalystAre you guys  can you hear me  Sorry about that  I was on mute Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Good morning  Steve Stephen Volkmann    Jefferies    AnalystGood morning  And Dave  congrats  All the best  And Mike  welcome David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Steve  Appreciate it Stephen Volkmann    Jefferies    AnalystAnd Dave  before you go  maybe I can get you to explain something to me  I m kind of figure out how this Defense accounting works because I guess I was assuming that having an order this quarter would have bumped your margin slightly above sort of full year guidance because you d have that catch up albeit lower than last year  but obviously your guidance kind of assumes that the Defense margin increases going forward sequentially  So I guess  I m just trying to figure out how that works  A and B  is it stable from here over the next three quarters or does it continue to bounce around assuming no more orders  Thank you David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Unfortunately  as we ve talked about previously  the whole revenue recognition standard ASC 606 has introduced a new level of volatility into the Defense segment for us and what we ve been very consistent about when talking about the segment is that new standard was implemented is  think about the full year guidance  there is going to be things from quarter to quarter that we ve seen in the past  You ve seen this quarter  and you re likely going to see in future quarters  That just on the surface may make you scratch your head a little bit  but in the context of the full year  everything still holds together  We ve got a great backlog  we re about 90     I think 98  booked for the year  So we know what s coming at us  The wild cards typically are the timing of orders  and when we got the JLTV order in the first quarter  we did note in that release that we are expecting additional JLTV orders later in the quarter  That s still the case  The President s serve    the fiscal  20 budget was finalized in the first quarter  So we will expect additional orders from our other programs as well  Some of the things we talked about in the prepared remarks  the higher NPD  Phonetic  in the quarter  so that certainly was a drag  I know last year  we had the favorable resolution of a contract compliance matter  There is a number of    just a number of moving pieces in there  but as we look at the remainder of the year given the visibility that we have  we feel really good about the year  It is going to be    continue to be lumpy from a quarter to quarter basis  because we know the orders are going to come in  We don t necessarily know  are they going to be the second quarter  the third quarter  but on a full year basis  we feel good Stephen Volkmann    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  And again  I guess  assuming we get an order  all things being equal  that would bump the margin up relative to not getting an order David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerAll things being equal  that is the case  but if you think about going forward  Steve  another thing that is going to help us from a margin standpoint  this was the lowest sales quarter in the year for Defense  When you look at the implied guidance for the remainder of the year  that would say just if you spread it out equally that on average  remaining quarters are going to be up about 15  above where the first quarter was from a sales standpoint  So we will benefit from improved absorption in those quarters as well  And then the NPD impact probably shouldn t be as pronounced as we saw on margins in the first quarter and the upcoming quarters Stephen Volkmann    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  So in Q2  is there anything we should keep in mind relative to Defense margin David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerWell  we will look at timing of orders  and again  we re not in control of when the government places those orders  We re confident that we will get those during the year  What we can t say definitively is whether they re going to start coming in in the second quarter or the third quarter Stephen Volkmann    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  I appreciate it David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerRight  Thanks  Steve Patrick Davidson    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Steve OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel  Please proceed with your question Stanley Elliott    Stifel Nicolaus    AnalystHey  good morning  guys  Thank you for taking the question  Dave  first  our best wishes  And Mike  welcome aboard David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Stanley Stanley Elliott    Stifel Nicolaus    AnalystI was wondering if you guys could start  nice performance here on the margin side within the Access business  Is there a way to parse out how much of that was mix versus maybe favorable steel  And then with the lot of the restructuring you ve done over the past several years  could you remind us again on what sort of a detrimental margin would look like kind of on a go forward basis under kind of the current framework David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerOkay  But if I missed some of those Stanley  please just remind me  So first quarter performance as we called out on the prepared materials  price cost  favorable mix  operational efficiencies  all helped us offset the impact of the lower sales  From a price cost standpoint  last year at this time  we were still    in the first quarter still working through the remainder of some of that price protected backlog that we had in place when the surcharges were implemented  So that was a little bit of a tailwind for us in the quarter  We won t benefit from that going forward obviously  as we will have worked through all of that year over year change  But the big thing that I think kind of sticks out versus what we ve seen in the last couple of quarters is really that mix  It was certainly a more favorable mix weighting toward aerial work platforms If you recall last year  we were very strong in telehandlers and part of that was due to kind of a recovery after we had made the movement of production of telehandlers in the prior year  So when I look at versus the fourth quarter or the third quarter of fiscal  19  that one kind of really sticks out at me as something that was a nice contributor for us In terms of the detrimental margins going forward  part of that is going to depend on product  customer  region mix  which you would expect  but kind of a rule of thumb that we ve talked about is a good place to start is maybe that low to mid 20  detrimental margin and then we adjusted from what we re seeing in the other areas around that and then any impact of operational issues or    I m sorry  initiatives that we ve been working on  When I look at the upcoming quarters  the detrimental margins  I would say  are still pretty good in the remainder of the year So I think the Access Equipment team is doing a good job of really managing the overall business  be it from the price cost standpoint  they re continuing to execute on a lot of those initiatives  We re going to continue to see benefits from those going forward  We will lap later this fiscal year some of the operational benefits from the operational initiatives that we put in place for in fiscal  19  So that s why the implied decrementals aren t going to look quite as good as we saw in the first quarter or that s one of the reasons why they won t look quite as good  but there s still  I would say  on a relative scale implied healthy detrimentals in Q2 through Q4 Stanley Elliott    Stifel Nicolaus    AnalystYeah  no doubt  I asked a lot in there    in the interest of time  I m sure there s a lot of the people in queue I will pass it along  but congratulations and best of luck  guys David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThanks Patrick Davidson    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Stan OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse  Please proceed with your question Jamie Cook    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  good morning  Congratulations  Dave  I wish you the best of luck  And welcome  Mike  But I guess my question just in terms of the commentary you guys have talked about on the Access Equipment side in North America in particular telling you  you have a pretty good feel for how your customers are thinking about  The year    I mean is all of that number sort of reflected in backlog or are they  sort of  Can you talk more broadly how they re thinking about capex in 2020 in particular with CONEXPO coming up  I would assume that be a favorable event for you guys in terms of potential orders  And then just the weakness that you sort of noted in Europe  can you just talk to sort of the order trends that you saw in Europe in the quarter  I mean  then last on Fire   Emergency  you noted you had the inefficiency associated with the supplier  If you could just provide any color on how much that impacted the quarter and do we catch up for that in the second quarter John C  Pfeifer    Executive Vice President   Chief Operating OfficerOkay  So good morning  This is John Pfeifer  I will attempt to answer that  So if I miss something  I ll try to come back to it  So let me start on Access  If we look at the outlook for Access  Q2 through Q4  we think we have a very responsible outlook and Dave just talked about the favorable decrementals in this business  Let me tell    our customer negotiations are largely complete  We booked  1 3 billion in orders in our backlog  over  1 billion  we feel good about that  Let me kind of give you the underlying what s underneath that  First of all  economically  we feel that economic indicators have shifted a little bit in our favor  Economic forecast is pretty good  Forecast for non residential construction has moved favorable  We saw the really good residential construction stats come out  Just recently  The Dodge Momentum Index has improved  So all that s good From a customer perspective  rental rate and we have very strong relationships with our customers  They are positive  Rental rates are healthy  Utilization is healthy  So we re pleased with the annual negotiations  When you talk about capex for this year  capex is probably a little bit focus more around replacement capex  then it is around growth capex  but we knew that  that s not a surprise to us  That s what we had expected  And then again another thing that we look at a lot of used pricing  We know the used market well because we participate in it  And we feel that used market pricing is fine right now  So that all underpins why we believe we ve got a strong or a responsible outlook  I should say  for the Access market  Now  we took our    the top end of our sales guidance down by  50 million because of Europe Just a couple of comments about Europe  we have a very robust SIOP process  which is underpinned by our forecasting capability in Europe  great relationships with our customers  We got a lot of data points  And we felt some weakness in Q1 on the order rates going forward that caused us to take down the top end of the guidance a little bit  You see what s happening in Europe  probably the reasons for the uncertainty with our customers is Brexit causes uncertainty  Sociopolitical challenges in the region cause a little bit of uncertainty  And I think that s probably the main factor there that s causing a little bit of that weakness in our expected order rates for the rest of the year I think your final point was about F E  F E is doing just fine  The full year is just fine  We had a supplier issue in Q1  which caused us to shift our mix around a little bit  So our mix became less healthy than we normally would expect  It caused our sales to be a little bit lower than we expected because some operational inefficiencies  Those have been worked through  We are fine for the full year  That s behind us  So we feel very  very good about the F E business market today Jamie Cook    Credit Suisse    AnalystThank you  I ll get back in queue Patrick Davidson    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks OperatorOur next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore  Please proceed with your question David Raso    Evercore ISI    AnalystHi  good morning  A question about the Access revenue guide  I mean in the last two years  the backlog was sort of abnormally high after the fiscal first quarter  Well  outside of those last two years  the current backlog you have as a percent of your sales guide  it s the highest you ve had in 10 to 12 years  So it was a little bit higher backlog than I would have thought  but then there s still take the top end of the revenue guide down and you just explained that was Europe centric  but is it also because where order is pulled forward a little bit  maybe due to the ANSI pushback  just trying to understand the strength of the backlog to the revenue guide  but you still chose to take it down  Was there a pull forward in orders to some degree Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerDave  no    not what we were expecting  As we said on the prepared remarks  we are pleased with the orders  Things played out largely as we expected  If anything probably attributing at a little bit too  it s still early  We did see as John mentioned  some things    and heard some things in the quarter out of Europe that led us to think things might be a little weaker there  but overall  the quarter played out as we ve said  largely as expected David Raso    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  Just the backlog is pretty healthy relative to the guide  On the first quarter Access margins  you mentioned all the issues price cost mix  but for the full year aerials are still supposed to grow or be down less  I should say  than telehandlers  Is that still correctly the mix will stay positive for the full year Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  a little positive  Not as positive as we saw in the first quarter David Raso    Evercore ISI    AnalystYeah  the down 9 basis points  Phonetic  versus down 25 basis points   Phonetic  it won t be that wide again  But for the full year  it should still be slightly positive  Okay  All right  Thank you very much  It s really all I had  I ll follow up with Pat  Again congratulations  Dave David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThanks Patrick Davidson    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  David OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan  Please proceed with your question Ann Duignan    J P  Morgan    AnalystYeah  Hi  I m just following up on David s question with the orders so strong in the quarter in Access  Can you talk a little bit about what your lead times are today versus what they might have been a year ago and when would you have to see orders reaccelerate in order to make your full year revenue guide John C  Pfeifer    Executive Vice President   Chief Operating OfficerThis is John  and I ll take that question  So lead times    generally  lead times have come down from their highs of nine to 12 months ago  Most machines today have lead times from two weeks to a few months  But you could probably say average of about 30 days  which again is better than it was a year ago  So that really supports our view that order rates have returned to a more normal pattern versus recently when we ve had these gigantic orders coming in  in the very first part of the year  So we think the order timing has shifted out a little bit and partly because of our lead time situation Ann Duignan    J P  Morgan    AnalystAnd can you tell me what the lead times were a year ago  roughly  more or like 60  90 days  is that extreme David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerIt depends on the product category and in some cases  yes  it was that extreme Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerIf you would recall  and we have shifted our telehandler production consolidated and telehandlers lead times have pushed out quite a bit for us  which is all normalized now Ann Duignan    J P  Morgan    AnalystOkay  And secondly  just a follow up on the commercial side  can you just expand on some of your comments on the mix of that business in the quarter David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerI m sorry  can you repeat that again Ann Duignan    J P  Morgan    AnalystCan you just expand a little bit on the mix of products that you called out in the quarter for commercial  Thank you David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerOkay  Sure  As we said  we saw a little bit of an adverse mix  There was    it was a higher mix of what we call package sales and that s where we sell both our body as well as a third party chassis  and we make our money largely on our bodies  not so much on the third party chassis  So that s    it s a little bit of a drag  RCVs were up year over year and then concrete mixers were down year over year  and that s largely due to timing  We had a couple    when you look at the order pattern in mixers  there were a couple of customers that were conspicuously not in with their orders in the first quarter  They have since come in  in January  and we re off to a good start for orders here in the second quarter for mixer  So a lot of    we attribute a lot of that to just the timing Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerAnother factor in commercial in Q1  which is a    which I think is a positive thing is we were    we had a higher new product development spending in the quarter  We re launching a new S series 2 0 front discharge mixer  which is going to be a great product  that will be at CONEXPO  And as we ramp that  we had higher R D costs in the quarter  We think those are good costs because they are really an investment in the future of that product Ann Duignan    J P  Morgan    AnalystOkay  I ll leave it there in the interest of time  Thank you  I appreciate it David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Ann Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Ann OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank  Please proceed with your question Chad Dillard    Deutsche Bank    AnalystHi  good morning everyone  Dave  good luck Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Chad Chad Dillard    Deutsche Bank    AnalystMike  welcome aboard Michael E  Pack    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThank you Chad Dillard    Deutsche Bank    AnalystSo  I just wanted to dig in on just the cash flow  which came in a little bit lighter than typically normal for season  Can you just talk about the drivers of that and more specifically  you just talk about the quarter over quarter inventory build  And what segments drove that Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerSure  So if you look at the fiscal year  typically  absent any large defense international contracts and cash flows associated with those  the first fiscal quarter is going to be our weakest cash flow quarter of the year  and this year was no different  Inventories are up year over year and that s largely in Access and Defense  A couple of things going on there  One  we    our Defense or Access is carrying a modest amount of what we call pre ANSI inventory as they go into the transition to the new ANSI models coming up because we know just in terms of response to customer feedback in terms of interest in that product yet  so that s one thing there There re also    as you can imagine  given the labor environment today  they are carefully managing their production cadence  along with their workforce levels  We are going to see production down in that segment  We ve known that  we ve talked about that  So we think overall we re in good shape there Defense  it s really more about what s to come yet this fiscal year  If you look at the upcoming quarters  we are going to see sales increase  as I talked about in response to an earlier question  So that s largely just inventory build to support the sales levels that we expect in the coming quarters Chad Dillard    Deutsche Bank    AnalystThat s helpful  And second question is just on    just some of the puts and takes during the quarter  So for example in Access  how much of the JLG amortization  was a tailwind there  And then on the Fire   Emergency  just some of the supplier issues  You talked about some revenue push outs margin impact  Can you quantify that  To what extent  will that actually be a tailwind in 2Q Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerSo on JLG  the amortization  it was a small benefit in the first quarter  We ll see a larger benefit in each of the subsequent quarters in the remainder of the year  In Fire   Emergency  John talked about the adverse mix  We aren t going to quantify what the impact is  but it will be a favorable mix impact to us going forward in the quarter because we did as the    had to move things around  In the first quarter  it did end up being a little bit of an adverse mix versus what we were expecting  And then as John also mentioned  just the efficiencies    or inefficiencies associated with that supplier issue  those will be behind us and will be relative to the first quarter a tailwind in the coming quarters Chad Dillard    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGreat  I ll leave it there  Thanks Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerAll Right  Thanks  Chad OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs  Please proceed with your question Jerry Revich    Goldman Sachs    AnalystYes  Hi  good morning everyone  And David  my congratulations David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThanks Jerry Revich    Goldman Sachs    AnalystAnd just a quick note  Dave  I think the earnings power of the business was about  3 00 or less when you take on the CFO role  So big congratulations to it  the team has done over your tenure  CFO David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerIt takes a village  Jerry Jerry Revich    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHey  can we talk about Access Equipment  I was pleasantly surprised by the bookings this quarter as you heard from others on the call  Do you think you re gaining share  Can you give us a bit more context  Also looks like you had really good performance out of    it looks like Jerr Dan products based on disclosures in the quarter  Can you just expand on those two items  If you don t mind Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerJerry  First of all  I appreciate your comments about Dave  As I ve said  we re going to miss Dave  He has been kind of our rock  but as I also mentioned  we got another good rock coming in  Mike  and he has been under Dave s mentoring for several years  So I think the transition has been well played out and planned  And so    and again  Dave is going to be behind journey forward and still help this some too  So    but again  thanks for that comment  Dave  well deserved retirement  As far as share market  Jerry  we don t    as you know  we don t get into details about that  What I would tell you is we like the way the JLG team is performing in the marketplace  You can see  they ve been very disciplined in pricing and really just taking care of all the things that they can control  We talked last year that we lost a little share in telehandlers  due to that consolidation we made  We are back in good shape with telehandlers now  And this off to CONEXPO  which I hope all of you will come and see us out there  We ve got some exciting new things to introduce  which innovation has been one way that JLG has grown share over the years  So all in all  we like our share position  There s always some deals that we don t get  but sometimes those deals are not the right deals to get from a price cost standpoint And Jerr Dan is a good story there  That s a    if you go back four  five years  that was one of our business units that was really struggling to make money  And through good leadership  good insights  operational excellence  it s been again guided by JLG  that s part of JLG  They re back on track now performing like most of our other business units  So  good story there  They re in a tough marketplace  but we do believe they have gained some share over the last couple of years Jerry Revich    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  And in terms of staying with an access  the outlook for heading into the second quarter here  normal seasonality is for your sales and production to be up about 30  from first quarter levels  Can you just talk about any puts and takes we should keep in mind  given the flows in the backlog compared to that normal seasonality  And if you could comment specifically on what you re seeing in your China business given the unfortunate situation there  That would be helpful David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerI ll start Jerry  And maybe John  Wilson want to add in as well  We do expect to see a seasonal uptick like we normally would  I think we are hearing a few things about Q3 may actually be a little bit stronger than Q2  And that s normal again from a seasonality standpoint  but it almost sounds like we re starting to hear that it might be a little bit more stronger than Q2 than we ve seen in the past few years  But overall  I m not aware of any significant gives and takes  And I don t know  John  Wilson  if you want to add anything about the China antivirus John C  Pfeifer    Executive Vice President   Chief Operating OfficerSo we re on the China situation  We re paying attention to it day by day  maybe even hour by hour  All of our people are fine  Our manufacturing plants are fine  They are planned to come back from Chinese New Year as scheduled  So we will probably have some people working at home in Shanghai until they reopen Shanghai  But let me just go back to our thoughts are with everybody  they re dealing with the situation  We actually think they re dealing with it appropriately  But let me just go back to  China is a great long term story for us  It s a big market  It s going to continue to get bigger  We love the adoption rate trends in China toward our product away from the old methods of construction and working at height  So  long term  we feel great about China  Short term  it s a day by day situation  but at this point in time  we have not been impacted Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerAnd not to be insensitive to the issue going on there  But total consolidated  less than 5  of our revenue  So if it does become a more significant issue  you have the scale  it s less than 5  of our revenue today Jerry Revich    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThank you very much David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Jerry OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Tim Thein with Citigroup  Please proceed with your question Timothy Thein    Citi Research    AnalystThanks  Good morning  Dave  enjoy the time David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThank you Timothy Thein    Citi Research    AnalystSo    yeah  the first question  just to follow back up on Access margins in terms of the    for the full year guidance and based on what you have in backlog today  what is the expectation for price cost that s assumed  I think from memory in FY  19  the pricing was fully offset by material cost  So just curious what that full year expectation is currently David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerOverall  I would say there is an alignment between price cost expectations for the year and we did    I did mention earlier in Q1 about last year  some of the working through the remainder of the price protected backlog  So that s probably a little bit of a benefit  but we tried to look at this holistically from a standpoint of where all of our costs are going  not just deal  There s a lot of other components that go into that  We ve got labor costs and where we are  And so  it s    we try to be responsible with that pricing and I think we are and I think that responsible outlook is baked into the forecast guidance that we provided for the year Timothy Thein    Citi Research    AnalystOkay  All right  And then just on Defense and maybe a bit longer term  but you gave some help    some good color earlier in terms of the implications of the FY  20 DoD budget  any early read in terms of what the team is expecting around the  21 budget request to be released  I guess  in a few weeks from now David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerNo  I wish we had that much insight  but they hold that pretty close to the vest until they drop that on the Congress  I think that s targeted for some time in February Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerI think  yeah  keep in mind too that  we have FHTV contract deliveries into 2022  We have contracted JLTV deliveries into 2024 and then the FMTV contracts into 2026  So we re positioned well with our programs  but to Dave s point  we don t know until that information is released for next year Timothy Thein    Citi Research    AnalystAll right  Okay  I appreciate it  Thanks a lot David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Tim OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with RBC  Please proceed with your question Seth Weber    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystHey guys  good morning  And Dave  congrats again David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThank you Seth Weber    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystEnjoy it  Well deserved  So maybe just on the Defense business  you got to 30  the order for the 30 JLTVs internationally  Can you just  Wilson  maybe handicap your confidence level that 2021 could see some additional JLTV awards internationally  How are you    I know you re not guiding the  21 yet  but if you were trying to handicap this  do you think it s more likely than not that you have something in addition to the 30  Thanks Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Seth  we expect to actually have some international orders later this year  some more  We know Slovenia and Lithuania are both working through the FMS process  That process takes some time  but we know they are  And I think we ve talked before about the UK MoD  that s approved for roughly 2 700 vehicles  They have two  they re testing right now  We expect they may make some adjustments to the variance  But we would expect in the coming in at some point  Probably even better news is our JLTV defense team was just over in London at an Armored Vehicle Conference  and they had 16 different Ministries of Defense  all doing trials and demonstrations on JLTV  So obviously  we re very excited about the opportunities in Europe and the Middle East for the JLTV  So to answer your question  yes  we expect orders in  20 and in  21 from an international standpoint Seth Weber    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystExcellent  Thank you  And then maybe just on the fire business  you talked about    you called out the international being affected by the trade policy and such  I mean how big of a tailwind do you think that could be  if we get some resolution  Can you just remind us how big the international as a portion of that business and where could that go  I guess from here  It could be a significant tailwind in say FY  21  Thanks John C  Pfeifer    Executive Vice President   Chief Operating OfficerWell  this is John  So kind of keep in mind that most of our businesses  North American business and most of it is US business  Having said that  our business internationally is a material contributor to our business performance  We have been    we feel really good about our business  And we ve been able to keep a really  really strong order book  In fact  a record backlog because the business in the US is so strong  So when we see international business pick up again  sure  it s going to be an added benefit  but it s not impacting this year whatsoever  due to the healthy level of our US market right now Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerJust maybe to be a little bit more specific that John spot on with what he said  but in the past  it s been roughly about 10  of the F E revenue  Fire   Emergency revenue  So if that helps you set just to use about 10  Seth Weber    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystYeah  That s what I was looking for  Okay  I appreciate it guys  Thanks very much David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThanks OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre with Robert W  Baird  Please proceed with your question Mircea Dobre    Robert W  Baird    AnalystThank you  Good morning  everyone  Dave  thanks for all the help over the years  Best of luck to you going forward David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Mig Mircea Dobre    Robert W  Baird    AnalystSo  I do want to go back to Access Equipment and you mentioned that the seasonality of orders is looking a little bit different and I think like everybody else  I do agree that the orders in Q1 were better than what I expected  But given the seasonality comment and the way your comparisons on orders were for the rest of the year  is it fair for all of us to expect year over year growth in orders in Access David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerWhen you look at the implied sales for the full year  that would say that Q2 through Q4 cumulative orders will be up year over year  Let me add a little context to that  Last year in 2019  we did see orders start to moderate  And I think you pointed that out to us last year  And if you go back and just actually run the numbers  cumulative Q2 through Q4 orders in fiscal  19 compared to fiscal  18 were down  I think  around 23  to 25   somewhere in that range  So what we re looking at  it did    it does imply this year that orders will be higher  but if you go back even farther to fiscal  18  sales in fiscal  18 were right about the high end of our full year guide for fiscal  20 and the implied orders that we need yet for this year to hit the high end of the range  which is what we always target  I would say that we need a little less quarters over that cumulative three quarter period than we experienced in  18 So we ve looked at a couple of different ways  On the surface  yes  you can say  they need to be up  but I think in the context of a multi year view to that  it makes sense  and we believe they are achievable Mircea Dobre    Robert W  Baird    AnalystAll right  because that was going to be my question  given the fact that you re done with your negotiations with your main customers  I m presuming that there is a level of visibility that you have now that you might not have had three months ago when we were having this discussion  So given that  that s embedded in the outlook  how confident are you in that presuming pretty confident  otherwise you wouldn t have issued the outlook  but still   Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  you re absolutely correct  We have better confidence now  and we think that our outlook is very responsible and there s a lot of data points that go into it and what we feel good about it Mircea Dobre    Robert W  Baird    AnalystLast question from me is if I m looking at the low end of the guidance  the  3 5 billion recognizing your comment that you re seeing less fleet growth and more replacement demand  how much of that  3 5 billion would you guess is replacement demand Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerThat s hard to pin down  Mig  I mean  we get an order in from a customer  it s not    here is a growth order  here is a replacement order  I think we ve been pretty consistent that we believe    our customers are not pulled back on the growth capex this year  So we certainly expect that a meaningful portion of that will be replacement  but for us to get any more specific than that  it s really hard Mircea Dobre    Robert W  Baird    AnalystFair enough  Thanks and good luck again Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Mig David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Mig OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley  Please proceed with your question Courtney Yakavonis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHi  thanks for the question and congrats again  Dave David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThank you Courtney Yakavonis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystJust wanting to echo what everyone mentioned  Not to belabor Access  but just wanted to make sure I fully understood the guidance change versus what you had previously guided to last quarter  I think you suggested that North America will be down 15  to 20  and the Europe will be down double digits  So  with most of this decline coming from Europe  I just wanted to    and your orders only down about 14  year over year  Is it safe to say that you are trending toward the low end of your North America expectations or even trending a little bit better than that  And then how should we think about the magnitude of Europe being down relative to what you had previously expected David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  It s too early for us to really change our expectation on the US market  We feel fine about where we are with US markets  I wouldn t say that we feel like we re trending to the low end  I would not say that at all  We just felt a little bit more weakness than we had expected in EMEA  which is why we took it down by  50 million  and we feel like it s too early to say  we expect it to be offset by stronger orders in North America  So that s really what it is Courtney Yakavonis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  And I think you d also suggested that APAC would be up double digits  and I appreciate some of the comments about how small China is as a percentage of your sales  but is that still the expectation in APAC or has that shifted at all as well David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYeah  that s still the expectation  And when we say that it s up by double digits  we re not talking 10  or 20   It is a strong  strong growth market and we expect it to be for several years to come Courtney Yakavonis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  And I think you said it was up over 40  last quarter  it s similar this quarter David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYes Courtney Yakavonis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  Got you  And then just on inventory levels  I think you also suggested that those were in a relatively good shape exiting the year  is that safe comment at this point in the year as well David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYes  Yeah  we   Courtney Yakavonis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  And   David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerI m sorry  go ahead Courtney Yakavonis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystNo  no  go ahead David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerWe did get a question earlier on the call about inventory levels  So they are up a little bit  but we think the reasons why they are up a little bit are very valid and for the right reasons Courtney Yakavonis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay and then just lastly on price cost  I think in a couple of people mentioned this as well earlier  but I just    you obviously said it was positive this quarter  But just wanted to understand for the remaining three quarters  do you still expect price cost to be positive even with the roll off in the surcharge from the backlog David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerOverall  I would say the price cost is fairly in alignment when we look at Q2 through Q4  It s not going to be as favorable as we saw in Q1 Courtney Yakavonis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  But it won t be negative for the remainder of the year offsetting David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerHow should we not expect it to be    on a full year basis to be negative  No Courtney Yakavonis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  great  Thanks so much David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Courtney OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS  Please proceed with your question Steven Fisher    UBS    AnalystThanks  Good morning  and best wishes  guys  I m just starting off on the Defense margins  coming back to follow up on Steve Volkmann s question  I know you said it was going to be lumpy  but is the margin base case that the Q2 is going to be something like the full year overall margin guide of 9  or is there some other reason why the margin might be more back end weighted other than just the timing of orders David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerTiming of orders are going to be the big driver  Steve  I m not trying to be evasive here  Just we don t control the timing of when those are released  As we sit here today  we think we re going to see a continued improvement in margins as we go through the year  Again  as I talked about Q1 is the lowest sales quarter of the year  so certainly we expect to see some absorption benefits  Everything that on the production side and the NPD spend side  all of that is in alignment with supporting higher margins as we go through the year  It s just the volatility from quarter to quarter is really going to be dependent upon the timing of the receipt of those orders that we re confident that we will get in the fiscal year Steven Fisher    UBS    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  And then just on Access  you mentioned that your order discussions with the key customers are largely complete and maybe this is really just might being too picky on the wording  but how unusual is it for those to not all be resolved at this point and maybe what s unique about customers that haven t fully finalized yet John C  Pfeifer    Executive Vice President   Chief Operating OfficerIt s John  It s not really unusual at all  When I say it s largely completed because we still have some negotiations to wrap up and some orders to come in Q2 from those negotiations  But let s say  it s 90  to 95  Steven Fisher    UBS    AnalystOkay  terrific  Thank you David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThanks OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Mike Shlisky with Dougherty   Company  Please proceed with your question Michael Shlisky    Dougherty   Co     AnalystGood morning  guys  And again  Dave  best wishes David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThank you Michael Shlisky    Dougherty   Co     AnalystSo guys  it has not been made 100  unclear thus far on the call in Access Equipment  At this point  you still feel good about 2021 being possibly a better year than this year due to ongoing replacement  And just a little more color there  can you maybe give us any kind of a feel for how  if I look between the mix between telehandlers and aerials Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerI ll jump in on the  21 question  Mike  And then I ll let Dave talk mix  but it s January 2020  And we re just getting into the first quarter of our most of our customers  I think you know we re on an October through September year  So we always come into year  working hard to get the next forecast in place  but what we would say about  21 of what we know today is if you think about the normal replacements on aerial work platform  there was some really big years back there in  13 and  14  which would add up that  21 should be a fairly large replacement year  We ve heard commentary from some of the rental companies that s consistent with this thinking  So we look at  21 as a good year coming up from what we know  But again  we re not going to call  21 as we re just getting started in our customers  fiscal 2020 David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerMike  this is Dave  I would echo Wilson s comments  You look back historically  and that s a pretty good indicator when you start looking at the fleet ages of when they needed to be or need to be replaced and ideally when they should be replacing in that seven to nine years seems to be the sweet spot  You see maintenance costs tick up  You see used equipment values  That s kind of the sweet spot as well  In terms of mix for 2021  yeah  it s still way too early to be thinking about what that might look like  That s going to be largely dependent on what each of those customers is seeing and the timing of sequencing of how they want to think about replacing that used equipment Michael Shlisky    Dougherty   Co     AnalystOkay  great  I also wanted to ask secondly  about the large Defense order that came in  in December  which you ve been talking here on the call about  Perhaps  I m looking at this too much  but in your past orders from the government and your past written comments  there s always been in order that has been for the army and the marines and the wording of this order entered in the Navy and the Air Force  Now  of course  those folks  they fly more airplanes  they buy boats  but they do definitely drive people around as well  Is there an opportunity for those two branches over time or at this point  have you orders already included all four of those branches Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerNo  they haven t  And there are opportunities there  Mike  So we re continuing to work that  Our JLTV team is busy domestically  And as I mentioned earlier  they re very busy on international front too  And Mike  if you look at    go back to that press release  we did make a comment in there that we expected additional JLTV orders yet this fiscal year  And once those come in  we ll get a better idea of what branches with the service those incremental volumes are for Michael Shlisky    Dougherty   Co     AnalystSo just to kind of clarify at this point then  what you    until this order or all the other orders were just for two branches only and not for all four Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerLargely  there may have been a smattering in there for the Air Force and the Navy David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerMike  that Army    these guys are saying the Army and the Marines are the prime users  There are some Air Force and Navy requirements though Michael Shlisky    Dougherty   Co     AnalystSure  of course  Exactly  Okay  thanks guys  I appreciate it Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Mike OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Steve Barger with KeyBanc  Please proceed with your question Steve Barger    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystHey  thanks  Congratulations  Dave  I m sure  Charlie Szews is excited to have a new fishing buddy Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Steve Steve Barger    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystYou probably have to screen your calls  This is going to be the first revenue decline in four or five years  But it looks pretty modest  and obviously  the balance sheet is in great shape  should be a good free cash flow year  Are you using this time to get more aggressive about trying to source deals or look at pitches Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerSteve  we ve always talked about always on this  The theme for us is opportunistic  We re generating good cash  We will generate more cash this year  What we want to do is  we do make a move  make sure it s the right move  a move that you would say  yeah  that makes sense  So we re not going to go just buy something to buy it  So we look at that  but at this point  capital allocation I think has been displayed well from our Company  The balance sheet  as you mentioned  is in good shape  And so  we ll continue to review the share repurchase opportunity  the possible raising the dividend and then looking    it s not just a deal  there could be some partnerships  potential JVs  there s a lot of conversation going on in the market today with companies working more together than in the past  So we re certainly as wide open and looking at just about everything out there that could possibly help us grow and add value to our shareholders Steve Barger    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystGot it  thanks Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Steve David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Steve OperatorThank you  Our final question will come from the line of Ross Gilardi with Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Please proceed with your question Ross Gilardi    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  great  Thanks guys for squeezing me in  And congrats Dave as well about   David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Ross Ross Gilardi    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystI can t think of any other questions possibly  The only thing I was curious about was your implied Commercial and Fire   Emergency orders  If I m doing the math right  I think your Commercial orders are up like 13  year on year and Fire is up like 50  and I m trying to understand that in the context of the Class 8 truck orders that we get in the six  seven truck orders that we get that are all still squarely down  Are these just the only few end markets in the whole market that are still growing  Are there any like unique share issues or timing issues that are influencing your implied order growth and just trying to understand sustainability really of that David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerRoss  I think one thing  if you re looking at kind of the Class 8 comparing to that  we re vocational truck builders here  And as I ve    and we ve looked at some of the commentary out of the truck OEMs  I think they ve all been pretty consistent that their vocational markets continue to remain quite healthy and their outlook for their vocational markets continue to remain quite healthy  It s a little bit different than over the road outlook  We know that  I think what we re seeing is fairly consistent with what we re hearing from the truck guys Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerI think just to add to that  the two big markets that you are seeing move there  the refuse collection vehicles and fire municipal spending  And municipal spending is held pretty well  and you ve got some pretty old fleets that are in need of replacement  So that s where you re seeing some of the pickup in fire and refuse David M  Sagehorn    Executive Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerI ll even add to that  Ross  In the F E market  we have really  really good dealers and they re getting better  We ve also got new products that have been helping us a lot of aerials and other parts of our product line  So all those parts that we re gaining share in the F E environment Ross Gilardi    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystYeah  Thanks guys  I agree that the truck OEMs have been a bit more upbeat  And I realize you re not included in the over the road order numbers  but even the Class 8 straight vocational numbers seem to be down  So it does seem like you guys are really outperforming in that respect  which is great  Thanks so much Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Ross OperatorThank you  I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments Wilson R  Jones    President   Chief Executive OfficerWell  I m going to start off and again thank Dave  David Sagehorn for 20 years of just great work here in our Company and helping us get to levels that honestly  I don t know  we have  Technical Issues  we get to and obviously  he s charging us to keep going  And Mike will carry that torch forward for us  I want to thank everyone on the call today for your interest in the Oshkosh Corporation  We certainly look forward to speaking with you at a conference or on our next earnings call  Have a good day everyone Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  72 minutesCall participants Patrick Davidson    Senior Vice President of Investor

137577,359092,OSK,Is Oshkosh Corporation  OSK  A Good Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Oshkosh Corporation   NYSE OSK   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Oshkosh Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 4  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 71  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Oshkosh Corporation s current PE level puts it way below its midpoint of 13 95 over the past five years The stock s PE compares quite favorably with the Auto Tires Trucks Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 10 11  This indicates that the stock is undervalued right now  compared to its peers Meanwhile  Oshkosh Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 8 35  which is slightly lower than the current level  So  it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Oshkosh Corporation stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Oshkosh Corporation has a P S ratio of just 0 57  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 12x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Oshkosh Corporation currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Oshkosh Corporation a solid choice for value investors and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Oshkosh Corporation is just 0 72  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 03  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate What About the Stock Overall Though Oshkosh Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of A  This gives F a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen four estimates go down in the past sixty days compared to three upward revisions  while the full year estimate has seen no down and nine up in the same time period This has had a mixed effect on the consensus estimate  While the current quarter consensus estimate dipped 2 1  over the past two months  the current year estimate has shot up 3 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Oshkosh Corporation Price and Consensus   Despite such mixed analyst sentiments  the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and it is the reason why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineOshkosh Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 20  of more than 250 industries   a Zacks Rank  2 instils optimism in the stock However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below We believe  despite an unsatisfactory past industry performance and a sluggish industry rank  a good Zacks rank and analyst sentiments signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Oshkosh Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks

137581,359096,OSK,Buy The Dip On This High Quality Company,opinion,"It s hard to find undervalued  high quality companies in this market  Most cheap companies are cheap for a reason  and most high quality companies have premium valuations to match 

We recently upgraded this stock to Very Attractive after the market s overreaction to a negative forecast on its earnings call sent shares down over 10   Investors are worried about a potential dip in earnings next year while ignoring that the long term trends for this company are positive  and the valuation already prices in a permanent profit decline  Oshkosh Corp   NYSE OSK  is this week s Long Idea  
Strong Trend of Profit Growth
Oshkosh  which manufactures specialty vehicles for a wide array of governmental and industrial customers  operates in four key segments 
Access Equipment  Includes aerial work platforms  lifts  and telehandlers  for use in construction  manufacturing  and home improvement centersDefense  Includes tactical wheeled vehicles for the US military  as well as a small amount of sales to foreign militariesFire   Emergency  Includes fire trucks and emergency response vehicles for use in airportsCommercial  Includes concrete mixers and trash collection vehiclesAll of these segments have trended upwards in recent years due to strong economic conditions and rising military spending in the U S  After tax operating profit  NOPAT  increased from  368 million in 2015 to  499 million in 2018  or 11  compounded annually  Trailing twelve months  TTM  NOPAT is up to  598 million  Meanwhile  return on invested capital  ROIC  improved from 8  in 2015 to 12  TTM  See Figure 1
Figure 1  OSK s NOPAT and ROIC Since 2015





Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
As Figure 1 shows  the company s fundamentals remain solid when including the first three quarters of 2019  OSK s fiscal year ends on September 30   However  the company spooked investors in its 3Q earnings call on August 1 when CEO Wilson Jones said 
 We believe the access equipment markets in North America and Europe could be down modestly in 2020  foreseeing increased replacement demand in 2021  
These comments sent shares down over 10  despite the fact that OSK beat on the top and bottom line and raised its full year 2019 guidance  KeyBanc downgraded the stock from Overweight to Sector Weight due to macro concerns after the earnings call 
While the potential decline in demand for 2020 is a real concern  we think the market underrates OSK s diversified business  its excellent leadership  and its long term growth potential  These factors should help OSK weather any cyclical downturn in 2020 and deliver long term value to shareholders 
Diversified Business Provides Growth Opportunities
While access equipment is OSK s largest segment  it sill accounts for less than 50  of revenue  as shown in Figure 2  Even if access equipment struggles in 2020  the other segments have significant upside potential to offset that decline 
Figure 2  OSK Revenue by Segment  2018





Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
The attention paid to cyclical headwinds for access equipment overshadowed the bullish news for other segments  For instance  Congress and President Trump recently agreed to a two year budget deal that will boost defense spending by three percent  This deal averts a potential automatic spending cut and gives more clarity to the near term future for the defense segment 
In addition  the fire   emergency segment has strong growth opportunities from rising demand in the U S  and expanded opportunities internationally  International sales doubled year over year in the most recent quarter as the company delivered fire trucks to China and airport rescue vehicles to Egypt  The administrative challenges of dealing with foreign governments and municipalities have made it difficult for the fire   emergency segment to gain traction internationally  and even now international sales represent just 9  of segment revenue  However  the recent growth and new deliveries suggest there s more opportunity to expand the business geographically 
These other business lines   which account for over 50  of revenue   have the potential to offset the short term decline in access equipment and provide long term growth for Oshkosh 
Product Diversification and Innovation Provides Competitive Advantage
Oshkosh s diversified business also gives it a competitive advantage by allowing it to provide more comprehensive product solutions to customers than many of its competitors  For example  a city government choosing between Oshkosh and a smaller competitor to supply trucks for its fire department might take into account the fact that Oshkosh can also supply emergency vehicles for the city s airport  A construction firm might prefer Oshkosh for its ability to provide both aerial work platforms and concrete mixers 
In addition to product diversification  the company seeks to differentiate from its competition through product innovation  In recent years  Oshkosh delivered innovative new products like natural gas powered concrete mixers and garbage trucks  hybrid and battery powered boom lifts  and battery powered communication systems for news vehicles 
These innovations earned Oshkosh the designation as the 4th most sustainable industrial company  and the 17th most sustainable company overall in the Barron s 100 Most Sustainable U S  Companies ranking 
Oshkosh s ability to provide a wide array of products and to differentiate its products through energy efficiency and other unique features gives it a competitive advantage in its industry 
Superior Corporate Governance Leads to Value Creation
Oshkosh s growth in recent years has not come at the expense of prudent capital stewardship  as we often see with many other rapidly growing companies  Instead  Oshkosh s corporate governance ensures that executives are focused on creating lasting shareholder value 
ROIC has been a part of the company s long term incentive plan since 2000  More recently  the company has further intensified its focus on capital efficiency by adding Days Net Working Capital as a performance target for annual bonuses  The CEO and CFO s bonuses are based on the whole company s performance  while segment heads earn bonuses based on their specific segment performance 
This focus on capital efficiency helps Oshkosh significantly outperform its peers in terms of invested capital turns   or revenue average invested capital   as shown in Figure 3  The weighted average capital turns for the company s peers listed in its proxy statement declined from 1 3 to 1 1 over the past five years  Meanwhile  Oshkosh s capital turns increased from 1 5 to 1 6 over the same time 
Figure 3  Average Invested Capital Turns  OSK vs  Peers  2014 TTM





Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Oshkosh s superior capital turns indicate that the company is more intelligent about allocating capital and ensuring that its assets operate at the highest possible level of efficiency 
Valuation Is Below the Bear Case Scenario
Even if Oshkosh does face a cyclical downturn next year  this decline is already priced into the stock  At its current valuation of  75 share  OSK has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 0 9  This ratio means the market expects OSK s NOPAT to permanently decline by 10  
Notably  this expectation is far below what analysts are projecting for the stock  Consensus estimates have revenue declining by just 1  and earnings per share declining by just 3  in 2020  These estimates also project revenue and earnings to bounce back to 2019 levels by 2021 
If we assume analyst estimates for EPS growth and decline roughly line up with changes in NOPAT  we can use our reverse discounted cash flow model to see the divergence between the market s valuation and consensus forecasts 
Figure 4 shows OSK s price of  75 share implies that NOPAT will increase by 17  in 2019  decline by 10  in 2020  and never grow again after that  Meanwhile  analysts expect 2019 earnings to increase by 34   decline by just 3  in 2020  and then increase by 3  in the years after  These estimates are well above what the current stock price implies for future growth  which gives OSK significant upside potential  
Figure 4  OSK s Historical and Implied Future NOPAT vs  Consensus Analyst Estimates




 
Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Based on the current information about OSK s cash flows and future projections  it s hard to justify the current low valuation 
Cheap Valuation Provides Upside
OSK s 0 9 PEBV means the stock is the cheapest it has been since 2016  The last time OSK was this cheap  the stock more than doubled over the following two years  We re not necessarily projecting an exact repeat  but there is significant potential upside going forward 
If OSK can maintain its TTM NOPAT margin of 7  and grow NOPAT by 4  compounded annually over the next decade  the stock is worth  100 share today   a 34  upside to the current stock price 
This scenario could prove conservative  as the 4  growth is slightly below the 5  projected growth of the construction equipment market  Even if OSK grows slower than the overall market  the stock still has potential upside 
Sustainable Competitive Advantages That Will Drive Shareholder Value Creation
Here s a summary of why we think the moat around Oshkosh s business will enable the company to generate higher profits than the current valuation of the stock implies  This list of competitive advantages helps OSK offer better products services at a lower price and prevents competition from taking market share 
Diversified product lineup that offers more comprehensive solutionsProduct innovation  especially around energy efficiency and sustainability  that differentiatesSuperior capital efficiency compared to peersWhat Noise Traders Miss with OSK
These days  fewer investors focus on finding quality capital allocators with shareholder friendly corporate governance  Instead  due to the proliferation of noise traders  the focus tends toward technical trading tends while high quality fundamental research is overlooked  Here s a quick summary for noise traders when analyzing OSK 
Positive trends in other segments to offset the headwinds in the access equipment businessSuperior corporate governance that leads to greater capital efficiencyBear case forecasts actually imply a higher valuation than the current stock priceCatalyst  Trade Deal  International Growth Could Send Shares Higher
A new trade deal  especially one that lifted tariffs on steel prices  would be a big boost to Oshkosh  which purchases a significant amount of steel for its manufacturing process  Falling steel prices help the company in the short term because it has   5 billion  60  of TTM revenue  in contracted backlog where the prices are locked in based on higher steel input costs  Longer term  falling steel prices make the company s products more affordable and should boost overall demand 
Even without a trade deal  Oshkosh has the ability to shift attention away from the concerns in the North American access equipment market by growing its international business  If the company can continue to win new business abroad  that should reduce the concern over short term cyclical pressures 
Dividends and Buybacks Provide 8  Yield
Oshkosh has increased its dividend for each of the past seven years  Since 2014  Oshkosh has increased its quarterly dividend from  0 15 to  0 27  or 12  compounded annually  Its current annualized dividend of  1 08 equates to a dividend yield of 1 4  
In addition to dividends  Oshkosh returns capital to shareholders through share repurchases  Over the last twelve months  the company repurchased  374 million  7  of market cap  worth of shares  The company currently has a remaining purchase authorization of 8 8 million shares  or  660 million worth of stock at the current price  With its  397 million in TTM free cash flow  Oshkosh has the ability to maintain its buyback and dividend and return 8  of its market cap to shareholders each year

137583,359098,OSK,BorgWarner Bumping Along Amid Low Margin And Pricing Pressure,opinion,BorgWarner Inc    NYSE BWA   has been navigating through rough waters for a while now amid contracting margins  pricing pressure from OEMs and tariff related costs  All these headwinds weighed upon BorgWarner s results in the last reported quarter  wherein the vehicle technology company posted year over year lower sales and earnings  Management expects these challenges to remain and hence  it trimmed its 2019 sales and earnings view Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been witnessing a downtrend  Notably  estimates for the current and next year have moved south by 27 cents and 33 cents to  3 88 and  4 16  respectively  over the past 60 days In the past three months  the company tumbled approximately 11   wider than the  s decline of 0 7   Let s delve deeper into the factors ailing this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock What s Behind BorgWarner s Dismal Run Low production volumes and margin pressures have significantly affected the firm s performance  Declining margins across the sector and lower backlog contributions are hurting the stock  As expectations of vehicle sales continue to dwindle  hopes for a rebound look uncertain BorgWarner is witnessing a decline in light vehicle production across all its major markets served  which is in turn marring the top line  In China and Europe  the industry s light vehicle production recorded a year over year decline of 16  and 7   respectively Management expects the challenging conditions to continue  which will further impact its sales in the remainder of 2019  BorgWarner anticipates global light vehicles volumes to decline 3 5 5  year over year versus the prior forecast of 2 5 5   Due to softening demand in China amid trade tensions  the company is increasingly pessimistic about the Chinese market  The firm expects production in China  Europe and North America to decline 10   3  and 2   respectively  on a year over year basis Bleak outlook for the remainder of 2019 has dampened investors  sentiments  For third quarter 2019  the company envisions net earnings in the band of 83 90 cents per share  indicating a decline from  1 in the year ago period  The company has also downwardly revised its sales and EPS expectations for the full year  It anticipates net sales in the range of  9 94  10 18 billion versus the prior guidance of  9 90  10 37 billion  EPS is also anticipated within  3 75  4 per share compared with the previous forecast of  4  4 25  Further  operating margin is now expected in the range of 11 4 11 8 vis a vis earlier estimate of 11 9 12 2  Further  supply chain inefficiencies and higher research and development costs are likely to mar its margins  In fact  the company expects R D costs to be higher in the second half of the year as it continues to invest heavily in electrification related programs  Reportedly  the firm is facing challenges in the turbo charging business owing to aggressive pricing strategies Notably  as the company has to deal with a struggling Tier 2 supplier base  margins are expected to erode  As we know  annual price reductions for OEM customers have become a common practice  While BorgWarner faces pressure from OEMs to reduce prices  it is unable to pass on any increase in raw material costs to OEM customers  While it s normal for auto OEMs to demand price reductions from tier 1 suppliers like BorgWarner  these firms try to recover the costs from Tier 2 suppliers  However  weakness witnessed in Tier 2 suppliers is limiting BWA s ability to pass on pricing concessions to OEMs While the company has growth potential in new hybrid and electric vehicle models  delayed or reduced new model launches remain a concern  If the launch of the models is postponed or it generates lower volumes than expected  then the revenue mix will shift toward less favorable internal combustion engine products Wrapping UpWhile the company has been making efforts to optimize its portfolio by entering into strategic joint venture deals and divesting non core holdings  restructuring efforts will take time to yield results and win back investors  confidence  Ultimately  investors would want the company s earnings and stock price to accelerate  However  production and sales of light vehicles need to be stabilized first  However  uncertainty regarding margins and the pace of vehicles  launch and adoption remain concerns Meanwhile  some better ranked stocks in the same industry are Allison Transmission Holdings  Inc   NYSE ALSN    Gentex

137591,359106,OSK,Is Oshkosh Corporation  OSK  A Good Stock To Pick Right Now ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put  Oshkosh Corporation   NYSE OSK   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Oshkosh has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 02  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 19  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level Oshkosh puts current PE ratio below its midpoint  which is 13 83  over the past five years  Also  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Auto Tires Trucks sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 12 27  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Oshkosh has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 11 10  so an increase in the share price of the stock can be expected in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  the stock has a P S ratio of about 0 72  This is somewhat lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 49 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Oshkosh currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes OSK a solid choice for value investors and some of its other metrics make it clear For example  the PEG ratio for Oshkosh is just 1 03  a level that is considerably lower than the industry average of 1 14  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate What About the Stock Overall 
Though Oshkosh might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of C  This gives OSK a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen four estimates go lower in the past sixty days and two higher  while current year estimate has seen five downward and one upward revision in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined 2 3  in the past two months  while current year estimate has also fallen 0 9  in the same time period  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Oshkosh Corporation Price and Consensus    This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineOshkosh is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  the company s prospects might be constrained due to adverse broader factors  as it has a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 28  out of more than 250 industries   In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity  Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices  In the process  it s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate  12 3 trillion in activity A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech  Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  in the 1990s  Zacks  just released special report reveals 8 stocks to watch  The report is only available for a limited time ",2020-02-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-oshkosh-corporation-osk-a-good-stock-to-pick-right-now-200503934,200503934

137645,359160,OSK,Should Value Investors Pick Oshkosh Corporation  OSK  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Oshkosh Corporation   NYSE OSK   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Oshkosh Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 26  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 79  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Oshkosh Corporation s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the metric facing significant instability over the past few months  However  the stock s PE also compares unfavorably with the Zacks Auto sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 9 68  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers  Nonetheless  we should also point out that Oshkosh Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 9  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Oshkosh Corporation s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Oshkosh Corporation has a P S ratio of about 0 67  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 24x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Oshkosh Corporation currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Oshkosh Corporation a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Oshkosh Corporation is just 0 87  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 18  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  OSK is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Oshkosh Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of C  This gives OSK a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed  The current quarter has seen six estimates go down and one up over the past sixty days  For the full year  the estimate has seen ten upward revisions over the same time period with no downward movement This has had an impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has slumped by 6 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has risen by 5 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Oshkosh Corporation Price and Consensus   Despite the mixed analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term Bottom LineOshkosh Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  a dull industry rank  among Bottom 19  of more than 250 industries  is concerning  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Auto  Original Equipment industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  We believe  despite an unsatisfactory past industry performance  a good Zacks rank signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Oshkosh Corporation Zacks  Top 10 Stocks for

at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Oshkosh Corporation   NYSE OSK   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Oshkosh has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 2  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 16 6  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Oshkosh s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past three years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point However  the stock s PE compares unfavorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 8 6  This indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers Nevertheless  we should point out that Oshkosh has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 0  so it is fair to say that a value oriented path may be ahead for Oshkosh stock in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Oshkosh has a P S ratio of about 0 6  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 0 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  OSK is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Oshkosh currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Oshkosh a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Oshkosh is just 0 6  a level that is lower than the industry average of 0 9  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  OSK is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Oshkosh might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of F  This gives OSK a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been trending higher  The current fiscal quarter has seen seven estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the fiscal full year estimate has seen ten upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has risen by 19 5  in the past two months  while the fiscal full year estimate has increased 9 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Oshkosh Corporation Price and Consensus    This positive trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineOshkosh is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Its strong Zacks Rank also indicates robust growth potential in the near future  However  the company s prospects might be constrained due to adverse broader factors  as it has a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 10  out of more than 250 industries   In fact  over the past three years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ,2018-12-18,Zacks Investment

137952,359467,OSK,How To Screen For Classic Value Stocks,opinion,"Welcome to Episode  85 of the Value Investor Podcast
Every week  Tracey Ryniec  the editor of Zacks   shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks 
The growth stocks  especially the big cap FANG names like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   are hitting new all time highs again 
But that doesn t mean there isn t value to be found in this market 
Tracey decided to do a narrow screen to find only those with classic value fundamentals 
What are the Classic Value Criteria 
1       A P E ratio of 15 or lower 
2      A P B ratio of 3 0 or under  although if you really wanted a deep value dive  you could look for those under 2 0 
3      A P S ratio under 1 0 which indicates that you re paying less for that  1 in sales 
4      A PEG ratio under 1 0  Value investors should look for some growth  right 
She also screened for Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  stocks which should mean that the companies have rising earnings estimates 
This should be a very narrow screen because it is a lot of specific criteria to fill  As it is  there are about 900 Zacks Rank  1 and  2 stocks and then you are adding not just one value criteria  but four of them 
The screen returned 26 stocks 
Out of those 26  Tracey picked 5 of the classic value stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  that she found the most intriguing 
5 Classic Value Stocks with a Top Zacks Rank
1       BP plc   NYSE BP   is a British big oil company with worldwide energy operations  The energy stocks are back out of favor which is why it s so cheap  It has a price to sales ratio of just 0 5  It also pays a hefty dividend  currently yielding 6   BP is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
2      Cigna Corporation   NYSE CI   is a health insurance company that recently announced it would acquire pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts  Shares are cheap  with a forward P E of just 12 9  It s a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
3      Meritage Homes Corporation   NYSE MTH   is one of the smaller home builders with a market cap of just  1 9 billion  The homebuilder stocks have sold off in 2018 on fears about rising mortgage rates  Meritage trades with a forward P E of only 9  It s a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
4      Oshkosh Corporation   NYSE OSK   makes specialty trucks including for defense  fire   emergency and commercial trucks including concrete mixers  Founded in 1917 in Wisconsin  it is trading with a P S ratio of just 0 8  It also pays a dividend  currently yielding 1 2   Oshkosh is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
5      Realogy Holdings Corporation   NYSE RLGY   operates real estate franchises around the country including Century 21  Coldwell Banker  Sotheby s International and Better Homes   Gardens  It s a mid cap company with a market cap of just  3 5 billion but it pays a dividend  which is currently yielding 1 4  
It s not easy being a value investor  You have to go against the grain 
It may mean investing in industries and sectors that no one else likes or otherwise seem  boring  
What else should you know about screening for classic value stocks

138059,359574,OSK,Play EPS Surprises With These 5 Top Stocks,opinion,"There is no mystery behind investors  hunt for stocks with estimate beating potential ahead of an earnings season  This is because investors always try to place themselves ahead of time and look to play stocks that are rich in quality 
Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important 
Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you if it has been decelerating 
Also  seasonal fluctuations can come into play  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
On the other hand  after a whole lot of research and analysis on a company s financials and initiatives  Wall Street analysts project its earnings  They also take a company s guidance into consideration when deriving an earnings estimate 
Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market perception  And if the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release  Thus  more than anything else  an earnings surprise can push a stock higher 
How to Locate Potential Outperformers  
Now  finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line is a dream that investors chase but might not always come true  One way of fulfilling it is by looking at the earnings surprise history of a company 
An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a driver in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s ability to exceed estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve to deliver yet another earning beat in its upcoming release 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the followingas our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through 
 greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to nine 
Here are five out of the nine stocks

decrease about 3  in 2018 to 16 8 million vehicles from 17 4 million units in 2016 Challenges AboundThe auto industry is in a transition phase  The compulsion of manufacturing electric vehicles in a

Charles River Laboratories  NYSE CRL 


Charles River Laboratories broke above its 20 day SMA in December  as it started to move higher  It took a couple of steps up and then had a gap up in February to a plateau it has held ever since  Last week it created a tight range against that support and made contact again with its 50 day SMA  The RSI is holding in the bullish zone while the MACD is about to break into negative territory  The question is whether it will bounce here or continue lower  Let it tell you and then tag along

Up Next  Bonus Idea
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Thursday which with Easter now behind and April options Expiration ahead  sees equity markets looking a bit weaker short term as they give up some ground 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue in its uptrend while crude oil also moves higher  The US dollar Index has moved into broad consolidation while US Treasuries are biased higher short term and may be reversing  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue to drift higher as Emerging Markets  NYSE EEM  consolidate their recent move up 
Volatility looks to remain low  but higher than it has been and with a short term bias to continue up  This alone should not be enough to put a damper on equities but could contribute  The equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   IWM  NYSE IWM  and QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ   all look ready to continue to give ground in the short run  In the intermediate view they are all stronger with the QQQ strongest and IWM next and the SPY the least positive  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

Since that pop  the stock has sold off  making a bottom in late July and early August  That led to a consolidation period that started in late August  The stock has been making higher lows in consolidation since then and formed an ascending triangle 

Monday the stock sits at the top of the triangle and has been there for 6 days  The momentum indicators are mixed  Both are in the bullish range  but the RSI is rolling lower  If it can shift into a lower gear and gain some power  a break of the triangle to the upside targets a move to 52 80  That would be a 23  move higher  Wait for the trigger  but be prepared to fasten your seat belt  These trucks can drive anywhere
