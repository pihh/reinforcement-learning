158698,380214,PCAR,Mexico s truck makers delay investment amid doubts on new clean diesel rules,news,"By Sharay Angulo
MEXICO CITY  Reuters    Mexico s truck manufacturers have not started making the investments they need to assemble and import vehicles that use clean diesel ahead of new rules that will restrict the use of high sulfur diesel  an industry association said on Tuesday 
Mexico s government has ordered gas stations  which are mostly operated by state run Pemex  to distribute and sell the replacement ultra low sulfur diesel  ULSD  from July  while truck manufacturers will from January 2021 only be allowed to import  make and sell ULSD run trucks 
But distribution of ULSD to gas stations has been slow as Pemex continues producing high sulfur diesel and independent importers and sellers have not significantly increased ULSD purchases  according to figures from Mexico s association of bus and truck makers  known as Anpact 
A survey conducted by the association among a sample of some 350 gas stations revealed ULSD present at 79 percent of them  versus 81 percent in 2018  Mexico has over 12 000 stations 
 There are regions where the fuel is nowhere to be found   Anpact president Miguel Elizalde said on Tuesday at a news conference 
In a preliminary version of its business plan  Pemex in July said it was not in compliance with the ULSD rule  so it was introducing  legal measures  while trying to increase domestic production of the fuel  That was not included in the public version of the plan 
Pemex did not immediately reply to a request for comment  Mexico s energy regulator could not be reached for comment  The association is requesting a meeting with Pemex to discuss the issue  Elizalde said 
Amid uncertainty over the availability of ULSD  truck makers have not yet prepared for the rule ordering them to switch fuel consumption of heavy vehicles produced and imported into Mexico to ULSD by 2021 under the Euro VI EPA 10 international standards  so they are asking for more time 
 Nobody is forced to comply with the impossible  If there is not 100  coverage of ULSD  they cannot force us to abandon the  current  Euro V EPA 7 ahead of time   he said 
Truck and bus makers including Navistar International  N NAV   Kenworth  O PCAR   Mercedes Benz  DE DAIGn   Freightliner  Volkswagen  DE VOWG p   and Volvo  ST VOLVb  would need 18 24 months to prepare factories  distribution chains  stores and sales forces for the change  Anpact said  pointing out there was 16 months to go until the changeover date 
 We are running out of time   Elizalde added 
Postponing the ULSD norms   including those for truck makers   or giving Pemex and heavy vehicle makers options to adapt could be temporary solutions  the executive said ",2019-08-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/mexicos-truck-makers-delay-investment-amid-doubts-on-new-clean-diesel-rules-1964630,1964630

our excellent fourth quarter and record full year 2019 results and business highlights  Thanks to PACCAR s outstanding employees around the world  2019 was the best year in the company s 114 year history  PACCAR achieved record revenues of  25 6 billion and record net income of  2 39 billion  a 9 3  after tax return on revenues  PACCAR strong financial performance in 2019 benefited from PACCAR Parts record pre tax profits of  831 million and PACCAR Financial Services pre tax profits of  299 million  PACCAR has achieved 81 consecutive years of net income and a total shareholder return in 2019 of 45   The company has paid a dividend every year since 1941  In 2019  PACCAR declared dividends of  3 58 per share a 16  increase over 2018  Total dividends declared were a record  1 24 billion PACCAR s fourth quarter revenues were  6 1 billion and fourth quarter net income was  531 million  PACCAR delivered 45 700 trucks during the fourth quarter compared to 49 300 in the third quarter  There were fewer build days and lower build rates in North America compared to the third quarter   Technical Issues  remained steady The U S  economy performed well in 2019  which contributed to a strong truck market  In 2019  U S  and Canadian Class 8 truck retail sales were 309 000 units  the second highest truck sales in history  During 2019  Kenworth and Peterbilt combined market share increased to 30  compared to 29 4  in the prior year  In 2020  the U S  economy is expected to grow by about 2   The new U S  MCA and China Phase 1 trade agreements could provide upside in the economy and are good for PACCAR  We estimate that 2020 U S  and Canada Class 8 truck market to be in a range of 230 000 to 260 000 vehicles  European above 16 tonne truck registrations were 320 000 vehicles in 2019  reflecting continued robust customer demand after several years of steady economic growth  DAF delivered a strong 16 2  market share  In 2020  the European economies are projected to continue growing and we expect another excellent truck market with above 16 tonne registrations in a range of 260 000 to 290 000 vehicles I would like to recognize PACCAR s high performing Kenworth  Peterbilt  and DAF dealers who are the best in the industry and important contributors to our success  Truck and parts gross margins were 14 4  in the fourth quarter  Truck pricing increased during the quarter  more than offsetting costs  In the first quarter  we expect deliveries to be 5  to 7  lower than the fourth quarter due to normalized markets and build rates in North America  First quarter truck and parts gross margins are estimated to be around 14   PACCAR continues to take a rigorous approach to controlling costs throughout the business cycle and delivers industry leading operating margins Other 2019 accomplishments included PACCAR delivering a record 199 000 trucks worldwide  Kenworth  Peterbilt  and DAF expanding the range of battery electric  hybrid  and hydrogen fuel cell trucks in field testing with customers  and South American deliveries increasing by 60   The company s focus on sustainable business practices were recognized by the environmental reporting firm CDP  For the second consecutive year  PACCAR achieved an A rating  which puts us in the top 2  of more than 8 000 companies which report to CDP  PACCAR is one of only 35 companies in the United States to earn the A rating  In addition  we re proud that Peterbilt  Kenworth and PACCAR Parts were recognized as top workplaces for women by the organization Women in Trucking  Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on PACCAR Parts  PACCAR Financial Services  and PACCAR s investments in future growth Harrie C  A  M  Schippers    President   Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Preston  In 2019  PACCAR Parts generated record annual revenues of more than  4 billion and record annual pre tax profit of  831 million  Annual parts revenue grew 5  and profit grew 8  compared to 2018  Parts fourth quarter revenues were  994 million and quarterly pre tax profit was a strong  205 million PACCAR has steadily increased its truck and engine market share over the years  resulting in a greater number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation  At the same time  PACCAR has consistently expanded its network of parts distribution centers such as the ones opening this year in Las Vegas  Nevada  and Ponta Grossa  Brazil  Kenworth  Peterbilt and DAF dealers have made large investments to increase their service capacity  The growing part of PACCAR trucks and power trains and the enhanced parts distribution and service network grant  Phonetic  future long term growth  In 2020  we estimate part sales to grow by 4  to 6  PACCAR Financial Services achieved 2019 records in annual revenues of  1 48 billion  new business volume of  5 6 billion  and portfolio assets of  16 1 billion  The portfolio continues to perform well with low past dues and low credit losses  Fourth quarter pre tax income was  68 million  the same as in the third quarter  PACCAR Parts and PACCAR Financial Services profit contributions enhance PACCAR s financial results through all phases of the business cycle  I m pleased to share that in 2019  PACCAR was recognized for its products and manufacturing innovations  DAF earned Truck of the Year awards in the U K   Poland  Czech Republic  and Slovakia and the Green Truck Logistics Solution Award in Germany Kenworth Chillicothe and Peterbilt Denton each earned a prestigious 2019 Manufacturing Leadership Award from the National Association of Manufacturers  At the CES Technology Show in Las Vegas earlier this month  PACCAR showcased a Level 4 autonomous vehicle and two battery electric trucks  We had a terrific turnout of people interested in PACCAR technology and the opportunity to see the trucks first hand  Kenworth  Peterbilt  and DAF have each announced that they will begin producing alternative powertrain trucks in the next 12 to 18 months  PACCAR is a leader in all powertrain technologies that drive our industry including diesel  battery  hybrid  and hydrogen fuel cell  PACCAR invested a record  744 million in capital and and  327 million in R D expenses last year  In 2020  we re planning capital investments in the range of  625 million to  675 million and R D expenses of  310 to  340 million  These capital and R D projects will develop the next generation of fuel efficient vehicles and enhance the company s manufacturing and parts distribution facilities  Thank you  We d be pleased to answer your questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Tim Thein with Citigroup  Your line is now open Timothy Thein    Citigroup Inc    AnalystThank you  Good morning  Preston  maybe  the first one just on the guidance here for the first quarter  I m looking at build rate in the industry level at least projected build plans for North America calling for a modest    a small sequential step up from 4Q to 1Q and I m curious how PACCAR fits into that in terms of within the context of that I think you said down 5  to 7  deliveries where North America fits in relative to Europe and some of the other markets R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorSure  as we just said  we do expect deliveries to be overall 5  to 7  lower and that s kind of matching to where the market really is  North America is more of that than Europe is  Europe s been fairly stable for us through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter and real issues matching to where the normalized market has become where we re seeing the normalized market  So it s nice for us as we have a pretty good percentage of the backlog  I think it is roughly 34  of the backlog and compared to the inventory where there    we are a smaller percentage of the inventory  In fact  we only have about two months worth of inventory  2 5 months of inventory sitting in there  So we are in pretty good shape that way and it s just normalizing to the market Timothy Thein    Citigroup Inc    AnalystOkay  all right and then on the margins in the first quarter  there is obviously  you ll get a little bit more help from a seasonal perspective in the second quarter  but how are you considering that roughly 14  margin today in the first quarter relative to the full year R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorSo when you look at the first quarter and it s kind of where we stop our guidance to it is we look at the 14   I think that s really continuing to deliver as PACCAR does excellent industry leading margins and that s kind of consistently good for us and we re pleased to be able to deliver that and that s really because of the performance of our teams on the truck side  the financial services side  and the Parts team and in composite that works really well Timothy Thein    Citigroup Inc    AnalystAlrighty  I will now pass it on  Thank you R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorOkay  thank you  Have a good day OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan  Your line is now open Thompson Rich    JPMorgan    AnalystHi  this is Thompson Rich  Phonetic  on behalf of Ann R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorHello Thompson Rich    JPMorgan    AnalystHi  quick question on SG A  which came in a bit higher than we had modeled for the fourth quarter  Can you just talk about what drove the year on year increase  Is Q4 a fair run rate for 2020 R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorWhen we look at SG A  one of the nice things for PACCAR is we have the lowest SG A in the industry by a  Phonetic  substantial  We do a great job of managing that  As a percentage of sales  it was actually down in 2019 at the end of the year and we always take a look  we have a rigorous approach to cost control at all elements of the business both in up cycles and down cycles and we continue to manage that cost to the great levels we maintain  It s how we think about it  Consider very little things  very little is fixed costs and just try to do a great job Thompson Rich    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay and can you discuss new orders in North America and Europe for PACCAR relative to the industry  I think last quarter you noted your backlog represented 36  of the industry backlog  Where does it stand at the end of Q4 R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorSure  our backlog is really sitting around 34  is what we have now  As we look at orders  orders are a complicated thing because it depends on everybody s inputs for what s an order and what s been canceled  So what we think about more is we make sure that what we re building has a firm order a customer name on it  and that s what we do and so we ve been able to adjust our build rates aligned with our orders and that carries us forward as we look into next year OperatorOur next question comes from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies  Your line is open Stephen Volkmann    Jefferies    AnalystHey  gGood morning  gentlemen  I m curious  Preston  based on what you know today  obviously things could change  but are the run rates for each of your factories kind of what you d expect to be sort of stable through the year or do you think at some point there will be another production cut needed R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorI think we think about it in a little bit more close in view than that  We think about whether the orders we have right now present the backlog we need to keep the factories running smoothly and that s where we re at right now  We ve continued to adjust as I said  we think  first quarter s deliveries will be down 5  to 7  and build kind of matches that  Actually  it has to tie together  So that s where we re thinking about in the first quarter  We are operating in what we think is a good economy  GDP growth is going to be up almost 2  in the U S  We think European GDP is growing  So there is some positive reasons to think about the economy and the operating environment  So we ll see what happens through the course of the year as far as build Stephen Volkmann    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  thanks  And can you just comment on what you re seeing in terms of used pricing and I ll pass it on R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorSure  used pricing as we said in the last quarterly is continuing to be a headwind  I think in the last time we talked about it being somewhere in the double digit declines and so a nice thing for being part of PACCAR  as we have an amazing team in our PACCAR Financial Services Group that does a great job of managing the used trucks  We sell the best trucks in the industry and the second owners love buying PACCAR products  It s really one of our inherent advantages and the other part of it is  I think we continue to invest in our used truck organization so that we add new used truck centers throughout Europe and North America to make sure that we are meeting the market needs as we grow our market share  it means there is ultimately more used trucks and we want to take care of our customers with those used truck centers Stephen Volkmann    Jefferies    AnalystThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities  Your line is now open Andy Casey    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystThanks a lot  Good morning R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorGood morning Andy Casey    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystI want to kind of flip over to Financial Services  Revenue was quite strong  Can you comment on what drove the strength in revenue and then also within the Financial Services  the provision for losses on receivables dropped on an absolute basis sequentially against what continues to be a pretty challenging used truck price environment that you just described and I m just wondering what the drivers were for that as well R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorSure  Harry  you want to Harrie C  A  M  Schippers    President   Chief Financial OfficerSure  So the PACCAR Financial had a good quarter  We have a good portfolio  record revenues  so that drives a lot of the profit improvement  but like Preston said used trucks continue to be a headwind for the finance company  We expect that that will continue in the first quarter and customers continue to pay their bills  Past dues are low  below 1  and credit losses are favorable too  So we expect with all of that the first quarter results of the finance company to be very similar to the fourth quarter Andy Casey    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  Thank you and just Harrie  back on the revenue  it went up pretty significantly year over year  but also sequentially    was there any Harrie C  A  M  Schippers    President   Chief Financial OfficerSure  some of that reflects the increased volume of used truck sales that flow through the finance company Andy Casey    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOh OK  Okay  thank you very much Harrie C  A  M  Schippers    President   Chief Financial OfficerYou re welcome OperatorOur next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs  Your line is now open Jerry Revich    Goldman Sachs    AnalystYes  hi  good morning and good afternoon everyone  I m wondering if you could please talk about what you re seeing out of your competitors in the U S  and Canada  Typically  when we are heading into a production downturn  you folks are the first to cut production and your market share in the initial stages of a downturn is typically lower as a result and this time your production share actually went up in the first quarter  a reduction here  can you just talk about what you re seeing out of your competitors and what s driving the different cadence in terms of your production share in this fourth quarter compared to the past couple of production downturns R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorWell  what we experience right now is we have just fantastic products out there with great dealer network  great products out there  and I think there just is strong demand for our products  This really is simply as it can be put as people want to drive the best trucks and have the best services and the best powertrains and that s what we offer  So we build again    coming back to what    we build to what an order    to the orders we have and that s driving our increase in share and that s as simple as we think about it  it s really kind of a nice picture for us because they re great products Jerry Revich    Goldman Sachs    AnalystAnd when you look at the overall inventory picture for the industry  So we re exiting  19 with about 73 000 trucks in inventory  which if you apply prior cycles  looks like the industry need to take out about 20 000  maybe 30 000 trucks out of dealer inventories  What does that picture look like for PACCAR just as the natural transition for some custom end applications that are completed at the dealer site  how much do you anticipate your dealer inventories coming down in  20 R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorIt s a good question  Our inventories are in a really good shape  You said 73 000  So that s kind of a round number  If I use a round number for us  call it 18 000 of Kenworth and Peterbilt combined  It obviously depends when you start it  but as we have 30  of the market share  we really only have 25  of the inventory  So that says again that we re in pretty good condition and some of that inventory  quite a bit of that inventory is with body builders right now  So we have the leader in the vocational market and so some of those trucks are getting bodies put onto them right now Jerry Revich    Goldman Sachs    AnalystAnd then on the parts business  you folks have continued to have pretty steady performance even though there has been some puts and takes for freight markets  can you just talk about in your outlook for 4  to 6  growth how much is the contribution from your engines hitting the sweet spot    the new truck lineup hitting the sweet spot for parts consumption versus underlying freight traffic  Can you just give us a bit context directionally how you re thinking about the pieces relative to the outlook R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorYeah  I think that there is a couple of things going on and the parts team continues to do an outstanding job  They have great technologies they are employing  It is something that we maybe don t give enough sharing of  Their e commerce program is outstanding and that s doing a great job of making sure we have the right products at the right places  As we mentioned in our earlier comments  we re investing in distribution centers as well  A new distribution center coming online this year in Las Vegas  Nevada  another one in Ponta Grossa in Brazil  Those contribute to parts performance  We continue to grow our proprietary power trains you mentioned  So I wouldn t say that s stable  That s a growing opportunity for us  Last year  we finished at 43  for engine sales being with our MX engines  So that s great  It was 47  actually in the fourth quarter  That s another opportunity for us  You mentioned the great trucks and the growing share they contribute to the parts teams growth  There s just a lot of great things happening on the parts team and so we have a great future to look forward to there Jerry Revich    Goldman Sachs    AnalystSo you don t need really strong pickup in freight volumes to get the 4  to 6  growth target   Speech Overlap R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorNo  I think what you see is the freight volume does drive demand  but it s really about the size of the part bigger    bigger influences or size of the part  size of your proprietary content and that takes a few years to mature where parts consumption is really growing  Again  looking forward  I think that we have a great amount of freight being hauled right  Freight tonnage was up last year over 3  and so that s going to contribute to utilization  we agree with you on that Jerry Revich    Goldman Sachs    AnalystI appreciate the discussion  Thanks R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorHave a good day OperatorOur next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America  Your line is now open Ross Gilardi    Bank of America    AnalystYeah  good morning guys R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorGood morning Ross Gilardi    Bank of America    AnalystI just had a question on decremental margin  I mean  if you go back to 2016  you seem to have sort of a similar revenue composition of down truck production but very steady parts and that translated into kind of 15  ish type decremental gross margin pre R D  Is there any reason why you shouldn t be able to sustain a similar level of performance or anything to think about this time around versus versus then R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorNo  I think you characterized it well and then we think about incrementals and decrementals in that 15  to 20  range and so what as you said  we saw in the 2016 time frame and I think that s a nice way to look at it going forward Ross Gilardi    Bank of America    AnalystOkay  great  And then the parts business has remained very resilient but certainly did decelerate a bit as the year kind of grinded on  Are you seeing any type of maintenance deferrals amid softer market conditions and when you say that you expect the business to be up 4  to 6  in 2020  is that somewhat second half weighted or do you think we ll see this acceleration back to that growth trajectory out of the gate in the first half of the year R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorYeah  I think that the 4  to 6  obviously is what we said for how we look at it going forward and I don t think I would try to stratify that by quarter  I think its going to be good performance throughout  Obviously  there can always be moments of cyclicality that are impossible to kind of guess where people are going to be by weeks or a month  but in general with great freight volumes  a great parts team  the right product lineups and the right investments  it s going to continue to deliver Ross Gilardi    Bank of America    AnalystAnd then just on the SG A  the question you got before  Are you trying to say that SG A as a percentage of sales overall should be roughly similar to where it was in 2019 R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorWell  that s  if you go back and look  that s where SG A has kind of run for us  Again  comparing it to the industry  it s significantly  the leanness of PACCAR shows through and we continue to do a great job of managing that SG A and I think we ll continue to do that going forward Ken Hastings    Senior Director of Investor RelationsWell  I think the context of the prior question was just that it did jump a little bit in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter  So just realistically  if we re looking at it for the full year  I m just trying to get a sense if I take your sales if it s going to   R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorTake a longer view of it and look where PACCAR has historically performed and know that we ll perform in that same level  as I think I would guess I d share is we will continue to rigorously manage our costs and control them and make the right decisions to build the future of the company in a great way Ross Gilardi    Bank of America    AnalystOkay and then just lastly on the R D side  I mean you re guiding to sort of stable R D  but in the context of getting to production models for your alternative powertrain models over the next year and a half  how should we think about that  I guess I m a little bit surprised that that number is not ramping up a little bit as you re moving in that direction R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorI think we have an amazing team of engineering people around the world and they re doing a fantastic job of looking at how we should go to production  We re working closely with all the customers who s interest is in alternative powertrains and we ll have the right technologies for those customers when it comes time  We continue to do that in PACCAR s way which is with good decision  making prudent investments  and leveraging our supply base and the other companies that are out there Ross Gilardi    Bank of America    AnalystThanks very much R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorYou bet OperatorOur next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse  Your line is now open Jamie Cook    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  good morning  I guess two follow up questions one within the U S  when you re talking about your orders and your backlog  can you distinguish between what you re seeing on the vocational side versus line haul side  If there is any variation there and then just second a nuance when you re talking about Europe relative to the retail sales guide and relative to what other customers have come out to set it sounds like you re seeing Europe sort of more stable  I m just wondering if Europe is trending a little better than what you would have thought so far and if so what geographies are driving that  Thank you R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorLet s take the first part of the question  I think we are the leaders in the vocational market  Peterbilt and Kenworth are  and they do a great job of that  The vocational market is is doing really well throughout U S  and Canada  Housing start is up  construction being strong  PACCAR does a great job there and so that s a good percentage of our orders  We re obviously pleased with how that s working and feel like that will continue through the course of the year as the economy develops  I think from the European side of the question  I think Europe is working the way we thought it might work into the first quarter where our build rates have been stable there for two quarters now  more than two quarters and we re delivering good market share and people are loving the DAF trucks  Freight continues to be moved from Central and Eastern Europe into Western Europe  That s kind of a continuing trend line    macro trend and we benefit from that because DAF is a market leader in those areas and it really contributes to our success Jamie Cook    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay  Thank you R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorYou bet OperatorOur next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS  Your line is now open Steven Fisher    UBS    AnalystThanks  Good morning  guys R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorHey good morning Steven Fisher    UBS    AnalystGood morning  Wondering how you feel about the second half visibility and your confidence in the outlook  obviously in the first half you have more backlog  but curious how you formed your full year market view and your assumptions in the first half versus the second half R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorYeah  I think what we did is we said that we have a growing economy  So that s contributory  We re very close with all our customers and we spend a lot of time talking to them about how their businesses are working because that s really the underlying principle for how our build will develop  In the last even few weeks last week or two  I ve talked to several of my friends that are refrigerated carriers  flatbed haulers  and truckload carriers throughout the country just to see how their businesses are running  they re running well and yet  we still feel like there will be some  there was probably an over buy in 2018 2019 and so that s going to normalize itself into the 230 000 to 260 000 kind of a market for U S  and Canada Steven Fisher    UBS    AnalystAre those customers telling you that they re going to start stepping up their orders at some particular point in the year to be able to hit that    make that 230 000 to 260 000 market number work R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorIt s not that specific  I think people buy trucks when they need them and there is a huge population of people buying trucks  so it would be not accurate to model it that way  not that specifically Steven Fisher    UBS    AnalystOkay and then just one quick one on the FinCo as you think about 2020  should we sort of carry forward this Q4 profitability level for the whole year of 2020 or do you think there would be some fluctuations on that relative to just demand and used values R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorI think the team has done a really nice job in the FinCo of delivering good performance  We expect that performance to deliver through the first quarter and then we ll watch as the year develops through that Steven Fisher    UBS    AnalystOkay  Thank you OperatorOur next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets  Your line is now open Seth Weber    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystHey  good morning  everybody R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorGood morning Seth Weber    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystI just wanted to circle back on the Europe question  I think  if my numbers are right  your market    the DAF share actually ticked down a little bit 2019 versus  18  Is there anything you d call out there from a regional or country perspective and do you think that that reverses here in 2020  Thanks R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorYeah  so two thoughts to that is  we had 16 2  in the 2019  which was the second best year ever  which is coming off of our 16 6   you re right  that was up 1  Phonetic  point and 1 3   Phonetic  we had huge gain and we ve held on to that gain and we have good momentum right now I think  The other part of it is on the medium duty side  we grew our share from 9  to 9 7  during the course of 2019  So we actually grew there and then I think it s    I wouldn t try to isolate down from that  The U K  did really well  but we are performing well in a lot of the markets in Europe and I think the DAF trucks are really performing and helping our customers be successful Seth Weber    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  thanks and then just to follow up on  I think you mentioned pricing price cost was positive in the fourth quarter  anything you d call out for your thoughts for 2020  Do you expect that to continue R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorI think what we saw was prices were a little bit realized over a little bit over 2   Phonetic  and costs were less than 2  and we ll watch what happens in 2020 and see how that model develops for us  but there s obviously going to be fluctuations as we go forward Seth Weber    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  That s all I had  Thanks guys OperatorOur next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI  Your line is now open David Raso    Evercore ISI    AnalystHi  thank you  I wanted to pick up on the point about price cost  Is the first quarter  the implied deliveries are down about 17  year over year and in that context  I think the 14  gross margin would be viewed as fairly impressive  Price cost you said was positive in the fourth quarter  can you give us some sense the cadence or what do you expect for the first quarter  I think people are just trying to figure out if there is a risk to the top line  what s the decremental on it  In the first quarter  the setup on the guide  again relatively impressive at 14  gross margin with that kind of delivery decline  So can you help us a bit on maybe mix in the backlog  price cost in the first quarter  We re just trying to get a sense of the resiliency of that again  relatively impressive decremental in the first quarter R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorI think    thanks for the question  David  I think when we think about it  it s really about making sure we have the right    that we are building the right quantity of trucks  which is obviously based on having the right orders and so we have those matched well together  We re not seeing tremendous fluctuations in costs  We re not seeing tremendous fluctuations in price  So the fact that we had a good price realization in the fourth quarter was advantageous to us and we ll see what happens as we get into 2020 and watch what that model looks like David Raso    Evercore ISI    AnalystSo the price cost spread in the first    in the fourth quarter  you don t expect it to be terribly different in the first or second  I think we were just trying to figure out is that really a mix  price cost benefit to get you to stay at 14  gross margins or is it just structurally with parts and so forth that we can be somewhat comfortable even if we do want to model more conservative top line that the gross margin resiliency is there  I mean that s the kind of spirit of the question R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorYeah  I think if I try to get the spirit of it  it really if you think about prices because the team does a great job of supporting customers and people are willing to pay for our trucks  That s the overarching thing on price to me is that people want PACCAR products because they are the best and then they are willing to buy those products  I think that part of the truck part and other gross margin performance has to do with the strong performance of our parts organization  So that is a    as truck sales is down  parts mix is up  that s a contributor as well and really just both of those things that keep us performing at the industry leading levels David Raso    Evercore ISI    AnalystBut it s not necessarily because price cost gets notably better in the first quarter as and maybe some thought your costs are down from steel R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorSo there s nothing substantial there David Raso    Evercore ISI    AnalystAll right  Appreciate it  All right  thank you R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorYou bet OperatorOur next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley  Your line is now open Courtney Yakavonis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystMorning  guys  Just back on the FinCo again  I just wanted to understand because it seemed like your pre tax profit was down and I think Steven asked earlier  just about carrying forward the margin  but was there anything one time that was impacting margins this quarter or is it just the weaker used values  Are there any impairments or increased depreciation expenses that are really causing that big step up in the interest in other borrowing expenses R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorYeah  your final statement is characterizing it accurately  What you say is we had record new business volume in 2019  the  5 6 billion that was a contributor to revenue growth and then more volume on the used side was the other contributor to revenues and that was the headwind on the profit side Courtney Yakavonis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystAnd I think you mentioned that you re still seeing the double digit declines in used  Have you seen any stabilization in used values or is it s still wait and see kind of how that market checks out R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorWell  it is a dynamic market  I think that the nice thing is  as I said and it can t be over stressed  the fact that especially maybe the second or equally the second owners really like our products  So that s helpful to us from the price position compared to the rest of the industry  So that works to keep us at a premium  not just for the first  but the second owner and then I would share your comment that things have stabilized a little bit  We see one way to look at that is that the amount of inventory coming in is equal to the inventory going out  So that s helpful as well  We re not building used inventory and so kind of the state of where it is right now Courtney Yakavonis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystAnd then just on the capex side  I think your capex for the year came in about  100 million below what your guidance had been and you obviously didn t change the capex guidance for next year  So just wanted to understand kind of what that discrepancy was and if anything  is proceeding ahead of schedule or any projects got cut R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorNo  in fact that s not exactly how we saw it  We saw capex was kind of slightly higher than where we d started and we have a good cash flow or capex plan for 2020 as well  which is going to deliver the great products we need  I wonder if you re looking at the cash flow statements more than your capex commitments Courtney Yakavonis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  Yeah  I was looking at the 575  Phonetic  versus the guidance for  625 million to  675 million but maybe that s the issue R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorI think that s what you re looking at  I think so     indecipherable  is the number that we re talking about for 2019 Courtney Yakavonis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  Perfect  Thank you for clarifying that  And then  and then just lastly  I think the comments that your build has remained steady  I just want to make sure that  that means that you really don t anticipate any further production cuts from the build rates that you are at currently R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorI think what we said is we would expect in the first quarter that deliveries will be down 5  to 7  and that s obviously matching the order intake Courtney Yakavonis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  perfect  Thank you OperatorOur next question comes from Joel Tiss with BMO  Your line is now open Joel Tiss    BMO    AnalystHey guys  how is it going R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorReally good how about for you Joel Tiss    BMO    AnalystHanging in there  Yeah  so I wonder if we could  if you could spend a minute just talking about Latin America  about how the setup is  Kind of what your market share is looking like and how you think you can gain a little bit more share in 2020 and just kind of the setup of the market there R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorSure  it s been a fantastic journey for us there  We have a great set of dealers really neat products down there  We ve got a lot of of success with the dealers and the customers  I think the brand reputation for DAF in Brazil has grown tremendously in just a very short period of time  We re looking at our market share growth opportunities as being substantial  We think that the market is relatively stable down there  So Brazil comes in at 75 000  the South American market overall is 100 000 to 110 000  As we noted  we increased our deliveries by 60  last year in South America  So  substantial growth that way  We ll just look forward to continuing growing the truck sales  The parts business is doing really well  We introduced the Financial Services business for customer financing in Brazil last year  So a lot of good activity happening for us in South America Joel Tiss    BMO    AnalystOkay  Thank you R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorYou bet OperatorOur next question comes from Felix Boeschen with Raymond James  Your line is now open Felix Boeschen    Raymond James    AnalystYeah  hey  thanks for squeezing me in here  I appreciate some of the color on the parts outlook but as for sort of dissecting some of the different buckets within the business  I m curious if you have an update on the TRP Stores  How many do you plan to add next year and maybe any color on some sort of same store sales growth number in that existing base of the stores R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorTRP has been a great addition for us in reaching a new customer base  They ve done a fantastic job of that  There s 210 stores now that are in operation  So that s growth year over year  We ll keep growing the number of stores where they make sense with our dealers all around the world  That s in Europe  it could be in Russia  it could be in South America and North America  all of the above  really  So we ll continue to see the brand grow and perform well and bring new customers to PACCAR Felix Boeschen    Raymond James    AnalystOkay  And then just curious to see if you have an update on the margin profile into next year for the parts business  On one hand  you obviously have the aging MX engine population and then the other one the TRP revenue increase  So any color would be appreciated on that R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorI think the margin profile will stay relatively in the same range Felix Boeschen    Raymond James    AnalystOkay  like 27   28  R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorThat kind of range Felix Boeschen    Raymond James    AnalystGot it  Thank you R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorYou bet OperatorOur next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research  Your line is open Adam Uhlman    Cleveland Research    AnalystHi guys  good morning  good afternoon R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorGood morning  good afternoon Adam Uhlman    Cleveland Research    AnalystHey  going back to the MX engine  it looks like you had a pretty strong fourth quarter  I don t know how much of that increase was mix of customers that you re shipping the engine out to  but how are you thinking about your penetration rate for this year R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorSo we have a great powertrain offering  obviously the MX engine that s a core of it  We have great relationship with Cummins as well who does a great job of supporting our customers with their powertrain  We did grow our MX engine share to 47  in the fourth quarter for a full year average of 43   Part of what enabled that is we invested in manufacturing capacity in the course of the year last year  So we have adequate capacity to build as many MXs as we want for the customers and we look forward to seeing that continue to grow as we move through the cycle Adam Uhlman    Cleveland Research    AnalystOkay  got you and then just a clarification  again on the Financial Services revenue  can you tell us how much your used truck sales were up in the quarter R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorI don t have that detail sitting around in front of me  but they did increase  I just don t know the number in front of us Adam Uhlman    Cleveland Research    AnalystOkay  Thank you R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorYou bet OperatorOur next question comes from Matt Elkott with Cowen  Your line is now open Matt Elkott    Cowen    AnalystGood morning and good afternoon everyone  Thanks for taking my question  I think your heavy duty percentage tends to be around 85  historically  So first  are you still comfortable with that breakout longer term  And the second part of my question  what was it in the fourth quarter R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorSo I think that that general percent is OK but we have great growth opportunities in the heavy side and the medium side as we look forward to it  So we ll continue to see share develop at PACCAR positively  Take a steady approach to it and been very successful growing share and we ll continue to find that same success  I don t think there ll be much of a shift though and I don t have the exact number  but you can    your numbers of ratios are about right Matt Elkott    Cowen    AnalystOkay and do you think that you may have picked up some share with the the GM strike in the Class 6 to Class 7 categories in the fourth quarter R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorI think we picked up share because we just have great trucks  great people  great dealers Matt Elkott    Cowen    AnalystGot it and then just one other question that s    if we take a longer term view  could you update us on your strategic priorities  anything that s likely to become more of a focus  more of a growth driver  whether it s a specific region or more vertical integration of PACCAR engines or alternative technologies or anything else R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorWell  you hit some of them  right  we re going to keep growing organically  We re going to grow geographically where it makes sense and provides a profit for the corporation and we re going to keep making the prudent investments in technologies that deliver great trucks and powertrains to our customers when they need them  So all of those will be areas that we grow in Matt Elkott    Cowen    AnalystGreat  thank you very much R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorYou bet OperatorOur next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research  Your line is now open Rob Wertheimer    Melius Research    AnalystYeah  hey everybody  My question is  you gave helpful comments on the European market share  Are you willing to sort of talk about your theme of improving straight truck market share  where that s progressing and whether you need that to work to sort of get above a certain threshold  Any update you can give us there R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorIt continues to be a focus  We continue to do well with it  We did grow as a percentage there in the straight truck market  That s going to continue to be an area of what we just talked on the prior question is organic growth for us Rob Wertheimer    Melius Research    AnalystAre you growing both    well  you have room to grow both tractor and straight truck share in Europe or is there any kind of limit on the tractor side R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorNo  there is no limit  I mean  we re the market leader in tractors and we ll continue to be enjoying that and looking for extension of that and growing on the straight truck side as well Harrie C  A  M  Schippers    President   Chief Financial OfficerSo we have the product in the straight truck side  So if you look at markets where that has been for a long time  the U K  Netherlands  Belgium  a straight truck market share is about the same as the tractor market share  So we do have the products  It s just a matter of growing that business also in markets like Germany  France  Italy  and Spain Rob Wertheimer    Melius Research    AnalystOkay  Thank you  And if I can  I don t know if this is an answerable question  but I ll ask it anyway  Just what s your    in a normal up and down cycle  what s your preferred pacing of production changes given supply chain given ramping et cetera  would you be looking to make adjustments one and two quarters out or two quarters and three quarters out  just  I know you don t try to hold a lot of inventory and not trying to stop the dealers  just a little bit about the rhythm of how you think about production changes R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorYeah  I think we build trucks to order is the essence of it  which is different than the automotive industry  What we do is when we talk to our customers and they need to truck  then we schedule that in and we try to maintain some kind of a visibility whether that s four  eight  12 weeks and that s how we define our production schedules Rob Wertheimer    Melius Research    AnalystOkay  No  Thank you R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorAll right OperatorOur next question comes from Joe O Dea with Vertical Research  Your line is now open Joseph O Dea    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystHi  good morning  My impression so far and commentary around pricing expectations is that it s more of a wait and see into 2020  What we saw the last time  demand did soften in 2016 is that there was a little bit of pricing pressure and I m just curious whether you anticipate that we should be looking at something similar just given a little bit softer demand or if you re seeing anything different out there across competitor behavior that would suggest that the pricing can hold up R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorI think if you think of in terms of truck part and other  in the truck side  there will be obviously market dynamics drive differences  but we have a continued strong performance  an increasing percentage of our performance coming from parts and they are doing a great job  So it s a little bit of a balancing factor to it looking back to prior cycles  but no  I don t think you should think that PACCAR s going to do anything except deliver the best margins in the industry Joseph O Dea    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystAnd then I guess related but a little bit more of a mix type question  Similarly  going back from if we just track 2015 to 2016  the average truck price was down and it was more than just a pure pricing effect  Is there anything to just be aware of with general mix in a softer demand environment and what that means for average unit pricing just given the mix effect R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorI don t really think so  I don t think there s anything in there Joseph O Dea    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystOkay  thanks a lot OperatorOur next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Loop Capital Markets  Your line is now open Jeff Kauffman    Loop Capital Markets    AnalystThank you very much  Hi everyone  Hey  you know  lot of the real smart questions have been asked here  I just want to follow up with one  I think I know the answer to and just a detail  but when you re giving the 5  to 7  down figure  That s sequentially versus 4Q  that s not a year on year number  Correct R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorYes  correct Jeff Kauffman    Loop Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  thank you  And then secondly  with the U S  pulling back a little bit more than Europe  at least in the outlook  How should I think about tax rate or are there any other changes that I would think about to some of the other line items that would occur as a result of that R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorYeah  I don t think    there is not going be much change in tax rate overall Jeff Kauffman    Loop Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  so consistent with where we are this year R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorYes Jeff Kauffman    Loop Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  that s all I have  Thank you very much and congratulations R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorYou bet  Have a great day Operator Operator Instructions  Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities  Your line is now open Andy Casey    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystHello  Again  thanks for the follow up  Two questions  one short term  I know it s a smaller volume market for you  but you have a pretty good share over there  I m wondering if you could comment on whether you expect the Australian natural disasters to have any tangible impact on 2020 demand R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorWell  first of all  our hearts and prayers go out to the people there and the country that has been affected    adversely affected to it  No  I don t think in the longest term that it is going to have any impact to us  We ll continue to be the market leader Andy Casey    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  thanks and then separately  longer term  you talked about it at CES and then again in the release today  the battery electric trucks expected to hit the market a year to year and a half from now  Are you  based on your work with the customers  seeing any potential for acceleration in adoption rates versus what you originally expected or is it pretty much on track R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorI think it s pretty much on track  It has to make commercial sense or be regulated in and we have really good partnerships that we re working with to bring the right trucks to the customers and we will supply them the best trucks  the best alternative powertrain trucks as they need them Andy Casey    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystThanks and then a little bit more detail on that  Preston  you have kind of divergent  I think divergent potential regulations going on between the EPA and CARB maybe that s been closed  but is there potential for a significantly different adoption rate in let s say California and associated states versus the rest of the country R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorThere could be  I mean that can happen  It can happen in Europe that way as well  I think from our standpoint  that s not going to material effect how we develop the products  What we re going to do is develop the best technologies with the highest performance and then we will just supply those for the markets they need based upon where the customers are operating Andy Casey    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  thank you very much R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorYou bet OperatorThere are no other questions in queue at this time  Are there any additional remarks from the company R  Preston Feight    Chief Executive Officer   DirectorWe d like

158756,380272,PCAR,Can Value Investors Consider PACCAR  PCAR  A Worthy Pick ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put PACCAR Inc    NASDAQ PCAR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  PACCAR has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 34  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 71  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  PACCAR s current PE level puts it way below its midpoint of 14 04 over the past five years The stock s PE compares quite favorably with the Auto Tires Trucks Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 10 11  This indicates that the stock is undervalued right now  compared to its peers Meanwhile  PACCAR has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 9 34  which is in line with the current level  So  it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Oshkosh Corporation stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  PACCAR has a P S ratio of just 0 88  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 12x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  PACCAR currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes PACCAR a solid choice for value investors and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Oshkosh Corporation is just 1 11  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 25  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate What About the Stock Overall Though PACCAR might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of B  This gives F a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate go down in the past sixty days compared to four upward revisions  while the full year estimate has seen one down and six up in the same time period This has had a positive effect on the consensus estimate  While the current quarter consensus estimate increased 3 8  over the past two months  the current year estimate has inched up 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below PACCAR Inc  Price and Consensus   Despite such positive analyst sentiments  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and it is the reason why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LinePACCAR is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite a strong industry rank  among Top 41  of more than 250 industries   with a Zacks Rank  3 it is too hard to get excited about the stock Also  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for the Zacks Rank and past industry performance to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors

158786,380302,PCAR,Paccar  PCAR  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Paccar  PCAR  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This truck maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 82 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  14 5  
Revenues are expected to be  6 16 billion  up 12 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 18  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Paccar 
For Paccar  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 90  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Paccar will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Paccar would post earnings of  1 66 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 81  delivering a surprise of  9 04  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Paccar doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/paccar-pcar-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200440171,200440171

158790,380306,PCAR,North American truck orders more than double in October,news,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT  Reuters    North American orders for Class 8 semi trucks more than doubled in October compared with the same period in 2016  and strong orders should continue to bolster truck production into 2018  FTR  a company that tracks the industry  said on Thursday 
Preliminary truck orders for October hit 35 700  up significantly from 13 674 in October 2016  according to FTR 
 The market continues to follow our expectations and highlights that the market fundamentals remain solid as we approach 2018   said Jonathan Starks  FTR s chief operating officer 
October marks the fifth consecutive month of rising truck orders  Truck orders slumped in 2017 amid high inventory levels and truck companies  concerns over the state of the economy 
Class 8 semi trucks are the big rigs that haul most U S  freight down the country s highways 
Truck order growth in 2018 could be fueled by a federal mandate that truck firms switch to electronic logs  ELDs  from paper logs next month  Experts predict many smaller truck firms that fudge the books in order to stay profitable in a low margin industry will close up shop  benefiting larger companies and driving up demand for new vehicles

158840,380356,PCAR,A May To Forget ,opinion,"This difficult month was bookended by negative tariff news  It started a few weeks back when the U S  China trade talks suddenly broke down and ended today with President Trump threatening new tariffs on Mexico 
	In between  the major indices put together their first down month of 2019  And it wasn t just slightly off  the NASDAQ dipped by about 8  in May while the Dow and S P each declined approximately 6  
	We knew that Friday s session was going to be tough after the President unexpectedly threatened to impose a 5  tariff on Mexican imports starting on June 10 if that country doesn t help us at the border 
	And that s not all  the tariffs will progressively rise throughout the year and could reach as high as 25  if Mexico doesn t help the U S  with illegal immigration 
	That s the last thing the market wanted to hear  especially since the relationship with China has been deteriorating 
	The NASDAQ plunged 1 51   or nearly 115 points  to 7453 15  as technology will really feel the impact of a broadening trade conflict  The S P retreated further away from 2800 with a dive of 1 32  to 2752 06 
	These indices have now dropped for four straight weeks

158843,380359,PCAR,Volkswagen denies planning a bid for U S  Paccar,news,"By Edward Taylor and Andreas Cremer FRANKFURT BERLIN  Reuters    Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  denied planning a bid for U S  truck maker Paccar  O PCAR  after analysts published comments in a research note from a senior executive of German rival Daimler  DE DAIGn  saying he had heard of such a plan 
According to Bernstein Research  Daimler Trucks Chief Wolfgang Bernhard insisted that  serious  multiple sources  informed him that VW was going to bid for Paccar in 2015 
A spokesman at VW s Wolfsburg based headquarters emphatically denied the rumours  calling them  complete rubbish  
Daimler declined to comment while Paccar was not immediately available for comment  Bernhard was briefing analysts at an event hosted by Daimler Trucks late on Wednesday when he made the comments  Bernstein said 
Shares in VW fell as much as 1 4 percent and were trading 0 7 percent lower at 191 40 euros as of 0907 GMT  valuing the firm at 90 9 billion euros   123 99 billion   Paccar had a market capitalisation of  22 3 billion at Wednesday s close 
Europe s largest automotive group is pushing ahead with a long planned alignment of its heavy trucks brands MAN SE and Scania after its 6 7 billion euro   9 14 billion  bid for the Swedish division was accepted by shareholders 
To be headed by Daimler s previous trucks chief  Andreas Renschler  the VW led alliance of heavy duty vehicle makers aims to deepen cooperation in areas including drive trains  chassis and electronics 
But Scania  D SCVb  does not have a substantial presence in the United States  while MAN  DE MANG  is mainly active in Europe as well as Brazil and other emerging economies 
Analysts have long predicted VW would seek to enter the world s biggest trucks market  either via an acquisition of Paccar or of troubled U S  rival Navistar International  N NAV   to take on global trucks leaders Daimler and Volvo AB  ST VOLVb  
VW has indicated that despite its large cash reserves of 17 7 billion euros at the end of March  it would seek to raise funds for any further deals 
But Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn told the March 13 annual press conference that VW has no plans at present to expand the group through further acquisitions as it is focusing on integrating its 12 brand network 
Meanwhile  analysts questioned the rationale behind Bernhard s comments c

 The only rational answer to our mind is that Daimler is trying to make life difficult for anyone trying to further consolidate the industry   said Arndt Ellinghorst  an analyst at investment researchers ISI Group 
 There are probably few more efficient ways of doing this than in front of a group of sellside analysts

158872,380388,PCAR,PCAR Or FOXF  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Automotive   Domestic stocks have likely encountered both Paccar  PCAR  and Fox Factory Holding  FOXF   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Right now  Paccar is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Fox Factory Holding has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that PCAR has an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
PCAR currently has a forward P E ratio of 10 69  while FOXF has a forward P E of 30 02  We also note that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 1 27  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  FOXF currently has a PEG ratio of 1 99 
Another notable valuation metric for PCAR is its P B ratio of 2 70  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  FOXF has a P B of 8 96 
These metrics  and several others  help PCAR earn a Value grade of A  while FOXF has been given a Value grade of F 
PCAR stands above FOXF thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that PCAR is the superior value option right now ",2019-05-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pcar-or-foxf-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200415568,200415568

158874,380390,PCAR,Looking For A Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why Paccar  PCAR  Is A Solid Choice,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Paccar  PCAR  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this truck maker is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Paccar is 8 2   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 6 2  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 3 8  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Paccar is 24 5   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 4 8  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 10 4  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 6 3  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Paccar  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3 2  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Paccar has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

This combination indicates that Paccar is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-05-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/looking-for-a-growth-stock-3-reasons-why-paccar-pcar-is-a-solid-choice-200415434,200415434

158905,380421,PCAR,Paccar  PCAR  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of PACCAR  PCAR   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 4 8  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  73 in the previous session  PACCAR has gained 25 4  since the start of the year compared to the 10 3  move for the Zacks Auto Tires Trucks sector and the 6 8  return for the Zacks Automotive   Domestic industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on April 30  2019  Paccar reported EPS of  1 81 versus consensus estimate of  1 66 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2 45  
For the current fiscal year  Paccar is expected to post earnings of  6 43 per share on  23 18 billion in revenues  This represents a 3 04  change in EPS on a 4 71  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  5 8 per share on  21 28 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of  9 86  and  8 21   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Paccar may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Paccar has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 11 1X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 7 7X versus its peer group s average of 7 6X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 33  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Paccar currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Paccar passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Paccar shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come ",2019-04-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/paccar-pcar-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200413746,200413746

158945,380461,PCAR,PCAR Vs  FOXF  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Automotive   Domestic sector might want to consider either Paccar  PCAR  or Fox Factory Holding  FOXF   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Paccar and Fox Factory Holding are both sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
PCAR currently has a forward P E ratio of 10 94  while FOXF has a forward P E of 30 86  We also note that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 1 30  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  FOXF currently has a PEG ratio of 2 04 
Another notable valuation metric for PCAR is its P B ratio of 2 87  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  FOXF has a P B of 9 21 
Based on these metrics and many more  PCAR holds a Value grade of A  while FOXF has a Value grade of F 
Both PCAR and FOXF are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that PCAR is the superior value option right now ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pcar-vs-foxf-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200407128,200407128
158946,380462,PCAR,Here Is Why Growth Investors Should Buy Paccar  PCAR  Now,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Paccar  PCAR  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this truck maker a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Paccar is 8 2   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 3 1  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 1 1  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Paccar is 24 5   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 4 8  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 10 4  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 6 3  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Paccar have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Paccar has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

This combination indicates that Paccar is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-04-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here-is-why-growth-investors-should-buy-paccar-pcar-now-200407186,200407186
158947,380463,PCAR,Paccar  PCAR  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Paccar  PCAR  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This truck maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 66 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  14 5  
Revenues are expected to be  5 99 billion  up 12 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 1  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Paccar 
For Paccar  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 18  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Paccar will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Paccar would post earnings of  1 57 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 65  delivering a surprise of  5 10  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

158976,380492,PCAR,Why Paccar  PCAR  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Paccar  PCAR   This company  which is in the Zacks Automotive   Domestic industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
When looking at the last two reports  this truck maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 4 21   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Paccar was expected to post earnings of  1 57 per share  but it reported  1 65 per share instead  representing a surprise of 5 10   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 50 per share  while it actually produced  1 55 per share  a surprise of 3 33  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Paccar lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Paccar has an Earnings ESP of  1 36  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on April 30  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-paccar-pcar-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200406852,200406852

159003,380519,PCAR,Is PACCAR  PCAR  A Suitable Stock For Value Investors Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put PACCAR Inc   NASDAQ PCAR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  PACCAR has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 1  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 6  If we focus on the long term PE trend  PACCAR s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point However  the stock s PE compares slightly unfavorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 10 9  This indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers Nonetheless  we should point out that PACCAR has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 8  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for PACCAR stock in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  PACCAR has a P S ratio of about 1 0  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  PCAR is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  PACCAR currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes PACCAR a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for PACCAR is 1 0  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 2  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  PCAR is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though PACCAR might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of A  This gives PCAR a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen eight upward and one downward revision in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 7 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 2 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below PACCAR Inc  Price and Consensus    Even though PACCAR has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LinePACCAR is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a robust industry rank  among the Top 29   should boost investor confidence However over the past two years  the industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite the poor past performance of the industry  a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in PACCAR Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ,2019-02-21,Zacks Investment

that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that PACCAR Inc has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 2  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for PACCAR Inc s stock in the near term too P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  PACCAR Inc s P CF ratio of 5 99 is lower than the industry average of 6 48  which indicates that the stock is somewhat undervalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  PACCAR Inc currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the

159027,380543,PCAR,PCAR Vs  FOXF  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Automotive   Domestic stocks have likely encountered both Paccar  PCAR  and Fox Factory Holding  FOXF   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Right now  Paccar is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Fox Factory Holding has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that PCAR likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than FOXF has recently  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
PCAR currently has a forward P E ratio of 10 34  while FOXF has a forward P E of 24 22  We also note that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 0 96  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  FOXF currently has a PEG ratio of 1 35 
Another notable valuation metric for PCAR is its P B ratio of 2 65  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  FOXF has a P B of 7 55 
These metrics  and several others  help PCAR earn a Value grade of A  while FOXF has been given a Value grade of D

159046,380562,PCAR,Are Investors Undervaluing Paccar  PCAR  Right Now ,opinion,"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks  we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies  With this in mind  we are always looking at value  growth  and momentum trends to discover great companies 
Looking at the history of these trends  perhaps none is more beloved than value investing  This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market  Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large 
Luckily  Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits  Value investors will be interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with both  A  grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now 
One company to watch right now is Paccar  PCAR   PCAR is currently holding a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and a Value grade of A  The stock has a Forward P E ratio of 9 84  This compares to its industry s average Forward P E of 11 06  Over the past year  PCAR s Forward P E has been as high as 17 87 and as low as 8 90  with a median of 11 43 
Investors will also notice that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 0 91  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  PCAR s industry currently sports an average PEG of 1 51  Over the past 52 weeks  PCAR s PEG has been as high as 1 79 and as low as 0 82  with a median of 1 15 
Another valuation metric that we should highlight is PCAR s P B ratio of 2 34  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This company s current P B looks solid when compared to its industry s average P B of 2 56  Over the past year  PCAR s P B has been as high as 3 45 and as low as 2 10  with a median of 2 70 
Finally  we should also recognize that PCAR has a P CF ratio of 6 54  This figure highlights a company s operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook  This company s current P CF looks solid when compared to its industry s average P CF of 6 82  PCAR s P CF has been as high as 11 90 and as low as 5 86  with a median of 7 64  all within the past year

159080,380596,PCAR,Auto Sales Ride On Strong Economy  Self Driving Gathers Pace,opinion,"After a tepid start to 2018  major automakers reported robust sales in March  A strong jobs market and favorable tax measures spurred consumer demand  which in turn pushed up sales  The March sales upsurge is in contrast to what the auto industry witnessed in the past year 
In fact  in 2017  U S  vehicle sales declined for the first time since the financial crisis  It slipped to 17 2 million from 17 55 million in 2016  Last year s decline notwithstanding  the overall level of sales aren t that far from all time record levels 
Elevated consumer confidence  a strong job market  big discount and a growing U S  economy have aided this rise  Even concerns over high interest rates and growing oil prices could not stop Americans from splurging on sport utility vehicles  SUVs  and pickup trucks  This has led to strong unit sales of SUVs  crossovers and pickup trucks 
Per Autodata  auto industry sales rose 2 5  to 1 653 529 while new vehicle sales gained 6  in March  Moreover  seasonally adjusted annual rate  SAAR  was 17 5 million in comparison to 16 8 million  a year ago  General Motors Company  NYSE GM   GM  posted a sales increase of 15 7  year over year to 296 341 vehicles 
This upside was attributable to the Chevrolet  GMC  Buick and Cadillac brands  Ford Motor Company  NYSE F   F  announced a 3 5  rise in year over year sales to 244 306 vehicles  boosted by crossover and truck sales  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N V   FCAU  reported 13 6  growth in year over year sales to 216 063 vehicles in the United States 
There are also other reasons to be optimistic about the broader auto industry for both the short and the long run  Below  we highlight those that should drive the sector s performance in the near to medium term 
Opportunities
Strong Economy   Elevated Consumer Confidence
According to a recent report by the Federal Reserve  unemployment has dropped from 10  in October 2009 to 4 1   This is the lowest level in about 20 years  About 17 million jobs have been added through this expansion  The labor market has remained robust and is likely to also remain strong in the future 
Additionally  growing household wealth  stable income gains and elevated consumer confidence continue to support consumer spending  Also  fiscal sops and accommodative financial measures are aiding both household spending and business environments  These positive macroeconomic factors are likely to aid the U S  auto sector at least in the near term 
Improved Global Auto Industry Outlook
Leading rating agency Moody s has upgraded its outlook for the global auto industry from negative to stable  Improving business conditions have partly led to this rating upgrade  The rating agency has further added that it anticipates sales of cars  SUVs and light trucks to be higher this year than the previous projection 
In fact  prospects for growth are improving for the majority of the auto markets in the world  Moody s anticipates 1 5  rise in sales for 2018  unchanged from its previous projection  In addition  the rating agency expects U S  auto sales to shrink less in 2018 than its previous forecast

and 67 8   respectively However  on a year over year basis  the auto sector s bottom line in the to be reported quarter is expected to record a decline of 9 6  while the top line is likely to fall 3 4   However  the S P 500 companies are estimated to record respective 18 3  and 7 7  year over year rise in earnings and revenues during the quarter An improved economy and shift in consumer preferences toward trucks and sports utility vehicles  SUV  encouraged automakers to launch new models in the U S  market with an aim to earn their share of profit  In Europe  automakers are witnessing a decline in vehicle sales  Per European Automobile Manufacturers  Association  vehicle registrations edged down 0 6  in first quarter 2018  This decline is majorly due to slowing economic growth and uncertain

159225,380741,PCAR,Auto Industry Stock Outlook   Sept  2017,opinion,"The auto sector s joy ride in 2015  which continued in 2016  has been somewhat subdued in 2017  Not only that  the auto industry is undergoing a transition  courtesy of changing consumers  preference toward SUVs and crossovers  and the necessity for manufacturing electric vehicles 
According to IHS Markit forecast  total global light vehicle sales will reach 93 5 million units in 2017  up 1 5  from 2016  with most of the global growth coming from China 
In fact  automakers across the globe are partnering with local companies in China  the biggest car market in the world  where sales of electric vehicles are anticipated to increase  Renault SA  PA RENA   RNLSY  and Nissan Motor Co   Ltd   NSANY  have partnered with Chinese automaker Dongfeng Motor Group Co to manufacture battery powered automobiles in the Chinese market  Ford Motor Company  NYSE F   F  announced a joint venture to manufacture electric vehicles in China  Also  General Motors Co   GM  and other automakers have shared their plans of manufacturing electric vehicles in China 
On the other hand  automakers bore the brunt of expenses related to safety recalls and negative currency effects  Massive recalls related to Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  AG s  VLKAY  emission scandal and Takata Corp s defective airbag inflators have been hurting the auto sector in recent times  Rising delinquency rates in auto loans are expected to hurt sales in the future 
Zacks Industry Rank   Positive Outlook
The distinctive attributes of the auto industry prompted us to have a dedicated sector for the industry in our database  The automobile sector is one of the 16 Zacks sectors  unlike the S P classification  wherein autos are part of the Consumer Discretionary sector  The S P has 11 sectors compared with the 16 sectors for Zacks 
At the expanded classification level  the Zacks Auto sector is divided into six industries  Auto Domestic  Auto Foreign  Auto Original Equipment  Auto Replacement Parts  Auto Internal Combustion Engines and Rubber   Tires  The level of sensitivity and exposure to the different stages of the economic cycle vary for each industry 
We rank the 265 sub industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  We put our industries into two groups   the top half  industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank   Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1   To learn more visit    
The current Zacks Industry Rank is  111 for Automotive   Domestic  placing it at the top 43  of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries    6 for Automotive   Foreign  placing it at the top 2  of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries    49 for Automotive   Original Equipment  placing it at the top 19  of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries    111 for Automotive   Replacement Parts  placing it at the top 43  of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries    24 for Automotive   Internal Combustion Engines  placing it at the top 43  of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries    213 Rubber   Tires  placing it at the bottom 17  of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries  
Looking at the exact location of these industries  one could say that the general outlook for the auto industry is  Positive  
Sector Level Earnings Trend
The auto sector is expected to contribute 2 0  to the total S P 500 earnings in 2017  This is more than double its 0 9  market cap weight in the index at present 
Looking at the second quarter 2017 results of the auto sector  earnings decreased 0 3   Auto sector earnings are expected to decline 17 3  in the third quarter of 2017 but projected to rise 16 7  in fourth quarter 2017 
Total revenue declined 4  year over year in second quarter 2017  Revenues are expected to decline 2 3  in the third quarter of 2017 but edge up 0 2  in fourth quarter 2017

Bottom Line
The auto sector is currently has a lot of opportunities at the same time is facing challenges  While attractive financing options and impressive vehicle launches are driving sales  slowing sales growth in the United States  rising auto loan defaults and high levels of safety recalls act as dampeners 
At this juncture  we recommend stocks such as Continental AG  DE CONG   CTTAY   PACCAR Inc  NASDAQ PCAR   PCAR  and Fox Continental Holding Corp   FOXF   each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

reasons to be optimistic about the broader auto industry both in the short and long run  Below  we discuss a few key factors that should continue to drive the sector s performance in the near to medium term OpportunitiesGlobal Sales to Grow ModestlyAccording to IHS Markit forecast  total global light vehicle sales will reach 93 5 million units in 2017  up 1 5  from 2016  Majority of the global growth can be attributed to China  Chinese targeted auto excise duty incentives are expected to continue through 2017 IHS Markit anticipates China to remain the world s largest car market for the foreseeable future  It has uplifted its 2017 light vehicles sales in China forecast to 28 5 million units  up 1 9   Per the IHS Markit report  South Asian demand is likely to further recover in 2017  Light vehicle sales in the region are expected to grow 5 9  in 2017 Meanwhile  Association of Southeast Asian Nations   ASEAN   car markets are anticipated to grow 4 6   as recoveries continue in key markets Rising Vehicles Age in the United StatesFurther  the high average age of cars on U S  roads should continue to boost replacement demand for cars as well as car parts  According to IHS Automotive  by 2021  around 81 million vehicles are expected to be over 16 years old compared with 62 million vehicles today   This will benefit replacement part manufacturers and retailers  apart from new vehicle manufacturers and retailers Sales in China Rev UpA number of automakers  including the likes of Ford Motor Co   NYSE   and General Motors Company  have been banking on strong sales growth in China to drive earnings over the next few years  Auto sales in the world s largest automobile market increased 14 5  year over year to a record 28 119 000 units in 2016  Sales of passenger cars increased 14 9  to almost 24 38 million units  hitting a new high  Moreover  sales of commercial vehicles improved 5 8  year over year In the first seven months of 2017  both passenger cars and commercial vehicles registered robust sales in China  Sales of passenger cars increased 2  year over year to almost 12 93 million units in the first seven months of 2017  while sales of commercial vehicles rose 17 5  to 2 39 million units  Consequently  total automobile sales increased 4 1  year over year to over 15 33 million units Sustained Recovery in European UnionNew passenger car registrations in the European Union increased 4 7  to more than 8 million units in the first half of 2017  per the European Automobile Manufacturer s Association  The rise can be attributed to higher demand in Italy   8 9    Spain   7 1    Germany   3 1   and France   3    partly offset by a fall in demand in the United Kingdom   1 3    Rising consumer confidence  solid incentives  strong replacement demand and product launches are driving sales Attractive  Tech Savvy Vehicle LaunchesRising sales and intense competition are encouraging automakers to come up with new and attractive  technologically advanced vehicles to gain market share  Most automakers are also revamping their popular vehicles by adding new technologies and enhancing their visual appeal to revive sales  Features such as backup cameras  automatic emergency braking and in car connectivity are common in most vehicle segments In fact  automakers are offering attractive optional features in vehicles to scoop up more profits  These features provide scope for surplus revenue generation from small cars  which have lower profit margins than large trucks Bottom LineThe auto industry is benefiting from a number of factors  According to IHS Automotive  total global light vehicle sales will reach 93 5 million units in 2017  increasing 1 5  from 2016  Moreover  IHS Markit anticipates China to remain the world s largest car market for the foreseeable future  It has uplifted its 2017 light vehicles sales in China forecast to 28 5 million units  up 1 9   A few automobile stocks worth considering are Continental

Other auto stocks from the Zacks  industry which also carry a Zacks Rank  3 include Harley Davidson  Inc    NYSE HOG   and PACCAR Inc    NASDAQ PCAR   
Price Performance

The Zacks Automotive   Domestic industry has tasted success over the last one year  gaining 25 6  in the process  GM has underperformed the industry with a gain of 19 6  over this period  This is why it is stronger in terms of price performance since Ford has lost 13 4  over the same period 
Valuation
Since the auto sector is capital intensive  the most appropriate ratio to value companies is EV EBITDA  Additionally  it is the ideal metric to compare two companies within the same industry  Further  it is not impacted by differing capital structures and excludes the impact of non cash expenses  

First  it is important to consider where the industry as a whole stands from a valuation perspective  Here  we can see that with an EV EBITDA of 8 5  the entire domestic auto industry is marginally undervalued compared to the S P 500  which has a value of 10 88 
Coming to the two auto majors  both Ford and GM are undervalued relative to their broader industry  However  GM holds the edge here with an EV EBITDA value of 5 27  lower than 6 56 for Ford 
Debt to Equity Ratio
This is an important metric for the purpose of evaluating these two stocks since the industry is capital intensive in nature  The debt to equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well being of the company and its level is a good proxy for its debt servicing capacity  In this case  the industry as a whole has an alarmingly high debt to equity ratio of 243 23

Return on Equity

Dividend Yield
In the last one year period  Ford offered a higher than industry dividend yield  While the domestic auto industry offers a yield of 2 76   Ford returned 5 32   Since GM has a dividend yield of 4 38   the marginally smaller auto stock wins this round fair and square

159248,380764,PCAR,Should Value Investors Consider PACCAR  PCAR  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put PACCAR Inc   NASDAQ PCAR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  PACCAR has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 90  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 34  While PACCAR s current PE level puts it almost in line with its midpoint over the past five years  the current level stands below the highs for the stock  signaling scope for entry However  the stock s PE also compares unfavorably with the Zacks classified Auto Tires Trucks sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 11 21  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that PACCAR s forward PE is roughly same as its trailing twelve months value  so we might say that the forward earnings estimates are incorporated in the company s share price as of now  We define forward PE as current price relative to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  PACCAR has a P S ratio of about 1 31  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 16 right now  which indicates that the stock is undervalued from the P S aspect too Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  PACCAR currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes PACCAR a good choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though PACCAR might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  B  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives PCAR a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  C    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been somewhat encouraging  The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen four up and three down in the same time period Notably  this has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 2 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has climbed 0 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below PACCAR Inc  Price and Consensus    However  industry challenges like stiff competition and higher supply of used trucks remain threats for the stock  which currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  Bottom LinePACCAR is an inspired choice for value investors  given its decent lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 18  out of over 250 Zacks industries  and a Zacks Rank  4  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  Further  the Zacks categorized Auto Manufacturers   Domestic industry has cleary underperformed the broader market in the last two years  as you can see below So despite having good value metrics  we find that PACCAR is not a strong value contender at this point  especially in light of its poor Zacks Rank and industry weakness Sell These Stocks  Now Just released  today s 220 Zacks Rank  5 Strong Sells demand urgent attention  If any are lurking in your portfolio or Watch List  they should be removed immediately  These sinister companies because many appear to be sound investments  However  from 1988 through 2016  stocks from our Strong Sell list have actually performed 6X worse than the S P 500 ,2017-06-26,Zacks Investment

159295,380811,PCAR,Will PACCAR s  PCAR  Earnings Disappoint Investors In Q2 ,opinion,"PACCAR Inc    NASDAQ PCAR   is set to report second quarter 2016 results on Jul 26  In the last quarter  the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4 21   Further  PACCAR posted positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 3 07   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors Influencing this Quarter
PACCAR is well positioned in the key non U S  markets due to its strategic investments  The company continues to expand its global network of strategically located parts distribution centers  These factors should positively impact second quarter earnings 
However  Class 8 industry retail sales for the U S  and Canada are expected to be in the range of 220 000 250 000 units in 2016  lower than the prior projection of 230 000 260 000 units as well as 278 000 units sold in 2015  This indicates the possibility of a year over year decline in the second quarter as well  which may adversely impact the company s upcoming results 
Moreover  DAF  owned by PACCAR was recently charged 752 7 million euros   829 4 million  by the European Union regulators for illegally forming a cartel with a few other truck makers  The company will pay the charge out of the 850 million euros   936 6 million  provision it created earlier 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that PACCAR is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  PACCAR has an Earnings ESP of  0 98  because the Most Accurate estimate stands at  1 01  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  1 02 
Zacks Rank  PACCAR currently has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Westport Fuel Systems Inc    NASDAQ WPRT   has an Earnings ESP of  9 09  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   The company s second quarter 2016 financial results are expected to release on Aug 3 
Allison Transmission Holdings  Inc    NYSE ALSN   has an Earnings ESP of  6 35  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company s second quarter 2016 financial results are expected to release on Jul 27
