What Are Smart Beta ETFs 
The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market 
Market cap weighted indexes offer a low cost  convenient  and transparent way of replicating market returns  and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency 
But  there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds  these funds track non cap weighted strategies  and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market 
By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk return performance  non cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics  or a combination of such 
The smart beta space gives investors many different choices  from equal weighting  one of the simplest strategies  to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility momentum based weighting  However  not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns

128726,350241,CHTR,U S  Supreme Court weighs Comcast appeal in Byron Allen racial bias lawsuit,news,"By Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  Supreme Court justices on Wednesday expressed sympathy toward allowing comedian and producer Byron Allen to pursue his racial bias lawsuit accusing cable television operator Comcast Corp  O CMCSA  of discriminating against black owned channels 
Over the course of an hour of oral arguments  however  the justices struggled over whether a lower court that cleared the way for the  20 billion lawsuit against Comcast to proceed had reviewed the case under the proper legal standard 
Their ruling  due by the end of June  could impact the ability of plaintiffs to enforce claims under the Civil Rights Act of 1866  a post Civil War law that forbids racial discrimination in business contracts 
At issue in the litigation is the refusal by Comcast to carry channels operated by Entertainment Studios Networks  owned by Byron Allen  who is black 
The case centers on whether a lawsuit like Allen s can proceed to trial without showing that racial discrimination was the predominant cause of the denial 
The San Francisco based 9th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals last year said lawsuits may go ahead if plaintiffs can show that discriminatory intent was one factor among others in the denial of a contract 
During Wednesday s arguments  several justices raised doubts that the standard to sustain a lawsuit should be as stringent as Comcast suggests 
Chief Justice John Roberts wondered why  if  clear racial animus  occurred at one step of a failed contract negotiation  it would not be reasonable to allege in a lawsuit that the discrimination carried through to the end 
Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted that such discrimination lawsuits are rarely thrown out at an early stage of litigation 
Both liberal and conservative justices  however  raised questions indicating that the appeals court decision siding with Allen may have to be set aside and reconsidered in light of their eventual ruling 
Entertainment Studios Networks sued in Los Angeles federal court  accusing certain cable companies including Comcast and  Charter Communications  Inc  O CHTR  of violating the civil rights law 
Comcast and Charter said their business decisions were based on capacity constraints  not race  and that Allen s channels  including JusticeCentral TV  Cars TV  and Comedy TV  did not show sufficient promise or customer demand to merit distribution 
Other distributors  including  Verizon Communications  Inc  N VZ   AT T Inc  N T  and DirecTV  carry some of Allen s programming  court papers said 
Allen pinned the rejections primarily on racial discrimination  accusing cable executives of giving insincere or invalid excuses and granting contracts to carry white owned networks during the same period 
The Trump administration backed Comcast in the case ",2019-11-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-supreme-court-weighs-comcast-appeal-in-byron-allen-racial-bias-lawsuit-2019996,2019996

rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year over year basis unless otherwise specified Joining me on today s call are Tom Rutledge  our Chairman and CEO  and Chris Winfrey  our CFO  With that  let s turn the call over to Tom Thomas M  Rutledge    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Stefan  Our operating strategy continues to deliver strong results and we remain focused on driving customer growth by delivering superior services and value to our customers  proving the quality of our operations by reducing unnecessary service transactions and truck rolls per customer  delivering sustainable free cash flow growth by driving EBITDA growth while reducing capital intensity  and finally positioning our Company for long term customer relationship growth with current and new products by continuing to evolve a fully converged network that delivers high speed  low latency  seamless connectivity services inside or outside customers homes  and the sedentary environments or on the move In 2019  we created over 1 1 million new customer relationships  substantially more than 2018  And we added over 1 4 million new Internet customers  also more than 2018  We grew our full year cable adjusted EBITDA by 6 6  in a non political advertising year  And combined with our lower cable capital expenditures  our 2019 cable free cash flow grew by over 100  year over year  We expect that our cable EBITDA growth combined with our declining capital intensity and disciplined capital deployment strategy will drive continued strong free cash flow growth Our mobile business is a strategic extension of our core connectivity capabilities today and in the future and it continues to grow  We now have well over 1 million mobile lines in service with over 900 000 of those added in 2019 at an accelerating pace  In 2019  we saw a substantial reduction in service transactions per customer relationships and those improvements were reflected in lower per relationship or per cost  trouble call and truck rolls and billing calls  We also performed fewer physical installation truck rolls given growing levels self installation activity Looking forward to 2020  we re well positioned to continue to reduce service activity per customer given a higher level of customers and spectrum pricing and packaging  the completion of our insourcing program and increasingly experienced in sourced call center and field operation workforces  the overall improving quality  reliability and maintenance of our network  greater levels of our online service activity  self service activity and growing level of self installation activity  as I mentioned  which  in the fourth quarter exceeded 50  of sales So in 2020  these lower levels of overall service activity per customer relationship should continue improvements in customer satisfaction  lower churn and a reduction in cost to service customers per customer relationship  Our in home connectivity product set also continues to improve with 85  of our residential Internet customers now receiving minimum Internet speeds of 100 megabits or more  and nearly half receiving minimum speeds of 200 megabits or more  We continue to offer 400 megabits  our Ultra product and our gigabit speed tier across our entire footprint We made our network capable of providing gigabit service everywhere we operate using DOCSIS 3 1 technology over the course of 13 months for  450 million in planned capital  Through our 10G plan  we also have a cost efficient pathway to offer multi gigabit speeds and lower latency to consumers and businesses that continue to attach more devices to our network  use more and more data on a daily basis and our demand in greater network responsiveness and reliability During the quarter  we also continued to deploy our advanced home WiFi capabilities to new markets beyond Austin  Texas  including Dallas  San Antonio and portions of Southern California  Our advanced WiFi capability provides enhanced security  privacy and app based control over all IP devices in our consumers  homes  while simultaneously delivering a superior customer experience through better in home WiFi coverage and managed WiFi solutions through dynamic band switching and channel optimization within the bands  So far our deployment has gone well and we plan to roll out this capability throughout our entire footprint Our Spectrum Mobile business continues to grow quickly and we added over 280 000 lines in the fourth quarter  more than we added in the third quarter  While it s still early  we believe that our results so far indicate our mobile product drives core connectivity  customer satisfaction and will generate stand alone profitability at scale We also continue to test dual SIM technology using CBRS spectrum via small cells monitor on our own high capacity two way network  Our test continued to go very well  We continue to add features and functionality to our Spectrum Mobile product  And in the first quarter  we plan to offer 5G mobile service Now I will turn the call over to Chris Christopher L  Winfrey    Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Tom  Before covering our results a quick reminder that we closed the sale of Navisite  managed cloud services business within Spectrum Enterprise in September  We ve not prepared pro forma financials  Our reported results include Navisite in the fourth quarter of 2018  but not in the fourth quarter of 2019  For the next few quarters  I will discuss enterprise revenue growth including and excluding Navisite for comparability  On an annual basis  Navisite generated roughly  150 million in revenue and its impact on our EBITDA and capex was not material Turning to our results on slide 5  Over the last 12 months we grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by over 1 1 million or 4  and by 268 000 in the fourth quarter  Including residential and SMB  we grew our Internet customers by 339 000 in the quarter and by 1 4 million or 5 6  over the last 12 months  Video declined by 101 000 in the quarter  wireline voice declined by 128 000  and we added 288 000 higher ARPU mobile lines  At the end of the fourth quarter  85  of our residential customers were in Spectrum pricing and packaging In residential  customer relationship growth accelerated to 3 8  year over year  As we look to 2020  our goal is to accelerate our full year customer growth rate as we deliver highly competitive products with better service  targeting connects and reducing churn  In residential Internet  we added a total of 313 000 customers in the quarter  resulting in residential Internet customer growth of 5 4  year over year  driven by continuing churn improvements In residential video  we lost 105 000 customers in the quarter  primarily driven by lower video gross additions year over year  And in wireline voice  we lost 152 000 residential customers in the quarter  driven by lower sell in following our transition to selling mobile in the bundle and continued fixed to mobile substitution in the market generally Turning to mobile  We added 288 000 total mobile lines in the quarter driven by the value of our mobile product offers  growing brand and product awareness and increased sales effectiveness  As of December 31st  we had nearly 1 1 million lines with a healthy mix of both Unlimited and By the Gig lines  Spectrum Mobile continues to scale with less EBITDA loss per line even at an accelerating net addition rate  and that does not include any benefits to our traditional cable connectivity business Over the last year  we grew total residential customers by just over 1 million or 3 8   Residential revenue per residential customer relationship grew by 1 8  year over year given a lower rate of SPP migration and promotional campaign roll off in rate adjustments  Those ARPU benefits were partly offset by a higher mix of non video customers  higher mix of streaming in lighter video packages within our video base and  29 million of lower pay per view revenue year over year in the quarter  Our cable ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue  The Q4 especially benefited from the timing of the rate adjustment this year Slide 6 shows our cable customer growth combined with that elevated Q4 ARPU growth resulted in year over year residential revenue growth of 5 7   Turning to commercial  SMB revenue grew by 6 3   faster than last quarter as the revenue effect from the repricing of our SMB products in Legacy TWC and Bright House continues as well  SMB customer relationships grew by 6 8  year over year  Enterprise revenue declined by 4 5  year over year  driven by the sale of Navisite and some one time cell tower backhaul fees that we mentioned as a benefit in the fourth quarter of 2018 Excluding Navisite from the fourth quarter of 2018  enterprise revenue grew by 1 3  in the fourth quarter of 2019  And excluding both cell tower backhaul and Navisite  enterprise grew by 8 5   I expect that retail portion of enterprise to continue to grow nicely that the wholesale piece including cell tower backhaul will continue to be challenging Fourth quarter advertising revenue declined by 23  due to less political revenue in 2019  Our non political advertising grew    revenue grew by 4 6  year over year primarily due to our advanced advertising capabilities and recently deployed products that efficiently sell highly viewed long tail inventory using our own anonymized much more detailed viewing data As we look to the full year 2020  we expect continued ad growth driven by our advanced advertising business and a healthy year of political revenue  Other revenue declined by 6 6  year over year  driven by lower processing fees and lower home shopping revenues related to video subscriber declines  partly offset by higher levels of video CPEs sold to customers  Mobile revenue totaled  236 million  with  138 million of that being device revenue  In total  consolidated fourth quarter revenue was up 4 7  year over year  Cable revenue growth excluding mobile was 3 4  or 5 2  when excluding advertising in both years and Navisite in 2018 Moving to operating expenses on slide 7  In the fourth quarter  total operating expenses grew by  165 million or 2 3  year over year  Cable operating expenses excluding mobile were essentially flat or up 0 6  when excluding Navisite and that s despite strong relationship in revenue growth  Programming increased 0 6  year over year due to higher rates  That was offset via video customer decline of 2 8  year over year  higher mix of streaming in lighter video packages such as Choice and Stream and lower pay per view expenses year over year tied to the  29 million of lower pay per view revenue I mentioned Looking at full year 2020  we expect programming costs per video customer to grow in the mid single digit percentage range  Regulatory  connectivity and produced content grew by 4 3  and that was driven by higher cost of video CPE sold to customers  and original programming cost  Cost of service customers declined by 2 3  year over year compared to 4  customer relationship growth  So we re meaningfully lowering our per relationship service cost through a number of operating  quality and efficiency improvements which is core to our strategy  Key metrics like calls per customer  truck rolls per customer  churn and self install rates all continue to move in the right direction as Tom mentioned  Looking ahead  we expect further declines in cost of service customers on a per customer relationship basis  but this quarter s level of operational productivity was exceptional and it won t be replicated every single quarter Cable marketing expenses increased by 2 1  year over year and other cable expenses were down 1 4  driven by lower ad sales cost  which reverses in a political year and lower cost related to the sale of Navisite  which will carry through to the third quarter of this year  Mobile expenses totaled  372 million and they were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue  customer acquisition and MVNO usage cost and operating cost to stand up and operate the business Our 2020 mobile EBITDA probably looks similar to 2019 due to growth and the scale cost  but looking even further  our current expectation is that in 2021  our mobile service revenue will exceed all regular operating cost excluding acquisitions and growth related mobile cost Turning to EBITDA  We grew total adjusted EBITDA by 8 8  in the quarter  when including the mobile EBITDA start up loss of  136 million  Cable adjusted EBITDA grew by 8 9  in the fourth quarter including a roughly 3  negative growth rate impact from advertising revenue net of its associated expense in both periods Turning to net income on slide 8  We generated  714 million of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the fourth quarter versus  296 million last year  The year over year increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and the loss of financial instruments in the prior year period  partly offset by higher income tax expense Turning to slide 9  Capital expenditures totaled  2 3 billion in the fourth quarter with our cable capex declining about  200 million year over year driven by the same CPE trends  DOCSIS 3 1 benefits and lower in sourcing and integration costs I ve mentioned throughout the year  We spent  151 million on mobile related capex this quarter  which is mostly accounted for in support capital and it was driven by software and development cost and retail footprint upgrades for mobile In 2020  we expect our mobile capital expenditures to be similar to 2019 and then decline meaningfully in 2021 as that work will be behind us  And mobile capex outlook excludes any potential mid band spectrum acquisition and build out  which would be based on a separate ROI evaluation  In 2020  we expect our cable capex intensity to continue to decline from the 15  in 2019  And on an absolute dollar basis  we don t expect our cable capital expenditures to be meaningfully different from 2019 levels  Similar to what I just said about our mobile capital expenditures  if we find new high ROI projects during the course of the year or that accelerated spend on existing projects would drive faster growth  we d still do so The slide 10 shows we generated  1 6 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter  and excluding our investment in mobile  we generated  1 9 billion of cable free cash flow  up  700 million versus last year s fourth quarter  For the full year 2019  we generated  5 8 billion of cable free cash flow  up  3 billion versus 2018 despite a cable working capital headwind of  800 million this past year For the full year 2020  we would expect cable working capital to improve significantly with the neutral to slightly negative impact on our cash flow  We ll still have typical seasonal swings including the first quarter in which our working capital was most always a use of cash  With respect to mobile working capital  we continue to add mobile customers at an elevated pace  which will continue to drive handset related working capital needs in 2020  In any event  our free cash flow profile improved significantly last year  We re positioned to continue to couple our free cash flow growth with a return focused investment in capital structure strategy We finished the year with  78 4 billion in debt principal at  74 9 billion of net debt  Our current run rate annualized cash interest is  4 billion  And as of the end of the fourth quarter  our net debt to last 12 month adjusted EBITDA was 4 45 times at the high end or 4 to 4 5 times leverage range  And when calculating our leverage  we include the upfront investment in mobile to be more conservative than looking at cable only leverage  which was now 4 31 times at the end of the fourth quarter During the quarter  we repurchased 5 6 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling about  2 6 billion at an average price of  459 per share  For the full year 2019  we ve repurchased over  7 6 billion of our equity and since September of 2016  we ve repurchased over  27 billion  We re a bit more than 25  of Charter s equity at an average price of  346 per share Turning to taxes  on slide 2  Tax assets are primarily composed of our NOL and our tax receivables arrangement with Advance Newhouse  We now don t anticipate becoming a meaningful federal cash taxpayer until 2022 with some modest federal cash tax payments beginning in late 2021 as we expect the bulk of our existing NOL to be utilized by the end of that year For the years 2022 through 2024  we expect our federal and state cash taxes to approximate our consolidated EBITDA  less our capital expenditures and less our cash interest expense multiplied by 21  to 23   That estimate would include partnership tax distributions to Advance Newhouse  captured separately in cash flows from financing in the financial statements  There are multiple factors that impact what I just described and we re always looking for ways to improve our cash tax profile  but it s a good baseline for today So we re pleased with our results and we believe in our operating strategy  our network capabilities and the balance sheet strategy  which all work in concert to create value for a long period of time  Charter is an infrastructure asset with strong growth characteristics and cash flow yield  We have a lot of ancillary products to use for and so on top of core connectivity services that when combined with good value and service will drive cash flow growth with tax advantaged levered equity returns Operator  we re now ready for Q A Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instruction  And our first question comes from the line of John Hodulik from UBS  Go ahead please  Your line is open John Hodulik    UBS    AnalystGreat  Thank you  Chris  you gave a lot of good detail on some of the cost metrics as we look out into 2020  And the 200 basis points you guys saw in cable margin improvement this quarter  especially with the advertising headwind  I think it was really the highlight  but putting it all together in terms of the programming  the cost to serve continuing to come down  How should we think of cable margin trends heading into 2020 year  Thanks Christopher L  Winfrey    Chief Financial OfficerSure  Look  on one hand  you had a headwind as you mentioned political advertising not being in the fourth quarter of 2019  On the other hand  we had some fairly exceptional pieces that were taking place as well  The timing of our rate increase was earlier inside of Q4 2019 than it had been in prior years  And so  I think  that results in a higher ARPU per customer relationship growth in one of these sustainable either prior to that quarter or inside of 2020  So you need to take that into account  I think  that growth rate given the subscriber mix could look a lot more like what we saw for the full year of 2019  then it would  what we saw in Q4 The second thing I d mention is that programming had done very well on a gross and per customer relationship basis  I think it will still do well relative to other years  But we expect mid single digit per customer relationship growth in programming cost in 2020  And then  finally  as I mentioned  the cost to serve  it was exceptional in the fourth quarter  Our cost to serve per customer relationship has been declining  it s going to continue to decline is our expectation  but to have an actual gross declined a significant one inside of a quarter was a big step down  And I just would encourage people to replicate that every single quarter So then working against    again  I m not giving guidance for the ways to help you to build a model and particularly later in the year  we expect this to be a pretty good year for political advertising  So  all in  I think it s going to move around  And it s not something that we actively manage inside the business  what we re managing is can we grew our customer relationships faster  and that s our goal  which would then drive better revenue growth  which continues to be our goal to go faster and it has been our experience and it continues to be our goal to grow EBITDA at a faster rate than our revenue growth rate with or without a political advertising year  So that s  I think  the right way to think about it and not to get particularly hung up in a particular quarter of year over year comparison on a margin rate with what s happening with the underlying trend John Hodulik    UBS    AnalystAll right  Great  That s helpful  Thanks Stefan Anninger    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsJames  we ll take our next question  please OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick with JP Morgan  Go ahead please  Your line is open Philip Cusick    JP Morgan    AnalystThanks  guys  Following up there  Chris  you talked about lower video gross adds year over year  Is that a result of fewer promotions and changed incentives  And you said the goal is to accelerate customer growth rate  How do you expect that to go from in terms of gross adds and churn going forward  And then quickly a follow up  if I can  on the in sourcing program  You talked about it in your commentary  where are we on the completion of that and how much in terms of costs are still being duplicated as you in source labor and everything else  Thank you Christopher L  Winfrey    Chief Financial OfficerSorry  So what was your second question  So  first one is lower video gross adds  third one is status in sourcing program  any double up  what was the second one Philip Cusick    JP Morgan    AnalystThat was the gist of it Christopher L  Winfrey    Chief Financial OfficerI thought there was a second  but anyway lower video gross adds up  I think it s more a function of the marketplace  more than anything else  We still believe in videos and attractive piece to their connectivity of package that we offer  It s an important attribute and we continue to invest in both in the traditional set top box with as well as all of our IP platforms  And I don t know if Tom wants to add any more on that Thomas M  Rutledge    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  yes  The lower gross adds I think are a function of the marketplace  It s not material to what drives our economic model  but it is a nice small addition to our broadband connectivity business Christopher L  Winfrey    Chief Financial OfficerAnd then on the in sourcing program  the in sourcing is essentially complete  We have well over  90  of our service calls are handled in house and onshore  And then in the field service side  you need to have some contract labor available for peaks and valleys  but we re well over 75  of our labor being in source there and that s been the case for both of those for some time now  So there s very little in the way of double up cost anymore that s in the system I do think that it s going to continue to get better for all the reasons that Tom mentioned  the tenure of our employees gets longer  which means they get more experienced and better and higher quality transactions with our own employees who have a career path at Charter  The amount of self installation is going up  the number of calls and truck rolls are going down  the churn is going down  and the amount of digital transactions which Tom talked about is also going up  which means less labor intensive service infrastructure  And I think that trend is going to be with us for a long period of time Philip Cusick    JP Morgan    AnalystThanks  Chris Stefan Anninger    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsJames  we will take our next question  please OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs  Go ahead please  Your line is open Brett Feldman    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThanks  And Tom  you just mentioned how videos still can be very complementary to your core broadband product  There are a number of new direct to consumer video products coming soon  whether it s HBO Max or Peacock and those providers have all said they re looking for distribution  including through MVPDs  I was hoping you could give us your updated thoughts around being a partner for some or all of them and maybe some of the factors that you have to think through as you decide whether it makes sense whether it s the economics  if there s technical issues or just some strategic considerations that are weighing on whether or not you intend to do this  Thank you Thomas M  Rutledge    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  Brett  yes  there is an opportunity in us marketing direct to consumer products in our relationship with programmers and those relationships in many cases are also operating under the old model too  which is the bundled cable model  And we can hold both thoughts in our head at the same time  And so bundled products which I think we ll be selling for years to come  but also selling direct to consumer products and because of our customer relationship  because of the way we can package those products into our overall product mix and the user interfaces that we develop with products like flex are designed to help enhance We have an opportunity to create and help programmers sell their content and do that in a way that s mutually beneficial to both of us  And so  we re working through those models with various companies  We have already placed direct to consumer products like Netflix on our user interface and customers can purchase products directly from our user interface ala carte  Phonetic  product so to speak  which we ve been doing for a long time by the way In many ways  I look at these products like I look at Pay TV  There are opportunities to enhance the video experience and part of the customer relationship  So we have ongoing discussions with all of that into these out there  And fundamentally  I think  while there s a lot of dislocation going on in the video business  there s an opportunity in there for us Brett Feldman    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGreat  Thank you Stefan Anninger    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Brett  James  we ll take our next question please OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley  Go ahead please  Your line is open Ben Swinburne    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThanks  Good morning  guys  Two questions for either of you or both of you  Tom  any change in how you re thinking about pricing the video business in particular  I don t know if you would characterize your rate adjustments in the fourth quarter as a change from prior philosophy or not  but at least it seem to us like a more aggressive increase in your video pricing than you ve done in the past  I m just wondering if that reflects a change in your mind about how you manage the business And then  Chris mentioned in his prepared remarks sort of mid band spectrum and any acquisition build out there  I was just curious where your guys collective head was at on that opportunity  if that s something that s becoming more likely less likely or just how we should be thinking about that as we go through this year and think about some auctions coming down the road Thomas M  Rutledge    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerBen  I think  fundamentally we didn t or haven t changed anything with regard to our pricing strategy  which is prices is the major component of how we drive our revenue growth it s a driver of growth  And we have accelerating subscriber growth and we expect to continue to have accelerating subscriber growth  because we have the price strategy  we do with the product strategy  we do  And the bulk of our revenue growth comes from that  So we have been passing through things like retransmission  consent fees and other things in the video business  and looking at the margins in the video business  and the competitive environment in the video business and how we re priced  but our fundamental strategy is not different Ben Swinburne    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  And the wireless Thomas M  Rutledge    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerMid band spectrum  We re interested in mid band spectrum  There is an auction coming up for CBRS  We are likely to participate in that auction  I think  there s an opportunity for us  the FCC has been helpful and positioning that spectrum in a way that s an opportunity for us  And so we re carefully considering our options there Christopher L  Winfrey    Chief Financial OfficerWill be better discipline as you d expect about an ROI approach to spectrum and that s acquired cost to acquire the cost to build what s the financial return from doing so and where would you do it  So I think people should expect that we will be disciplined around that first  but we think it s pretty attractive  And clearly the more mobile lines that we have the more attractive that ROI is Ben Swinburne    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  Makes sense  Thank you  guys Stefan Anninger    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Ben  James  we ll take our next question please OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson  Go ahead please  Your line is open Craig Moffett    MoffettNathanson    AnalystAll right  Thank you  Two questions if I could  First on the wireless business  If I could just continue down that line of thinking how much  just given what you know today  how much traffic do you think you will eventually be able to offload  sort of thinking about as a percentage of total maybe that you d be able to offload on to your own facilities  if you think about where it might make sense to build where you have areal infrastructure to be able to build  and is there any scenario where you would ever want to go to full facilities based strategy where you d own your entire network  And then just back to the videos question for a second  how do you think differently about programming renewals just given the change in tone around your video strategy Thomas M  Rutledge    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo look on the wireless situation  it s really a math question of what s it cost to pay for your MVNO rate and what s it cost to bill  where is the traffic and what s    and how does all that work and that s the discipline that Chris was talking about  So as we think about it  there is    it depends on what you re paying for mobile traffic and what the economic traffic zone is inside of a particular area and how you would switch that traffic  So I don t    there is no immediate plan to change our fundamental relationship with our carriers and    but over time  as the market evolves and speeds go up and capacity goes up  the economics might change and we ll take advantage of those through time as the marketplace unfolds With regard to programming  obviously  the biggest issue in the bundled package is price and a lot of people have been priced out of the market and we continue to negotiate contracts and as penetrations in the overall distribution change  relative value of the content changes  and the changes the relationship in that and changes how much programming is worth to you as an operator  And so  I don t expect the general circumstance of distribution precipitously change over the next couple of years  I think  we ll still have a big bundled product  but the relative pieces of that are changing in value and will act appropriately in the marketplace Christopher L  Winfrey    Chief Financial OfficerCraig  you had a sub question on the wireless side that asked if there s any scenario where we want to own it all the end to end networking  So far we haven t seen anything that really demonstrates that need  We have a very good partner with Verizon  it s going very well and they have a very strong macros of our network  And so  I don t think that there is any economic case that we re seeing today that says that we need to own all of it and I hope we ll be partners with MVNO partners for the years to come Craig Moffett    MoffettNathanson    AnalystThanks  Chris  Thanks  Tom Stefan Anninger    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsJames we will take our next question  please OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street  Go ahead please  Your line is open Jonathan Chaplin    New Street    AnalystThanks  Just following on the questions around cost of service  Technical Issues  you said we shouldn t impute the same improvement in cost of service that we saw year over year this year or we shouldn t assume the same cost of service  there s something that would drive cost of services from here or something one time  Technical Issues  And then related to that  I m wondering if you can give us an update on where the Legacy Time Warner churn is relative to Legacy Charter churn and whether Legacy Charter churn is finally bottomed out or are there still opportunities for that to come down  because it seems like the churn improvement drove a big component of the improvement in cost of service Christopher L  Winfrey    Chief Financial OfficerSo you were little garbled there  Jonathan  but on the cost to serve    cost to serve trend continues to go down on a per customer basis  There are all sorts of reasons  that s true  I think  Chris was trying to say that with the pace that is and how that will manifest itself quarterly isn t something that you should straight line extrapolate  But the fundamental mark that we re on in terms of customer self serving using high quality service operations with well skilled people doing the work is reducing overall transaction volume as this is the digitization and the definition of the network as a software defined network and many of the operations becoming software defined  All of those things are taking fundamental operating cost out of the business and the capital expenditures that we made over the last three years as a result of the integration puts us in a position to realize that upside  So that s the fundamental notion that he was trying to express Thomas M  Rutledge    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd Legacy TWC churn continues to be growth elevated relative to Legacy Charter but continues to be declining at a faster rate than Legacy Charter continues to decline Jonathan Chaplin    New Street    Analyst Technical Issues Thomas M  Rutledge    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHey  Jonathan  you ve got really bad cell signal and so at this time around we couldn t hear anything on that question Jonathan Chaplin    New Street    Analyst Technical Issues Thomas M  Rutledge    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay Stefan Anninger    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Jonathan  Operator  we ll take our next question please OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America  Go ahead please  Your line is open Jessica Reif Ehrlich    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThanks  I have two follow ups  I think it was Tom who said that you will accelerate or you expect to accelerate customer growth rate this year  And I just wonder if you could elaborate on that  Do you mean the high speed data only or do you including video in here  And then you also Tom mentioned Flex and I don t know if it s just in the context of direct to consumer services  but do you have plans to offer a service similar to Comcast Flex and or can you talk about how you re thinking about the evolution of your broadband product that would differentiate    that would make it more    besides speed  but others differentiate it Thomas M  Rutledge    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerRight  Well  when I just spoke of accelerating growth  I was talking about high speed data and customer relationship growth accelerating  So that s what I meant by that  And in terms of Flex or similar products  yeah  the answer is yes  There are a variety of IP relationships we have  we have one with Apple  selling IP devices through Apple  We have Roku devices that our product is on We ve got millions of customers who subscribe to us directly through an app based product  And so our video product on the Internet or IP delivered cable TV and IP delivered over the top products are all being delivered through a variety of new technology platforms  Flex is one of those  And so the answer is we re pursuing all the various opportunities in video that are available to us and including those in our broadband strategy In addition to    we ve enhanced our broadband through speed differentiation and taking our minimum speeds up more than half of our customer base now gets minimum speeds of 200 megabits as the slowest speed we sell  And we ve enhanced that with our advanced WiFi products  which deliver high quality service throughout the house  allow you to manage all the devices in your house  see what the service quality of those devices is and how they are connected to the network as well as allow you to manage the privacy or the utilization of any of those devices throughout your house  so that you are secure  private and getting a high quality service everywhere inside your property and on the go  So we continue to invest in the broadband platform to make it a better platform  and we continue to invest in Legacy video and we continue to invest in the way Legacy video transforms itself into a IP platform Jessica Reif Ehrlich    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThank you Stefan Anninger    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Jessica  James  we ll take our next question please OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore  Go ahead please  Your line is open James Ratcliffe    Evercore ISI    AnalystHi  it s James Ratcliffe for Vijay  Two if I could  First of all  Tom  you mentioned 10G is sort of the next phase with a 3 1 rollout done  Can you give us any idea of the timing or magnitude of that sort of deployment  I mean  I assume it s different in kind of just degree to the  9 a home passed  So that 3 1 was  And secondly  in the slides  you mentioned that the strategy in the business is not dependent on M A  Can you talk about what do you see the M A landscape looking like both any opportunities for horizontal or if there are any incremental vertical acquisition that would make sense  Thanks Thomas M  Rutledge    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSure  Well  with regard to 10G we just upgraded the whole network to 1 gigabit everywhere  That was the  450 million capital project  I mentioned  in over a 13 month time frame  10G is a set of technology specifications that the industries develop that allows us to ultimately get to 10 gig symmetrical services which are provided at very low latency deliveries specifications and allows you to put high compute capabilities throughout your network  And there is no immediate need to deploy a new upgrade in the marketplace today  but it s an evolution that we can invest in as we go forward and it allows us to do that incrementally in a very cost efficient way  a lot less cost than it would cost to build the brand new network  So we have no immediate capital deployment associated with it  but it s a variety of tools to incrementally get you to at least a 10 gig symmetrical  And there is    we have already surpassed that capability in our laboratory testing  And so  that s just the stake in the ground in terms of what the potential of our existing infrastructure is With regard to M A  first of all  we don t have anything that we re about to talk about  but the cable businesses is owned by control shareholders mostly through the United States and I think we have a great business and lots of opportunity with the right combination of assets there s always value and scale and market approach  but there is nothing for us to say at the moment James Ratcliffe    Evercore ISI    AnalystGreat  Thank you Stefan Anninger    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  James  James  we ll take our next question please OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank  Go ahead please  Your line is open Bryan Kraft    Deutsche Bank    AnalystThanks  good morning  I wanted to ask you a couple of questions on capex  can you talk about some of the puts and takes and scalable infrastructure capital is down quite a bit in 2019 from the prior couple of years  Just wondering how we should think about that spending category in the coming years relative to history  is there a sort of normal level if you will And then secondly on capex  as you reach the end of the FCC commitment for new homes passed  what should we expect in terms of a normal homes passed growth rate  Will it kind of be the just the rate of home growth in your footprint  the way it s been maybe historically over the years or do you see opportunities now to extend the network to existing premises that are currently off net  Thanks Thomas M  Rutledge    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo with regard to scalable capex  Bryan the  we are getting advantages from the 3 1 deployment  And I think that those advantages which are in    with the advantages that the growth in Internet utilization on a per customer basis is continuous investment required by us and the 3 1 so expanded the capacity of the plan  Some of that scalable infrastructure capital that might have been prior periods isn t required right now  but that opportunity continues for a while yet  because one  it s a function of the rate of data usage per unit per customer and interestingly our Internet only customers now are using over 500 gigabytes per month half terabyte of data usage So it is something that continuously to climb and that s relative to a wireless average customer of 8 to put that in proportion  But the capital expenditure  I think  we ll stay in that space similar to what it is now for some period of time  Clearly 2020 because of the capacity has been built by 3 1  And the evolution of traditional video toward DOCSIS any of that opportunity Homes passed  look  we build everything that we can build from a homes passed perspective without regard to the requirements of our consent decree  So we ve accelerated and actually built more passings than the consent decree required and there s nothing going forward that would change the rate at whichWe re building other than the rate of household formation Christopher L  Winfrey    Chief Financial OfficerAnd Bryan  just on the capex  Tom mentioned were temporarily depressed in 2019 to probably in 2020 for the continued DOCSIS 3 1 benefits  but if you think about the different line items for capex or CPE which includes traditional install  which is now growing higher self install or CPE is declining and already the majority of that mix of CPE is more tied to Internet related products as opposed to video products  As Tom mentioned  we ve been building at an accelerated pace on the line extension  So I think that will continue to be elevated with positive ROI attached to that build out  and the scalable  while lower last year is probably this year as well Over time  that s an area that we ll continue to invest like we have in the past and support  We continue to have not the same magnitude that we ve had the past few years  but we re still a fair amount of integration back end integration capital that s going on and you ll see that in the support category  whether that s through real estate or through IT systems and so whereas scalable maybe temporarily lower I think support is temporarily still higher and hat s the way the different pieces of capex will move over the short to medium term Bryan Kraft    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGreat  and on balance continued declines in capital intensity as you look beyond 2020 for the most part Christopher L  Winfrey    Chief Financial OfficerRight  we don t see anything that changes the ARCs that we re on and mobile will have its own trajectory  which I talked about in the prepared remarks  which we expected to step down significantly in 2021 but for any ROI based investment in Spectrum build out Bryan Kraft    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGreat  thank you Stefan Anninger    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Bryan  James  we ll take our last question please OperatorAnd our last question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse  Go ahead please  Your line is open Doug Mitchelson    Credit Suisse    AnalystThanks so much  I wanted to dig in more specifics on a couple of topics  Tom  I think to ask the question directly that I think folks were trying to get to  will you need to subsidize OTT video services to compete in broadband in the future  Against the likes of ATT that s going to include at HBO Max for certain customers  So one  the competitive outlook going forward to broadband two  on Spectrum and super interesting the conversations you ve been having with us around wireless and the lack of a need for a physical network  I guess my question is how much Spectrum  do you need  because if you re just going a per high capacity areas  I think you could do that with a small amount of CBRS or C band spectrum 10 or 20 megahertz  but if you re going to buildout 10 or 20 megahertz  you might as well build out more  because the cost to build is sort of the same regardless of how many megahertz  So  I m just curious how you think about quantity of Spectrum relative to that return on invested capital dynamic  Thank you Thomas M  Rutledge    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  on the subsidization of OTT  that s really just price  what you re selling broadband for  And I think that we have a relatively good competitive posture from a price perspective in the marketplace  And so  I don t see us changing that whether we ll do promotional offers that have a price effect in the cost    I won t say never  but it s just a marketing technique  It doesn t mean you to change your fundamental pricing strategy And with regard to wireless you re into the math of what s the value of the physical network pieces and that s a function of a lot of things  it s not  it is the cost to build  it s the cost to what your rented network is and how those two things interact with each other and so I d say you re thinking is correct  but we haven t decided exactly  what we ll do Doug Mitchelson    Credit Suisse    AnalystIf I could just follow up on that  Tom  do you need updated MVNO with Verizon or a new MVNO to take advantage of mid maximize take advantage of building out mid band spectrum and high traffic areas does there need to be any evolution in that relationship for you to be able to switch to your to your Spectrum Thomas M  Rutledge    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe have a good relationship and we are happy with our relationship with Verizon and I m sure we will evolve through time Doug Mitchelson    Credit Suisse    AnalystI thought I d try  Thanks so much guys Thomas M  Rutledge    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Doug  And thanks to everyone  who listened to our call today  That concludes our call Christopher L  Winfrey    Chief Financial OfficerThank you very much Operator Operator Closing

128756,350271,CHTR,Supreme Court to hear Comcast appeal in Byron Allen racial bias suit,news,"By Andrew Chung WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear cable television operator Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  Corp s bid to throw out comedian and producer Byron Allen s racial bias lawsuit accusing the company of discriminating against black owned channels   The justices will review a decision by the San Francisco based 9th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals that cleared the way for a  20 billion civil rights lawsuit against Comcast to proceed  At issue in the litigation is the refusal by Comcast to carry channels operated by Entertainment Studios Networks  owned by Byron Allen  who is black  The justices did not act on a similar appeal by  Charter Communications   NASDAQ CHTR  involving claims by Allen after the company also declined to carry his channels  That case likely will be guided by the outcome in Comcast s appeal   Comcast and Charter have said their business decisions were based on capacity constraints  not race  and that Allen s channels  including JusticeCentral TV  Cars TV  Pets TV and Comedy TV  did not show sufficient promise or customer demand to merit distribution  Other television distributors  including Verizon  NYSE VZ   AT T  NYSE T  and DirecTV  carry some of Allen s programming  court papers said    Comcast has an outstanding record of supporting and fostering diverse programming  including programming from African American owned channels  two more of which we launched earlier this year   the company said in a statement  adding that it hopes the Supreme Court will bring the case to an end   Allen disputed the statement  saying the channels Comcast mentioned are not wholly owned by African Americans  Comcast  Allen said   will continue to lose this case  and the American people who stand against racial discrimination will win   Entertainment Studios Networks sued in Los Angeles federal court  accusing the cable companies of violating the Civil Rights Act of 1866  a post Civil War law that forbids racial discrimination in business contracts   The suits brought by Allen pinned the rejections primarily on racial discrimination  accusing cable executives of giving insincere or invalid excuses and granting contracts to carry white owned networks during the same period   The lawsuits also alleged that the companies  commitments to diversity are a sham and that they have used outside civil rights groups  such as Reverend Al Sharpton s National Action Network  to provide cover for empty promises  Comcast called those accusations  outlandish   Both Comcast and Charter called the lawsuits a  scam  and sought to have the cases dismissed  But the 9th Circuit last year allowed the litigation to proceed   
At the heart of the case is the question of whether individuals who are refused a business contract can sue under the civil rights law without ruling out reasons other than discrimination for the denial  The 9th Circuit said lawsuits can proceed to trial if plaintiffs can show that discriminatory intent was one factor among others in the denial of a contract ",2019-06-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/supreme-court-to-hear-comcast-appeal-in-racial-bias-suit-1893182,1893182

128759,350274,CHTR,Why U S  small caps may lag despite U S  China trade truce,news,"By David Randall
NEW YORK  Reuters    A truce in the trade war between the United States and China that pushed large cap stocks to new record highs Monday does not appear to be enough to buoy the shares of small U S  companies that are struggling under the weight of higher tariff costs 
Lower margins and less pricing power are preventing small companies from either passing on or weathering the effects of higher trade tariffs to the same degree as large caps  effectively putting a ceiling on their growth prospects  fund managers and analysts say 
That is souring investors on their shares and leaving small caps underperforming in a steep reversal from last year  when many investors jumped into small companies in the expectation that they would be insulated from the trade wars because of their focus on the domestic market 
For the year to date  the benchmark Russell 2000 index of small companies is up nearly 17   yet remains more than 8  below the record highs it reached in August 2018  The large cap S P 500  by comparison  hit record highs Monday as part of its nearly 18 5  rally this year    
 I would not be overweight in small caps right now because the risks are too high relative to large caps   said Barry James  a portfolio manager at James Advantage Funds whose James Micro Cap fund is one of the top performing small cap funds for the year to date   That s eventually going to change and they could have a spectacular run  but this year at least the index overall is not attractive from a risk standpoint  
The Russell 2000 index is dominated by financial and healthcare  two sectors that face the risk of compressed margins from lower interest rates and increased governmental regulation if Republicans lose either the presidency or the Senate in the 2020 elections  James said 
As a result  James is focusing on companies like recreational products maker Johnson Outdoors Inc and electric wire maker Encore Wire Corp that have above average growth prospects  he said 
The United States and China agreed on Saturday to resume trade negotiations after U S  President Donald Trump offered concessions to his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping when the two met at the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Japan 
Those included no new tariffs and an easing of restrictions on tech company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd  HWT UL   China agreed to make unspecified new purchases of U S  farm products and return to the negotiating table 
Dan Mahr  a portfolio manager of the Federated MDT All Cap Core fund  said that his fund remains underweight small caps in favor of larger companies like MasterCard Inc and  Charter Communications  Inc  NASDAQ CHTR  that are benefiting more from market momentum 
 Investor sentiment is much higher as you go up the cap scale   he said 
WEAKENING GLOBAL ECONOMY
A weak global economy is also weighing disproportionately on small cap stocks  which are saddled with rising international revenues and feel a greater hit from trade tariffs than large caps  said Venu Krishna  deputy head of U S  equity research at  Barclays   LON BARC  
 The core issue is that global growth is slowing and while the trade war concerns ebb and flow there s a general sense that they are here for longer   he said   We don t see a catalyst that will push small caps higher  
Barclay s now estimates that small caps will post EBITDA  earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  growth of 2  this year  down from its estimate of 5 5  growth earlier this year  Krishna said 
Those economic concerns are pushing investors to pile into companies that seem to be flawless and punish those that might miss analyst estimates or have additional leverage on their balance sheets  said Randy Gwirtzman  a portfolio manager of the Baron Discovery fund 
 If it s not perfect  it s not working right now   he said 
As a result  Gwirtzman has been moving into biotech companies Revance Therapeutics Inc and Esperion Therapeutics Inc that have been hurt by investor skittishness over the healthcare sector  At the same time  he has been adding to his position in cyber security company ForeScout Technologies Inc  whose shares tumbled in May after its guidance fell short of Wall Street expectations 
 There are many quality companies that for whatever reason people are just scared of   Gwirtzman said   People are running to things that have no problems in them and paying a lot  and we d rather get things with manageable problems at much lower multiples  ",2019-07-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/why-us-small-caps-may-lag-despite-uschina-trade-truce-1912628,1912628

128827,350342,CHTR,Analysts Estimate Charter Communications  CHTR  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Charter Communications  NASDAQ CHTR  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This cable provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 67 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  20 9  
Revenues are expected to be  11 43 billion  up 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 31  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Charter 
For Charter  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  8 75  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Charter will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Charter would post earnings of  1 79 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 39  delivering a surprise of  22 35  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Charter doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-charter-communications-chtr-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200475135,200475135

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4 82   A quarter ago  it was expected that this cable provider would post earnings of  1 79 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 39  delivering a surprise of  22 35

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Charter shares have added about 52 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 1  
What s Next for Charter 
While Charter has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Charter was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

128830,350345,CHTR,Charter  CHTR  Moves To Buy  Rationale Behind The Upgrade,opinion,"Charter Communications  NASDAQ CHTR  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Charter is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Charter  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Charter
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this cable provider is expected to earn  6 84 per share  which is a change of 31  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Charter  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2 2  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

128831,350346,CHTR,Here s Why Momentum Investors Will Love Charter Communications  CHTR ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Charter Communications  NASDAQ CHTR   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Charter Communications currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for CHTR that show why this cable provider shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For CHTR  shares are up 5 03  over the past week while the Zacks Cable Television industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 14 42  compares favorably with the industry s 1 88  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Charter Communications have risen 21 49   and are up 46 76  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 1 05  and 17 23   respectively 
Investors should also take note of CHTR s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  CHTR is averaging 1 025 931 shares for the last 20 days

128851,350366,CHTR,Charter Communications  CHTR  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Charter Communications  NASDAQ CHTR  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 26  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This cable provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 79 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  55 7  
Revenues are expected to be  11 39 billion  up 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 67  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Charter 
For Charter  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 14  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Charter will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Charter would post earnings of  1 34 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 11  delivering a surprise of  17 16  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Charter appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/charter-communications-chtr-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200441939,200441939

128855,350370,CHTR,Telecom Carriers Collaborate With States To Thwart Robocalls,opinion,Leading domestic telecom carriers have joined forces to clamp down on robocalls or unwanted phone calls  and have struck an agreement with attorney generals of all the states and the District of Columbia  The deal is aimed to shield consumers from this growing menace and eliminate the root cause by empowering law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators The move seems to be a major step in a synchronized attack on this perennial problem  as the Congress and the Federal Communications Commission   FCC   have also embarked on decisive actions to curb unsolicited calls  Before we take a closer look at these measures  let us dig a little deep into these spoofed calls Robocalls  A Growing MenaceA robocall is an unsolicited phone call that typically uses a pre recorded message like that delivered by a robot to market various products and services or serve reminders for pharmacy visits or debt payments  Using an automated dialing system  these calls are made without customer consent and are often viewed as irritants as customers are bombarded with thousands of such calls on a day  Per data from YouMail Inc   a developer of software that blocks the calls  about 48 billion robocalls were made last year  up from 31 billion in 2017  which translates to 4 billion robocalls a month In addition to infringement on customer privacy  robocalls try to siphon off personal data to con individuals  This eventually has led to several scams  robbing unsuspecting customers of their hard earned money Preventive Measures Already in PlaceIn order to prevent customers from receiving spurious calls  several telecom players have come up with innovative solutions through their bundled offers or supported apps  AT T   NYSE T   provides a blocking app and service called Call Protect that detects and blocks fraudulent calls  flags spam calls as  Suspected Spam  when the phone rings  and helps to maintain a personal block list  The service is likely to be enabled for new customers as a default in the near future followed by a similar such measure in existing customers   Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   offers a free version of its Call Filter service in compatible phones and postpaid plans that tries to detect and filter spam calls  In addition to alerting users  it reports unsolicited numbers and blocks them  T Mobile US  NASDAQ TMUS  Inc    NYSE T   offers Scam ID and Scam Block features free to all its postpaid and Metro customers  While Scam ID helps to identify potential scammers  Scam Block helps to block all likely scammers even before the call comes in The DealResponding to the call of the hour  12 leading telecom players have collaborated to ink an agreement with the states to launch free call blocking technology and make other free anti robocall devices and apps available to subscribers  These are AT T  Verizon  T Mobile  CenturyLink Inc  NYSE CTL    Comcast Corp  NASDAQ CMCSA    Sprint Corp   Bandwidth Inc   Charter Communications Inc  NASDAQ CHTR    Consolidated Communications Holdings Inc   Frontier Communications Corp  NASDAQ FTR    U S  Cellular Corp  and Windstream Holdings Inc  The agreement reinforces their earlier pledge to set up updated technology by the end of the year in response to an appeal by the FCC to curb the exponential growth of robocalls FCC   Congress Pitch InThe FCC has proposed a couple of measures to end the unsolicited robocalls that users have to constantly grapple with  These include creation of a national database of disconnected phone numbers that are reassigned to other users to avoid dialing the wrong customers repeatedly and enabling telecom service providers to block and filter text messages deemed as spam  The FCC has also demanded a digital validation by carriers to curb this menace Meanwhile  the Congress has passed the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act by an overwhelming majority in the Senate  followed by an almost unanimous approval of the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act in the House  The Senate bill will facilitate to protect consumers from spoofed calls with fake caller IDs  The House bill aims to stop the unwanted robocalls from being made in the very first instance by strengthening the Telephone Consumer Protection Act  which ensures that these callers must have consent from consumers before dialing With both bills likely signed into law and telecom carriers working in unison with states  robocalls are expected to be significantly curbed the in the near future  New York Attorney General Letitia James perfectly observed   The bad actors running these deceptive operations will soon have one call left to make  to their lawyers  Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of

Enterprise revenues increased 5  and 3 4   respectively However  commercial revenue growth came below commercial customer relationship growth in first quarter 2019 due to migration of customers to Spectrum pricing and packaging from Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House However  advertising sales  3 1  of total revenues  declined 3 1  year over year to  345 million  primarily due to lower political revenues  Other revenues  2  of total revenues  came in at  221 million  down 1 3  year over year Subscriber StatisticsIn the reported quarter  total residential and SMB customer

Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year   20 5  vs   16    Visa s first quarter fiscal 2019 earnings beat expectations and increased year over year  The results were driven by growth in payments volume  cross border volume and processed transactions  and a lower tax rate The Zacks analyst thinks Visa s strategic acquisitions and alliances  technology upgrades and effective marketing have paved the way for long term growth and consistent increase in revenues  Visa is well poised to gain from growing electronic payment processing and a solid brand name  Its strong capital

another concern  You can   Shares of Charter Communications have outperformed the Zacks Cable TV industry over the past year   1 4  vs   5 1    Charter s fourth quarter 2018 revenues increased on

Spinraza is performing well and has multi billion dollar potential  Biogen s efforts to regularly in license assets to build its pipeline are encouraging since several of them have transformative potential  Several data readouts are expected in 2019 with multiple potential launches in the early 2020s However  its core MS business  excluding Ocrevus royalties  has been largely flat  Also  potential competition to Spinraza from competitors  gene therapy programs for SMA is a concern  Though Biogen s CNS pipeline is attractive  it is a high risk area  You can   Other noteworthy reports

128933,350448,CHTR,Why Charter  CHTR  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Charter Communications  NASDAQ CHTR   which belongs to the Zacks Cable Television industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This cable provider has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 61 97  
For the most recent quarter  Charter was expected to post earnings of  1 04 per share  but it reported  2 11 per share instead  representing a surprise of 102 88   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 95 per share  while it actually produced  1 15 per share  a surprise of 21 05  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Charter  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Charter currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 34   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 31  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-charter-chtr-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200377183,200377183

128935,350450,CHTR,Charter Communications  CHTR  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Charter Communications  NASDAQ CHTR  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 31  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This cable provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 49 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  73 3  
Revenues are expected to be  11 15 billion  up 5 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8 79  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Charter 
For Charter  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 31  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Charter will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Charter would post earnings of  1 04 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 11  delivering a surprise of  102 88  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Charter doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/charter-communications-chtr-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200378952,200378952
128936,350451,CHTR,4 Telecom Stocks To Buy As 5G Network Revs Up Sector ,opinion,A growing U S  economy speeds up the demand for real time voice  data  and video manifold  The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans The next generation 5G Network will be a major driver for telecom operators going forward  Consequently  it will be lucrative to invest in telecom service provider stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank Advantage of 5G Wireless NetworkThe United States is progressing well to lead the world in 5G   the next generation of wireless connectivity   which will enable faster speeds and low latency wireless broadband services  Although 5G network is not likely to replace existing 4G standards on large scale before 2020  several telecom behemoths are expected to launch 5G smartphones in 2019 5G is widely believed to be smarter  faster and more efficient than 4G  It promises mobile data speeds that far outstrip the fastest home broadband network currently available to consumers  Data transmission speed of 5G network can go up to 100 Gbps  which will be 1 000 times faster than 4G standard  As a result  an entire HD film can be downloaded in less than a second using 5G network The rising demand for technologically superior products has been a silver lining for the telecom space in an otherwise tough environment  In this respect  the superfast 5G mobile networks will be of utmost necessity in managing the exponential growth of internet connected devices  popularly known as Internet

market size will reach  520 billion in 2021 from  235 billion in 2017 Consequently  IoT holds the potential to be the numero uno factor in driving future growth in the telecom space  Since 5G network will play the role of the backbone connectivity for the IoT  telecom sector will start benefiting since 2019 with the launch of this next generation wireless network Barriers to EntryLack of public airwaves  spectrum  in the telecom industry creates a high barrier to entry  It is not easy for a new operator to establish itself in the market  as it requires government approval to transmit voice  data  and video on public airwaves Spectrum licenses are limited and quite expensive  Moreover  the deployment of network infrastructure requires significant capital expenditure  which only a few entities can afford  Consequently  this barrier protects the profits of incumbents in the telecom space Our PicksAt this stage  it will be a wise decision to invest in telecom service provider stocks

   Factors to Consider News Corporation is battling soft print advertising demand with readers  preferring to access news online  mostly free  Advertising forms a major part of News Corporation s total revenues  approximately 28  of fiscal 2018 total revenues   Advertising revenues at News and Information Services segment fell 2  during the final quarter of fiscal 2018 on account of sluggishness in the print advertising market  The decision to stop The Wall Street Journal s international print editions also impacted fourth quarter fiscal 2018 results  Nevertheless  the company is concentrating on cost cutting and expanding digital offerings with greater emphasis on real estate services to mitigate the impact of sluggish print advertising demand  Also  the company s licensing deal with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  to create an original television series based on The Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien has been contributing to the company s results  These measures are likely to generate higher revenues and boost the company s profitability   The company is impressed with its Book Publishing segment s performance and continues to expand its foreign language penetration  At digital real estate services  it is likely to witness sturdy revenue growth at the REA and Move  This division is expected to drive the company s overall performance  Notably  the company s top line in the last reported quarter gained from consistent momentum in the Book Publishing and Digital Real Estate Services segments  Considering these growth driving factors  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of Book Publishing  Digital Real Estate Services  and News and Information Services in first quarter of fiscal 2019 is pegged at  405 million   294 million and  1 228 million  up 1   8 5  and 1  year over year  respectively  Meanwhile  the consensus mark for Cable Network Programing segment is anticipated to soar more than four folds to  666 million  What Does the Zacks Model Say  Our proven model does not conclusively show that News Corporation is likely to beat estimates this quarter  A stock needs to have both   a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive    for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   News Corporation has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  but an Earnings ESP of 0 00   We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Strong Sell  going into earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions  Stocks With Favorable Combination Here are some better ranked companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat  SeaWorld Entertainment  Inc    NYSE SEAS   has an Earnings ESP of  7 88  and a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  Monro Muffler Brake  Inc    NASDAQ MNRO   has an Earnings ESP of  0 86  and a Zacks Rank  2   Charter Communications  Inc    NASDAQ CHTR   has an Earnings ESP of  1 38  and a Zacks Rank  3   Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest Strategies It s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6   and  67 1   And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ",2018-11-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/whats-in-store-for-news-corporation-nwsa-in-q1-earnings-200354165,200354165

John Malone
When you study history  you find that many industries  especially those which required physical activity or skilled labor  offered apprenticeships for young workers as a way to learn from seasoned  experienced hands  I am sure you are familiar with guilds in iron working or carpentry as an example  There are plenty of others you can probably imagine as well  In the modern world  internships at investment banks are the version of apprenticeships for aspiring investors  However  investing capital is different than trying to create or evaluate a good deal  restructure a company to create more value for its owners or potential buyers  depending on the deal   or merge competitors into a one unified entity  As Mr  Munger says  nobody was born a good investor  So  if you didn t go to Wharton or Harvard and get an MBA  and don t happen to land one of those highly prized internships at an investment bank  you are forced to your own devices to find out how to invest  At this point  many people become familiar with Warren Buffett  Clearly Mr  Buffett is the greatest investor ever  but there are lots of great wealth creators out there  and the more of them you can discover  the greater your knowledge repository to draw on  For many readers  you have long read about my familiarity with John Malone 
In case you were not aware  from the early 1970 s until the early 1990 s  Mr  Malone oversaw the number one performing stock on any exchange anywhere in the world  after starting in very difficult financial circumstances at TCI Cable   Over the last ten years or so  while not doing that well  Liberty shareholders returns have bested the major indexes  So  there are worse people to become familiar with than this acclaimed billionaire  Over the last week  I went to the annual Liberty Investor Day  as I have done for the last five years or so  and it is always a good experience  There are the usual presentations about each business by the many Liberty controlled companies  and what has become the legendary video which management produces that pokes fun at various parts and people in the Liberty Empire  The most memorable part of this years event was when a highly regarded technology analyst asked Mr  Malone about how he felt about not pursing any potential sale with Charter Communications  NASDAQ CHTR  last year  Mr  Malone s terse but calm answer was essentially that he does things with only one entity in mind  that being Liberty shareholders  him being the largest one  As such  if your time horizon is not as long as his  think decades   there is a disconnect  He then gave the wisdom that stock prices of his company go up when people see a business favorably  and down when they don t and he just reacts to what the situation is  It is not the worst thing in the world to keep that in mind  eh 
Elsewhere  investors came to the conclusion that global growth is slowing when both Germany and Japan had worse than expected GDP results  In conjunction with that  Theresa May had cabinet members quit after trying to negotiate final Brexit terms with the European Union  In the commodity markets  oil prices continued to retreat based on the slowing growth thesis  In the US  Maxine Waters decided to let the investment world know where she stood when she inherits the post of House Financial Services Committee chairperson  Maxine said the free pass for large banks by easing regulations was finished  Clearly  a fellow Democrat might mention to Maxine what the political reality is in the Senate as well  Anyway  as if they did not have enough negative sentiment towards them  large banks took it on the chin this week  along with the rest of the market  Maybe it was the fires in California  maybe the slowing growth idea is reverberating  or maybe people see technology valuations as just way too high  Whatever the case may be  since the end of September  investors mood has turned dour  Maybe Thanksgiving will  shall we say  lighten the mood 
Finally  we should mention the tragic situation in California with the fires and the loss of life  homes  and animals that it has taken place  It certainly makes you realize the fragile nature of the world that we live in  Fires  hurricanes  terrorist activities  cybercrime  well  there are plenty of difficult things that can happen which make today s environment quite unpredictable  All the more reason to find wisdom wherever one can  including long standing figures in the investment world  There is a link to Mr  Malone s interview with David Faber at the bottom of the page  in case you are interested

128993,350508,CHTR,Sprint  T Mobile call off merger after months of talks,news,"By Liana B  Baker and Anjali Athavaley SAN FRANCISCO NEW YORK  Reuters    Sprint Corp  N S  and T Mobile US Inc  O TMUS  said on Saturday they have called off merger talks to create a stronger U S  wireless company to rival market leaders  leaving No  4 provider Sprint to engineer a turnaround on its own  The announcement marks the latest failed attempt to combine the third  and fourth largest U S  wireless carriers  as Sprint parent SoftBank Group Corp  T 9984  and T Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom AG  DE DTEGn   show unwillingness to part with too much of their prized U S  telecom assets  A combined company would have had more than 130 million U S  subscribers  behind  Verizon Communications  Inc  N VZ  and AT T Inc  N T   The failed merger could also help keep wireless prices low as all four providers have been heavily discounting their cellphone plans in a battle for consumers   Consumers are better off without the merger because Sprint and T Mobile will continue to compete fiercely for budget conscious customers   said Erik Gordon  a Ross School of Business professor at the University of Michigan   The companies  unusual step of making a joint announcement on the canceled negotiations could indicate they still recognize the merits of a merger  keeping the door open for potential future talks  Sprint and T Mobile said they ended talks because the companies  were unable to find mutually agreeable terms   John Legere  chief executive of T Mobile  said in the statement that the prospect of combining with Sprint was compelling  but  we have been clear all along that a deal with anyone will have to result in superior long term value for T Mobile s shareholders compared to our outstanding standalone performance and track record   Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said that even though the companies could not reach a deal   we certainly recognize the benefits of scale through a potential combination    Claure also said Sprint has agreed it is best to move forward on its own with its assets  including our rich spectrum holdings  and are accelerating significant investments in our network to ensure our continued growth   SPRINT S ROAD AHEAD Failure to clinch an agreement leaves SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son  a dealmaker who raised close to  100 billion for his Vision Fund to invest in technology companies  needing to find another option for Sprint  Sprint is in the middle of a turnaround plan and has sought to strengthen its balance sheet by cutting costs  But industry analysts have expressed concern that the company  weighed down with total debt of  38 billion  has few financial options  Even though its customer base has expanded under CEO Claure  growth has been driven by heavy discounting  Analysts said an end to talks with T Mobile would leave debt laden Sprint without the scale needed to invest in its network and to compete in a saturated market  Sprint has sought to strengthen its balance sheet by cutting costs and mortgaging a portion of its airwaves and equipment  Mark Stodden  telecom analyst at Moody s Investors Service  said about Sprint   To really take the kind of next step from a business that has been stabilized to a business that has been growing is going to require a new more intense investment phase    T Mobile is in a better position as a standalone company  analysts have said   T Mobile  controlled by Germany s Deutsche Telekom which owns roughly 65 percent  became the first major carrier to eliminate two year contracts   a shift quickly embraced by consumers and copied by competitors  The company has also badgered rivals with its unlimited data plans  Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim H ttges said in a statement on Saturday that T Mobile has a  strong basis for growth in the upcoming years   MONTHS OF TALKS Both companies had expressed interest in a tie up this year  SoftBank was prepared to give up control to do a deal with T Mobile  sources familiar with the company s thinking told Reuters in February  But no deal was announced immediately following the conclusion of a ban on merger talks in the spring that was associated with a U S  government auction of wireless airwaves   Both Sprint and T Mobile said they were open to exploring other options  An added wrinkle was Sprint s negotiations with cable companies Comcast Corp  O CMCSA  and  Charter Communications  Inc  O CHTR   A source told Reuters in July that SoftBank was considering an acquisition offer for Charter in a deal where it would combine the cable company with Sprint  The two companies came close to announcing a merger in 2014  but called it off at the last minute due to regulatory concerns   Industry executives have said a combined Sprint T Mobile entity would have the scale  network and enhanced portfolio of wireless airwaves and a better chance to develop 5G  the next generation of wireless technology  Even if T Mobile and Sprint had agreed on merger terms  they would have faced major challenges convincing antitrust regulators that their deal should be approved  
 This is good news for consumers   a potential merger by T Mobile and Sprint could have raised serious antitrust issues   Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in a statement ",2017-11-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/sprint-and-tmobile-end-merger-negotiations-763973,763973

129001,350516,CHTR,Top Stock Reports For Charter Communications  Mondelez   Halliburton,opinion,"Wednesday  March 14  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Charter Communications  NASDAQ CHTR   Mondelez  MDLZ  and Halliburton  HAL   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Charter Communications  shares have outperformed the Zacks Cable TV industry over the past three months   8 6  vs   4 3    Moreover  the Zacks analyst likes the company s wireless venture  along with plans to offer its wireless service in 2018  The company s residential and commercial internet and voice customer growth continues to accelerate  evident from the revenue growth and subscriber gains  
Further  despite cord cutting  the company reported a net gain of 15 000 video  300 000 Internet and 53 000 voice customers in fourth quarter of 2017  However  Charter s operations in a saturated and competitive multi channel U S  video market is a worry  The company continues to face stiff competition from online TV streaming service providers  The company s high debt level and consolidation related woes are other potential hazards 
 You can   
Shares of Mondelez have lost  1 2  in the last one year  outperforming the  11  decline of the Zacks Food Preparation industry  Mondelez reported fourth quarter 2017 results  with earnings beating expectations and revenues meeting the same  Adjusted earnings grew 21   primarily driven by operating gains  Net revenues increased 2 9  year over year  courtesy of the Power Brands and favorable trends in emerging markets  Emerging markets  net revenues rose 6 3   while Power Brands witnessed a 3 7  rise  
Regionally  Latin America  Asia  Middle East   Africa and Europe registered an increase of 4 2   2 6  and 5  in revenues  respectively  However  North America s revenues declined 0 6   Adjusted operating margin expanded 180 basis points year over year on lower overhead costs owing to continued cost reduction 
 You can   
Halliburton s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil   Gas Field Services industry over the past six months  up  9  vs   2 9    This price performance is backed by phenomenal earnings surprise history  with HAL having surpassed expectations in all the trailing 14 quarters  The world s No  2 oilfield services provider s consistently strong numbers could be attributed to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America  
Of late  HAL has also been aided by margin expansion at its drilling and evaluation product lines  while the international market continues to improve  However  cost inflation triggered by increased fracking sand pricing is likely to dampen investor confidence  Moreover  with the failure of BHI acquisition  HAL had to book a massive  3 5 billion in breakup charges that stretched its balance sheet  Hence  the Zacks analyst advises investors to wait for a better entry point before buying shares of HAL 
 You can

129080,350595,CHTR,U S  Telecommunications Industry    Looking Forward To 2018,opinion,It is turning out to be disappointing 2017 for the U S  telecommunications industry  Cut throat pricing competition resulting in lower ARPU  average revenue per user  and margins  massive investment for upcoming 5G wireless network and fiber optic buildout resulting in low free cash flow and intense competitive pressure shifted investor s focus toward other growth oriented industries in an overall bull market in 2017 Year to date  telecom service provider industry has lost 0 73   Although the telecom equipment manufacturer industry has gained 12 09   it is still below the bench mark S P 500 index gain of 16 91     Will the telecom industry turnaround in 2018  The answer to this question depends on a spate of macro economic and industry specific factors  Irrespective of a few positives and negatives  the industry s fate will also depends on court verdicts in some major cases Positive FactorsUpcoming fifth generation  5G  superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry  Verizon plans to launch next generation 5G wireless residential broadband services in three five U S  markets in 2018  However  a full phased 5G wireless network will be offered only in 2020  5G wireless networks will be of utmost importance in the management of exponential growth in Internet of Things  IoT   In other words  IoT has the potential of becoming the numero uno factor in driving growth in the space Accumulation of dark fiber will bolster telecom operator s cell network density  consequently giving a boost to their mobile backhaul network  The densification of cell network will help carriers install and build 5G network  Adoption of small cells has increased due to the inconvenience of installing large towers in inaccessible areas  Small cells will be used to augment existing 4G LTE and upcoming 5G network and will primarily concentrate on high traffic locations like a business district or a shopping mall Internet TV streaming service is gradually gaining market traction in the United States  Of late  the legacy pay TV industry has been facing stiff competition from online video streaming service providers  The low cost over the top video streaming service has resulted in massive cord cutting that is currently threatening the pay TV business model  Internet TV streaming has emerged as a strong alternative to counter this competitive threat President Donald Trump s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish  The two pro growth agendas of Trump  namely  significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the U S  economy   We believe the U S  telecommunications industry is going to be a major beneficiary The proposal to reduce corporate tax rate from 35  to 20  faced by telecom carriers would be immediately accretive to cash flow  Trump s tax proposal will result in a huge windfall for telecom operators  The carriers can utilize this money for 5G network R D and its deployment   The telecom industry is highly capital intensive in nature  Therefore  the immediate expensing of investment in all tangible  intangible and real property  other than land  would significantly benefit telecom carriers  This would encourage telecom operators to increase investment for capital expenditure  Major proposals such as a pledge to spend  1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years coupled with the above mentioned policy changes are likely to spur higher consumer spending Trump has stated that he wants to do away with nearly 75  of all governmental regulations during his term as the President  We believe that the telecom industry will be one of the major beneficiaries of this policy change  A new Federal Communications Commission  FCC   headed by Ajit Pai  exercising lesser restrictions  certainly augurs well for the ISP  Internet Service Providers  industry Negative FactorsThe U S  wireless industry is likely to get competitive in 2018 with the entry of cable MSOs  multi service operators   Comcast has already entered this space with its Xfinity Mobile offering  Importantly  the company acquired 73 licenses in the band of 600 MHz auctioned by the FCC  We believe that in the future Comcast will deploy this spectrum for extensive wireless coverage Charter Communications  NASDAQ CHTR  has reiterated its plans of launching wireless service in the first half of next year  Further  DISH Network has created an extensive portfolio of spectrum  the most important component of wireless networks  The company boasts a portfolio of 80 MHz of radio frequencies of different bands which will be utilized to deploy 4G LTE wireless network in the top 100 U S  markets Telecom operator s wireline business is also struggling with persistent losses in access lines as a result of competitive pressure from voice over Internet protocol  VoIP  service providers and aggressive triple play  voice  data and video  offerings by cable MSOs  multi service operators   These are weighing on the company s revenues and margins  Moreover  cord cutting remains a major problem for all legacy pay TV operators Internet TV streaming service market is quickly getting crowded  Moreover  a major concern for pay TV operators  who recently entered into Internet TV streaming  is that the latter has actually cannibalized the legacy pay TV service  Most of these companies are offering both legacy pay TV services as well as Internet TV streaming service  with selected TV channels at lower costs Two Key Court Verdict is AwaitingOn Dec 14  2017  in a landmark decision  the U S  telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission  FCC  repealed the Net Neutrality laws that it had imposed under the Obama regime  There is little doubt that the ISP industry will be the major beneficiary after FCC dismantling Net Neutrality  Nevertheless  Net Neutrality supporters are preparing for a legal battle  The current FCC s less restrictive regulatory attitude may also pave the way for new merger and acquisition deals between ISPs and online digital media companies  We expect this subject to remain a hot cake in the 2018 telecom space AT T and media giant Time Warner are finally heading for a battle in court against the U S  Department of Justice  DOJ  in 2018 over their  85 4 billion big ticket merger deal  On Nov 20  2017  the U S  Department of Justice  DOJ  filed a lawsuit against the telecom behemoth over its mega acquisition deal citing that the proposed deal will increase prices for rival pay TV operators as well as subscribers  It will also act as a stumbling block for the development of online video  Recently  AT T and DOJ once again engaged in a settlement talk which failed to resolve the issue unanimously   We believe that the decision will have a strong bearing on the recent convergence trend in the telecom cable TV media space  Cable TV and telecom giants are foraying into the media industry with big ticket acquisitions  Technologically  we are moving from triple play  voice video data  bundled services offering to quad play  voice video data mobile  bundled offering   Video on demand is the new norm for telecom  cable TV and media industries  Technological advancements have enabled distributors to come up with different ways of bundling and disseminating content  effective content creation methods and creating new business models  The DOJ s decision is a major concern for this new business model Stocks

129082,350597,CHTR,AT T  T  Facing Stiff Rivalry  Should You Dump The Stock ,opinion,AT T Inc    NYSE T   had a disappointing 2017 and continues to struggle in the competitive and almost saturated wireless market  Adoption of several unlimited data plans resulted in a reduction of wireless service revenues and average revenue per user  ARPU  We believe that the U S  telecom behemoth is currently facing several headwinds  We do not foresee any immediate catalyst for AT T s growth and therefore it will be beneficial for investors if they stay away from this stock Question Mark on Time Warner DealOn Nov 20  2017  the U S  Department of Justice  DOJ  filed a lawsuit against AT T for its proposed  85 4 billion takeover of media giant Time Warner Inc    NYSE TWX    The DOJ verdict was challenged by AT T in court  However  a court ruling is unlikely before May 2018  Notably  both the companies have resettled the closing date for the deal for Jun 21  2018 If the court ruling goes against AT T  three options will be available   scrapping the deal  divesting its DIRECTV division or acquiring Time Warner without the Turner Broadcasting assets including CNN We believe that disinvestment of DIRECTV is out of question as the company is gradually promoting its satellite based DIRECTV brand over its fiber based U Verse  as its new pay TV offerings  Moreover  DIRECTV NOW online streaming service is quickly gaining market traction  which recently surpassed one million subscribers On the other hand  disinvestment of Turner Broadcasting assets including CNN will prevent AT T to derive maximum synergies  Management expects the deal to be accretive to both adjusted earnings and free cash flow  in the first year post its closure  The company is likely to achieve cost synergies of  1 billion per annum within the first three years of the merger   The company expects the deal to help in diversifying its revenue mix  lowering capital expenditure and reducing regulatory restrictions Finally  if AT T abandons the Time Warner deal  it will be the company s second big ticket merger that will fail after the FCC discarded its  39 billion merger proposal with T Mobile US  AT T s growth in 2018 will largely depend on the court ruling on the Time Warner merger deal Intensely Competitive U S  Wireless MarketThe U S  wireless industry is likely to get competitive in 2018 with the entry of cable MSOs  multi service operators   Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  has already entered this space with its Xfinity Mobile offering  Charter Communications  NASDAQ CHTR  has reiterated its plans of launching wireless service in the first half of 2018 Technological upgrades and breakthroughs have resulted in cutthroat price competition  Although AT T added domestic postpaid wireless customers in the third quarter of 2017  a closer look gives us a more interesting picture  Net addition of 117 000 postaid connections actually dropped a substantial 44 8  year over year  Notably  postpaid customers are those who are billed monthly and considered more profitable to telecom operators Moreover  AT T s wireline division is struggling with persistent losses in access lines as a result of competitive pressure from voice over Internet protocol  VoIP  service providers and aggressive triple play  voice  data  video  offerings by cable companies  These are weighing on the company s revenues and margins Cord Cutting a Major ConcernIn the third quarter of 2017  AT T lost 251 000 satellite TV customers and 134 000 U verse TV customers  Of late  the legacy pay TV industry has been facing stiff competition from online video streaming service providers  The low cost over the top video streaming service has resulted in massive cord cutting that is currently threatening the pay TV business model A major cause for concern for pay TV operators  who recently entered into Internet TV streaming  is that the latter has actually cannibalized the legacy pay TV service  Most of these companies are offering both legacy pay TV services as well as Internet TV streaming service  with selected TV channels at lower costs Operators are yet to find out an appropriate trade off between these two types of services  Making attractive online ventures are drawing subscribers to the new service at the cost of traditional pay TV business model  Ultimately  the Internet TV service is yet to stop cord cutting  the biggest threat for pay TV operators Other HeadwindsAt the end of the third quarter of 2017  AT T had approximately  163 3 billion of total debt outstanding with a debt to capitalization ratio of 0 55  Its debt skyrocketed post its decision to acquire media mogul  Time Warner Inc In November 2017  Mexico s telecommunications regulator stated that America Movil could start charging local rivals for mobile calls to its network for the first time since a 2014 sector reform  This has been a bane for companies like AT T which are desperately trying to strengthen foothold in Mexico but still depend on America Movil s network due to its sheer size across the nation AT T is aggressively offering bundled services  However  it needs to set the stage right  as so far  its bundled customer addition has failed to match the outflow of users from its legacy services  Our analysis has been substantiated by the fact that over the past 60 days  five analysts have downwardly revised their estimates for 2018 Earnings per share  EPS  of AT T Price performance and Zacks Rank  In 2017  AT T s shares have decreased 9 89   worse than the  s decline of 8 14   Notably  the benchmark S P 500 index has gained a whopping 18 25  in the same time period  AT T carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   However  other major national carriers  namely Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    T Mobile US Inc    NYSE T   and Sprint Corp    NYSE S   carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Investor Alert  Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the

129084,350599,CHTR,Are Investors Wrong To Be Selling These 5 Stocks Now ,opinion, One of the funny things about the stock market is that every time one person buys  another sells  and both think they are astute     William FeatherInvestors often buy winning shares and sell the ones yielding negative returns  However  the stock market thrives on sentiments  and any unforeseen event in a particular sector has a ripple effect on others  which might be temporary  In fact  companies with solid fundamentals and prospects are likely to brave the temporary setbacks Why You Shouldn t Always Sell Stocks with Negative ReturnsWhile invertors  short term concerns dent a company s performance for a momentary period  stocks with strong fundamentals usually return to a growth path Meanwhile  with the latest tax reform  the new wage bill  an infrastructure plan and more  the U S  stock markets have been shining bright  In fact  in the last month  the Dow inched up 1 8   registering nine straight months of gains for the first time since 1959  Over last year  the index climbed 25 2  posting its best yearly increase since 2013  The Dow also notched its 71st record close in 2017  the highest number recorded in a year Now  when the markets are advancing at such a lightning pace  it is very difficult to find good stocks that are trading at a cheaper rate  One way could be to focus on stocks that are yielding negative returns due to some temporary issues  but have robust fundamentals that guarantee long term growth  Furthermore  a series of positive developments  as mentioned below  are also likely to boost these stocks Major Market MoversPresident Trump signed his new  1 5 trillion tax reform plan   the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act    recently  As usual  in its initial stage  the nation had given mixed reactions on the controversial bill  While the bill is claimed to primarily focus on the easing of tax woes for middle class Americans  the massive cut in the corporate tax rate tells a different story altogether Trump s  America first   pitch has been driving employment growth like never before  Per reports  the unemployment rate was pegged at 4 1  in November 2017  the lowest since February 2001 The minimum wage is poised to increase in 18 states and around 20 cities in the United States  according to an analysis by the National Employment Law Project  This will result in inching employees  wages closer to  15 an hour  which is known as a  living wage  Per a report by the Bureau of Economic analysis  real gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 3 2  in the third quarter of 2017 compared with 3 1  increase in the second quarter  Strong contributions from personal consumption expenditures  PCE   private inventory investment  nonresidential fixed

129096,350611,CHTR,Sprint swings to profit  but potential merger best long term play,news,"Investing com   Sprint Corp  NYSE S  shares remained solidly higher Tuesday afternoon after the company posted a quarterly profit after three straight years of losses while reported merger talks and an ongoing turnaround plan gave traders even more reason to be bullish

WeaknessesIn general  the beleaguered telecommunications companies have high debt levels and large financial leverage ratios  Moreover  they are often unable to cope with recent market trends  Other risks that pose threats are as follows 
         Potential Business Slowdown  Sales fluctuations of carriers are expected to continue weighing on capital spending decisions    a major problem faced by equipment vendors  The companies are expected to retain focus on improving balance sheets  financial discipline and free cash flow generation  
          Product Overlapping  We may see more product sharing deals between telecom  cable TV and satellite TV operators  as each of these players are vying to grab a sizeable share in each other s territory  Even pay TV services  offerings to business enterprises  mobile backhaul and metro Ethernet segments may observe more convergence  Mobile phone makers are now progressively offering tablets and chipset manufacturers are providing chips for personal computers as well as mobile devices    thus frequently interchanging their areas of operations           Intensified Competition  Technological upgrades and breakthroughs have resulted in cutthroat price competition  Product life cycles and upgrade cycles have been reduced drastically as several firms are coming up with new products and services within a short span of time  Increasing competition is compelling players to offer heterogeneous and bundled services to retain their position in the space

129105,350620,CHTR,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  AT T  Verizon Communications  Comcast And Charter Communications,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 29  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include AT T Inc    NYSE T    Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    Comcast Corp    NASDAQ CMCSA   and Charter Communications Inc  NASDAQ CHTR     NYSE T   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  FCC Plans to Repeal Net Neutrality  Who Gains Ever since President Donald Trump elected Republican commissioner Ajit Pai as the chairman of the FCC  Federal Communications Commission  in January 2017  the fate of Net Neutrality has been at stake  Pai  a staunch Net Neutrality opponent  has always maintained his view that consumers would be worse under Net Neutrality and should expect their bills to go up along with slow broadband speed In May 2017  the FCC voted 2 1 to start the formal process of unwinding the Net Neutrality rules  On Nov 21  Pai revealed a draft plan for a complete roll back of Net Neutrality  The FCC is set to vote on the proposed changes at its next monthly meeting on Dec 14 Net Neutrality implies an open Internet atmosphere  The 2015 Net Neutrality laws reclassified Internet as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act instead of section 706 of the 1996 Telecom Act  This gives the FCC increased control over the ISPs  Internet Service Providers   Net Neutrality will prohibit ISPs from discriminating against applications  Earlier  these companies were allowed to restrict any device  application  service  or content from running on their respective networks   Read   Arguments Against Net NeutralityEven when the former FCC under the chairmanship of Tom Wheeler had adopted Net Neutrality  Republican senators were not in favor of this directive  These groups believe that a slight law reformation under section 706 of the 1996 Telecom Act would be enough to enforce Net Neutrality All ISPs  along with several cable TV and telecommunications industry bodies have been vehemently opposing Net Neutrality  The major argument against the directive is that ISPs have to spend several billion dollars to install and upgrade high speed mobile fixed  mobile broadband network Further  disallowing discriminatory pricing policy will significantly reduce revenues and margins  which will result in lower investments in the high speed broadband sector  Consequently  broadband equipment service providers might suffer  due to lesser investment by ISPs  and loss of jobs is also a likely scenario Per a recent study by telecom industry body USTelecom  investment in broadband infrastructure declined from its peak at  78 4 billion in 2014 to  77 9 billion in 2015 and  76 billion in 2016  According to USTelecom  the reclassification of broadband as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act has resulted in precipitous lower investment in broadband infrastructure The Draft Proposals of Ajit PaiPer the new proposals drafted by the FCC chairman  the regulator s sole concern will be transparency of ISP practices  This will ensure that consumers can buy service plans best suited to them  Also both large and SMB  small and medium business  enterprises can avail instant technical information for product innovation  The draft proposes the return of the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  in charge overseeing ISP practices for the protection of consumers  online privacy Pai strongly argued that a light touch regulatory measure generated higher investment in the overall telecom industry  For example  establishment of Internet fast lanes become necessary for some critical scenarios  Remote healthcare applications and self driving cars will require high speed secured broadband connections with exceptional reliability  In these situations  FCC s soft regulatory policies will enable ISPs to better serve the country Pai further stated that in the last 20 years  private sector has invested a mammoth  1 5 trillion to install communications network throughout the country  This enormous expenditure happened primarily due to not so stringent rules implemented by the regulator According to Pai   Internet is inherently an interstate service   Therefore  the new proposals will prevent state and local governments from creating their own Net Neutrality rules  The current FCC s less restrictive regulatory attitude may also pave the way for new mergers and acquisition deals between ISPs and online digital media companies Who Will Benefit if FCC Revokes Net Neutrality Trump himself is a strong critic of Net Neutrality  There is little doubt that if the new FCC scraps Net Neutrality laws  the ISP industry will be the major beneficiary  Leading ISPs including AT T Inc   Verizon Communications Inc   Comcast Corp  and Charter Communications Inc  strongly criticized Net Neutrality rules  Each of the above mentioned stocks currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Bottom LineTelecommunications is a necessary utility  The need for telecom in both rural and urban areas as well as its role in the infrastructural development of an economy is of vital importance  Net Neutrality may discourage large investments in the telecom sector but will cut down the cost of online access for end users since content providers will no longer need to pay extra fees  However  it is to be seen how the government manages a trade off between the two Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But

129115,350630,CHTR,TV networks try new tricks to woo pay TV partners as ratings slide,news,By Jessica Toonkel  Reuters    Sliding ratings and a continued drop in cable subscribers has led programmers such as Viacom Inc  Univision Communications Inc and AMC Networks Inc to invent new ways to justify their worth to pay TV providers  In the past  programmers could rely on their hit shows as leverage at the bargaining table with cable and satellite partners who buy their programs  But as online viewing continues to disrupt the traditional media business  programmers are pitching everything from co producing series with distribution partners to offering data for use in advertising   The way people watch TV is rapidly changing  Fewer people are watching live television  leading to declines in ratings and ad revenue  And at the same time  more people are cancelling cable subscriptions to watch shows online on their tablets or phones  resulting in record customer losses   Declining subscriptions have left cable companies hard pressed to pay higher prices for TV shows   Cable and satellite companies shed 793 000 subscribers in the first quarter  more than four times the loss during the same quarter last year  according to research firm BTIG  Analysts at UBS estimate another 1 million customers will cut the cord in the second quarter as there are no signs of this trend abating    The distribution business has changed more rapidly in the past 12 months than in the prior five years   said Tom Gorke  executive vice president of content distribution at Viacom   If we just focus on  here are my channels and here is my price  call me with your response   that is not going to grow the pie   While the economics of renewal negotiations is still largely focused on programming  being able to offer other things can help  said Eric Ratchman  executive vice president of content distribution at Univision  DIGITAL FOCUS Viacom CEO Bob Bakish has made it a priority to improve relations with distributors  Over the past several months  Bakish  Gorke and his team have met with the chief executives for all the largest distributors asking what they can do to help them do their business better  Gorke said  For Viacom  the company said it is in ongoing discussions to help distributors on everything from identifying password sharing on paid TV apps  to using its viewer data to help target advertising around their broadband and other services   Offering viewer data helped Viacom clinch a distribution deal with Suddenlink parent Altice USA in May  marking the end of a two year dispute with the cable company   Meanwhile  Univision is leveraging the popularity of European soccer to entice a pay TV partner  Univision owns the Spanish language rights for more than 600 Union of European Football Associations  UEFA  games and is looking for a distributor to become the exclusive partner on some televised games  said Ratchman   Univision would also like to co produce more dramas with distributors like it did with Netflix s  El Chapo   Ratchman said   AMC  home of the popular  The Walking Dead   zombie series inked a co production deal with  Charter Communications   NASDAQ CHTR  to create programming exclusively for Charter s Spectrum subscribers to watch first before AMC airs it elsewhere   Last month  AMC launched a monthly subscription option designed for customers of Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  Corp s Xfinity TV packages  AMC is in talks to do similar deals with other distributors  said Ed Carroll  chief operating officer of AMC  Such deals demonstrate how conversations between distributors and programmers have evolved away from pricing of content to a more comprehensive digital focus  said Matt Strauss  general manager  video and entertainment services for Comcast Cable   The conversation has gotten more sophisticated with respect to digital rights and customer experience    Strauss said   I think you are seeing a lot of networks leaning into this     For a graphic on  Viewing behaviour by age and device  click  ,2017-07-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tv-networks-try-new-tricks-to-woo-pay-tv-partners-as-ratings-slide-507104,507104

129138,350653,CHTR,T Mobile s expanded network has rivals   and suitors   taking notice,news,By Anjali Athavaley NEW YORK  Reuters    T Mobile US Inc  O TMUS  has built a reputation as a scrappy underdog by offering cell service with no contracts and cheap prices   Now it s aiming for another title  America s No  1 wireless carrier   That might seem a stretch for a cell phone company long known for its lousy coverage outside of major cities   But over the past five years T Mobile has been on a buying binge to extend its reach  Bankrolled by a  3 billion break up fee from a failed 2011 merger with AT T Inc  N T   it has snapped up wireless airwaves in states ranging from New York to Washington   Suddenly  T Mobile  the No  3 U S  wireless carrier  is within striking distance of market leaders  Verizon Communications  Inc  N VZ  and AT T  at least when it comes to delivering nationwide coverage  OpenSignal  a London based startup that measures network experience based on data from users of its app  said in February that T Mobile and Verizon were tied in speed rankings in the last quarter of 2016  Testers found a Verizon signal 88 percent of the time  T Mobile s network availability was just two percentage points lower  T Mobile Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray says the bulk of the country will soon have access to its network    There s nothing that stands between us delivering and matching  if not beating  Verizon and AT T s coverage   Ray said in an interview with Reuters in May  Verizon and AT T still maintain a hefty lead when it comes to retail subscribers  each boasting around double T Mobile s 55 million users  They also have higher profit margins  Still  T Mobile s client base has been growing steadily  Its share of retail subscribers grew to 18 percent in the first quarter of 2017  up from 10 percent in the same period in 2012  according to data from financial services firm  Barclays   LON BARC    And when it comes to users who pay a monthly bill  the industry s most valuable customers  T Mobile has grown that segment for four straight years  while Verizon and AT T lost monthly subscribers in the first quarter of 2017  For a graphic on T Mobile s market share in wireless  see   T Mobile s German majority owner Deutsche Telekom AG  DE DTEGn   which owns roughly 65 percent of the U S  carrier  says T Mobile is now positioned to call its own shots as it plots its course in the United States   We decide what  when  and how   Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Tim Hoettges said at an annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday   That includes T Mobile remaining a stand alone carrier  But the real intrigue in telecom circles is about a possible merger or acquisition  Rival Sprint Corp  N S   America s No  4 carrier  has expressed interest in a tie up   Japan s SoftBank Group Corp  T 9984   Sprint s controlling shareholder  was prepared to give up control to do a deal with T Mobile  sources familiar with the company s thinking told Reuters in February   Cable companies  too  could be interested as they roll out wireless services to bundle more products together  In January  John Malone  whose Liberty Broadband Corp  O LBRDA  is the largest stakeholder in  Charter Communications  Inc  O CHTR   raised the possibility that major cable companies could get together and buy T Mobile  The buzz has boosted T Mobile s stock price  which is up nearly 60 percent from a year ago  First quarter profits hit  698 million  or 80 cents per share  up 46 percent from a year earlier and well ahead of analysts  expectations  The success of T Mobile  which has dubbed itself the  Un carrier   can be attributed partly to its straight up approach to mobile  It was the first major carrier to eliminate two year contracts  a shift quickly embraced by consumers and copied by competitors  The company has continued to badger rivals  most recently with its unlimited data plans  But copious data and fast speeds are pointless if mobile users can t get a signal  Verizon  the biggest U S  wireless carrier by subscribers  says T Mobile still has a lot of catching up to do   Chief network officer Nicola Palmer pointed to data from testing firm RootMetrics  which has called Verizon the clear U S  leader in coverage and reliability  Some T Mobile customers  too  say their service isn t what it should be  Austin  Texas resident Abbie Scheider  an avid camper  says she s out of luck in the woods of central Texas    I never have service even when others do   the 24 year old ad agency account executive said   It s frustrating for sure   SPECTRUM  MOTHER LODE   T Mobile s big push to boost coverage began in 2012 when it received cash plus spectrum from a failed merger with AT T  The U S  Justice Department in 2011 sued to block the deal on concerns it would harm competition  Facing the prospect of a lengthy regulatory battle  AT T walked away  T Mobile subsequently picked up spectrum from a 2013 merger with Texas based MetroPCS Communications  followed by a 2014 asset swap with Verizon  Its most ambitious effort yet came in April when it committed  8 billion to become the biggest spender in a U S  government auction of wireless airwaves  The purchase  which T Mobile executives refer to as the  mother lode   will strengthen the company s presence this year across the western United States  including Arizona  Montana  Texas and Wyoming   And T Mobile isn t done yet  Like its competitors  the company is pushing into so called fifth generation wireless or 5G  a new network that is expected to offer higher speeds and lower response times   While it continues to invest in its network  T Mobile says it is open to considering various strategic options  Company officials have acknowledged interest in talking with Sprint  At an investor conference in May  T Mobile Chief Financial Officer Braxton Carter said Sprint s spectrum was a  treasure trove that you could do amazing things with   A Sprint spokeswoman declined to comment   Industry executives and analysts said T Mobile has shown that it can go it alone  giving it leverage as it enters any discussions   We want to be a global leader in this space   Ray said   That s the plan and now the capability we have for T Mobile

before the opening bell on Oct 19 Last quarter  Verizon s bottom line was on par with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The company s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters  with an average miss of 1 10  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors at PlayWe remain concerned about Verizon s operation in the highly competitive and saturated U S  wireless industry Spectrum crunch is a major issue in the domestic telecom industry  Moreover  the entry of major cable companies like Comcast Corp   NYSE S   and Charter Communications Inc   NASDAQ CHTR   has further intensified competition  Comcast has already completed the nationwide rollout of its wireless services  while Charter is planning to launch wireless services in 2018 The company s wireline division continues to suffer from persistent losses in access lines owing to competitive threats from voice over Internet protocol  VoIP  service providers and aggressive triple play  voice  data  video  offerings from cable companies  Verizon  s plans to cut costs over the next four years and support the dividend payout with savings by 2022  implies the company s high debt levels  Funding of dividends is difficult with rising debts On the flip side  Verizon has restructured its unlimited data plans and has teamed up with Amazon com  Inc   NASDAQ AMZN   to deliver virtual network services at a global scale  Verizon  along with Ericsson  BS ERICAs  and Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  have achieved a download speed of 1 07 Gbps  Verizon s 5G wireless network trials  plans to deploy fixed wireless version in 2018 and the deal to buy Straight Path Communications complements its 5G wireless expansion strategies  Verizon is preparing to launch an online TV streaming service later this year  We expect that these announcements will aid Verizon to gain subscribers in the to be reported quarter Additionally  we appreciate Verizon s efforts to reward shareholders with a quarterly dividend of 59 cents per share  an increase of 1 25 cents or 2 2  from the previous quarter  This is the 11th consecutive year  wherein Verizon s board of directors has approved a quarterly dividend increase Buyout of Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  aids Verizon s digital media suite  Meanwhile  Verizon continues to remain on track to fortify itself in the fiber and Internet of Things space through different deals Price Performance and A Closer View on Certain Important MetricsOn a positive note  the company portrays an impressive price performance  In the past three months  shares of Verizon soared 9 7  compared with the  s gain of 1 2    When compared with the market at large  the stock s performance looks outstanding  as the S P 500 index is pegged at 3 6   over the same time frame   We believe that the market expects this momentum to continue in the upcoming days  on the back of the overwhelming hike in the price  We also believe that the achievement occurred due to the better performance of certain other important non financial metrics Improvement in subscriber addition holds promise for Verizon in the soon to be reported quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of postpaid wireless subscriber addition for third quarter is 415 million The prepaid wireless segment is also expected to perform well in the third quarter of 2017  with net subscriber addition of 41 37

129156,350671,CHTR,WWE Q3 Earnings To Gain From Subscriber Growth  TV Right Fees,opinion,World Wrestling Entertainment  Inc    NYSE WWE   is scheduled to report third quarter 2017 financial numbers  before the opening bell on Oct 26  In the previous quarter  the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16 7  Notably  the company s earnings have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters by an average of 8 2   Here s a discussion of the determinants of the second quarter results Factors Influencing This QuarterAfter generating record revenues in 2016  WWE had impressed investors with its revenue generation ability  In the first and second quarters of 2017  the company had reported top line growth of 9 9  and 10 7   respectively  We believe WWE will continue to report record revenue growth as it has not only extended its earlier deal but also signed agreement with new service provider for airing its flagship program Raw and SmackDown in different countries  Further  subscriber growth and worldwide increase in TV rights fees will boost the top line further higher In July  WWE reached an agreement with sports marketing agency Lagard re Sports in an effort to augment revenues  Per the agreement  Lagard re Sports will help in building partnership portfolio through its sponsorship proficiency and global sales channel in all international regions  excluding China  We believe with increasing subscription based video streaming services  WWE Network through its vast presence in over 180 countries will be able to capitalize on the trend  Consequently  this is likely to aid top line growth Moreover  management is optimistic about achieving another great year of revenues and adjusted OIBDA growth  The company is targeting adjusted OIBDA of  100 million for 2017  up nearly 25  from the 2016  In first half 2017  the company has already generated adjusted OIBDA of  36 7 million  For the third quarter  adjusted OBIDA is projected in the range of  31  35 million driven by top line growth  WWE Network subscribers and contractual television rights fees  In the fourth quarter  it anticipates adjusted OIBDA of at least  28  32 million However  WWE operates in the highly competitive market of entertainment video  Further  decline in home entertainment and pay per view revenues has been a major concern for the investors  In 2016  home entertainment net revenues came in at  13 1 million in comparison with  13 4 million and  27 3 million in 2015 and 2014  respectively  Further  the trend continued in the first and second quarter of 2017  with home entertainment revenues declining 27  and 3 2   respectively  The decline in home entertainment revenues has been primarily due to steady shift of consumers to digital formats  downloaded or streamed over the Internet World Wrestling Entertainment  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   What to Expect The question lingering in investors  minds now is whether World Wrestling Entertainment will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 20 cents  in comparison with year ago quarter earnings of 14 cent  We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 30 days  Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of  173 2 million compared with  164 2 million reported in the year ago quarter Zacks Model Shows Unlikely BeatOur proven model does not conclusively show that WWE is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  WWE has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 20 cents  The company carries a Zacks Rank  3 which increases the predictive power of ESP but an ESP of 0 00  makes a surprise prediction difficult  You can uncover the best

129203,350718,CHTR,U S  Telecommunications Industry Outlook   July 2017,opinion,"The U S  telecommunications industry is currently balanced with almost equal proportions of positive and negative influences  This year  we expect this industry to witness growth more or less in line with the broader market  Telecom has of late emerged as an intensely contested space where success largely depends on technical superiority  the quality of services and scalability 
Positive Factors
At present  the U S  telecom industry enjoys several positive attributes  First  the Trump administration s new telecom regulatory body   Federal Communications Commission  FCC    has given enough indications that it will be less stringent compared with the Obama administration  and is likely to roll back several regulations of the previous regime  Second  the less restrictive nature of the FCC will aid mergers and acquisitions which are likely to spur growth in 2017  Third  President Trump has decided to improve broadband availability in rural areas  Rural broadband development will be an element of his ambitious  1 trillion infrastructure plan he will submit to Congress soon 
Negative Factors
However  several near term headwinds prevail in the telecom industry  The chief ones include growing price competition for wireless services that are likely to reduce carriers  revenue growth in 2017  Leading cable MSOs  multi service operators  have decided to enter the wireless field this year  which is likely to intensify competition in an already saturated market 
Further  capital spending by U S  telecom carriers may be muted in 2017  4G LTE wireless penetration is currently 83  in North America  This can primarily be attributed to most carriers  intention to upgrade to the 5G wireless network standard which requires massive investment  However  a full phased 5G network deployment is unlikely before 2020 
Telecom   Media Convergence Now a Reality
Massive growth of smartphone and tablets together with continuous development of super fast data transfer technologies have acted as a key driver of the convergence of the Telecom and Media sectors  Cable TV giant Comcast Corp   CMCSA  became a media mogul after acquiring NBC Universal in 2011  AT T Inc  NYSE T    T  is currently awaiting the regulatory approval for its proposed  85 4 billion cash and stock deal to acquire media giant Time Warner Inc  NYSE TWX  
Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ    VZ  has already acquired AOL and the Internet based assets of Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  to establish a strong foothold in the Telecom   Media space  The company is also mulling over buying out any powerful media giant to remain competitive  AT T currently holds a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  while both Verizon and Comcast carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Telecom Operators   Cable TV Operators  Segments Overlapping
The broader telecom sector has turned out increasing competitive as both basic phone service providers and cable TV operators are increasingly entering into each other s territory  While Verizon and AT T have long been servicing customers with fiber based video networks  leading cable MSOs  multi service operators  like Comcast and Charter Communications Inc  NASDAQ CHTR    CHTR  have entered the wireless network field 
Currently  both companies are negotiating with national wireless carrier Sprint Corp   S  for a possible MVNO  mobile virtual network operator  deal or an outright purchase of Sprint  Meanwhile  AT T has strengthened its pay TV services after the acquisition of largest satellite TV operator Directv 
Online Digital Advertisement  Solid Prospects
Advertisement on the mobile video platform is gradually shifting from simple selling of banner ads on the mobile web to automated or programmatic ad selling  Pay TV operators are steadily adopting the data driven advertising technique that is already popular in the web based advertisement arena  To derive maximum synergy from the combined video content and video distribution platform  these companies are extensively penetrating the advertising technology market 
Inclusions of dynamic ad insertion  targeted audience advertising and data driven TV advertisements are steps toward the same objective  According to market research company eMarketer  the global mobile ad market value is expected to reach a worth of  133 7 billion by 2017 
Wireline Industry  Going All Out for Consolidation
In the past decade  U S  wireline phone companies have lost a significant number of customers to wireless service providers and cable multi service operators  In order to tackle this critical situation  wireline operators have decided to merge to attain economies of scale with respect to fiber optic cable networking and cloud based network services  Meanwhile  small and medium business  SMB  services have become a high revenue generating segment in the data communications industry 
In Apr 2016  Frontier Communications Corp   FTR  completed the purchase of Verizon s wireline assets in California  Florida and Texas  Currently  the company operates landline business and provides broadband  video  voice and FiOS services in all the three states  In Nov 2016  CenturyLink Inc  NYSE CTL    CTL  and Level 3 Communications Inc   LVLT  entered into a definitive agreement  through which the former will acquire the latter in a cash and stock transaction 
In Feb 2017  telecommunications and data service firm Windstream Holdings  Inc   WIN  acquired EarthLink Holdings Corp  In addition  in Apr 2017  the company entered into a deal to acquire Broadview Networks  a leading provider of cloud based unified communications solutions to SMBs  In Jul 2017  Cincinnati Bell Inc   CBB  announced that it will buy Hawaiian Telecom Inc 
Growing Demand for Fiber Optic Network
The fiber optic network is increasingly becoming the most sought after technology for secure and fast data transmission over long distances  Going forward  the wireline industry will largely evolve around the fiber based superfast gigabit data transmission network 
Fiber optic cable is a vital infrastructure to meet the surging need for cloud based business data  along with more video streaming services by individuals  Moreover  fiber optic cable network is vital for backhaul and last mile local loop  which are needed by wireless service providers for their upcoming 5G network 
Fiber networks are essential for the growing deployment of small cells  The increase in adoption of small cells is because of the inconvenience in installing large towers in inaccessible areas  Verizon stated that small cells will be used to augment its existing 4G LTE and upcoming 5G network and will primarily concentrate on high traffic locations like a business district or shopping mall  Small cells will increase voice capacity and data speeds as well as complement wireless service providers LTE infrastructure 
Valuation Indicates Some Upside
Going by the P E  price to earnings per share  valuation metrics  which is often used to value telecom sector stocks  the industry looks stable at this stage  The industry currently has a trailing 12 month P E ratio of 16 33x  in line with the median value in the past year 
Additionally  the reading compares favorably with the market at large  as the current P E for the S P 500 is pegged at 20 61x and the median level is 20 10x  At present  the telecom industry looks undervalued compared to the overall market  This indicates a near term upside potential for the stocks 
Another commonly used valuation metric for this sector is P S  price to sales  which also depicts the same picture  The industry s current P S of 1 52x compares favorably with the market at large  as the current P S for the S P 500 is at 3 20x and the median level is 3 13x 
What the Zacks Industry Rank Indicates 
Within the Zacks Industry classification  Telecommunications is broadly grouped in the Computer and Technology sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  and is further sub divided into 12 industries at the expanded level  Communications Infrastructure  Communications Components  Satellite Communications  Cable TV  Diversified Communications Services  Internet Services  Wireless Equipment Supplier  National Wireless Service Provider  Rural Wireline Operator  Non U S  Wireless Operator  National Wirleline Operator and Non U S  Wireline Operator   The level of sensitivity and exposure to different stages of the economic cycle vary for each industry

Earnings Trend in the Sector

129204,350719,CHTR,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Comcast  AT T  Verizon Communications  Charter Communications And Sprint,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  July 28  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Telecom  Part 1  including Comcast Corp   NASDAQ   NYSE S       AT T Inc   NYSE   NYSE T        Verizon Communications Inc   NYSE   NYSE VZ      Charter Communications Inc  NASDAQ CHTR    NASDAQ   NYSE T      and Sprint Corp   NYSE   NYSE S      Industry  Telecom  Part 1Link  The U S  telecommunications industry is currently balanced with almost equal proportions of positive and negative influences  This year  we expect this industry to witness growth more or less in line with the broader market  Telecom has of late emerged as an intensely contested space where success largely depends on technical superiority  the quality of services and scalability Positive FactorsAt present  the U S  telecom industry enjoys several positive attributes  First  the Trump administration s new telecom regulatory body   Federal Communications Commission  FCC    has given enough indications that it will be less stringent compared with the Obama administration  and is likely to roll back several regulations of the previous regime  Second  the less restrictive nature of the FCC will aid mergers and acquisitions which are likely to spur growth in 2017  Third  President Trump has decided to improve broadband availability in rural areas  Rural broadband development will be an element of his ambitious  1 trillion infrastructure plan he will submit to Congress soon Negative FactorsHowever  several near term headwinds prevail in the telecom industry  The chief ones include growing price competition for wireless services that are likely to reduce carriers  revenue growth in 2017  Leading cable MSOs  multi service operators  have decided to enter the wireless field this year  which is likely to intensify competition in an already saturated market Further  capital spending by U S  telecom carriers may be muted in 2017  4G LTE wireless penetration is currently 83  in North America  This can primarily be attributed to most carriers  intention to upgrade to the 5G wireless network standard which requires massive investment  However  a full phased 5G network deployment is unlikely before 2020 Telecom   Media Convergence Now a RealityMassive growth of smartphone and tablets together with continuous development of super fast data transfer technologies have acted as a key driver of the convergence of the Telecom and Media sectors  Cable TV giant Comcast Corp   NASDAQ      became a media mogul after acquiring NBC Universal in 2011  AT T Inc   NYSE      is currently awaiting the regulatory approval for its proposed  85 4 billion cash and stock deal to acquire media giant Time Warner Inc  NYSE TWX  Verizon Communications Inc   NYSE      has already acquired AOL and the Internet based assets of Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  to establish a strong foothold in the Telecom   Media space  The company is also mulling over buying out any powerful media giant to remain competitive  AT T currently holds a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  while both Verizon and Comcast carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Telecom Operators   Cable TV Operators  Segments OverlappingThe broader telecom sector has turned out increasing competitive as both basic phone service providers and cable TV operators are increasingly entering into each other s territory  While Verizon and AT T have long been servicing customers with fiber based video networks  leading cable MSOs  multi service operators  like Comcast and Charter Communications Inc   NASDAQ      have entered the wireless network field Currently  both companies are negotiating with national wireless carrier Sprint Corp   NYSE      for a possible MVNO  mobile virtual network operator  deal or an outright purchase of Sprint  Meanwhile  AT T has strengthened its pay TV services after the acquisition of largest satellite TV operator Directv Online Digital Advertisement  SolidProspectsAdvertisement on the mobile video platform is gradually shifting from simple selling of banner ads on the mobile web to automated or programmatic ad selling  Pay TV operators are steadily adopting the data driven advertising technique that is already popular in the web based advertisement arena  To derive maximum synergy from the combined video content and video distribution platform  these companies are extensively penetrating the advertising technology market Inclusions of dynamic ad insertion  targeted audience advertising and data driven TV advertisements are steps toward the same objective  According to market research company eMarketer  the global mobile ad market value is expected to reach a worth of  133 7 billion by 2017 Wireline Industry  Going All Out for ConsolidationIn the past decade  U S  wireline phone companies have lost a significant number of customers to wireless service providers and cable multi service operators  In order to tackle this critical situation  wireline operators have decided to merge to attain economies of scale with respect to fiber optic cable networking and cloud based network services  Meanwhile  small and medium business  SMB  services have become a high revenue generating segment in the data communications industry Growing Demand for Fiber Optic NetworkThe fiber optic network is increasingly becoming the most sought after technology for secure and fast data transmission over long distances  Going forward  the wireline industry will largely evolve around the fiber based superfast gigabit data transmission network Fiber optic cable is a vital infrastructure to meet the surging need for cloud based business data  along with more video streaming services by individuals  Moreover  fiber optic cable network is vital for backhaul and last mile local loop  which are needed by wireless service providers for their upcoming 5G network Fiber networks are essential for the growing deployment of small cells  The increase in adoption of small cells is because of the inconvenience in installing large towers in inaccessible areas  Verizon stated that small cells will be used to augment its existing 4G LTE and upcoming 5G network and will primarily concentrate on high traffic locations like a business district or shopping mall  Small cells will increase voice capacity and data speeds as well as complement wireless service providers LTE infrastructure Valuation Indicates Some UpsideGoing by the P E  price to earnings per share  valuation metrics  which is often used to value telecom sector stocks  the industry looks stable at this stage  The industry currently has a trailing 12 month P E ratio of 16 33x  in line with the median value in the past year Additionally  the reading compares favorably with the market at large  as the current P E for the S P 500 is pegged at 20 61x and the median level is 20 10x  At present  the telecom industry looks undervalued compared to the overall market  This indicates a near term upside potential for the stocks Another commonly used valuation metric for this sector is P S  price to sales  which also depicts the same picture  The industry s current P S of 1 52x compares favorably with the market at large  as the current P S for the S P 500 is at 3 20x and the median level is 3 13x What the Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Within the Zacks Industry classification  Telecommunications is broadly grouped in the Computer and Technology sector

129226,350741,CHTR,Altice USA  The Industry Is Fine  The Company Is Not,opinion,"Broadband company Altice USA  NYSE ATUS  got off to a good start with its Thursday IPO  the second largest of the year behind Snap s  NYSE SNAP  gargantuan IPO  Altice raised  1 9 billion by selling 63 9 million shares at  30 apiece according to   and the price fell in the upper half of Altice s expected  27 to  31 range  As of early Monday morning  the stock has risen to a price of  34 30 after reaching a high of  35 29 
All of this is good news for Altice  but is it enough to beat long term concerns of cord cutting and a changing cable industry  Perhaps  but it is not enough to beat the concerns which relate to Altice directly  Altice is unprofitable and its potential to expand remains limited  and it is simply too early to speculate that its future will be roses  Investors should pass for now  but pay attention to whether Altice can make the major acquisitions it desires  Changing Cable Times
Altice USA is a subsidiary of European telecoms company Altice  AS ATCA   and is much younger than its larger peers of Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA   Charter Communications  NASDAQ CHTR   which owns Time Warner Cable   and Cox Communications  Altice purchased two cable companies  Suddenlink and Cablevision  NYSE CVC  in 2015 and 2016 respectively  and then merged them to form Altice USA 
Altice USA stated in its  that it has  4 9 million residential and business customers  in 21 states  though the majority of them are concentrated in New York and Texas  However  Altice had a net loss of  76 million in the first three months of 2017 along with losing over  831 million in 2016 and  190 million in the first three months of 2016  Altice can thus point out that its bottom line is improving  but it still remains in the red 
Investors may also be wary of Altice and other cable companies due to the rise of cord cutting and the  of cable television subscribers  These fears  while concerning  are overstated  Altice s Pay TV revenue managed to slightly increase from the first three months of 2016 to 2017 from  1 05 billion to  1 07 billion  And while cable providers may be squeezed by declining subscribers if they cannot find a solution  they still have a steady business in broadband which will continue to grow in demand  How will it grow 
But even if Altice will not be negatively affected by cord cutting  it still needs to expand and improve operations if it wants to become  and compete  And there are serious questions about how Altice will accomplish that 
This is especially so because while Altice can point out that its bottom line is improving  it faces a massive debt burden thanks to its earlier acquisitions  Altice has  36 billion in total assets  but a staggering  24 billion in debt 
Altice says that the proceeds it raises from this IPO will help pay off the debt  but  1 9 billion is obviously nowhere near enough  In fact  Altice will not be getting anywhere near that amount of money   points out that it will only be getting 19 percent of that  1 9 billion  with the majority of it going to Altice s past investors in BC Partners and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board 
Altice s need to service that debt will impact its ability to grow elsewhere  Altice became the fourth largest American cable company through making sudden acquisitions at the cost of a burdensome debt load  and it appears to be planning to double down on that strategy by making further acquisitions  While there are small regional competitors whose acquisition could enlarge Altice s profile  the big potential prize is Cox Communications  A merger between Cox and Altice would create a strong competitor to Charter and Comcast 
But Cox has expressly indicated that they are not for sale  Even if they were  there are  that Charter is interested in merging with Cox as well  And even if Cox chose to merge with Altice  such a move is too long term to fully understand how it would play out 
Consequently  the prospect that Altice can grab an acquisition which would immeasurably boost its profile remains unlikely  For now  Altice remains an unprofitable company with a massive debt load that is stuck competing against larger peers  Watch and Wait
Altice s bottom line numbers are improving and it has grown rapidly through making acquisitions  But while these facts may intrigue some investors  its current unprofitability and high debt load should scare them away  While cord cutting may not doom cable  the industry is in a transitional phase and now is not the time to bet on an emerging company  If Altice s bottom line numbers can continue to improve  then investors may consider giving them a chance  But that is no reason to make a move now ",2017-06-29,Alex Newman,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/altice-usa:-the-industry-is-fine,-the-company-not-so-much-200198147",200198147

129229,350744,CHTR,North American deals drive global investment banking fees to 10 year high,news,"By Dasha Afanasieva
LONDON  Reuters    Global investment banking fees reached a 10 year high in the first quarter of 2017 with more than half of the  24 billion in total takings coming from North America  Thomson Reuters data showed on Tuesday 
The rebound in fees to pre crisis highs will be good news for global advisors who complain they are being squeezed by regulatory requirements amid competition from boutique players 
Wall Street banks took the top five places last quarter  led by JP Morgan  N JPM  which earned  1 7 billion in fees  followed by Goldman Sachs  N GS  with  1 5 billion 
Fees from equity issuance almost doubled although bonds were the biggest contributor to fees globally  Mergers and acquisitions  M A  was the only sector not to improve on last year s dismal first quarter  with fees falling 2 5 percent in the first three months of this year 
Uncertainty surrounding Britain s exit from the European Union  the election in the Netherlands and upcoming polls in France and Germany dampened European activity but fees still rose almost 20 percent last quarter 
The biggest fee payer was U S  telecoms operator  Charter Communications   O CHTR  which has been exploring a tie up with Verizon  N VZ  and has issued a series of bonds 
Investment banking fees generated by financial sponsors and their portfolio companies increased by 50 percent on a year earlier to  2 7 billion for the first quarter of 2017

more than  100 billion to acquire Charter Communications Inc  NASDAQ CHTR     NYSE T    the second largest cable MSO in the U S  The offer   valued between  350 and  400 per share   was supposedly rejected by the cable company stating that the price offered was too low  Also  Charter Communications is not ready to get acquired Well  none of these two companies have commented anything about the merger negotiations yet  Currently  both Verizon Communications and Charter Communications carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Meanwhile  reports say that Verizon has also been eyeing another Liberty Media  NASDAQ FWONA  property  Sirius XM Holdings Inc    NASDAQ SIRI   for a buyout  although this has not yet resulted in a bid The Expected SynergiesGiven the scope for revenue and cost synergies from a merger  Verizon is eyeing a cable acquisition to help it launch its high speed 5G wireless plans  These plans require the fiber optic networks that cable companies possess  Charter Communications  wide and dense fiber optic network could be valuable for Verizon s 5G wireless data services  As we all know  Verizon is currently conducting customer trials in 11 U S  cities for fixed 5G wireless network  The company is focusing on building a fiber and wireless infrastructure in a bid to deliver mobile video efficiently The wireless giant  which was the first to deploy the 4G LTE  Long Term Evolution  network nationwide  is initially testing equipment at 15GHz  28GHz  39GHz and 64GHz frequency bands for 5G network deployment   The company s partners in the 5G project are Cisco Systems Inc   NASDAQ CSCO   Ericsson  BS ERICAs  LM  ERIC   Nokia  HE NOKIA  Corp   NOK  and Samsung  KS 005930  The buyout could help Verizon Communications cope up with slow broader U S  telecom market and emerge as the high speed broadband Internet services provider in the U S Meanwhile  on May 8  Comcast Corp    NASDAQ CMCSA   and Charter Communications   two major cable companies   have agreed to jointly work on their wireless services businesses  making the U S  wireless industry severely competitive  For this much hyped wireless venture  both companies have already inked a

2017   AOL Inc    a major player in the digital content and online advertising space   was acquired by Verizon in Jun 2015  We believe a slowdown in mobile phone sales has prompted Verizon Communications to diversify its business model into the digital media platform  targeting the lucrative segments of digital media  advertising and content creation  as well as distribution Similarly  the twin buyout of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks has benefited Charter Communications in terms of geographic expansion and operating cost synergies To this end  Verizon Communications

129253,350768,CHTR,U S  sues DirecTV for illegal information trading during Dodgers talks,news,"By Diane Bartz WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Justice Department filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against AT T s  N T  DirecTV  alleging it acted as a ringleader to illegally swap information with rival pay TV providers about negotiations over showing Dodgers baseball games in the Los Angeles area  The department said DirecTV  before its 2015 acquisition by AT T  exchanged confidential information with Cox Communications   Charter Communications   O CHTR  and AT T  to get leverage against  Time Warner  Cable  which distributes a channel showing Dodgers games in Los Angeles  These companies have refused to carry the SportsNet LA channel  a partnership between the Dodgers baseball team and Time Warner Cable  contending that carriage fees sought by Time Warner Cable were too high  As a result  much of Los Angeles was unable to watch the Dodgers play for the past three seasons  the Justice Department said  The lawsuit comes at a time when AT T is preparing for an antitrust review of its planned purchase of Time Warner Inc  N TWX   a separate entity from Time Warner Cable  The Justice Department is expected to scrutinize the deal  While the spat with the Justice Department over the Dodgers channel is legally distinct from the antitrust review of AT T s planned purchase of Time Warner  analysts said the lawsuit was bad timing given the vehement opposition the deal faces from some lawmakers and public policy groups   It is hard to see how this can help the deal   said Spencer Kurn  an analyst with New Street Research  The department said in its complaint that a DirecTV executive assured executives at the other three companies that DirecTV had no plans to strike a deal to show the Dodgers  Cox  Charter and AT T responded with similar assurances  The result was that the companies knew that they would not lose subscribers to competitors if all of them refused to air the Dodgers channel  the complaint said  The department said DirecTV  as the largest pay TV provider in the United States with over 25 million video subscribers and a nationwide footprint  had the most subscribers that could watch the Dodgers Channel and without it  competition would not have been harmed  Among other evidence  the complaint cited then DirecTV CEO Mike White s public comments in a May 2014 industry conference  where he said it was important that  the distributors start to stand together  like most of us have been doing in Los Angeles for the first time ever  by the way  with the Dodgers on outrageous increases and excesses   The complaint names DirecTV and its owner AT T as defendants  but not Cox or Charter  AT T is named because it is DirecTV s parent company   Dodgers fans were denied a fair competitive process when DirecTV orchestrated a series of information exchanges with direct competitors that ultimately made consumers less likely to be able to watch their hometown team   said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Sallet of the Justice Department s Antitrust Division  AT T said the information trades occurred before its DirecTV acquisition last year  and said it disagreed with the department s action   The reason why no other major TV provider chose to carry this content was that no one wanted to force all of their customers to pay the inflated prices that Time Warner Cable was demanding for a channel devoted solely to LA Dodgers baseball   said David McAtee  AT T general counsel  in a statement   We make our carriage decisions independently  legally and only after thorough negotiations with the content owner  We look forward to presenting these facts in court   McAtee said  In its complaint  the Justice Department asked court to bar future similar communications between the companies  require them to create a compliance program and pay the government s legal costs  Cox said in a statement that it was  gratified  that it was not named as a defendant   We continue to be committed to making independent decisions on program content   Charter  which completed its takeover of Time Warner Cable earlier this year  declined to comment  The drawn out battle over the distribution of the Dodgers  channel highlights how pay TV operators have been struggling with high sports programming costs charged by networks from regional sports channels to ESPN  In 2013  Time Warner Cable partnered with the Dodgers  owners to create a new regional sports network called SportsNet LA to distribute Los Angeles Dodgers games  Under the deal  Time Warner Cable was in charge of negotiating local affiliate fees for the new network with rival cable and satellite TV providers  
The channel launched in 2014 but Time Warner Cable was unable to get pay TV operators  such as DirecTV  who complained that the carriage fees were exorbitant  to pay for it ",2016-11-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-sues-directv-for-illegal-information-trading-during-dodgers-talks-436931,436931

However  the domestic economic calendar will get moving tomorrow with the release of the National Federation of Independent Business  NFIB  Small Business Optimism Index  forecasted to tick lower during April to a level of 104 0 from March s 104 7 level  followed by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey  JOLTS   with economists expecting the measure of unmet demand for labor to show 5 74 million jobs were available to be filled in March  matching the prior month s reading

Europe mostly lower following French election results  Asia mostly higher to begin week 
European equities finished mostly lower  with the markets reacting to the expected results from the final round of the French Presidential election over the weekend that delivered a victory for pro Europe  mainstream candidate Emmanuel Macron over anti EU Marine Le Pen  However  political uncertainty remained as U K  Brexit negotiations continue and a vote looms in June for the nation  while Germany is slated to hold an election later this year  along with Italy 
Oil  and gas issues rebounded  despite choppy action for crude oil prices  while basic materials issues led to the downside following some relatively soft Chinese trade data  The markets shrugged off upbeat reports on German factory orders and eurozone consumer sentiment  The euro and British pound traded lower versus the U S  dollar  while bond yields in the region were mixed 
Stocks in Asia finished higher to kick off the week  aided by Friday s stronger than expected U S  labor report and final French Presidential election vote that offered no surprise to keep concerns cooled about the status of the eurozone  Basic materials and oil and gas issues rebounded from recent pressure  despite some softer than expected Chinese trade data  Stocks in both Japan and South Korea rallied in their return to action following holiday breaks  with continued weakness in the yen giving the former an additional push 
Meanwhile  markets in China were mixed amid lingering concerns about regulatory crackdowns and following trade figures showing April exports and imports rose at smaller than expected y y rates  Shares in mainland China declined and those trading in Hong Kong advanced  The strength in commodity issues gave Australia s markets a boost  while Indian equities posted a modest increase

   What is Driving the Better than Expected Earnings AMC Networks owns and operates various cable television stations and is engaged in the production of programming and movie content  Its programming network channels include AMC  IFC  Sundance  WE and BBC America AMC Networks  strength lies in programs with original content for which it holds ownership rights  In this regard  shows like Breaking Bad and Mad Men have been major hits  driving commercial success for the company  However  one of the biggest drags for the company is that its network is entirely dependent on The Walking Dead franchise The second half of the seventh season of The Walking Dead was ranked the number one show on television with 15 9 million total viewers and 9 9 million 18 49 adults  Total viewers were up 5  from Dec 2016  18 49 adults increased 3  and the 25 54 cohort increased 5   Meanwhile  horror video streaming services are doing well  The premier of the critically acclaimed programming event Planet Earth II telecast on Feb 18  gathered 2 7 million total viewers  including 1 2 million adults 25 54 AMC Networks is also boosting its regional growth in key markets with channel launches and new distribution deals with key pay TV operators in Latin America  Central and Eastern Europe  Iberia and Africa to serve audiences with award winning programming across multiple genres In Jan 2017  the company reported a huge viewership percentage  with a 14  increase from 2015 and a 107  increase in the past two years  The company has successfully expanded its cable and DTH platforms in the Balkans region  We believe these new deals to bring new series in the entertainment world will boost its subscriber base in the to be reported quarter Additionally  serious competitive threats from over the top  OTT  online video streaming service providers and other media companies coupled with the recent trend of the bulk of ad revenues skewed toward Internet TV are factors that may mar the quarter s performance  AMC Networks competes in the highly competitive broadcast radio and television industry  Its major competitors include CBS Corp    NYSE CBS    Gray Television Inc    NYSE GTN   and Entercom Communications Corp    NYSE ETM   to name a few Key PickHere is a company from the Zacks categorized broader sector   which houses AMC Networks   that has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Charter Communications Inc    NASDAQ CHTR   is slated to release first quarter 2017 results on May 2  The company has an Earnings ESP of  6 06  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  Charter Communications  earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 79 71  Sell These Stocks  Now  Just released  today s 220 Zacks Rank  5 Strong Sells demand urgent attention  If any are lurking in your portfolio or Watch List  they should be removed immediately  These are sinister companies because many appear to be sound investments  However  from 1988 through 2016  stocks from our Strong Sell list have actually performed 6X worse than the S P 500 ",2017-04-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/amc-networks-(amcx)-q1-earnings:-is-a-beat-in-the-cards-200186398,200186398

129323,350838,CHTR,Should Charter Communications  CHTR  Enter Wireless Arena ,opinion,"Last week  the U S  wireless industry dynamics took a turn after Comcast Corp    NASDAQ CMCSA   became the first cable MSO  multi service operator  to offer an unlimited data plan for the postpaid wireless market  This led to an industry wide speculation about the possibility of Charter Communications Inc  NASDAQ CHTR     NYSE T   following suit  Notably  with the acquisitions of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks  Charter Communications has become the second largest cable MSO after Comcast 
Comcast is likely to start offering wireless services around mid 2017 by combining its MVNO  mobile virtual private network  agreement with Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   with its own WiFi network  With this the company can offer quad play wireless  wireline  video and high speed data  Internet  services 
On the other hand  Verizon is already offering quad play services using fiber based FiOS video and FiOS Internet  AT T Inc    NYSE T   has also become a major player in the bundled quad play offerings after its acquisition of DIRECTV  the largest satellite TV operator 
The industry is wondering whether Charter Communications can survive providing just the triple play video  voice and high speed data services  We believe it will be tough for the cable MSO to remain competitive without entering the wireless field 
While unveiling its unlimited data plan for the wireless market  Comcast clearly stated that its plan is not specifically related to making huge profits or gaining significant market share from incumbent carriers  Rather  will aim retaining existing X1 pay TV bundle subscribers by reducing churn rate  We believe the same logic also holds good for Charter Communications since cord cutting has become an existential threat for traditional pay TV operators 
In Feb 2017  Charter Communications announced the launch of its experimental field trials for the upcoming 5G wireless network  Notably  these trials come on the back of spectrum test licenses granted to the company by the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  
Like Comcast  Charter Communications also has an agreement with Verizon to operate as an MVNO using the latter s wireless network  Charter Communications has more than 17 million video  22 5 million high speed Internet and 10 1 million voice customers 
In Jan 2017  The Wall Street Journal reported that Verizon is exploring strategic options to acquire Charter Communications  The latter s announcement about its 5G trials immediately gave rise to these speculations  However  nothing concrete has come out so far 
We believe a merger with Charter Communications makes sense for Verizon since the company is aiming to launch the initial version of its super fast 5G network in 2018  5G services require connections to have fiber optic networks in dense urban areas 
Charter Communications will aid Verizon to standardize its 5G network from a technical perspective  If the acquisition takes place  the combined entity will likely emerge as a significant player in the quad play industry 
Price Performance of Charter Communications

Year to date the stock price of Charter Communications returned 14 84   underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s gain of 15 06   At present  the cable TV industry is facing a massive cord cutting threat and Charter Communications is no exception  We believe that is the primary reason behind the stock currently carrying a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

129324,350839,CHTR,FCC s 600 MHz Spectrum Auction Witness Surprise Winners,opinion,"Recently  the U S  telecom regulator  Federal Communications Commission  FCC  has declared the names of the winning bidders for its latest 600 MHz low band wireless spectrum auction  popularly known as  Incentive Auction  
The much hyped Incentive Auction turned out to be a massive disappointment with just  19 8 billion in total proceeds  way below the initially settled clearing bench mark of  88 4 billion for a substantial 126 MHz of wireless spectrums   The airwaves were freed by TV broadcasters that no longer have any productive use of the same   
Surprisingly  T Mobile US Inc    NYSE T   has acquired the largest pie  nearly 45   of the available spectrums by offering a sum of nearly  8 billion  The company won 1 525 licenses and bought around 31 MHz of spectrums in the 600 MHz low band frequencies  The second lace holder was the satellite TV operator DISH Network Corp    NASDAQ DISH    The company bought 18 MHz of spectrum spending a little over  6 2 billion and acquired 486 licenses 
Comcast Corp    NASDAQ CMCSA    the largest cable TV operator and media giant  came in third by spending  1 7 billion and acquiring 73 licenses  Notably  Comcast will enter the U S  wireless market in mid 2017 and recently revealed its wireless unlimited data plan  The U S  telecom giant AT T Inc    NYSE T   took the fourth place after acquiring 23 licenses for a total bid price of over  910 million  Small sized wireless operator United States Cellular Corp    NYSE USM   also spent nearly  328 7 million 
Another surprising fact was that Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    the largest U S  telecom operator  did not bid for 600 MHz low band spectrum despite registering itself for the bidding process  All of the above mentioned stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Factors that Led to the Disappointment
In Jan 2016  the then FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler asserted that Incentive Auction will be the  world s largest spectrum auction that has ever taken place   However  the optimism soon died out  Notably  the regulator collected a substantial amount of nearly  44 9 billion from the AWS 3 spectrum auction that was concluded in Jan 2015 
Low band spectrum is essential for wireless operators as the signals can be transmitted over longer distances and through brick and mortar walls in cities  However  several industry experts believe that telecom operators may be unwilling to shell out such a hefty sum for low band airwaves 
Further  wireless operators are of the opinion that high band spectrums can boost capacity  The U S  wireless industry is currently suffering from cut throat pricing competition  Two large national carriers  namely  Verizon and AT T are facing significant competitive threats from the low cost pricing plan of T Mobile US and Sprint Corp  Recently  all four major wireless operators have introduced their new unlimited data plan 
Additionally  leading cable MSOs  Comcast and Charter Communications Inc  NASDAQ CHTR    are likely to enter the field in 2017  Consequently  it will be easier for incumbent operators to merge with a suitable company to enhance spectrum portfolio rather than spending huge sums on new spectrum buying 
However  during the Obama regime  the FCC was very strict regarding consolidation in the wireless industry  Nevertheless  general consensus so far is that the new Trump administration may be more liberal about merger and acquisition proposals in the U S  wireless market  Thus  the incumbent wireless operators may not be interested to in spending huge sums of money on the FCC conducted Incentive Auction

129334,350849,CHTR,Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway Hints At New Purchase,news,"By   
Warren Buffett s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc     NYSE BRKa  said Friday it boosted its stake in cable television operator  Charter Communications  Inc  NASDAQ CHTR    and signaled it may have another large investment planned after agreeing to buy Precision Castparts Corp  NYSE PCP   in its largest ever purchase  Berkshire also appeared to have shed its stakes in oilfield equipment provider National Oilwell Varco Inc  NYSE NOV   and refiner Phillips 66  NYSE PSX  in the second quarter  as the oil industry struggles with falling prices 
The changes were disclosed in a U S  Securities and Exchange Commission filing detailing Berkshire s  107 2 billion U S  stock portfolio as of June 30 
Berkshire kept some details about its holdings confidential  The SEC sometimes lets the Omaha  Nebraska based company delay disclosures of new stakes so Buffett can build them quietly  rather than have investors piggyback on him before he finishes 
The filing Friday indicated that only a small percentage of the  3 09 billion of stock that Berkshire bought in the quarter went to companies it already owned 
Berkshire held 8 51 million shares of Charter worth  1 46 billion June 30  up from 5 98 million shares March 31 
It also confirmed its purchase of 20 million shares  or 8 7 percent  of paintmaker Axalta Coating Systems Ltd  from controlling shareholder  Carlyle Group   NASDAQ CG  LP 
Berkshire reported lower stakes in conglomerate Chicago Bridge   Iron Co   media company Viacom Inc  and Wabco Holdings Inc   which sells braking and suspension systems for commercial vehicles 
It swapped most of what was once a much larger Phillips 66 stake for a chemicals business in February 2014 
Friday s filing did not disclose who made which Berkshire investments  Smaller investments are frequently made by Todd Combs and Ted Weschler  who may eventually succeed Buffett as chief investment officers 
Combs invested in Precision Castparts before Berkshire said Monday it would buy the aerospace partsmaker  The transaction valued that company at  32 3 billion  Other prominent investors such as Davis Selected Advisers and Jana Partners bought Precision Castparts during the quarter 
 Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    Co  remained Berkshire s biggest stock holding  Kraft Heinz Co  became Berkshire s second biggest holding last month  when H J  Heinz Co  bought Kraft Foods Group Inc  NASDAQ KHC   That transformed Berkshire s 52 5 percent stake in Heinz into a 26 9 percent stake in Kraft Heinz

129361,350876,CHTR,Exclusive  FCC poised to side with Verizon  AT T in airwaves spat ,news,"By Alina Selyukh WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  telecoms regulators are leaning toward rejecting a T Mobile U S  Inc  N TMUS  request that more airwaves be set aside for smaller wireless companies like itself to bid on during a government auction next year  according to people familiar with the matter  Such a decision  which could be finalized in coming weeks  would end months of speculation and vigorous lobbying by the nation s No  4 cellular operator  which wants the Federal Communications Commission to further limit how much spectrum dominant U S  carriers  Verizon Communications  Inc  N VZ  and AT T Inc  N T  can buy in the auction  The FCC voted last year to restrict the participation of Verizon and AT T in the 2016 spectrum sale by reserving a piece of each market s airwaves for non dominant carriers  but not to the extent sought by T Mobile  The vote was something of a compromise among the FCC s Democrats  who wanted to give smaller carriers a leg up but also to ensure that restrictions on the big carriers would not cut the proceeds of the auction  expected to be the agency s largest  Though no recommendation has yet been prepared and the deliberations could still shift  the FCC staff s current thinking is that an adequate amount of spectrum has already been set aside for smaller carriers  according to the people familiar with the matter   Regardless  FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel  often the FCC s swing vote in the three member Democratic majority  appears disinclined to revisit the current plan  those and other people also said  All sources spoke anonymously because the matter is not yet public  FCC spokesman Neil Grace said the FCC staff are working on various auction related matters   At this time  that preparatory work is active  remains ongoing  and no decisions have been made   For its part  T Mobile is confident that the FCC  will do the right thing by consumers in this auction and make sure AT T and Verizon don t further consolidate their control over wireless access to the Internet   Andy Levin  T Mobile s senior vice president of government affairs  said in a statement  The auction will be a landmark one for the U S  wireless industry as it will give participants their first chance since 2008 to buy low frequency airwaves  highly prized for their ability to carry heavy data over long distances and through obstacles such as buildings   That capability makes them particularly attractive for companies trying to satisfy growing consumer demand for data guzzling devices and applications  Last year s FCC vote largely limits Verizon and AT T  which the telecoms watchdog estimates control almost two thirds of the low band spectrum across the country  The resulting rules reserve up to 30 megahertz  or less than half  of the spectrum in each market for non nationwide carriers or companies with less than one third of low band spectrum there  such as Sprint Corp  N S  and T Mobile  T Mobile  in a recently formed coalition with Sprint  Dish Network Corp  O DISH  and advocacy and trade groups  has been pushing the FCC to raise that reserve to 40 megahertz  or at least half of the spectrum  arguing that larger blocks of frequencies are critical for them to compete with bigger rivals  Cable broadband company  Charter Communications  Inc  O CHTR  has made a similar request to the coalition s  according to a regulatory filing disclosed this week  AT T and Verizon have fought against the proposed change  Another FCC airwave auction in January raised more than  40 billion  setting a record and showcasing the wireless industry s hunger for spectrum  That auction surprised investors with a strong showing by Dish  whose partners scooped up  13 billion worth of spectrum  AT T and Verizon spent the most in the sale  more than  18 billion and  10 billion  respectively

129363,350878,CHTR,Dish  T Mobile US talk merger  wireless spectrum a key factor,news,By Greg Roumeliotis  Alina Selyukh and Malathi Nayak NEW YORK WASHINGTON  Reuters    Just four months ago  T Mobile US Inc Chief Executive John Legere warned consumers that results of a U S  airwaves auction  should scare the hell out of you  because winning bids by Dish Network Corp and bigger phone companies threatened competition  Now Legere is in talks to merge T Mobile US Inc  N TMUS  and Dish Network Corp  O DISH   said a source familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss the confidential negotiations  A decisive factor is how the partners would use the spectrum Dish has been buying up over the years  T Mobile would leapfrog its biggest rivals  Verizon Communications  Inc  N VZ  and AT T Inc  N T  to have the second largest stash of airwaves behind the No  3 provider Sprint Corp  N S   which has struggled to build out networks  said Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner  who saw irony in the merger talks   Everybody is an opponent until you re bedmates   said Entner    Dish CEO  Charlie Ergen went and bought spectrum like there s no tomorrow because there is no tomorrow without spectrum   Dish and T Mobile have in the past entertained a potential deal  which would be the latest in a wave of tie ups in the telecom and pay TV industries as companies look to offer more services for customers   Earlier this year  Ergen said he was  impressed  by the wireless carrier and Legere said it made sense for his company to team up with Dish  The satellite provider could offer up to  40 per share in cash and stock for T Mobile  according to an early estimate by Macquarie analyst Amy Yong  The merger talks are at an early stage and important aspects such as a price and structure have yet to be determined  the source said  Ergen has in the past walked away from other deals at the last minute  Dish in recent years has amassed spectrum  radio frequencies that carry the growing amounts of data flowing through devices  without building out infrastructure to offer its own wireless service  The company recently launched an online streaming video service  Sling TV  to offset the loss of pay TV subscribers  T Mobile has recently turned around years of subscriber losses with cut price deals  marketing and wireless plans  but customer gains have pressured the carrier s margins  T Mobile has also been reported as looking to buy spectrum from smaller rivals   You can never have enough spectrum given the explosion of data growth and where the market is going with over the top   S P Capital IQ analyst Angelo Zino said  In the auction that Legere complained about in a February blog post  Dish partnered with small companies that may still qualify for  3 billion in discounts to win some  13 billion worth of spectrum   This  added insult to injury   Legere said   The FCC s rules actually allowed companies that don t provide wireless service at all to buy up huge amounts of spectrum and sit on it for 10 years   As partners  Dish would offer T Mobile access to new mid band frequency spectrum  which can bear heavy data  as well as some low frequency airwaves  prized for their ability to carry heavy wireless traffic longer distances and through obstacles such as buildings  Dish rose 4 9 percent to close at  74 25 on Nasdaq  and T Mobile ended 2 6 percent higher at  39 34  T Mobile s majority owner Deutsche Telekom  DE DTEGn  closed up 2 38 percent  Representatives at all three companies declined to comment  Deutsche Telekom  which owns about 66 percent of T Mobile  has stated interest in partnerships to strengthen its U S  business after failing to sell it last year   Regulators  concerns about shrinking to three the number of nationwide carriers prompted Sprint to drop its bid for T Mobile  French operator  Iliad  SA  PA ILD  also abandoned its attempt to buy T Mobile last October  But Gene Kimmelman  president of the Public Knowledge interest group and a veteran of the Justice Department s Antitrust Division  said a Dish T Mobile deal was  very unlikely  to raise substantial antitrust concerns  The deal would also closely track a pending  48 5 billion bid by AT T for Dish s biggest rival DirecTV  O DTV   which is expected to receive approval with some conditions in coming weeks   Charter Communications  Inc  O CHTR  is seeking to remake the U S  cable television industry by acquiring No  2 cable company Time Warner Cable Inc  N TWC  for  56 billion  after regulators rejected the bid by their biggest rival Comcast Corp  O CMCSA   Dish and T Mobile have agreed Legere would serve as the CEO and Ergen would become the combined company s chairman  the Wall Street Journal  which first reported on the news

129376,350891,CHTR,Newmont Mining  Red Robin Gourmet Burgers  General Mills  Charter Communications And Cisco Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   September 26  2016    highlightsNewmont Mining  NYSE NEM     as the Bull of the Day and Red Robin Gourmet Burgers    as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Walt General Mills  NYSE GIS      Charter Communications  NASDAQ CHTR      and Cisco    

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

  

Thanks to a few Fed member comments  some investors were worried that the Federal Reserve would shock the markets and hike rates in the September meeting  However  not only did the Fed keep rates at their current levels  but they actually lowered rate hike forecasts for the future as well 

So while a rate hike seems likely before the year is out  that could be it for a while  This is in somewhat sharp contrast to even just a few weeks ago  and it is a good reminder that the Fed is going to go low and slow for quite some time 

Market Impact   Where to Look Now

This shift in expectations has led to a nice boost for dividend stocks  foreign securities  and also anything linked to commodities  As the Fed looks to keep rates low investors will increasingly look to precious metals  which is great news for miners in the space 

That is why now could be a perfect time to look at the gold mining industry for some top picks  as securities here can act as leveraged plays on the movement in the price of gold  while the industry rank is currently in the top 50  too  And while there are plenty of great choices in this market  it is going to be hard to beat Newmont Mining    in the near term 

Why NEM  

NEM is one of the larger and more established mining companies in the gold world  with a market cap over  20 billion  Like many companies in the space  it has been on a tear this year  with gains of over 100  in the time frame  But unlike several of its competitors  analysts are remaining bullish on the company s prospects  as earnings estimates have been on the rise for this company 

In fact  not a single analyst has decreased their earnings estimate in the past two months for either the current quarter or the current year time frames  And it isn t like the estimate shifts have been small either  as the current quarter consensus has increased by 20  in the past two months  while the full year figure has gone up about 28  in the same time frame 

  

The restaurant business is a notoriously difficult one  This may be especially true in the burger business  thanks to intense competition and a bit of a burger craze over the past few years which has once again focused consumers and investors on this market 

But after a flurry of IPOs  key changes at behemoth McDonald s  and waning consumer and investor interest in the market  several companies are beginning to feel the pain in this cutthroat market  One such burger stock that has been having a rough time and really epitomizes this trend is definitely Red Robin Gourmet Burgers     

Inside RRGB s recent performance

Red Robin was really ahead of the curve with its more gourmet burgers and it was arguably one of the key leaders in the  better burger  movement  This led to big stock price gains a few years ago  and led to massive returns for investors who had been in the stock for the long haul 

However  the incredible run came to an end in the summer of 2015 and the company has been on a downward trajectory at least in terms of its stock price ever since  In fact  the stock has lost about 39  over the past 52 weeks and it even missed earnings estimates in their most recent report  But that might not be the end of the pain for RRGB  at least if we look to recent earnings estimate revisions 

Recent Estimates

Analysts have been ratcheting down their expectations for RRGB s upcoming quarter and the full year too in recent weeks  Not a single estimate for either the current quarter or the current year has gone higher in the past two months  while at least five have gone lower for both of the time periods 

And the magnitude of these declines has also been troubling  as the current quarter consensus has fallen by over 16  in the past two months  while the following quarter has seen a nearly 20  decline  The full year outlooks aren t much better  as they have fallen by about 7 7  for the full year and over 8 7  for the following one  suggesting that more pain could be ahead for RRGB

129402,350917,CHTR,Strong Growth Potential For U S  Telecom Industry,opinion,"The U S  telecommunications industry witnessed considerable growth in the first half of 2016  On average  the stock price of four major national wireless carriers were up nearly 22   the stock price of five leading regional wireline operators surged over 39  and the top three pay TV operators saw their stock price up 12 47    The benchmark S P 500 index was up a meager 4 3  during the same time period   We believe the industry is likely to maintain this momentum through 2016 
The telecommunications industry is continually changing at rapid speed  This industry has lately emerged as an intensely contested space where success thrives largely on technical superiority  the quality of services and scalability  Cut throat pricing competition may strain margins 
Wireless carriers persistently compete for customers and spectrum  contending with each other and with potential new entrants such as cable MSOs  multi service operators  and tech behemoths  Wireless operators are increasingly turning to content as a way of differentiating their services  As demand for data is growing by the day  cell tower operators become a major link in the wireless capacity chain  Nevertheless  uninterrupted advancement in telecom technologies has helped telecom operators and equipment manufacturers adopt newer business models in order to boost revenues 
Wireless Services Remain Key
Wireless network strength is the key to future growth of the overall telecom industry  As wireless networks run on radio frequency  spectrums  airwaves  have logically become the most sought after asset in the industry  Spectrum auctions conducted by the U S  Federal Communications Commission  FCC  from time to time will significantly boost network capacity  The FCC had concluded an Advanced Wireless Servies 3  AWS 3  spectrum auction in Jan 2015  accumulating a record breaking  44 89 billion  Recently  the FCC started a conducting auction of 600 MHz low band wireless spectrums 
Upcoming 5G Wireless Technology
Several industry researchers hold that fifth generation  5G  network will provide a download speed of 1 Gbps  gigabit per second   which is 200 times the throughput of the currently available standard 4G LTE network  Latency period of data delivery will be in single milliseconds  Further  5G technology is designed to be more power efficient than any other standard wireless networks available at the moment  Naturally  5G enabled mobile devices are likely to last much longer than their 3G or 4G counterparts 
According to the research firm ABI Research  5G network deployment is expected to escalate after 2020 and its market size may reach  247 billion globally by 2025  North America  Asia Pacific  and Western Europe will be the three regions that will pioneer 5G network deployment 
As per a report from the research firm iGR  U S  telecom operators will spend around  104 billion during 2015 25 to upgrade their existing 4G networks to 5G standards and thereafter  implement full installation of 5G wireless services  Consequently  telecom infrastructure developers will have enormous potential for growth 
In July 2016  in a landmark voting  the FCC unanimously decided to make available high frequency radio spectrums  above 24 GHz  for the use of the upcoming 5G wireless network  With this  the U S  becomes the first country in the world to identify and open up a significant amount of spectrum suitable for the ultra fast 5G mobile standard 
The U S  telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ    VZ  achieved a milestone in the same month as it became the first company in the world to issue an initial radio specification for the upcoming 5G wireless network  The industry wide standardization specification by the 3GPP is likely to be ready in June 2018  Verizon  with its efforts to deploy 5G wireless network  seems to be far ahead of the others 
AT T Inc  NYSE T    T  and T Mobile US Inc   TMUS  have sought FCC approval for a millimeter wave radio test license to conduct a test run of 5G wireless standards  Leading mobile chipset manufacturer Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc   QCOM  is working rigorously to develop chipsets for the 5G mobile standard 
IoT to Drive Telecom Industry Growth
The  Internet of Things   IoT   which enables any physical electronic device with a valid IP address to transfer data seamlessly over a wireless network  is quickly gaining significant market traction and bringing about fundamental changes in business models  According to a recent report by research firm International Data Corporation  IDC   spending on IoT in the U S  alone is projected to grow at a 16 1  compound annual growth rate  CAGR  between 2015 and 2019 to reach nearly  357 billion 
Next generation superfast wireless networks  4G LTE  LTE A  upcoming 5G  will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry  In this context  IoT holds potential to be the number one factor in driving future growth in the space  IoT is a network of physical objects embedded with electronics  software  sensors and connectivity that facilitates it to achieve greater value and service by exchanging data with other connected devices 
At present  deploying innovative connectivity platforms to deliver seamless  fully integrated mobile communication with global networking has become essential for the success of wireless service providers   Massive growth of 4G LTE  Long Term Evolution  and LTE A  Advanced  networks across the globe will lead the smooth transition from 4G to the upcoming 5G network standard  Superfast 5G mobile networks will be of utmost necessity in managing the exponential growth of IoT 
Mobile Video Business Gaining Traction
Internet TV is gradually gaining a strong foothold in the U S  The legacy pay TV industry in the country has been under severe challenge from online video streaming service providers  The low cost over the top video streaming service has resulted in massive cord cutting that is currently threatening the pay TV business model 
Internet TV has emerged as a strong alternative to counter this competitive threat  At present  the web based digital media market is growing swiftly  The digital media brands are progressively gaining significant market traction especially among the young generation  With demand for smartphones and tablets on the rise  target customers are increasingly watching videos online  preferring them over costlier legacy pay TV connections 
Gradually  more customers are using the Internet to watch video  and they want mobility of their content  This provides wireless operators an opportunity to differentiate their products by offering access to selected content through their networks  By making deals directly with content developers  the wireless carriers are trying to entice customers with  bundles  of content such as streaming entertainment or sporting events  possibly with no additional data charges 
Online Digital Advertisement  The New Growth Driver
Advertisement on the mobile video platform is gradually leaning from simple selling of banner ads on the mobile web to automated or programmatic ad selling  Pay TV operators are steadily adopting the data driven advertising technique that is already popular in the web based advertisement arena  To derive maximum synergy from the combined video content and video distribution platform  these companies are extensively penetrating into the advertising technology market 
Inclusions of dynamic ad insertion  targeted audience advertising and data driven TV advertisements are all steps towards the same objective  According to market research company eMarketer  the global mobile ad market value is expected to reach  133 7 billion by 2017 
Mergers and Acquisitions to Continue
Mergers and acquisitions  M A  are not uncommon in the U S  telecom industry  despite strict regulations enforced by the FCC to put a check on monopolistic practices  Telecom and pay TV operators often join forces to provide better and attractive bundled products to their customers  In order to stay ahead of competition  existing players need to be constantly on their toes to introduce innovative products or merge with other companies  In the near future  the U S  telecom industry is expected to witness further mergers and acquisitions along with product diversifications 
Recently cable MSO Charter Communications Inc  NASDAQ CHTR    CHTR  acquired Time Warner Cable and Bright House LLC  Verizon has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire core business assets of Yahoo  Inc  NASDAQ YHOO    YHOO   In addition  the wireless operator has acquired Telogis Inc  and has decided to takeover Fleetmatics Group plc to diversify in the M2M communications field  In Feb 2016  Verizon entered into a definitive agreement to buy XO Communications Inc  s dark fiber optic network 
Expansion of Fiber Optic Network
The fiber optic network is increasingly becoming the most sought after technology for secure and fast data transmission over long distances  Going forward  the wireline industry will largely evolve around fiber based superfast gigabit data transmission network 
In this regard  Verizon has decided to launch a fiber to the premises  FTTP  network for both residential and business customers to deliver an exceptional 10 Gbps  gigabit per second  of upload and download speeds  Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Inc  s  GOOGL  fiber network currently offers 1 Gbps of speed while Comcast Corp  NASDAQ CMCSA   s  CMCSA   Gigabit Pro  provides 2 Gbps of residential broadband Internet speed  AT T is gradually expanding its super fast fiber optic broadband service   GigaPower  AT T s service offers 1 Gbps Internet speed to both residential and small business customers 
Major Upcoming Developments 
 1  The FCC has started the auction of 600 MHz low band spectrums on Mar 29  2016  The 600 MHz airwaves auction  popularly known as  Incentive Auction  is crucial for wireless operators as the signals can be transmitted over longer distances and through brick and mortar walls in cities  These airwaves will be freed by TV broadcasters who have no productive use for the same  The TV broadcasters had agreed to free a substantial amount of 126 MHz of spectrums for a massive  86 4 billion  In the second part of the auction process  the FCC will resale these airwaves to wireless operators  cable MSOs or tech firms through competitive bidding 
 2  The court verdict on the FCC proposed net neutrality rules is expected in 2016  In Dec 2015  a federal appeals court in Washington D C  took up the lawsuit related to the net neutrality norms  On Feb 26  2015  in a historic decision  the FCC had approved net neutrality rules after a majority voting  The new laws classify high speed broadband  Internet  as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act instead of section 706 of the 1996 Telecom Act  By way of this  the FCC is poised to gain stronger control over the ISPs  Internet Service Provider   Leading ISPs and several other sector participants have stoutly opposed the FCC s decision

129421,350936,CHTR,4 Telecom Stocks Likely To Trump Estimates In Q2 Earnings,opinion,"The Q2 earnings season is picking up steam with various telecommunication stocks scheduled to report their quarterly numbers in the coming days  Notably  the telecommunication industry is part of a broader sector which comprises telecom operators and telecom equipment manufacturers  As per our   the year over year earnings growth for the broader Computers and Technology sector is expected to be down 8 2  this quarter on 0 5  lower revenues  Meanwhile  if we focus on the telecom industry  the forecasts hint at reasonable growth through 2016  We believe that continuous advancement in technologies and adoption of newer business models will help boost revenues for the industry 
Factors to Drive Growth

The key elements that are likely to spur growth in the telecom sector are 
5G Capability  Several industry researchers believe that the 5G network will provide download speeds of 1 Gbps  gigabit per second  which is 200 times the throughput of the currently available standard 4G LTE network  Latency period of data delivery will be in single milliseconds  Further  5G technology is designed to be more power efficient than any other standard wireless networks available in the market  Therefore  5G enabled mobile devices are likely to last much longer than their 3G or 4G counterparts  However  a full fledged 5G network deployment is not expected to start until 2020 
Internet of Things  IoT   The IoT concept is about connecting households or commercial items to a wireless network by embedding electronic  software  or sensor technology into them  This network of devices is a giant leap toward wireless as it will reduce direct human to computer interaction to a great extent  Moreover  connected devices are particularly helpful for research and development purposes in the fields of science  technology and healthcare  This drive toward making everyday objects  smart  may entail creation of new products and services  It is therefore no surprise that many businesses are relentlessly working on bringing about innovation in the IoT space  Market observers recognize IoT as a booming space and the number of connected things will likely surge 30  year over year to 6 4 billion in 2016  per Gartner  The research firm also estimates 20 8 billion connected devices in use by 2020 
Enterprise Business Requirements  As businesses move toward automating the different processes and moving functions into cloud  management of these applications is of pivotal importance  However  not all businesses have the resources to do so on their own  This is where telecom operators employ their expertise in data management and cloud computing by providing Infrastructure as a Service  IaaS  and Software as a Service  SaaS  to help such businesses manage their operations  Notably  evolving technologies such as software defined networking  SDN  and network functions virtualization  NFV  will help boost efficiency for the enterprise customers  Further  enterprise business is now one of the fastest growing segments for telecom companies

A combination of AT T and DirecTV would create a pay television giant close in size to where Comcast Corporation  NASDAQ CMCSA  will be if it completes its pending acquisition of Time Warner Cable Inc  NYSE TWC   the Journal said    
Representatives for AT T were not immediately available for comment outside of regular U S  business hours

129435,350950,CHTR,Exclusive  Iliad in talks with investors to improve T Mobile bid   sources,news,"By Sophie Sassard LONDON  Reuters    French telecom firm Iliad  PA ILD  is in talks with investors to improve its bid for T Mobile US because it expects the parent company Deutsche Telekom  DE DTEGn  to reject its  15 billion offer  three sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday 
Bringing in more investors would help Iliad to increase its  33 per share bid for a 56 6 percent stake in T Mobile  N TMUS   the No  4 U S  mobile operator  said the sources  who asked not to be named because the talks are private 
Deutsche Telekom  DE DTEGn  is currently in advanced talks with the No  3 U S  mobile operator   Softbank s  T 9984  Sprint  which has bid  40 a share   and is expected to reject Iliad s bid as too low  the Financial Times reported on Tuesday 
T Mobile US shares rose up to 2 percent on Reuters  report 
Iliad is in talks with U S  satellite and cable operators including Dish Networks  O DISH   Cox Communications  COXC UL  and Charter Communications  O CHTR  that could be interested in a joint bid for T Mobile as they seek to enter the U S  mobile market  said the sources 
Iliad is also talking to infrastructure and pension funds such as Ontario Teachers Pension Plan  OTPP  and sovereign wealth funds including Singapore s GIC  said the sources 
Earlier this year  GIC and OTPP demonstrated their interest in mobile investments when they agreed to back France s third mobile operator  Bouygues Telecom  in its failed bid for its domestic rival SFR  which was acquired by the French cable operator Numericable  PA NUME   AS ATCE  
Iliad s discussions with potential partners are preliminary and could still fail  two of the sources said 
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Aug  1  Iliad s billionaire founder and majority owner Xavier Niel said the firm would be open to team up with partners   If there are people that want to accompany us  we are open  
OTPP and Charter Communications declined to comment  Iliad  Dish  Cox Communications and GIC were not immediately available for comment 
Iliad needs to team up with investors to raise its bid for T Mobile because alone it would not be able to raise more debt than the  13 billion that lenders HSBC  L HSBA  and BNP Paribas  PA BNPP  have committed to fund the deal  said the sources 
Niel is also planning to put in up to 1 billion euros of his own money and raise up to 2 billion euros via a share sale  sources previously told Reuters 
The Paris based company said a merger would result in  10 billion in synergies and an additional  2 billion in annual earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  
It would plan to hit those targets by running T Mobile  majority owned by Deutsche Telekom AG  DE DTEGn   in a more streamlined  efficient way  as it has done with its challenger Free Mobile service in France  sources earlier told Reuters 
But Deutsche Telekom has doubts about the cost savings goal that Iliad has touted  sources said on Monday  and analysts in the U S  have also been skeptical 
Iliad  which controls about 13 percent of the French mobile market  entered the mobile industry in 2012 and has a history of operating at minimum costs with cut throat rates  Its no frills plans start at just over  2 a month 

The company s entry into the French mobile market sent mobile plan prices down 30 percent and squeezed bigger rivals  profits 
T Mobile US has similarly restructured prices across the industry in the past year  with aggressive promotions that have cost its rivals thousands of subscribers  It reported the industry s largest post paid phone subscriber additions in the second quarter of 2014

129450,350965,CHTR,What Lies In Store For InvenSense  INVN  In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"InvenSense  Inc    NYSE INVN    a leading provider of motion tracking devices  is slated to report first quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 28  Last quarter  the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 14 29  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
InvenSense reported a weak fiscal fourth quarter  Also  management issued a weak fiscal first quarter guidance  which indicates poor demand 
For the fiscal first quarter  InvenSense expects total revenue in the range of  58  62 million  representing a sequential decrease of 24 0  at the midpoint  On a non GAAP basis  gross margin is likely to be 45  46  
Non GAAP loss per share is projected in the range of 5 cents to 7 cents  while GAAP loss per share is expected in the range of 13 cents to 15 cents 
However  we believe that the company s growth initiatives including increased software content  market diversification and new sensors built are the positives 
Additionally  with technological advancements  demand for console and portable video gaming devices  digital still and video cameras  smart televisions  3D mice and navigation devices is growing  InvenSense s chips target all these product categories and hence should experience demand growth  in our opinion 
Increasing competition and uncertain demand patterns remain headwinds INVENSENSE INC Price and EPS Surprise
   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that InvenSense will beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 14 cents  Hence  the difference is 0 00  
Zacks Rank  InvenSense s Zacks Rank  3 when combined with a 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum

129466,350981,CHTR,Charter Communications  CHTR  Officially Merge With Time Warner  TWC ,opinion,"Charter Communication  CHTR  officially owns Time Warner Cable  NYSE TWC  and another cable provider  Bright House  after a mega merger valued at  65 billion closed  This means the customer hated Time Warner Cable name is going away  The newly enlarged Charter is now one of the biggest television providers in the country  standing alongside Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA   AT T  NYSE T   and Verizon  VZ  
Charter calls its cable television and broadband services  Spectrum  
  One of our first major initiatives in implementing the Charter Playbook is to streamline our product pricing and packaging and introduce our consumer facing brand  Spectrum   Charter CEO Tom Rutledge told employees in an email message per a  via CNN Money   This will be rolled out in a phased approach beginning this fall  
This merger was  Charter and Time Warner did face some backlash from Dish Network  DISH  back in October 2015 as the rival   FCC  to dismiss the then pending merger due to concerns of a potential lack of competition in the market  It won its final approval last week from California s Public Utilities Commission  which means Wednesday is the day that the deal actually took effect 
 Charter has somewhat higher marks for customer service than Time Warner Cable  though the industry as a whole is not very popular among customers  The company is hoping to win new fans in Time Warner Cable markets like Los Angeles and New York 
Public interest advocates have doubts about whether the deal will truly help customer service issues as well as fair pricing for consumers  but a Charter spokesman said it will offer a  superior product set at highly competitive prices   per CNN Money 
The company is also highlighting the fact that it is bringing  thousands of outsourced jobs back to the United States   as Rutledge said in his email  Overseas Time Warner Cable call centers will be replaced by American workers

129475,350990,CHTR,Weak Asian Data  U S  Inventories Reduction Lead To Oil Price Rise,opinion,"Oil prices rise
Oil prices are rising due to the reduction in US oil inventories  as well as because of Asian weak data 
Reducing inventory was due to  increasing the activity of processing companies  as well as the production decline in the United States  which helped to reduce the excess fuel on the market     said the report from Phillip Futures 
Some experts believe that the oil market has reached a critical point after the annual fall  in connection with which manufacturers have begun to reduce the level of oil production 
 Oil production in countries that are not members of OPEC  except the United States  has reached its maximum limit and begins to decline due to the reduction of investments     says the report from Bernstein Research  In their view  production in such countries by the end of this year will be decreased by 400 mln barrels per day 
Should be noted that in the focus of the market is the Fed s two day meeting  which will end today  and where it will be decided on the increase in interest rates  If the decision will be in favor of an increase  the prices of oil will fall amid rising dollar 
By 8 55 Brent oil futures gained 20 cents to   49 95 a barrel  while WTI futures rose by 7 cents to   47 22

129479,350994,CHTR,Welcome To Merger Mania,opinion,"It s the year of the mega deal 
Charter Communications Inc  O CHTR  and Time Warner Cable Inc  N TWC  have announced a  79 billion merger 
Kraft and Heinz combined to form Kraft Heinz Co  O KHC   the fifth largest food and beverage company in the world 
Insurance companies Ace Limited  N ACE  and The Chubb Corp  N CB  are getting married in a transaction valued at  29 billion 
And Dell s  67 billion offer for EMC Corp  N EMC  is set to be the largest technology sector acquisition in history 
The list goes on and on 
So far this year  there have been 33 North American merger   acquisition  M A  deals announced with values greater than  10 billion  Year to date  North American M A deal volume has totaled an eye popping  1 67 trillion 
Ladies and gentlemen  welcome to  
The following chart helps put this year s activity into perspective 

I ve adjusted the historical M A volume data for inflation  so the dollar figures are directly comparable 
We still have nearly two months to go before the year is over  and we ve already surpassed the volume levels of 2006 and 2007  Also  the 2015 year to date deal flow total doesn t include proposed deals with unspecified terms 
For instance  Pfizer Inc  N PFE  is reportedly in talks to acquire Allergan  N AGN pa  in a super mega deal that could be upwards of  180 billion  And there are other deals in the works that should be formally announced before the end of the year 
Before it s all said and done  this year s gargantuan deal volume will swell even further 
Indeed  we re witnessing a bona fide merger mania 
Hold off on the champagne  though  Frenetic M A activity represents late cycle behavior that typically corresponds with major stock market tops  As such  I ll make a guarantee 
At some point before 2020  M A activity will nearly grind to a halt  Instead of making acquisitions  many companies will be shedding assets to survive the downturn 
Even companies that are willing and able to do deals will find them difficult to accomplish because credit availability will have dried up  thereby limiting acquirers  ability to finance takeovers 
Get ready  because we ll likely see an annual level of M A volume commensurate with that of 2003 and 2009 in one of the next five years 
The financial markets will be in disarray and investors will be wondering why they didn t heed the warning signs 
Now is the time to prepare for that eventuality  rather than in the throes of the next correction or bear market

In the terms of the deal  Charter will pay Time Warner Cable  195 71 a share  or  78 7 billion  Charter CEO Tom Rutledge will also run the combined companies  which he is currently calling  New Charter  
Time Warner Cable CEO Rob Marcus said in a statement   With today s announcement  we have delivered on our commitment to maximizing shareholder value  
Some investors are wary the deal will not be approved by the FCC because of last year s failed Comcast merger  In February 2014  Comcast proposed a merger with Time Warner Cable  which was denied due to monopoly precautions  However  FCC chairman Tom Wheeler told the CEOs of Charter and Time Warner earlier this month that  just because the FCC s staff wasn t convinced that the Comcast deals were in the public interest  they should not assume the agency is against any and all future cable deals  
Furthermore  Wheeler said in a statement on Tuesday morning  The FCC reviews every merger on its merits and determines whether it would be in the public interest  In applying the public interest test  an absence of harm is not sufficient  The Commission will look to see how American consumers would benefit if the deal were to be approved  
If the deal is approved  Charter and Time Warner have pledged to increase customer satisfaction but improving customer service  which both companies are not known for 
S P Capital analyst  weighed in on Time Warner on May 26  maintaining a Buy rating on the stock and increasing his price target from  170 to  180  The analyst noted   We think  the combined company  will be very well positioned to compete against the bigger guys   Furthermore  Amobi has the upmost confidence in Charter CEO Tom Rutledge  describing him as  one of the best operators in the industry  Tuna Amobi has rated Time Warner Cable three times since 2010  earning a 100  success rate recommending the stock and a  34 1  average return per recommendation 
The analyst currently has another Buy position open on Time Warner Cable from November 5  2014  when measured over a year  Investors who listened to Amobi s recommendation would have earned a  27 5  profit on the stock
