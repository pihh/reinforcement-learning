8218,229733,FANH,5 Chinese Stocks To Keep Rallying  Trade War Wraps Up Or Not,opinion,It has been more than a year and half since the Trump government chose to impose tariffs on the import of a wide array of products  The initiative   taken to promote manufacturing in the country and to curb export expenditure   gradually evolved into a full blown trade war with foreign trade partners  especially China Both countries as well as the global economy are presently grappling with the impacts of the trade war  While the U S  corporate margins have been hit hard as tariffs have inflated cost of raw materials for many products  the China economy has also lost businesses over time  Additionally  aging population  the scarcity of skilled workforce and debt burdens have been hurting China s economy Notably  the U S  exports to China decreased 13 6  year over year in the first nine months of 2019  Also  the U S  imports from China fell 14 4  during the same timeframe  The U S  GDP increased 2 1  in the third quarter of 2019  while China s GDP exhibited lowest year over year growth of 6  since the first quarter of 1992 Additionally  the International Monetary Fund has softened its outlook on growth prospects of the global economy  In its October release  the institution lowered the world output growth forecast by 20 basis points  bps  to 3  for 2019 and by 10 bps to 3 4  for 2020  The 2019 projection is lower than 3 8  growth registered in 2017 The growth projection for the U S  economy has been lowered by 20 bps for 2019  while increased by 20 bps for 2020  The growth forecast for China economy has been lowered by 10 bps and 20 bps for 2019 and 2020  respectively Tariffs That Sparked the Trade WarIn February 2018  the U S  government implemented 30  tariffs on all imports of solar panels and 20  on import of washing machines  Notably  the solar panel imports excluded Canadian transactions In March 2018  the U S  government decided on the imposition of tariffs on import of China aerospace  machinery and information communication technology products  It also imposed 25  tariffs on steel and 10  tariffs on aluminum imports These steel and aluminum tariffs attracted retaliatory measures by China in the form of tariffs on a wide array of products  including steel pipes  fruits  pork  wine  soybeans  recycled aluminum  chemicals  automobile and others Thereafter  initiatives to revise the product lists  the U S  brought consumer products  textiles  construction materials  electronic equipment  automotive parts  agricultural products and other product categories under the tariff brackets  and tariff rates followed In May 2019  the U S  government increased tariffs on a series of China imports from 10  to 25   It also placed some restrictions  some revisions were made later  on export to China telecommunications giant  Huawei Technologies Co  Ltd Few Remedial StepsSince the implementation of tariffs  a series of deliberations between the two countries to ease the tensions ended in no results To ward off some tensions  the U S  government extended subsidies to its farmers  In December 2019  the U S  government reached a phase one trade deal with China that will likely help in easing some tariff related woes  This deal will ease U S  restrictions on import of China consumer goods  while China on its part will increase the purchase of U S  products  especially agricultural products  in the coming years Additionally  the China government lowered taxes on corporations and businesses to ward off some of the tariff pressures  Further  currency devaluation has been done to make China products cheaper Despite the trade war  stock market performance in China has been quite promising  In the past year  the country s major stock exchange  Shanghai Composite Index  gained approximately 22   It lost roughly 28  in 2018 Below we present five China stocks that have performed impressively in the past year and also exhibit growth
