1729,223244,DNBF,Equity Trifecta  This Country  These Stocks  One Great Price,opinion,"Commodities and basic materials are not exactly a popular investment theme these days  Citicorp analysts predict oil is vulnerable to  20  the demand for industrial metals has plummeted  chemical companies can t get any traction  and farmers aren t buying any more equipment  supplies and fertilizer than they must  Of course  we don t invest for today  we invest today to be where we want to be tomorrow  If only we could add some hi tech to the mix  it d be great  And  what the heck  let s dare to dream and say if we can do it with a near 7  yield  we d like it even better 

Well  there is a country ETF we ve owned before that may be just the ticket  the Global X Norway ETF  NYSE NORW   One caveat before we go on  This is not a currency hedged ETF 

If the US dollar continues to climb against every other world currency  our returns in Norwegian kroner will take a haircut when the fund translates those returns into dollar denominated numbers  I may be in the minority here  but I am skeptical that the dollar will continue its meteoric rise  QE in Japan and Euroland is likely to have a beneficial effect on those economies as investors begin to perceive that they may not be such basket cases after all  And  about the dollar  Trees do not grow to the clouds  With oil priced in dollars  either the entire oil consuming world will rebel at the prices they must pay in inflated dollars or we will have to intervene and cool its ascent 

Besides  if ever there was a nation that is likely to enjoy a strong currency when others fail  it would be one that has a  900 billion sovereign wealth fund established for the future of its people  a nation blessed with abundant natural resources in demand for export trade  and a AAA country credit rating from S P  Moody s and Fitch  That would describe Norway  so I m less concerned with currency fluctuation here 

The  1 largest position held by NORW is Statoil  NYSE STO  which I have discussed a number of times in the past and which we currently hold in our growth and value portfolio  STO comprises 16  of NORW and I think that s just dandy  Sure STO is down right now   it is  after all  an oil stock  But if you wanted a rock solid anchor for your ETF  I don t believe you could do better  Statoil is an industry leader in terms of its interest coverage  cash to debt ratio  operating and net margins  ROE  ROA  revenue growth  and earnings per share growth  It sells at a trailing P E of just 10  which I imagine will be more like 15 this year  given the supply demand matrix in the oil patch  It s price book ratio is just 1 2  price sales 0 7 and its EV EBIT only 3 15  which may well be the lowest in the entire industry  even Exxon Mobil s  NYSE XOM  is higher at 6 81  

Further  Statoil may be a company  headquartered  in Norway but its reach is decidedly global  In competition with Russia  it sells natural gas to Europeans  It is a major player in the US with active operations in the Bakken Marcellus  Eagle Ford and offshore Gulf of Mexico  In India  Mexico  my old stomping grounds of Myanmar  and 30 other nations  Statoil s experience in deep oceans and on the Norwegian continental shelf is the company s entr e to joint venturing for deep water exploration  Fracked wells are easy to establish   but have a short life and an expensive tail  Deep water is where the next elephant fields will be found  and Statoil is there 

The 2nd biggest holding of NORW is DNB Financial Corp  NASDAQ DNBF   Norway s largest financial services firm  underwriter  and bank  It  too  has a global reach  as befits a nation that is a giant in both energy and shipping  with offices in Houston  New York  London  Shanghai  Singapore  Mumbai  and numerous points between these 

 3 on NORW s hit parade is Telenor  OTC TELNF   Norway has long produced engineers  entrepreneurs and technology firms out of proportion to the size of its population  Telenor is but one example  It is just out of the top 10 telecom companies in terms of revenue  falling below Nippon T T  NYSE NTT  and Australia s Telstra  OTC TLSYY   but in another measure of size  total number of mobile subscribers  it is bigger than AT T  NYSE T  or Verizon  NYSE VZ  and only slightly smaller than China Telecom  NYSE CHA   AT T and Verizon focus mostly on the overpriced  thus very profitable  USA  but Telenor owns networks in 12 countries and has other operations in 29 more 

My first interaction with Telenor occurred some 20 years ago or so  I was in Italy trying to call back to my office in the USA  Cell phones weren t even available in those telephonic Dark Ages  so I bought two different phone calling cards  neither of which worked of course  and spent nearly an hour in gesticulatory Italian slugging it out with the vendor that sold them to me to get him to take back two in exchange for a third one that  I  selected from his collection  He finally acquiesced when I used two important to know Italian words   Polizia  ora   Then I made the call from the 4th pay phone I visited  the first one that actually worked  and had the pleasure of dealing with an operator who spoke only Italian and clearly had more important things to do   Lentamente  per favore    More slowly  please  is all I could get in before the  7 I d invested in this enterprise ran out  An hour later we flew to Norway 

I still hadn t gotten answers I could only get via phone  We checked in to the airport hotel in Oslo about 10 p m  and I shuddered as I asked the front desk what it would cost to call the US from my hotel room   Two kroner  was the answer  That was the equivalent of about 33 cents back then   No  you don t understand   I said   I want to call America  From my room   She looked at me quizzically and said   Yes  That will cost you two kroner  

Later on that same trip  I discovered that I could put any credit card into any pay phone in Norway and make that same call back home for that same 33 cents  I was forever sold on Telenor  and it seems lots of others are as well  The company has operations in Norway  Sweden and Denmark  but also all over Central Europe and South and Southeast Asia from Pakistan to Malaysia  the prime areas of the world Telenor s strategic planners have deemed under served and with fast growing populations  They also reach into Russia  the  Stans and elsewhere via their 33  joint venture with Russia s Vimpel  and have extensive broadcasting and TV distribution throughout Scandinavia 





I could go on about NORW s other holdings  but suffice it to say they are an accurate representation of Norwegian companies and that nation s entrepreneurialism and innovation  They include Yara International ASA  OTC YARIY   the global chemicals and agricultural fertilizer company  Norsk Hydro ASA  OTC NHYDY   the aluminum and hydroelectric power firm  Schibsted ASA  OSLO SBST   international publisher of print and online newspapers and information  Marine Harvest Asa  OTC MNHVF   which provides salmon and other seafood worldwide  Opera Software ASA  OSLO OPERA   the Internet browser  cloud provider  and more  and Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA  OSLO NWC   which provides what is quite possibly the best bargain fares from the US to most of the key European gateways and which is growing like Topsy 

NORW s average PE is 11  It is currently selling at pennies from its low for the past year  And it yields 6 75   payable only at year end  For us    it s a buy

1744,223259,DNBF,Here s Why These 3 Bank Stocks Might Stop Rallying,opinion,"The U S banking industry  which has witnessed a solid rally since the beginning of the year with investors  optimism over President Trump s policy reforms and rising interest rates  seems to have lost momentum recently 
Lack of any tangible progress on the promises made by Trump and uncertainty related to the pace of interest rate hikes in the future are primarily responsible for the recent dislike of investors for this space 
Further  the expectation of the industry witnessing declining mortgage banking and trading revenues in the upcoming quarter has sidelined hopes of top line recovery 
Finally  lower than expected easing in banks  margin pressure despite the three rate hikes since last December is discouraging investors to bet on the industry  Though a rising rate environment is favorable for the banking system  lenders have not been able to generate revenues due to uneven movements in short and long term rates 
Which Segment Suffered Most 
Given the challenging environment  Zacks medium level bank industry  Banks   Thrifts  has declined 6 8  year to date  significantly underperforming the S P 500 s rally of 11 6
