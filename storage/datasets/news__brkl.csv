23131,244646,BRKL,Jobs Report Paints A Pretty Picture For Stocks  5 Top Picks,opinion,The month of May has seen strong and widespread job addition  with the rate of jobless matching the lowest in half a century  Robust jobs data offset brewing trade war fears and helped Wall Street recoup large chunk of losses  Let us  thus  look into stocks that made the most of the blockbuster jobs report and scaled north Blockbuster Jobs Report Offsets Trade WorriesMay s jobs report made a pretty picture of an economy with opportunities for almost everyone  The United States added 223 000 jobs last month  exceeding analysts  estimates  Such a feat was achieved despite questions about employers  ability to find skilled labor The jobless rate ticked down to an 18 year low of 3 5   indicating that the nine year stretch of economic expansion has scope to continue  Black unemployment  in fact  fell to a record low  The real unemployment rate  also known as the U6 rate  contracted to 7 6  from 7 8   The U6 now stands at a level lower than it was during the 2007 2009 recession Such robust jobs data shrugged off trade war fears  The United States decided to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the European Union  EU   Canada and Mexico  This in turn has sparked chances of retaliation by the trade partners  reigniting concerns of a global trade war Staffing Stocks to Make the Most of Strong Jobs ReportThe latest job additions bode well for staffing companies  Additionally  the Conference Board s Employment Trends Index  was 108 08 in April  up from 107 37 in March  When compared to the year ago level  the index shows a jump of 4 9  Gad Levanon  North American added that  with the economy growing well above trend  and the working age population barely growing at all  we expect the labor market to significantly tighten in the coming year  The buoyancy in the staffing space is further confirmed by its solid  in the top 37   indicating continued hiring and more job opportunities  In fact  the top 50  of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 Retailers Lead the Way in HiringBy and large  the jobs report showed that most of the industries added jobs and workers  pay have risen at a better than expected pace  Industries such as construction and manufacturing have raised issues of shortage of skilled workers  but  did report steady hiring  Construction firms boosted payrolls by 25 000 and manufacturers took on 18 000 workers However  it was retailers who led the way in hiring by increasing employment by 31 000  Such a hiring spree indicated that retailers are in an expansion mode and their businesses are churning out huge profits  And why not  Sales at U S  retailers rose in broad fashion in April as fatter after tax pay checks helped compensate the uptick in fuel cost  Per the Commerce Department  sales increased 0 3  in April  matching the median forecast  after a 0 8  rise in the prior month Jobs Report Points to Higher Interest Rates  Financials GainThe phenomenal jobs report also shows that hourly pay went up by 8 cents or 0 3  to  28 92 an hour last month  In the last 12 months  wages rose to 2 7  after remaining at 2 6  for three months at a stretch Higher pay means that the cost of borrowing for both consumers and businesses is going to go up soon  Higher inflation  in turn  may lead to increased interest rates  Minutes from the Fed s May 2 meeting had already shown that most of the policymakers have agreed that a strong economic outlook warranted a rate hike  soon   Traders in the federal funds futures market are pricing in a 91 3  chance of a June rate hike As the stage for a rate hike is set institutions such asbanks and insurance houses will see a ramp up in profits  Higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer term assets  such as loans  with shorter term liabilities Rising rates act as a boon for insurance companies as they derive their investment income from investing premiums  which are received from policyholders in corporate and government bonds  Yields and coupons on these bonds rise in response to a hike in Fed fund rates and bank interest rates  This enables life insurers to invest their premiums at higher yields and earn more  expanding their profit margins Dollar Strengthens on Jobs Report  Time to Think SmallThe ICE Dollar Index inched higher against a basket of six currencies  trading up 0 2  to 94 213 after the release of upbeat U S  employment data  The current strength in the U S  dollar  however  is weighing on multinational stocks But  small caps have little or no exposure to overseas market when it comes to revenue generation  So  they tend to gain with a stronger dollar  The small cap S P 600 index is up 8 6  since the start of the year  compared with 2 6  gain of the large cap S P 500  read more    Top 5 WinnersFrom recruiters and retailers to

23132,244647,BRKL,These 5 Stocks Make Great Buys On New Analyst Coverage,opinion,Coverage initiation on a stock by analyst s  majorly helps in interpreting information pertaining to capital markets  creating value for investors  Lack of information creates inefficiencies that might trigger misinterpretation of stocks  over  or under valued  In fact  coverage initiation usually depicts increased investor inclination  Investors  on their part  often assume that there is something in the stock that has attracted analyst attention  In other words  they believe that the company coming under the microscope definitely has some value Obviously  stocks are not arbitrarily chosen to cover  New coverage on a stock usually reflects an encouraging future envisioned by the analyst s   At times  increased investor focus on a stock motivates analysts to take a closer look at it However  the average change in broker recommendation is preferred over a single recommendation change Analyst Coverage   Price MovementIt is interesting to note that the price movement is generally a function of recommendations from new analysts  Stocks typically see an upward price movement with a new analyst coverage compared to what they witness with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage  Positive recommendations   Buy and Strong Buy   generally lead to a significantly positive price reaction than Hold recommendations  On the contrary  analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation Now  if an analyst issues a new recommendation on a company that has very few or no existing coverage  investors start paying more attention to it  Also  any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock So  it s a good strategy to bet on stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage over the last few weeks Screening CriteriaNumber of Broker Ratings now greater than the Number of Broker Ratings four weeks ago  This will shortlist stocks that have recent new coverage  Average Broker Rating less than Average Broker Rating four weeks ago   Less than  means  better than  four weeks ago  Increased analyst coverage and improving average rating are the primary criteria of this strategy but one should consider other relevant parameters to make the strategy foolproof Here are the other screening parameters Price greater than or equal to  5  as a stock below  5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors  Average Daily Volume greater than or equal to 100 000 shares  if volume isn t enough  it will not attract individual investors  Here are five of the eight stocks that passed the screen Global Net Lease  Inc    NYSE GNL    a publicly traded real estate investment trust  sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   The company s shares have outperformed its  in a year s time  Earnings estimates have climbed 0 9  for 2018 over the past 60 days  reflecting analysts  optimism over the stock s prospects  You can see  K12 Inc   NYSE LRN    a Herndon  VA based technology based education company  currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Shares of K12 have returned 51 3  in the past year  outperforming its   Earnings are expected to grow 11 8  for 2018 and 13 2  for 2019 Brookline Bancorp  Inc    NASDAQ BRKL   operates as the holding company for Brookline Bank  Bank Rhode Island  First Ipswich Bank

Operator Instructions I would now like to turn the conference over to Marissa Martin  Associate General Counsel  Please go ahead Marissa Martin    Associate General CounselThank you  Andrew  Good afternoon  everyone  and welcome to Brookline Bancorp s fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call  Yesterday  we issued our earnings release which is available on the Investor Relations page of our website  brooklinebancorp com  and has been filed with the SEC  This afternoon s call will be hosted by Brookline Bancorp s executive team  Paul A  Perrault and Carl M  Carlson Before we begin  please note  this call may contain forward looking statements with respect to the financial condition  results of operation and business of Brookline Bancorp  The actual results may differ from these forward looking statements  Factors that may cause actual results to differ include those identified in our annual report on Form 10 K  our most recently filed 10 Q and our earnings press release Brookline Bancorp cautions you against unduly relying upon any forward looking statements and disclaims any intent to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether in response to new information  future events or otherwise Any references made during this presentation to non GAAP measures are only made to assist you in understanding Brookline Bancorp s results and performance trends and should not be relied on as financial measures of actual results or future predictions  For a comparison and reconciliation to GAAP earnings  please see our earnings release And now I m pleased to introduce Brookline Bancorp s President and CEO  Paul Perrault Paul A  Perrault    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Marissa  and good afternoon all  And I m accompanied today by our Chief Financial Officer  Carl Carlson  who will walk you through our quarterly financial results following my comments We reported earnings of  22 2 million or  0 28 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019  resulting in record earnings for the year of  87 7 million or  1 10 per share  For the year our loan balances grew by  434 million  an increase of almost 7  from 2018 and deposits also grew about 7  or  376 million 2019 was also a year of rising and then falling interest rates with a relatively flat yield curve  which actually inverted at one point  We try to position with the banks to be as neutral as possible to changes in interest rates  However  we did experience a 10 basis point decrease year over year in our margin to 3 51   due to that flat yield curve and customer preferences for certificates of deposit later in the year Excluding the impact of securities gains  revenues increased  1 2 million year over year or 1 8   Also excluding the impact of merger charges related to the First Ipswich Bank merger into Brookline Bank  expenses decreased  941 000 year over year or negative 2 4   which resulted in positive operating leverage The work we do serving our customers and our communities would not be possible without the exceptional team of people that we have in place  I continue to be pleased by their dedication  which helps make Brookline Bancorp  one of the region s leading commercial banking companies I will now turn you over to Carl  who will review the fourth quarter results Carl M  Carlson    Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Paul  We had loan growth of  91 million in the fourth quarter or 5 5  on an annualized basis  Loan originations and drawdowns in the quarter was  614 million with an average weighted coupon of 481 basis points  The weighted average yield on the loan portfolio for the quarter was 499 basis points  a decrease of 9 basis points on a linked quarter basis  as the overall yield on earning assets declined 10 basis points to 473 basis points Total deposits grew  101 million during the quarter with growth of  35 million in demand deposits   91 million in NOW accounts and  35 million in savings  money market and time accounts  Our net interest margin declined 2 basis points from the prior quarter to 3 43   while our net interest income improved  695 000  driven by growth in earning assets Non interest income was  7 8 million in the quarter  down  173 000 from Q3  The decrease was due to slightly lower loan fees  gain on sales loans and our operating income offset by a gain on investment securities of  133 000 versus the loss of  116 000 in the prior quarter  The company s non interest expense declined  1 4 million from the third quarter to  38 8 million Including the  1 1 million restructuring charge in Q3  expenses declined on a linked quarter basis  251 000  The linked quarter decline was due to lower costs related to compensation equipment and advertising  Our provision for credit losses for the quarter was  3 6 million  an increase of  2 7 million from Q3  Net charge offs were  1 6 million or 10 basis points on an annualized basis versus two basis points in Q3 The allowance for loan losses increased  1 9 million in the quarter to  61 1 million and represents 91 basis points on loans versus 89 basis points at the end of September  During the quarter  non accrual loans declined  2 2 million to  19 5 million  representing 29 basis points of total loans and repossessed assets increased  499 000 during the quarter to  2 6 million  The Board approved a quarterly dividend of  0 115 per share  which approximates 3  yield based on yesterday s closing price This concludes our formal statements  We will now open it up for questions Questions and Answers OperatorWe will now begin the question and answer session   Operator Instructions  First question comes from Laurie Hunsicker of Compass Point  Please go ahead Laurie Hunsicker    Compass Point    AnalystYes  Hi  thanks  Good afternoon  Just was hoping Carl that you could give us what prepay fees and accretion income were for the quarter Carl M  Carlson    Chief Financial OfficerSure Laurie Hunsicker    Compass Point    AnalystAnd then also  just wondered how we should be thinking about day two loan loss provision under CECL given that there s a little bit of a wider range here with consensus  Just hoping you could help us think about that and taking that down  Thanks Carl M  Carlson    Chief Financial OfficerSure  Purchase accounting was  317 000 and prepayment fees were  2 1 million in the quarter Laurie Hunsicker    Compass Point    AnalystOkay  great Carl M  Carlson    Chief Financial OfficerOn the CECL side  we ve been running parallel for several quarters now  We re going to see an impact of plus or minus 25   A large    it will be heavier to    heavier weighted to the unfunded commitments  so you won t see it all in the allowance  Part of that will be in the reserve for unfunded commitments  but that s what the numbers are shaping up to be  We re in the final stages of documentation and model validation and that sort of thing Laurie Hunsicker    Compass Point    AnalystOkay  And then can you help us think about loan growth going forward  How you re looking at that for full year  20 Carl M  Carlson    Chief Financial OfficerI think we re going to still be steady at  100 million or so a quarter  We ll be plus or minus that Laurie Hunsicker    Compass Point    AnalystOkay  And then how should we be thinking about buyback Carl M  Carlson    Chief Financial OfficerVery opportunistically Laurie Hunsicker    Compass Point    AnalystOkay  Okay  And then just last question on your tax rate  How should we be thinking about that Carl M  Carlson    Chief Financial OfficerWe re estimating    we re still budgeting with the 25   but it s been trending a little bit lower than that  so probably in that 24 5  to 25  Laurie Hunsicker    Compass Point    AnalystOkay  great  Thanks OperatorYour next question comes from Collyn Gilbert of KBW  Please go ahead Collyn Gilbert    Keefe  Bruyette    Woods    AnalystThanks  Good afternoon guys Carl M  Carlson    Chief Financial OfficerHi  Collyn Collyn Gilbert    Keefe  Bruyette    Woods    AnalystCarl just on the loan growth the  100 million a quarter as you re sort of seeing it  Can you just talk a little bit about how you re seeing the mix evolve  and then also how you re seeing loan yields trending this year  And then that just part    one other question that then goes to part two on the NIM  which I ll ask you about after that Carl M  Carlson    Chief Financial OfficerI would say it s going to be more of the same  It s very consistent with what we re doing  I do expect C I to tick up a bit as part of that mix  But then as that grows  we may also see the total loan amounts grow  So I don t see a big change in the mix going forward of where we are now  Right now new originations are going on slightly lower than what our portfolio yields are  So we ll see  And a lot of our production is shorter in duration  so you ll see the impact of that as well Collyn Gilbert    Keefe  Bruyette    Woods    AnalystOkay  Just on that point  where are you seeing some of the best pricing or the better spreads within your business segments Paul A  Perrault    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  Collyn  I d say it s the equipment finance units that get the biggest yields  but that s nothing new and not uncommon Collyn Gilbert    Keefe  Bruyette    Woods    AnalystYes  I mean you re not seeing the dynamic    the competitive dynamics change within that business  I guess that s part of it too  Just as many banks are kind of shifting more to having that be a focus  I didn t know if you re seeing pricing start to compress or spreads start to compress in any of the loan categories because of competitive dynamics Carl M  Carlson    Chief Financial OfficerYes  I think in recent years  it s been a little bit of compression in equipment finance due probably to what you re describing  It s more competitive than it has been in the past  but it still provides opportunities that yield higher than the core banking stuff at the quality level that we like Collyn Gilbert    Keefe  Bruyette    Woods    AnalystOkay  Okay  And then are you finding you re able to    as you look at the growth is this    how much of this is coming from new customers versus current customers  kind of  building their own businesses or building their own mines Paul A  Perrault    President and Chief Executive OfficerI mean a totally unscientific answer to that would be half and half Collyn Gilbert    Keefe  Bruyette    Woods    AnalystGood answer  Good answer  Okay  All right  And then Carl just shifting to the NIM maybe could you just talk about how you re seeing sort of some of the deposit pricing trending maybe where your new offering rates are in deposits and sort of the outlook for NIM for this year Carl M  Carlson    Chief Financial OfficerSure  I would say deposits continue to be very competitive  but we are seeing benefits on our pricing efforts on the deposit side  As far as the NIM is concerned  we re projecting about 3 45  or so in that range for Q1  Last quarter we gave guidance around 3 50  or so a little bit higher than 3 50  for the full year  We re still seeing that    we still have some visibility to that as we continue to revisit our pricing  but we also know that the    we ve seen LIBOR continue to come down and then we re seeing a very flat yield curve at present  So we ll see how long that lasts and if that continues to put additional pressure on our loan yields and we ll adjust on the deposit side  There ll be a lot    there ll pricing in Q1 and Q2 so we see some relief there Collyn Gilbert    Keefe  Bruyette    Woods    AnalystOkay  And your    the 3 50  NIM guide that you had given for the full year  is that including any kind of rate cut throughout the year Carl M  Carlson    Chief Financial OfficerNo  no  That s a flat environment    safe environment Collyn Gilbert    Keefe  Bruyette    Woods    AnalystOkay  And I know you touched on    and I may have missed a part of it and I apologize in the beginning  I think some of the swap activity that you saw  I know that s hard to predict  but any thoughts just in terms of your own internal kind of business development efforts as it relates to that line or where you see the customer demand going in 2020 for how you think that the swap income can trend Carl M  Carlson    Chief Financial OfficerEvery quarter has been very solid  I ve always been very cautious on this and our lending teams continue to pleasantly surprise me and pipelines look good  But I m not going to try to guess on what s going to close and what particular quarter and if customer appetite continues to be as robust as it is  With a long yield    with such a flat yield curve and where the 10 year treasury is today  I would say customer appetite for long term funding is pretty    is not going away and that s how we accommodate that is through swaps so we ll see Collyn Gilbert    Keefe  Bruyette    Woods    AnalystOkay  And then I guess my last question just maybe on    just Paul a little bit more broadly for you as you manage the business and obviously there s something    so much volatility in the markets over the last year or so  but if there s a specific metric  financial metric that you would point to that sort of    you kind of measure yourselves against in terms of where you re being successful or where you re not  What would be the financial metric that we should monitor in terms of how you would be measuring your success Paul A  Perrault    President and Chief Executive OfficerEPS  Our EPS has grown  I mean  it s pretty basic stuff Collyn Gilbert    Keefe  Bruyette    Woods    AnalystIn isolation  Like on an absolute basis  on a relative basis or    I mean    and I guess that points to the fact that    do you try to manage to EPS growth growing year over year more than it did the prior year  Just trying to   Paul A  Perrault    President and Chief Executive OfficerWe ll keep it going north  Maybe  I ll try to answer a little bit differently  Carl is a great preacher around the company about operating leverage and I guess  I d say that if we can consistently produce operating leverage quarter after quarter  then all of the other indicators probably are going in the right direction Collyn Gilbert    Keefe  Bruyette    Woods    AnalystOkay  Perfect that s   Paul A  Perrault    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo  there isn t any singular    I mean  I m half joking when I say EPS  but this is a balancing act of a whole bunch of things as you know and our job is to keep an eye on all of them and keep them all in good stead Collyn Gilbert    Keefe  Bruyette    Woods    AnalystYes  Okay  That is all I had  Thank you Paul A  Perrault    President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Thank you  Collyn Operator Operator Instructions  The next question comes from Mark Fitzgibbon of Piper Sandler  Please go ahead Mark Fitzgibbon    Piper Sandler    AnalystHey guys  good afternoon Paul A  Perrault    President and Chief Executive OfficerHi  Mark Carl M  Carlson    Chief Financial OfficerHi  Mark Mark Fitzgibbon    Piper Sandler    AnalystI was curious first that the provision was quite a bit higher than I anticipated this quarter especially given you guys have really strong credit quality and had relatively modest charge offs and loan growth  I would ve thought it would have been a lower number  And so  I m just curious as to    was there something else there that was unique that caused you  sort of  bump up the provision to the level it was Carl M  Carlson    Chief Financial OfficerI would say  first start with the charge offs right since the charge offs were a little bit higher at  1 6 million  We had loan growth of  90 million yet  we had reserved coverage for that as well  And then  you have whatever activities that s going on with you truing up all your loss factors and things of that nature that go into it  And then of course  there s risk migration  See  I think we probably have a few more credits get    the risk ratings go down versus up  So  you go through this process throughout the quarter  throughout the year that loans give Paul A  Perrault    President and Chief Executive OfficerThat s a great observation  Mark  I mean  it was for us  yes probably a little bit more in there than normal in the fourth quarter  a little more noise than we typically will have  But we don t see it as anything trending Mark Fitzgibbon    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay Carl M  Carlson    Chief Financial OfficerYou saw our comps go up by 2 basis points  yes Mark Fitzgibbon    Piper Sandler    AnalystAnd then on the expense front  you guys looked like you made some good progress on cost there this quarter  Is that sustainable absent sort of the normal first quarter uptick you have related to a variety of small items or    just curious as to your thoughts on expense growth for 2020 Carl M  Carlson    Chief Financial OfficerYes  I thought I would say    so a couple of things to keep in mind  We are    a few things to keep in mind  let s put it that way  The FDIC  we had some relief on FDIC insurance that you really saw in the third and fourth quarters  So  you ll have that expense coming back in the first quarter  Like you said already on the employee benefits and taxes and things like that nature you usually get a pop associated with that in the first quarter  And that s    those are probably the big things that would be driving that  As you know we re also working on the First Ipswich consolidation into Brookline Bank  that will happen in February  so we ll see some benefit of that  But that you really won t    start really seeing the benefit of that into Q2  You ll see some of it in Q1  but most of that in Q2 And we re just very focused on costs as well    as Paul mentioned as long as revenues are growing we have no problem investing  Where we stop    if we come across a great athlete to join the team we re very open to those opportunities so    but we want to keep revenue growing faster than expenses Mark Fitzgibbon    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  And then lastly  I know on and off there s been some talk of bringing back rent control to the Boston  Cambridge market  I m just curious as to how likely you think that is to come to pass Paul A  Perrault    President and Chief Executive OfficerI d say the odds are against it  There s low level noise about it  but I don t really see anybody at a serious level pushing it at this point Mark Fitzgibbon    Piper Sandler    AnalystThank you Paul A  Perrault    President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay OperatorThe next question comes from William Wallace of Raymond James  Please go ahead William Wallace    Raymond James    AnalystThanks  Good afternoon  guys Carl M  Carlson    Chief Financial OfficerHi  William William Wallace    Raymond James    AnalystJust a quick follow up on the expense line of questioning  Once the Ipswich conversion is done what s the benefit that you anticipate on a quarterly or annual basis Carl M  Carlson    Chief Financial OfficerI think on an annual basis  I was estimating about  2 million of benefit on an annualized basis William Wallace    Raymond James    AnalystGreat  And then last question you had said in response to an earlier question that you will be opportunistic as it relates to a buyback  I m curious  if you were in the market early in January when the stocks sold off  Or if you d be willing to give us a general price range where you feel like it opportunistically makes more sense Carl M  Carlson    Chief Financial OfficerI m not willing to give you that price range William Wallace    Raymond James    AnalystFair enough Carl M  Carlson    Chief Financial OfficerWe ll comment on the first quarter William Wallace    Raymond James    AnalystOkay  Thanks  That s all I have  Appreciate it Carl M  Carlson    Chief Financial OfficerVery good OperatorThis concludes our question and
