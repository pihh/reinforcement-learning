first nine months of 2017  the company s business acquisitions  net of cash  amounted to  2 582 million  In this regard  the buyouts of the tools business of Newell Brands known as Newell Tools as well as Craftsman tool brand from Sears Holdings are worth mentioning  These takeovers were completed in March 2017 The company anticipates Newell Brands to strengthen its tools business through deeper penetration into markets worldwide while the Craftsman brand will likely complement its global tools and storage brands as well as open new business opportunities  especially in the lawn and

    Factors at PlayWe are encouraged by Paychex s investments in product development and focus on boosting sales force to drive revenues  We also believe that the company s expansion initiatives  including joint ventures and acquisitions  are in sync with its long term growth strategy One of the key secular growth drivers for Paychex is demand for outsourcing  Human Resource Services outsourcing is a large  less than half penetrated market that offers significant cost cutting potential  Moreover  growing regulatory burden on small companies underscores the increasing need for outsourcing non core activities The company continues to capitalize on this opportunity by regularly introducing new products and services for upselling and moving into the mid market  which should boost results in the to be reported quarter Going further  we are optimistic that Paychex might witness growth by successfully cross selling newer products such as Paychex Premier  Major Market Services  MMS  and ancillary HRS products such as 401 k  record keeping  health insurance sales and workers  compensation administration to the existing client base  This strategy is likely to positively impact the company s fiscal first quarter results However  sluggish economic growth and a possible rise in interest rates remain concerns  Moreover  intense competition in the outsourcing space from major players like Automated Data Processing Inc    NASDAQ ADP   and Insperity could add to its woes Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Paychex will beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 57 cents  Hence  the difference is 0 00  Zacks Rank  Paychex carries a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However a 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of stocks that you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases Actuant Corporation   NYSE ATU   with Earnings ESP of  3 45  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  Carnival  LON CCL  Corporation   NYSE CCL   with Earnings ESP of  0 53  and a Zacks Rank  3 Confidential from ZacksBeyond this Analyst Blog  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ",2016-09-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/paychex-(payx)-to-report-q1-earnings:-what's-in-the-cards-200155543,200155543

Why Should You Shun Actaunt   
Dismal energy market conditions have been affecting revenues and margins of several machinery or heavy equipment companies like Actuant  The company s fiscal fourth quarter 2016 revenues and margins fell short of their respective year ago tallies  by 8 2  and 18 9

Why Hold 
Actuant aims to enhance its profitability by undertaking tight cost management initiatives  The company s unique business model primarily emphasizes on lucrative innovation and growth projects  Also  the company s ongoing restructuring actions and accelerating lean production efforts are estimated to be conducive to growth in the near term Moreover  Actuant is trying to reinforce its business via strategic acquisitions  For instance  the FourQuest Energy buyout  completed in Mar 2016  has been driving the company s energy business revenues  Notably  the company undertakes strategic capital deployment programs  supported by its healthy free cash flow generation However  the benefits generated by the above mentioned positive aspects might be partially offset by certain headwinds  For instance  weak prices of energy resources  like oil  are currently affecting the revenues generated by Actuant  The company projects to experience a core sales fall of roughly 14 16  in first quarter fiscal 2017 In addition  each business segment of Actuant faces tough competition  Extensive business rivalry increases the bargaining power of customers and thus  exposes it to risks of market share loss  Moreover  the appreciating U S  currency is raising the competitive power of the smaller companies operating in low cost nations  thereby increasing revenue and margin loss risks for Actuant The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock has remained unchanged for fiscal 2017 and 2018  in the last 60 days ACTUANT CORP Price and Consensus

34874,256389,EPAC,Actuant  ATU  Q3 Earnings And Revenues Beat  Decline Y Y,opinion,Premium diversified machinery company Actuant Corporation   NYSE ATU   reported better than expected third quarter fiscal 2016 results Quarterly earnings of 40 cents per share plunged 36 5  year over year but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents  Higher revenues and greater operational efficiency drove the company s quarterly earnings higher Revenues  Costs and MarginsActuant s net revenue of  305 3 million dipped 4 6  year over year but were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  295 million  The quarterly sales were supported by the latest tuck in acquisition made in the Hydratight business  However  the upside was limited by weakness in the upstream oil   gas  general industrial and agricultural markets The company s cost of sales was  197 8 million in the quarter  down 1 8  year over year  Gross margin decreased 180 basis points  bps  to 35 2   Selling  administrative and

a year ago  Capital spending totaled  4 6 million  up from  4 4 million in third quarter fiscal 2015 During the quarter  Actuant repurchased 0 2 million common shares for  5 million Segmental PerformanceRevenues from the Industrial Segment fell 7 4  year over year to  95 8 million  The decline was due to poor demand from conventional industrial niche markets and unfavorable currency translation   Energy Segment revenues inched up 2  year over year to  101 3 million  Revenues were hurt by the appreciation of the U S  dollar and weak upstream capital expenditure made by companies engaged in drilling  field development and exploration  However  segmental revenues marginally increased year over year due to higher core sales generated from the Hydratight acquisition Revenues from the Engineered Solution Segment decreased 7 7  year over year to  108 3 million  The ongoing original equipment manufacturer  OEM  destocking initiatives and poor agriculture and off highway equipment demand resulted in the decline   OutlookActuant notes that the currently weak pricing and demand conditions in the upstream oil   gas  agriculture and general industrial markets are weighing over its top line and bottom line  Nevertheless  the company hopes to mitigate the negatives on the back of lower costs  superior services  strategic acquisitions and share repurchases However  the company anticipates a 9 10  decline in core sales and hence  has projected fiscal fourth quarter revenues in the range of  270  280 million  Earnings for the upcoming quarter have been estimated to be between

revision in the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the last 60 days as the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at  1 24 per share for fiscal 2016 and  1 36 per share for 2017 Though Actaunt s fiscal third quarter results surpassed our estimates  the stock slipped 8 8  to  24 67 on Jun 22  2016  due to year over year decline in earnings and revenues ACTUANT CORP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   InsightsThe persistent weakness in energy and mining market has been weighing over the demand for industrial or machinery products offered by companies like Actaunt  Moreover  a stronger U
