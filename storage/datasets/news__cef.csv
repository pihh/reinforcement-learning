34367,255882,CEF,Q3 2018 Tactical ETF Portfolio Update,opinion,"Below is our third quarter discussion of the major asset classes in our tactical ETF portfolio 
Stocks rallied to new highs in the third quarter taking the Buffett Yardstick to a new high  as well  In other words  the value of the stock market relative to the size of the economy remains at a very rare extreme  Only during the brief span of Q4 1999 to Q3 2000 were stocks more expensive than they are today  at least according to this measure   Many other measures  like the median price to sales  show stocks being much more expensive today than ever before  

As Warren Buffett has famously said   the price you pay determines your rate of return   Because investors are paying some of the highest prices in history today they are very likely going to receive some of the lowest returns  The forecast derived from Buffett Yardstick now suggests stocks should average a loss of 1 8   per year  including dividends  over the coming decade 

This certainly compares very unfavorably with the near 3  offered by the 10 year Treasury note currently 

But Treasury notes have not fared well lately and remain in a clear downtrend 

And with inflation continuing to gather steam  it looks like the current bear market in bonds could have much farther to go  In fact  it looks very similar to the period of the mid 1960 s when nominal potential GDP really began growing again  mostly as a result of rising inflation  and interest rates  with the help of an overly easy Fed  began a long period of persistently playing catch up 

For these reasons we remain underweight both asset classes at present  Though  because stocks remain in a technical uptrend  it is understandable that investors might want to  let it ride  for the time being  That being said  because valuations are so extreme even a technical uptrend can t justify an overweight position at present 

That hasn t stopped most investors from going heavily overweight recently  Almost every measure I look at to assess investor positioning is at an all time extreme  Margin debt levels or  as John Kenneth Galbraith referred to it   the index of the volume of speculation   continues to demonstrate that leveraged speculation as a percent of the overall size of the economy is totally off the chart  As the previous two peaks  in 2000 and 2007  demonstrated  this debt quickly becomes forced supply in a bear market  Thus risk to the equity market today is as great as it has been at any time during the past half century at least 

Corporate bonds are no better than stocks or treasuries  If inflation takes off  as I think it will  there s a good chance corporate bonds will suffer from not just a rise in interest rates but also a squeeze in corporate profit margins and a resulting widening in spreads  Even barring such an outcome  the yield curve  the spread between the yield on the 10 year Treasury and the 2 year  is suggesting spreads should continue to trend wider over the next few years pressuring bond prices  and  almost certainly  stocks  

Investors looking for income would do well to focus on the short end of the yield curve utilizing some sort of bond ladder  The 2 year treasury now yields nearly as much as the 10 year  hence the flattening of the yield curve  the blue line in the chart above   The 3 month treasury bill yields 2 19   Spreading some money across those maturities and a few in between seems like a very good way to earn some income while avoiding the current unattractive risk reward equation in most asset classes  It also provides some significant optionality if when that equation becomes more favorable 

While our markets are currently priced for perfection  markets overseas are much more reasonably priced  especially emerging markets like Russia and China  both of whom find themselves at the bottom of the global valuation range  chart below via StarCapital   This is the main reason we currently have an equal weight position in EM  Should they manage to turn technically from downtrend to uptrend we will likely go overweight  Should developed foreign markets do the same we will probably go to an equal weight position there but  for now  they are just not cheap enough and are far too highly correlated to the US market over time to have much confidence in them right now 

As and asset class  real estate  like bonds  is at risk of repricing due to rising interest rates  In fact  there was a recent research report put out demonstrating that the passive investing push in recent years has  in fact  been responsible for a great deal of the extreme pricing in the securities markets and REITs are the single most affected sector  chart below via Vincent Deluard   For this reason alone  real estate could be the most overvalued sector in the market at present 

By far  the most attractive asset class and the best hedge against rising interest rates and inflation is precious metals  Gold  in particular  is an asset class that I believe could very well be the focus of the next bubble that has moved from cryptocurrency to cannabis this year  As the federal deficit widens it provides a massive tailwind to the price of gold  And  for the first time since the late 1960 s it is widening during an economic expansion  though it is already larger  as a share of the economy  today   Should we get a recession it will quickly surpass the peak deficit we saw during the financial crisis  Either way the tailwind behind the gold price is only growing stronger 

And  as pointed out by Barron s recently  the gold price relative to the Dow Jones Industrial Average is about as cheap as it was back in 1965 before it took off on one of its most spectacular bull markets in history  Typically  at bull market peaks in the gold price reaches parity with the Dow which currently trades at over 26 000  Even if we were to get another 50  crash in that index a 13 000 price target for gold would mean a 10 fold rise from its current level 

My favorite vehicle for investors to use here is the Sprott Physical Gold and Silver Trust  NYSE CEF   First of all  it currently trades at a 4  discount to the precious metals it holds in storage  a wonderful bargain for investors looking for exposure  Second  since Sprott took it over they allow investors to redeem their shares in the fund for physical bullion so there is no concern about the limitations of owning  paper gold  or the potential problems in certain ETFs 

The bottom line is that financial assets  in general  remain highly unattractive while real assets  namely precious metals  represents a very rare opportunity for investors with the wherewithal and patience to take advantage ",2018-10-24,Jesse Felder,https://www.investing.com/analysis/q3-2018-tactical-etf-portfolio-update-200350147,200350147

34390,255905,CEF,Brazil s new government buffeted by pension fund scandal,news,By Anthony Boadle BRASILIA  Reuters    The government of Brazil s new President Michel Temer scrambled on Tuesday to distance itself from a multibillion dollar corruption scandal that broke less than a week after he took office  involving fraud in the country s largest pension funds  With the country already reeling from a sprawling bribery and kickback scandal at state oil company Petrobras  the new corruption case could hamper the conservative Temer s efforts to restore credibility and turn the page on the leftist government of impeached President Dilma Rousseff  Police on Monday arrested five people linked to fraudulent investments made by four huge pension funds of state run companies  The investigation snared dozens of businessmen and fund managers suspected of involvement in a fraud scheme valued at around 8 billion reais   2 5 billion   including the chief executive of the world s biggest beef exporter  The coveted appointments of directors to the funds  boards were made by political parties and the probe is expected to spread to Brazil s political establishment  where some 50 politicians are already under investigation in the Petrobras scandal  Temer s office said the appointments were made during the 13 years of Workers Party rule that ended with Rousseff s removal from office last week  and the  irregularities  uncovered by the police had nothing to do with the current administration   The Workers Party appointed the pension fund directors from the moment it took office in 2003 and they were closely linked to the unions   said a Temer aide who asked not to be named   The Workers Party was responsible for the big loss suffered  ironically  by the workers of the state companies who were saving for their retirement   the aide said   This has not even scratched the image of the new government   Temer s government will press for a thorough investigation as it pushes through proposed legislation that will depoliticize the appointment to directors of state companies  he said  The investigation focuses on investments in overpriced assets  including private equity funds with artificially inflated share prices  according to the federal police   The Workers Party declined to comment on the investigation but its president  Rui Falcao  denounced as  arbitrary  a raid and seizure of documents at the home of the party s former treasurer Joao Vaccari  jailed a year ago in the Petrobras scandal   POLITICAL INTERFERENCE Political observers in Brasilia doubt that Temer s Brazilian Democratic Movement Party will emerge unscathed from the new scandal  since it shared power with the Workers Party during the years the fraud allegedly took place  The party has also been deeply implicated in the Petrobras scandal  The state company pension funds  flush with cash  have long been vulnerable to political interference and dogged by suspicions of fraud  said political risk consultant Andre Cesar   The 8 billion reais is just the tip of the iceberg  They have opened a Pandora s Box and names of politicians will inevitably appear sooner or later   Cesar said  Even if nobody in Temer s government is implicated  the new scandal underscores some of the unsavory ties between business and political interests in Brazil that have undermined confidence in Latin America s largest economy   What are voters going to think  We just got rid of one government and corruption continues just the same in the new one   Cesar said   The pension funds caught up in the investigation are those of state run banks Banco do Brasil and Caixa Economica Federal  CEF UL   the postal service Correios and oil company Petrobras  or Petroleo Brasileiro SA  The funds have said they are cooperating with the investigation  The funds  which controlled 280 billion reais in assets last year  have been an important source of investment in Brazil s credit starved economy  now in its second year of recession    1   3 2183 Brazilian reais ,2016-09-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/brazil's-new-government-buffeted-by-pension-fund-scandal-424607,424607

34425,255940,CEF,Big Brazil banks look well placed to ride out economic downturn,news,"By Guillermo Parra Bernal
SAO PAULO  Reuters    Brazil s economy has stagnated and will remain weak well into 2015 but its big private sector banks are poised to safely weather the downturn thanks to a cautious business model that keeps a lid on risky lending and costs 
Latin America s largest economy is in its fourth year of disappointing growth and slipped into recession in the first half of the year  Weaker consumer spending  a cooling labor market and a slide in investor confidence mean 2015 is also likely to be tough 
Modest credit growth and higher default rates may also persist next year regardless of who wins this month s presidential election   the leftist incumbent  Dilma Rousseff  or the centrist favored by investors  Aecio Neves 
All of those problems typically drag on bank earnings  but giants like Ita  Unibanco Holding SA  SA ITUB4   Banco Bradesco SA  SA BBDC4  and state run Banco do Brasil SA  SA BBAS3  could all buck the trend 
By streamlining costs and focusing lending on the most creditworthy borrowers  private sector banks look well positioned to navigate any choppy waters ahead  said Sa l Mart nez  a senior analyst at JPMorgan Securities 
 The question here is  if there s a shock in unemployment or an abrupt downturn in economic growth  how each player in the banking sector will act  how their asset quality indicators will perform   he said   Private sector banks look relatively well prepared to face that situation  
State run banks  on the other hand  look more exposed to a weak labor market that may spark an uptick in defaults and force them to make additional loan loss provisions 
In that group  analysts said the risks look greater for Caixa Econ mica Federal  CEF UL   an unlisted government lender that has aggressively increased lending and charged lower interest rates since 2009  than for Banco do Brasil  the nation s largest bank by assets 
Earnings at Ita  and Bradesco  Brazil s top two private sector lenders  could expand 10 percent or more next year as their strategy of growing credit in low risk segments like payroll deductible lending and mortgage loans will help keep a lid on provisions  Deutsche Bank Securities  Tito Labarta said 
There s another reason to be optimistic about Brazilian banks  Because Rousseff s attempts early in her term to strong arm banks into lowering interest rates and increasing lending ended up backfiring  investors are betting on less state intervention in the financial sector going forward  even if the president is re elected 
She is running neck and neck in polls with Neves  the investor favorite  ahead of the Oct  26 runoff 
Hopes of less state intervention  regardless of who wins the election  have helped drive up banking shares since the start of August  Ita  has gained 10 percent  Bradesco 12 percent and Banco do Brasil 24 percent  compared with the benchmark Bovespa stock index s  BVSP  3 7 percent rise 
During the same period  the shares of these three banks have traded between 7 and 10 times price to earnings  the most volatile such range in 2 1 2 years  according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
Multiples could hit 11 times earnings if whoever wins the election embraces a pro market reform agenda for the sector  according to Barclays Capital analyst Cristina Marzea 
There is mounting optimism that the next administration   regardless of its political orientation   will face pressure to implement more business friendly policies  That would trigger an investor re rating of the financial sector  a decline in risk perception  funding costs and  eventually  in interest rates 
Marzea raised Ita  s earnings estimates for 2015 by 5 percent on Monday and kept them broadly unchanged for Bradesco and Banco do Brasil  regardless of how badly the  2 2 trillion economy does next year 
PRUDENCE
Unlike in the past  investors are picking bank shares as a way of protecting the value of their portfolios during this year s recession 
In general  the view is that lenders are poised to post strong returns on equity  control loan loss provisions and continued generous dividend payouts even if activity slows further 
Ita   for example  posted a record profit and return on equity near a five year high in the second quarter 
Banking executives  however  are sounding a slightly more cautious note in case the road ahead is rockier than expected  hoping to temper investor optimism by stressing that earnings are not immune to the economic slump 
The correlation between economic growth and earnings will only increase going forward  Marcelo Kopel  Ita  s senior vice president for risk and compliance  said in August  Ita  is Brazil s largest bank by market value 
The sluggish economy should drive margins at Bradesco down somewhat before year end  Chief Financial Officer Luiz Carlos Angelotti said in July 
At Banco do Brasil  revenue gains hinge more on faster loan disbursements for farmers than  for instance  extending credit to debt laden consumers and cautious businesses  CFO Ivan Monteiro said 
But there might also be another reason to cheer for Brazil s top three banks 
They face no immediate pressure to raise capital  bolstering share prices in the short run  said Pedro Fonseca  an analyst at BES Securities  In his view  2015 will be a  transitional year  in which lenders must adapt to a potentially tougher outlook in the second half of the decade   namely lower interest rates and more competition 

Fonseca expects domestic rates to start declining again in 2016  hindering banks  ability to charge more for loans  As a result  he sees lenders doubling down on controlling costs  boosting sales of financial services and  as Ita  has done  expanding outside Brazil

34428,255943,CEF,Exclusive  Brazil organizes investor meetings for state asset sales,news,By Alonso Soto  Guillermo Parra Bernal and Tatiana Bautzer BRASILIA SAO PAULO  Reuters    The Brazilian government plans to host a round of investor meetings to market a broad plan of asset sales  a key initiative to help raise cash and reduce a record budget deficit  a senior official and people familiar with the matter told Reuters  According to Wellington Moreira Franco  the head of a government agency to draw foreign investment to Brazil  a round of so called roadshows is seen as a necessary step to advertise the assets and the legal and regulatory framework behind the program  He did not give a timetable nor say which assets will be sold  Still  five sources with knowledge of the plan told Reuters over the past week that Moreira Franco and Foreign Affairs Minister Jos  Serra will lead the roadshows  which may take place in New York  London and other financial hubs  Two of the sources said the presentations are scheduled for mid July  The list of ready for sale assets is still in the making  Yet  interim President Michel Temer s government wants to sell majority stakes in the fuel distribution unit of oil producer Petr leo Brasileiro SA and in power utility Furnas Centrais El tricas SA  and some of the facilities that airport authority Infraero runs  the sources said  Moreira Franco said the program s goal is to help create jobs as Brazil wrestles with a two year long recession and slumping commodity prices  Still  the plan could help Brazil raise extra funds to narrow a deficit that most economists forecast to top 10 percent of gross domestic product this year   It s time to end with the government monologue and start building solutions with our partners   Moreira Franco said late on Friday  adding that the legal and investment framework will be designed in a way that bidders  feel safe and confident   The state asset sale program offers more evidence of Brazil s policy shift since the Senate s decision earlier this month to try the impeachment of leftist President Dilma Rousseff  Temer  her replacement during the trial and afterwards if she is found guilty  has vowed to streamline Brazil s bloated state and open room for more private investment activity  It could become Brazil s most ambitious privatization drive in two decades   Qatar Investment Authority  Abu Dhabi Investment Co PJSC  and Mubadala Development Co PJSC are among the sovereign wealth funds invited to attend the roadshows  three of the sources said  Canadian investment firms and European infrastructure companies have already been contacted too  the same sources added  Moreira Franco declined to give an estimate of how much the government could fetch from asset sales  although two of the sources said proceeds could range between  10 billion and  20 billion over the next two years   Some of the largest investment banks operating in Brazil will also attend the meetings  many of them representing potential buyers  the sources added  In a statement to Reuters  Temer s office said the government  plans to transfer to private investors several assets  stakes and companies  although it is still analyzing which and which others will remain in the hands of the state   Spokespeople for Serra s office declined to comment  Spokespeople for the wealth funds and the Canadian firms including  Brookfield Asset Management  Inc  TO BAMa   did not have an immediate comment  SANITATION  INSURANCE  LOTTERY Temer plans to deliver to lawmakers later on Monday a request to raise a key budget deficit target for this year  which requires congressional approval before the end of the month to avoid a government shutdown  The new shortfall estimate is the so called primary deficit goal  or the expected difference between spending and revenues before debt payments   Brazilian equities  bonds and currency have gained in recent months  on optimism that an eventual removal of Rousseff from office for breaking budgetary rules could usher in more business friendly policies  Moreira Franco noted that the asset sale program and contacts with investors could also help the government resume auctions of oil and natural gas exploration permits  The program will be implemented in phases that will hinge on the ability of officials and their advisors to prepare deals  the sources noted  Moreira Franco said that no banks have yet been hired to advise on the program  According to the sources  the government will first offer those state companies with the most attractive or profitable business models  keeping a smaller stake in them  At a later stage  the government would try to exit stakes in privately held or listed companies owned by BNDESPar  an investment holding company controlled by state development bank BNDES  they said  The Temer administration is considering disposing of stakes in regional sanitation firms  helping them refinance debt they owe to the federal government  one of the sources said  Other assets include state lender Caixa Econ mica Federal s  CEF UL  insurance unit and lottery licensing  the same source said  Between 1995 and 2002  then President Fernando Henrique Cardoso embarked on the sale of mining firms  utilities banks and licenses to operate telecommunications and electricity networks that raised about  78 billion   Cardoso sold 10 companies as well as five road and seven railway concessions  more than any other president in the country s history  Brazil s federal government has 2 trillion reais   568 billion  in direct or indirect stakes in about 77 companies  according to data compiled by Econom tica and Thomson Reuters  Among federal agencies that invest in state controlled as well as private sector companies is BNDESPar  which manages 45 billion reais in equity holdings     With additional reporting by Ethan Lou in Toronto  Editing by Mary Milliken

34821,256336,CEF,Precious Metals  Risk Vs  Reward,opinion,"While routinely following the precious metals as one of many sectors in NFTRH  we have mostly left it alone with respect to public writing over the last few years  That is because it is in a bear market and since I am not a slick short term trader  I have felt it is best to mostly just let it play out to the bear s will without overly active involvement 
But several indicators have us on alert that 2016 is going to be the year that the bear ends in gold and gold stocks  So why not publicly discuss the shiny rock a bit more in anticipation  I am still 100  in line with the value aspect of a monetary metal that is historically sought after in times of doubt about the Monetary Politburo s  Central Bankers   ability to manipulate the global macro backdrop as desired and to positive effect over the long term 
A bear market exists to clean out the excess from a previous bull market and though some gold bugs have a hard time admitting it to this day  the sector needed to be cleaned out  It was readily obvious in 2011 when first silver and commodities blew off and blew out  and then gold got driven too high  too fast on Euro Crisis fears and masses of monetary refugees did the  Knee Jerk  into the metal that was supposedly going to save them from the evils of Central Banking gone wrong 

 This article will not discuss the obvious contrarian signals that are implied by the public s entry into the realm of gold  as the barbarous relic is now  channel busting  up  but shows no signs of waning momentum  We will just warn that at some point  momentum always slows and the market in question  always corrects  at some point  For reference  see silver earlier this year  

I did not predict a bear market  That was confirmed  and well respected  later  But in the summer of 2011  it was obvious that the gold sector was not only due for  but in need of a cleaning  Well folks  that is the good news  We gold bugs have been deep cleaned  buffed  waxed and are just about ready for prime time  hopefully much wiser and more humble than before  The bear market has been a good thing  Period 
I could unleash a chart fest showing gold s long term support and downside risk  individual gold stocks that are already in bull markets and myriad other things  but I want to keep this article compact and on message  That message is that a huge proportion of the risk  vs  reward  in gold is now in the rear view mirror with four solid years of bear market activity  So we will show some strategic monthly charts instead 
The Central Gold fund s  N GTU  current discount means that players are risk averse to gold  almost as if saying  with that juicy 1 4 in interest the Fed just gave us  who needs it   Yes  it s sarcasm  We have long held that while confidence in the Fed remains intact  gold will remain on the outs  But long term investors need big pictures and this is a picture of value  no matter what price does in the near term 

Gold and silver together  Central Fund of Canada  N CEF  represent an even more compelling value case  Silver has been beaten like a rented mule and has led the metals into the depths of despair to the tune of a 10  discount to NAV  where once upon a time silver bugs were confident that a  100 oz  price was just around the corner  Silver now resides at 14 30 an ounce 

The above charts show value  but they also show that the precious metals remain in technical lock down  That is the stuff that short term players manage  sometimes obsessively  I am not sure why  because in my opinion the broad markets are much more manageable and since they are generally  in the mirror  to the precious metals  their fate plays into the prospects for the precious metals 
Here is a very simple NFTRH chart of the S P 500  We routinely cover the US market from many different angles and time frames but again  for this article  let s keep it really simple  SPX has had a Dome over its head for months now  This has generally been our ultimate parameter between the existing bear case  intact  and a less favored bull case that would see a break above the Dome and a  manic up  phase  So far dear bulls  it ain t happening 

Since we are on a big picture theme  let s stick with monthly charts and review another NFTRH chart that is actually just another view of the reset in sentiment that needed to happen on the macro  You remember those  Knee Jerks  running into gold from the Euro Crisis  Here is a picture of any left over US Financial Crisis refugees having completely closed out the fear and angst of 2008 2009  Gold vs  SPX has been sent back to the hell it came from and conventional market participants are back in automatic thinking mode as once upon a time 

That is exactly where you want them if you are a gold bull in waiting  This is another picture of risk  in US stocks  vs  reward  in gold  that is set up to unfold 
Finally  here is a chart that has tried to  quant  an analog of the 2001 bottom in gold stocks  GDM  vs  broad US stocks  SPX   As in 1999 2001  GDM SPX is on a long decline in relative price but with a monthly MACD positive divergence ongoing  The black dotted lines are when we first started taking note of this analog and we recently updated it with the blue dotted lines 

As you can see  relative price is in technical lock down  below resistance with moving averages  nowhere near a bull signal   But if the comparison is anywhere near reliable we are at the point  blue dotted lines  equivalent to late 2000  a few months prior to the bottom  That does not mean the ratio has not already bottomed  it just means that the  comp  did not bottom for good until a couple of months from the equivalent of now 
A bear market cannot end with positive technical signals  Risk vs  Reward in the gold sector vs  the US stock market is now excellent by this measure  But the ratio did not go on to prove it until resistance was exceeded and the moving averages crossed upward  That is why we are now in the realm of positive risk vs  reward but still in a technical bear market 
I want to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and happy holidays of all persuasions and beliefs and a happy  healthy and prosperous New Year ",2015-12-22,Gary Tanashian,https://www.investing.com/analysis/precious-metals:-risk-vs.-reward-376704,376704

35019,256534,CEF,My Secret Gold Investing Strategy,opinion,"Gold has taken a tremendous beating in recent weeks and is now tumbling along at four year lows of  1 160 ounce 

Things are so bad that you can actually buy the Central Fund of Canada Ltd  AMEX CEF     a popular gold and silver bullion investment vehicle   at a 10  to 11  discount to the   because traders think the price of gold will drop even lower 

Frankly  I think that s fantastic news 

Today I want to show you my secret  gold strike  strategy that s perfect for moments like this  You ll get the two tactics you need as a gold investor  a simple test to determine if you own enough gold  and a quick and dirty look at how to buy it 

Here s Why You Really Need Gold

Love it or hate it  gold is no longer an optional investment  You need gold   in some form   in your portfolio 


It is a critically important risk management tool that can help dampen your portfolio s overall volatility and also take the sting out of global uncertainty 

But contrary to what you may hear in late night television commercials  gold has never  ever been proven to be an inflation hedge 

That s not why you want to own it 

You see  while gold is not correlated to inflation  it is more directly correlated to interest rates  And interest rates are  in turn  driven by inflationary pressures and global risk  especially in recent times 

Most people think about this in terms of the stocks  but where gold really shines is in protecting your bonds  You don t hear Wall Street talk about this very often 

I don t have to tell you that s about to become a huge issue for millions of investors when the Fed starts raising rates next year  A lot of people stand to lose a lot of money because they don t understand what I m about to share with you 

That s because bond values will drop as rates rise  Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions 
So you want to protect against that risk  which brings me back to a very important question ",2014-11-16,Keith Fitz-Gerald,https://www.investing.com/analysis/my-secret-gold-investing-strategy-232573,232573
35020,256535,CEF,Market Outlook 2015  Part II  Contrarian Perspectives,opinion,"The big market stories over the course of 2014 were Oil  the US dollar and surging U S  equities  The Russian ruble tumbled to record lows in December  and as of this writing continues to weaken  but the U S market s meteoric rise appears to be unstoppable 
As 2014 comes to a close we asked 10 of the most popular contributors to Investing com for their strategies for the coming year  We received a provocative mix of views and have divided the responses into two articles  In Part I  here  opinions ranged from the macro to instrument specific convictions  Part II  below  offers insight into what contrarians are considering 

Matthew Weller  Euro Bullish
The infinitely quotable American author Mark Twain once counseled   Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority  it is time to pause and reflect   This is  of course  great advice for life on the whole  but it has very specific applications to trading in particular  As of writing  the consensus 2015 trade in the forex market is to be short EUR USD  At first glance  this is a very logical position  the US economy is accelerating  prompting speculation that the Federal Reserve will hike rates in the first six months of 2015  while the Eurozone is struggling with lackluster growth and fears of outright deflation  with most traders pricing in the start of sovereign quantitative easing  QE  program from the Eurozone in Q1 
The problem with this view is that the impact of these bearish catalysts for EUR USD may be priced into the market already  The pair has already fallen a staggering 1 800 pips in the last seven months of 2014  and sentiment is near an historic bearish extreme  The CFTC s Commitment of Trader data shows that speculative futures traders are net short EUR USD to the tune of 200 000 contracts  the most extreme positioning since the May 2012 low  With rates testing a decade long bullish trend line in the lower 1 20s  it s worthwhile to wonder if everyone who was considering selling already has 
As Mark Twain noted a century ago  the consensus is a dangerous place to be  and EUR USD could prove that adage by rallying strongly in 2015 
Gary Tanashian  Quality Miners Will Reward
While it is likely to be a grind until it finds an ultimate bottom  I believe that one of those most out of favor sectors the gold miners is likely to provide a rewarding opportunity at some point in 2015 and beyond  This is not simply because the sector has been beaten down  That is not a basis for investment  The potentially compelling issue is that of an environment seeing global economic deceleration and a lack of inflationary effects on asset markets  i e  commodities and many emerging markets are dropping   This is manifesting in gold out performing most commodities and if as it does so in relation to developed global stock markets  the stage would be set for investment in gold mining companies of relative quality 
The key is not to chase inflation around when considering gold stocks  It is to watch gold vs  mining cost inputs  including human resources and expectations for prosperity  i e  economic growth  the stock market  etc    Gold vs  crude oil and energy resources has been rising sharply  That is a positive in that the mining  product  is out performing a mining  cost   Watch gold in relation to the stock market particularly the US for a time when investor psychology may be ready for a turn as well  After all  when the S P 500 is flying around at all time highs  the majority have no inclination to look at a contrary play like the gold sector  Several macro indicators are coming in line  but gold vs  the stock market has been a holdout  At such time as gold rises in S P 500 units  a new bull phase in the miners would be indicated  assuming of course that gold is still elevated vs  energy and commodities 
Joseph L  Shaefer  Most Attractive Returns From The Oil And Gas Industry
Without question  I believe the most attractive returns in 2015 will be found in the oil and gas industry  particularly among the integrated oils and particularly by using the approach I discuss below 
OPEC has painted itself into a corner  Oil was in moderate over supply vs  demand prior to the OPEC meeting  That was hardly an issue since winter is coming to the Northern Hemisphere  where the bulk of manufacturing nations are  thus where most oil is consumed 
Since OPEC and all other producing nations are now continuing to create over supply  the price of oil has plunged  There is no next move for OPEC  Its members are living in the 1970s when it had the power to bring the more developed oil consuming world to its knees  Nigeria  Venezuela  Iran  and Russia are only the most obvious cases today of mismanaged economies with incompetent or fraudulent authoritarian governments  Lower prices will create at best riots in their streets and at worst  for them  messy regime change with the likelihood of severe interruptions in global oil supply 
Further  thanks to US  UK  Norwegian et al entrepreneurship and innovation  the cost of finding and producing oil is plunging  The question we should ask is not  Will oil prices stay this low   but  Can US producers make money at these levels   Every day our producers get more efficient  every day the cost of keeping shaky OPEC regimes in power grows  They must buy their citizens  quiescense with food  shelter  education and energy subsidies  make work jobs for 10 that would be done by one in the US  graft  corruption  nepotism and baksheesh at all levels of society  and lavish lifestyles for those whose only qualifications for leadership positions was being born to the already in power parents  It costs even Saudi Arabia  which can  pump oil  at  7 a barrel  almost  100 a barrel to provide all those subsidies and baksheesh 
We are playing the likelihood of OPEC s disintegration or descent into insignificance by purchasing long dated calls  LEAPs  on the big integrated oils and ETFs like the SPDR Energy Select Sector Fund  ARCA XLE   This way  we deploy very little capital  gain great leverage  and can never lose more than our small investment  It s possible oil companies will remain where they are or decline over the next two years  Anything s possible  I just believe it s highly unlikely 
Urban Carmel  U S  Equities In For A Fall  Treasuries  Tailwind  Emerging Markets Might Surprise
The consensus expects 2015 to be a glorious year for equities  This is the fabled  Year 3  of the Presidential Cycle  The S P has risen 22  on average in these years  and it has never produced a negative return in the past 60 years     But we think 2015 will end up being an unglamorous year for US equities 
For the past 3 years  equity prices have run up much faster than either corporate revenues or earnings  This makes them expensive on any number of metrics  Price sales ratios  for example  are nearing the highs from 2000  The remarkable run higher in equities has also made investors sanguine about future appreciation  Contrarians take note  retail investors have a greater allocation in stocks now than at any time other than during the late tech bubble period from 1998 2001    
If that were all to the story then equities would be in for a fall in 2015  But the conundrum for bears is that the US economy continues to strengthen and corporate financial results are excellent  November industrial production was arguably the strongest in 15 years and the latest employment report was the best since early 2012  As a result  revenues for US companies are accelerating  to nearly 4  from about 2 7  just a year ago    
So  the likely set up heading into 2015 is one where equity appreciation takes a pause while the real economy catches up  We ve seen this many times before  most recently in 2011  but also in 1984  1994 and 2004 05  Each of these years gained little from start to end but experienced strong intra year drawdowns  The S P 500 has not had a multi month drawdown of more than 10  in two and half years  That opportunity is likely to arrive in 2015  This implies a retrace to 1900 or less for the S P 500  That would reset investor sentiment and valuations and also be a profitable entry point into SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY  
The most widely hated asset class continues to be Treasuries  In a Wall Street Journal poll of big investors  90  said they are bearish on Treasuries and only 5  said they expect U S  10 Year yields under 2 5  in 2015  They are currently 2 1  and declining  Even so  yields in Germany and Japan are about 170 basis points lower  The fall in oil prices is another tailwind for Treasury prices  Inflation is tame  making the Fed unlikely to raise rates anytime in 2015  iShares Barclays 20  Year Treasury  ARCA TLT  outperformed SPY in 2014 and will probably do so again in 2015 
One final idea is emerging markets  The price of these markets has fallen by about 20  in 4 months  The price of oil is the primary culprit  Current valuations relative to developed markets are similar to the lows in 2004 and 2009  Global investors are very underweight the region  If the price of oil firms  iShares MSCI Emerging Markets  ARCA EEM  would likely strongly outperform SPY in 2015 
Tiho Brkan  China Equities  USD  Long Precious Metals  Russia
The current state of financial markets is quite interesting  Central banks have been in full stimulus mode  artificially propping up the financial system for a while now  I hope the majority of readers understand that we re living on borrowed time during the current bull market  however it can continue for a year or two  We have all major central banks especially the Fed and the BoJ engaged in extremely dovish monetary policies  While the Fed has paused its QE program right now  we have the ECB signalling they are ready to undertake QE in early 2015  Moreover  the BoJ recently doubled down on its QE  These insane policies  which were completely unimagined only several years ago  have benefited a variety of asset classes around the world  and in particular developed market equities in the last few years 
Personally  I am interested in investing in equities for the next few quarters as long as the party continues  However I do not like buying high and selling low later down the track  Therefore  markets such as US large caps  S P 500  seem overvalued to me on many different metrics  While they might continue to rally and become even more overvalued  I would prefer to be invested in markets that have lagged behind and appear to be cheap  With that in mind  recently I have opened up a very substantial position into Chinese equities  via iShares iShares FTSE Xinhua China 25 Index  ARCA FXI    The possibility of further interest rate cuts by the PBOC and the current crash in Crude Oil  could benefit the economy and push stocks higher there 
When it comes to other asset classes  I continue to hold all of my cash in US dollars  The USD Index has been through a very powerful rally  Entering into 2015  we could easily see a shake out in the form of a meaningful correction  as many hedge funds hold large net long positions  However  eventually the dollar should continue its run for a while longer  because the world will continue its easing programs weakening their own currencies  As an alternative to the dollar  I would consider starting a Precious Metals long position   via Central Fund of Canada Ltd  ARCA CEF    since they are extremely oversold and edging into their 4th year of being in a downtrend  While the bottom might not be here just yet  Gold at around  1000 per ounce offers great value for the long run 
Finally  the contrarian trade of the year would have to be Russian equities  via MarketVectors TR Russia ETF  NYSE RSX   which have suffered a terrible 2014 for many reasons  including a crash in Oil prices and the ruble s insane devaluation  If you believe in buying low and dirt cheap  this market trades below half of its book value  I would wait until RSX retests its 2008 09 low  where technically a major support exists  This is a great bet on recovery in energy prices  if you believe Oil will not stay below  60 forever  I certainly don t 
Anna Coulling  Look Beyond Traditional Asset Classes and Instruments
The end of 2014 has certainly been very different from the start  with markets refusing to end the year on a benign and relaxed tone  delivering instead periodic bouts of violent volatility  which at times has been off the Richter scale  In addition we have also seen a breakdown of many of the traditional and reliable relationships and correlations  thereby making any forecast of what is likely to happen next year about as easy as trying to forecast the latest lottery numbers 
However  anticipate and forecast we must  because volatility eventually dies down  and relationships reconnect and repair  But where to start  Perhaps we should scroll back to the beginning of 2014 when many analysts and commentators were declaring this to be the year of the US dollar  And indeed  after a very slow start the USD duly started to move higher in June when the Dollar Index failed to take out the strong platform of support in the 79 price region  and so began its current ascent  Since June the USD index has been on an unbroken upward trajectory as it now moves towards the key 90 price point  Only a move through this region will see the USD index re test the 2005 high of 92 
However  any move higher for the USD has ramifications for other instruments and asset classes  not least commodities and emerging markets  and it is the latter and the events of 1998 which are likely to weigh heavily in 2015  For a view of the overall performance of emerging markets the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  ARCA EEM  is a good chart to follow and here the technical picture looks weak longer term  with the ETF having been in congestion for the past 2 years  mirroring the USD index  Any move through the floor of support in the 36 50 could then trigger a deeper move to the lows of 2009 
The prospect for further dollar gains looks compelling  First the technical picture is now building a strong base and provided the 90 region is taken out  we can expect to see a further move to test 92 and from there on possibly even towards 94 70 by the end of the year  In this respect much will depend on the continuing positive rhetoric from the Federal Reserve  With interest rates now increasingly taking centre stage once again  the main beneficiary will be the US dollar  Indeed this could be one of the characteristics of 2015  where the fundamentals play an increasingly important role  particularly in forex markets  with central bank management of rates taking a back seat  This in turn is likely to be reflected in the major currency pairs as interest rate differentials once again become the main drivers of this market with Europe languishing in recession  if not outright depression 
Before moving to other asset classes  the US dollar s celestial twin is  of course the Japanese yen  and here 2015 may be the year that Japan loses control of their currency  2015 may be the year the BOJ takes a step too far in its constant round of quantitative easing  With the 120 price level having now been pierced the next significant level is 125 with 134 50 the next logical step 
Moving to commodities  here it has been a dismal year for Gold bugs with the precious metal declining steadily  punctuated with minor rallies  The outlook for next year is more of the same  with gold likely to move through  1100 per ounce and possibly to test the 2009 levels of  1000 per ounce in this period 
Furthermore  the traditional correlations for gold with the US dollar as a safe haven appear to have broken down  with the metal trading in its own unique world  Silver is likely to mirror the price action for gold 
The collapse in oil for both Brent and WTI has been dramatic and mirrors the equally dramatic fall of 2008  at the height of the financial crisis  The cause of the current fall is all to do with politics and in particular the desire of OPEC to curb the rise of alternative energy suppliers and sources  The fallout from the collapse in oil prices  particularly for the more junior members of OPEC  is already leading to social unrest and regime change  The break even prices have already been exceeded  but we are not at the bottom yet and we can expect to see a further move lower for oil early in 2015  with a consequent bottom likely in the  40 per barrel region for WTI 
Moving to equity markets  the Philippines was once again the star performer  with the iShares MSCI Philippines ETF  NYSE EPHE  returning 31  against the US at 17 9   This is a perfect example of how the media fails to report wonderful trading and investing opportunities in other markets 
Other star performers in 2014 included India  Indonesia  Taiwan and Vietnam and these countries look set to deliver another strong performance in 2015 as they will benefit from cheaper energy costs  Bottom of the list is Russia   which is no great surprise   given the collapse in oil prices and the ruble 
In summary  2015 will deliver some great trading and investing opportunities and may the year to look beyond the more traditional asset classes and instruments

35022,256537,CEF,Jay Taylor  Stay Liquid For The Coming Gold Boom,opinion,"Jay Taylor doesn t beat around the bush he believes the price of gold is being suppressed to support the U S  dollar and underwrite American foreign policy  But the publisher and editor of J  Taylor s Gold  Energy   Tech Stocks and host of the radio show  Turning Hard Times into Good Times  thinks that this suppression will fail  just as it did in the 1970s  when gold rose over 2 300   In this interview with The Gold Report  Taylor urges investors to stay as liquid as possible so they can invest in undervalued companies poised to explode when the value of gold is reasserted 
The Gold Report  The price of gold has fallen more than  130 an ounce   130 oz  since July  Why 
Jay Taylor  I believe we have two different markets  One is an honest market for physical metal  The other is a market that has increasingly become less than honest  The latter is a paper market  primarily in London and New York  and it is used to muddy the waters of price discovery with gold and silver  This paper market price is assumed to be the real price of gold  I don t think that s true 
There is a need on the part of Wall Street  and the ruling elite within the Anglo American empire  to keep people uninterested in honest money and real gold because dishonest enterprises must keep people from knowing the truth  What we have essentially is a fiat currency system that is devised to allow those in charge of the monetary system to profit at the expense of the real producers of wealth  the miners  the manufacturers  the farmers  the inventors  The people that produce useful things are having their wealth confiscated clandestinely by this monetary scheme 
TGR  You have written that  the rigging in the gold price in New York and London is accomplished by a handful of major bullion banks that just happen to be the biggest shareholders of the Federal Reserve   How is this rigging accomplished 
JT  It s accomplished through massive futures markets selling on the Comex and the London markets  It is like a casino  There is a 100 to 1 ratio of gold futures bought to actual gold settlement  We see huge amounts of selling coming into the market at exactly the times we would expect gold to do well  The futures markets are so highly leveraged that a very small amount of actual dollars are needed to drive the gold price down 
The players here  the big banks  have the largest shareholdings of the Federal Reserve  They have access to massive amounts of money created out of nothing  It is interesting to note that  especially for platinum  palladium and silver  a large premium  up to 24  in the case of palladium  is being paid by people in the physical markets of Shanghai  The premium for silver has been around 14   and the premium for platinum has been between that of palladium and silver 
TGR  In retrospect  was the creation of gold exchange traded funds  ETFs  a mistake 
JT  I don t think so  We must distinguish between those gold ETFs that are honest and those that might not be so honest  Among the good ones are the Merk Gold Trust ETF  OUNZ   which allows investors to actually take delivery of physical gold  Another good one is the Central Fund of Canada Ltd  ARCA CEF   which publishes a quarterly audit of the amount of gold  silver and cash that backs each share  The Sprott ETFs are honest as well  and at least one Sprott fund allows investors to take delivery of gold  albeit a larger number of ounces than the Merk Gold Trust  which is designed more for retail clients who wish to turn their shares into gold 
TGR  The rigging downward of gold  silver and other metals would obviously harm the mining industry profoundly  So why isn t the industry complaining 
JT  I don t think the major mining companies understand the product they re selling  I don t think they understand that gold  and to a lesser degree  silver  are  in fact  money designed by nature and not decreed by human beings  They have been taught to believe  by men and women with Ph D s from Princeton  Harvard and Yale  that gold is a  barbarous relic   There may be an exception here and there  with CEOs of major gold mining companies  Rob McEwen of McEwen Mining Inc   NYSE MUX   for example  understood this truth and said it many times when he headed Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG  
The World Gold Council  which is funded by those same CEOs who do not understand the product they sell  promotes gold as jewelry  That is simply  with all due respect  asinine because the greater the amount of gold taken off the market for jewelry  the lower gold is priced  What would really boost the gold industry would be an understanding that gold is honest money and that fiat money is dishonest  A lot of the junior miners sort of understand this  They re more supportive of the Gold Anti Trust Action Committee  GATA  
TGR  How long can this rigging continue 
JT  It s really a question of how long confidence in the U S  dollar can be maintained  The BRIC countries are forming their own financial infrastructure to compete with the dollar  Sanctions directed by the United States against Russia are pushing Russia into the arms of China  which makes the BRIC countries stronger  China is the largest gold producer in the world and has supposedly imported huge amounts of gold in recent years  Also  as tensions with Russia have been rising  that country has also has been importing large amounts of gold  as the chart below illustrates

If we had an honest monetary system with gold at the center  we could not issue endless amounts of money to finance the war machinery  The U S  went off the gold standard in 1971 because it wanted socialism and the ability to wage war without telling the people they had to pay for it  I don t know how long our pathological monetary system can last  but the handwriting is on the wall  As I look at the continuing decline of western economies  including that of the U S   I feel the day of reckoning is drawing near  I can t imagine we won t see a major breakdown in the global financial system within a year from now 
TGR  Capital continues to seek the US Dollar  The Dow and the S P 500 continue to hit record highs  while the headline unemployment number falls  Are we looking at an economic recovery  or could we face another repeat of the 2007 2008 crisis 
JT  I don t believe that we ve had a recovery  If we have  it s the most tepid in history  The number of people in the labor force continues to decline  and inflation is certainly not the 1  or 2  our government pretends it is  The top 1  in the western world have done extremely well  while the middle class is being hollowed out  Talk of recovery is a fraud that keeps people pacified  The large corporate interests in America don t want change because the banks  through the Federal Reserve  can print all the dollars they want  and they now have purchased Congress and the executive branch of the American government 
TGR  How does the present situation for gold resemble what happened in the late 1970s  when it rose more than 2 300  
JT  There is a case to be made that a much bigger rise could occur  The ratio of money being created relative to GDP even if you take the government s GDP numbers at face value  which I do not is much greater now than it was in the 1970s 
I m still agnostic as to whether the economy goes into hyperinflation or massive deflation  After a deflationary implosion  the nominal price of gold would not necessarily rise  but its purchasing power would rise dramatically  If the masses become outraged over the fall in their living standards  we could see money printed and thrown to them from helicopters  I pray to God that doesn t happen  because hyperinflation is the worst of all outcomes  The debasement of the dollar will continue  If this leads to a flight from the dollar  we could see a sudden and dramatic shift of capital from paper money into real goods  such as gold 
TGR  Will gold stocks lead or lag the gold price breakout 
JT  I think they have been leading already  My gold share values are up low double digits from the bottom  I m seeing wonderful opportunities in precious metals equities  These markets are true markets  unlike the fraudulent paper markets for gold and silver

JT  That s right  Cayden Resources Inc  TO CYD  is my second largest holding  The company has agreed to be purchased by Agnico Eagle for  205 million   205M   I was a bit disappointed at first  because we could have seen a much higher number in the longer run  That said  there s no question that a bird in the hand is better than two in the bush  As Ivan Bebek  Cayden s CEO  recently noted on my radio show  the company is now derisked  having exchanged shares of Cayden for Agnico Eagle  which is a very strong gold mining company  Agnico Eagle is one of my favorite senior gold mining companies because it has been very careful about protecting its margins  It s a stock I could easily see doubling or tripling when the real price of gold resumes its upward trek 
TGR  What s Ivan Bebek going to do in the future 
JT  Ivan and Shawn Wallace  Cayden s chairman  are definitely on to their next deal  This was their second success  Their first was Keegan Resources  which is now Asanko Gold Inc  AMEX AKG   I think that investors need to follow the successful jockeys  I m certainly looking forward to what they will do next 
TGR  Which other companies do you like in Mexico 
JT  Almaden Minerals Ltd   AMEX AAU  is one that I like a lot  The company is a project generator  but it has focused on the Ixtaca gold silver project  This has developed quite nicely into a low cost  multimillion ounce project 
The company released an updated preliminary economic assessment of Ixtaca on Sept  3  Its initial capital expense has been reduced 19  to  399M  Its pre tax net present value is now  842M  and its pre tax internal rate of return is 37   The after tax payback period is 2 5 years 
TGR  What prices did Almaden use for its base case scenario 
JT  The base case is  1 320 oz gold and  21 oz silver  I expect a gold price rise would be very positive for the company 
I also like SilverCrest Mines Inc   AMEX SVLC  a lot  because the company always does what it says it is going to do  It started producing on a small scale  and uses its cash flows to grow the company  SilverCrest is going to 3 000 tons a day  and this will increase production dramatically  The company earned  0 03 share during the first six months of this year  but its cash costs fell by 2  to  7 66 per equivalent ounce of silver produced  I expect this company will continue to grow organically without shareholder dilution 
Another Mexican company I like is Paramount Gold   Silver Corp  AMEX PZG   It s trading at only  0 92 share now  but it has 2 4 million ounces  2 4 Moz  of gold equivalent at San Miguel  and at the Sleeper mine in Nevada  where the latest NI 43 101 resource totaled 3 5 Moz in the Measured and Indicated categories  and just under 2 Moz in the Inferred category  This company has deep pockets supporting it 
TGR  Which companies do you prefer in the Caribbean and South America 
JT  I have Precipitate Gold Corp  TO PRG  on my list  The company has good exploration potential in the Dominican Republic  In fact  the company just announced a discovery hole on its Ginger Ridge project  Specifically  it intersected approximately 0 4 oz ton gold over 5 meters  5m  and 0 145 oz ton over 18m  Ginger Ridge is close to the GoldQuest Mining Corp   GQC TSX V  discovery  where a 2  Moz gold resource was outlined  GoldQuest is also on my list  Precipitate is a low cost stock that could evolve into something very considerable  Obviously  this discovery hole improves the odds 
Mandalay Resources Corporation  TO MND  is making money and paying a bit of a dividend  The company has operations in Chile  Australia and now in Sweden  after its takeover of Elgin Mining  I also like companies in French Guiana and Guyana 
TGR  Such as 
JT  In French Guiana  I love Columbus Gold Corp OTC  OTC CBGDF  and its Paul Isnard project  The company was smart enough not to go it alone  Instead  Columbus brought in a large  successful Russian mining company  Nordgold N V   NORD LSE   Nordgold will take it to production  or at least feasibility  with Columbus keeping just under 50   I like French Guiana because it has French law  Columbus CEO Robert Giustra has done a remarkable job  and I think the probability of success is quite high  With the stock selling at around  0 45  I think the upside is phenomenal  especially when the next leg of the gold bull market gets underway 
Next door  in Guyana  Goldsource Mines Inc   GXS TSX V  has the same management team as SilverCrest  and will begin producing gold this year  This stock sells for only  0 20 now  It could easily become a five  or tenbagger within the next year  because it will likely produce gold at  480 oz  Goldsource is going to mine the saprolites only  just taking the low hanging fruit  before it explores for hard rock potential  If a sizeable hard rock resource is found  it will likely look for a partner 
TGR  Ecuador is not a country we ve associated with foreign mining companies for some time  but you re interested in a company there  are you not 
JT  Cornerstone Capital Resources Inc   TO CGP  is a project generator  It has had some phenomenal intercepts at the Cascabel copper  gold prospect  For example  a hole announced on Aug  26 scored 0 4  copper and 0 17 grams per ton  0 17 g t  gold over 958m  An earlier hole scored 0 46  copper and 0 18 g t gold over 597 26m  The one thing I m hesitant about is that its Australian junior partner  SolGold Plc  SOLG LSE   is not terribly well financed  That said  this could be a tenbagger very quickly 
TGR  Which Canadian gold companies do you like 
JT  There are a lot of them  Klondex Mines Ltd   TO KDX   which is operating in Nevada  looks really good for its high grade resource  It recently reported its first profit  It has really turned the corner since it acquired the Midas mill and mine from Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM   It is trucking high grade ore  more than 1 oz ton much of the time  100 miles from its Fire Creek property to the Midas mill  But both the Fire Creek project and the Midas mine have substantial exploration potential  I believe this company will continue to grow its production organically as it takes advantage of excess mill capacity 
Premier Gold Mines  OTC PIRGF  is one of my favorites  The company has three great projects in Ontario and Nevada  It owns 100  of the Trans Canada property in Ontario  and holds a 49  interest in the Rahill Bonanza project  with Goldcorp holding 51   Premier recently acquired a 100  interest in the Cove gold project in Nevada  having purchased Newmont s interest  I believe this is one of the best development companies out there  with not one but three potential company making gold mining projects advancing toward production 
Terrax Minerals Inc  TO TXR   a new entry on my list  has the Yellowknife City gold project in the Northwest Territories  The company is 9 7  owned by Virginia Mines Inc   VGQ TSX   which has increased my confidence level  Management is in the process of pulling together data from some 463 previous drill holes  but what is most exciting is the fact that the southern end of the company s Northbelt property hosts the northern extension of the Yellowknife Gold Belt  which hosted the famous 8 1 Moz Giant Deposit and the 6 1 Moz Con deposit  The company s management team is technically strong and has skin in the game 
The final one I ll mention in Canada is Balmoral Resources Ltd   TO BAR   The company has projects straddling the Ontario Quebec border  It has a high grade gold discovery on its Detour trend project at the Martiniere claim group  located 45 kilometers from the Detour Gold deposit  Also in this group of claims  which measures 700 square kilometers  the company has made a nickel and platinum group metal discovery This is a very successful company from an equity point of view and from an exploration point of view 
TGR  Do you like any companies in Asia 
JT  I am very excited about Novo Resources Corp   NVO CNSX  NSRPF OTCQX  and its Pilbara gold project in Australia  CEO Quinton Hennigh has begun work on a bankable feasibility study for lower grade surface material  It s free milling gold  which should be very low cost  almost like a saprolite in the amount of effort required to win the gold from the hosting material 
Newmont Mining Corp  owns 32  of Novo  and management owns a big chunk of stock  Newmont just finished using its propriety bulk leach extractable gold  BLEG  surveying technology to outline huge masses of prospective land for finding what the company hopes will be the next Witwatersrand deposit  I expect that  before the end of this year  its resource will grow very dramatically  Novo is also going to put down a couple of deep holes this year 
TGR  You mentioned Witwatersrand  What s the connection 
JT  The Witwatersrand Basin in South Africa has produced 1 5 billion ounces of gold  about one third to one half of all the gold ever produced  Quinton Hennigh  who is a geologist  believes that he has found the same kind of environment at Pilbara  If Novo were to hit what is known as the carbon leader that s typical of the Witwatersrand  then I think this stock would be a rocket shot to the moon in no time  I was talking to  about this recently  and Rick says if Novo really intersects that carbon leader  which is deeper down in the ancient seabed  then it will have to stop worrying about putting together a bankable feasibility study and just drill the heck out of this thing 
Quinton has studied Witwatersrand rock and has been developing this hypothesis for many years  Novo is an Australian company  so political risk is relatively limited  Pilbara has the prospects of near term production combined with the possibility of a major discovery  Novo is very well financed  with about  14M in cash 
TGR  Some investors are put off Novo because it isn t listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange  TSX  
JT  That doesn t bother me  but I expect it will be listed on the TSX or another senior exchange shortly  Novo is actually very illiquid now  To give you an example  I probably have more shares of this company than I should  I wanted to sell some to buy something else I thought looked attractive  The stock was at just over  1 10 share when I went to sell  I sold 1 100 shares  and that transaction took it to just below  1 share 
TGR  You have stated your firm belief that the price of gold cannot remain suppressed for much longer  But as John Maynard Keynes reminded us   Markets can remain irrational a lot longer than you and I can remain solvent   Many investors in gold companies have felt the sting of Keynes  word for more than three years now  What should they do 
JT  Well managed companies with good projects and the ability to raise money will survive  Many juniors are not in that position  and will be gobbled up or be subjected to the huge rollbacks that kill early investors  Obviously  not putting all your eggs in the precious metals basket would have been wise  and still is  I do not  however  advocate big investments in the wider equities markets now  because they are long in the tooth and could be rolled back substantially themselves 
Investors should keep some cash and build some cash  I ve sold stocks at a loss to make sure I have cash for when this market finally turns around  There s some enormously attractive junior gold and silver mining companies out there  so investors need to keep liquid  Investors should find liquid companies that have valuable assets and can stay the course  companies with managements that are careful about how they structure their shares and their financings

35023,256538,CEF,Gold  Watch This Level For Support,opinion,"Gold and gold miners have rebounded but remain in a technically weak position  Both markets have failed to move beyond the highs made last Friday  The same happened to the gold stocks in early October  They exploded higher one day but failed to muster anything after that  At that time Gold continued its rally for a few weeks  This time Gold has struggled to sustain Friday s gains  While we are coming to the end of the bear market and one should not be too bearish  the downside target of  1000 oz Gold remains well in play 
2 Key Levels

The chart below shows the weekly Gold close since 1980 and the net non commercial  speculative  position as a percentage of open interest  From this chart we can deduce the two most important levels   720 oz and  1000 oz  Give or take  5 oz   720 oz was the secondary peak in 1980  the peak in 2006  small resistance in 2007 and major support in 2008  Gold s bottom in 2008 wasn t random  It bottomed at an important pivot point around  700 oz  Today  Gold is in a downtrend without any major support until the  1000 oz level  That level marked important support and resistance from 2008 to 2010 and is the next major support 



As a percentage of open interest  the net speculative position is 13   It s low of 5  in 2013 marked an 11 year low  If Gold declines near  1000 oz  I d bet the net speculative position would fall below 5  and reach a 13 year low  That qualifies as extreme bearish sentiment  The physically backed ETFs  ARCA CEF  and  AMEX GTU  are already showing 


The  1000 oz target expressed above also fits very well with history as we ve shown numerous times in this bear analog chart 




While the downside for Gold and Silver may be limited  in percentage terms   the downside for miners could be quite a bit more  With Gold trading at  1160 oz  it would have to fall about 13  to reach  1000 oz  That is not so bad if you hold Gold  However  a 13  fall in Gold could cause a 20  fall in the miners or more  If a gold producer has a  200 profit margin at  1200 oz then he does not have much profit at  1050 Gold  If a junior has a deposit that can earn good money at  1300 oz then that isn t worth much if Gold drops to  1050  Thus  a fair amount of downside potential remains in play  On the other hand  it works in your favor if you buy very low and Gold recovers 
Almost Done

In any event  the bear market is very close to its end  The weeks and months ahead figure to be enticing and exciting for precious metals traders and investors  Expect quite a bit of day to day volatility as we see forced liquidation and occasional short covering  Opportunities are fast approaching so pay attention  Be patient but be disciplined  As winter beckons we could be looking at a lifetime buying opportunity  I am working hard to prepare subscribers ",2014-11-14,"Jordan Roy-Byrne, CMT",https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold:-watch-this-level-for-support-232530,232530

35057,256572,CEF,Stocks Versus Gold  3 Years On,opinion,"Chart 1  Three years ago  in August  11 Gold peaked and US stocks bottomed


 Source  Stock Charts  edited by Short Side of Long 
With only two weeks left in August 2014  I thought it was appropriate to revisit an interesting inflection point that occurred exactly three years ago  During August 2011  US default worries and the ongoing Eurozone Crisis sparked a panic sell off in the S P 500 and many other stock markets around the world 
Interestingly  Gold acted as a safe haven at the time  moving in an opposite correlation to global equities  refer to Chart 1   As the mini crisis played out by month s end  just about all traders   It was back during those market conditions that I initially  and  as well  while calling a potential bottom in the stock market  sentiment posts  and

Chart 2  Over the last three years Precious Metals have under performed

Source  Stock Charts  edited by Short Side of Long 
Three years have now passed and precious metals have dramatically under performed  while US equities have been the best major performing asset class  In Chart 2 we can clearly see what a powerful bull market the S P 500 has been in  posting gains of over 75  in the last three years  At the same time  the Central Fund of Canada ETF  ARCA CEF  which is 50  Gold and 50  Silver has pretty much halved in value 
Obviously  traders who focus on shorter term horizons and follow trends will not give this post all that much attention  However  investors who tend to chase out of  favour assets in a contrarian manner and purchase value at cheaper prices as longer term bets  should be looking at Chart 2 with an understanding that sooner rather than later  US equities will stop outperforming the overall global macro space  At that point  the question will arise as to where would some of the money flow towards  Which asset classes might next be favoured by liquidity 
Chart 3  Historically  the S P 500 rarely offers better returns over 3 years  

 Source  Short Side of Long
When we look at the 3 year holding investment history over the last five decades for both S P 500 and Gold  I could come to a plethora of observations  I m sure you could come up with many more  Right now  I will focus on what some investors are currently saying as the conventional wisdom 
Stock bulls  and there are an abundance of them  would claim that the US equity market has broken out to new highs  indicating the start of a new secular bull market such as the one in the 1980s  These same investors also claim that Gold s magic ten year period has now ended and the best case scenario for the yellow metal is to move sideways  like it did during 1980s and 1990s  
While I do not share the same enthusiasm toward stocks and pessimism toward Gold  I do admit that these investors could very easily be correct  Nevertheless  to them I say that rarely does the S P 500 offer better 3 year rolling returns then we have witnessed in the last few years  and at the same time rarely does the price of Gold offer such awful returns as we have witnessed in that same period 
Chart 4   while Gold rarely becomes more oversold then it currently is

 Source  Short Side of Long
To play devil s advocate  I could just as easily make a case that according to various valuation metrics  US stocks are currently very overvalued  Certain metrics even argue that future projected returns over the next several years and even up to a decade from now could very well be flat 
With that in mind  one could also make a strong case that the current sell off in Gold usually does not get too much worse relative to its historical periods of underperformance  In other words  while it is possible for price to go lower  the downside should be rather limited as this asset is already extremely oversold 
I also do not see a reason why one could not entertain the idea that the recent Gold sell off is just a correction within a secular bull market  with higher highs and higher lows still intact  If we study Chart 4 very closely  we should be able to notice that during the 1970s  Gold tripled in value twice over a three year rolling time frame  Now that is what a true bubble looks like  Even though Gold bears have called the recent 2011 peak a bubble  according to this historical chart it would not qualify as one ",2014-08-17,Tiho Brkan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-versus-gold:-3-years-on-222897,222897
35059,256574,CEF,Where Is Gold s Real Leverage  ,opinion,Over at Zero Hedge there is a  about how gold and gold stocks are better investments than the stock market and how there is a Wall Street conspiracy to suppress the gold price and keep the  dumb  investors in stocks With the Bank of Japan s  and seemingly to start another round of global competitive currency devaluation  it does certainly make some sense to hold some gold in a portfolio  However  I remain of the opinion that it makes no sense for gold bulls to hold gold stocks over bullion  Consider this chart below of the price of gold compared to the Amex Gold Bugs Index  HUI  The top panel shows the price of gold in black and HUI in red  The bottom panel shows the HUI gold ratio  A rising ratio indicates positive leverage to gold and a falling ratio shows falling leverage  The HUI gold ratio rose and peaked out in late 2003  It then flattened and started to decline in 2005 and continues to fall today  I wrote about this topic in  and  and it continues to be true  Gold bulls shouldn t buy gold stocks  The reason why gold stocks have failed to keep pace with the price of bullion  gold mining companies can t replace lost production at the same cost at which the older  cheaper ore bodies were mined out  They are mining lower and lower grade ore and therefore their profits and cash flows are lower because of higher production costs  see my analysis   Bottom line  If you are a gold bull  buy physical gold  the gold ETF  GLD   or a commodity fund such as the Central Fund of Canada  CEF   or any other vehicle directly related to the price of gold  Just avoid gold stocks Disclosure  Cam Hui is a portfolio manager at     Qwest    This article is prepared by Mr  Hui as an outside business activity  As such  Qwest does not review or approve materials presented herein  The opinions and any recommendations expressed in this blog are those of the author and do not reflect the opinions or recommendations of Qwest  None of the information or opinions expressed in this blog constitutes a solicitation for the purchase or sale of any security or other instrument  Nothing in this article constitutes investment advice and any recommendations that may be contained herein have not been based upon a consideration of the investment objectives  financial situation or particular needs of any specific recipient  Any purchase or sale activity in any securities or other instrument should be based upon your own analysis and conclusions  Past performance is not indicative of future results  Either Qwest or Mr  Hui may hold or control long or short positions in the securities or instruments mentioned ,2013-01-23,Cam Hui,https://www.investing.com/analysis/where-is-gold's-real-leverage-152031,152031
35060,256575,CEF,Precious Metals Sentiment,opinion,With the recent volatility in gold and silver prices  it would be nice to get an idea of what kind of sentiment is being generated  Measures of sentiment tell us if there is too much optimism or pessimism in a particular market  There are a number of sentiment trackers for stocks  but very few are readily available for precious metals  One that we track is the premium or discount on shares of Central Fund of Canada  CEF  Central Fund of Canada  CEF  is a closed end mutual fund that owns gold and silver exclusively    the metals  not stocks    at a ratio of about 48 oz  of silver to 1 oz  of gold  Closed end funds trade based upon the bid and ask  without regard to their net asset value  NAV   Because of this  they can trade at a price that is at a premium or discount to their NAV  By tracking the premium or discount we can get an idea of bullish or bearish sentiment regarding precious metals The following chart shows CEF history going back to 1986  and the bottom panel shows the amount of premium  green  or discount  red  at which CEF shares were selling  It is amazing to see that there have been discounts of lower than  20  and premiums approaching  30   I suspect that a good deal of this extreme behavior can be accounted for by the fact that some of the buyers and sellers simply did not know how closed end funds work It is interesting to note that in the last two years  sentiment swings have held a much more reasonable range  The extended topping action probably had something to do with that  More to the point is that recent bearish sentiment has been fairly low  considering the sharp decline in precious metals prices  This does not tell us if prices are going to continue lower  but it does show us that bearishness has not reached the kind of extremes that would prompt us to start looking for a price bottom by Carl Swenlin,2013-05-05,Carl Swenlin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/precious-metals-sentiment-165606,165606

The precious metals sector outperformed the majority of other asset classes in Q1 of 2014  however that strength has recently dissipated  What s even more interesting is the fact that while Gold and various miners rebounded powerfully in quarter one  Silver has continued to disappoint  As we can see in the chart above  the metal now finds itself at a technical pressure point 
To break on the upside  Silver will have to overcome a downtrend line  which has been in place since the bear market began in May 2011  On the other hand  if Silver was to move toward new bear market lows  it will first have to break a strong support area around  18 50 to  19 00 per ounce  A break in either direction could occur very soon  and would be a leading indicator for the rest of the PM space 
So which way will Silver move 
While I wish I could answer that question with precision  unfortunately I do not know  as my crystal ball is currently getting fixed  What I will do is place forward a handful of clues  so that we can work on probabilities and case scenarios 
Chart 2  Silver has declined 15  over last 3 months  but is not yet oversold

Over the last three months  Silver has sold off by about 15   As we can see from Chart 2 above  Silver is slightly oversold  but not yet past the 1 5 standard deviations on the downside  or about 19  decline  that I like to use  Therefore  more selling could come in the short term  before we consider the long side 
Keep in mind that Silver usually follows Gold closely and Gold itself is even less oversold over the last 3 months  Finally  most of other classic technical indicators  RSI  MACD  STO  etc   are not at oversold daily or weekly levels either 
Chart 3  Change in hedge fund positioning is now close to bearish levels
 
Source  Short Side of Long
The recent COT report  released last Friday  continues to show that hedge funds and other speculators continue to dislike Silver  However  future positioning hasn t reached extreme bearish levels just yet  Last time we saw those type of conditions signalling a contrarian buy signal was around the back part of the panic sell off in the middle of 2013  Since there are numerous ways to track the COT report  I thought I d include a few other interesting charts 
  but not yet at the outright extremes we saw during the July 2013 intermediate bottom
Commitment of traders  is also quite low  but has not yet reached the extreme  single digit percentage level
  but if prices were to move lower  there is a possibility that these could yet increase further
Chart 4  Premium during topping phase  discount during basing phase 
 
Source  Short Side of Long
As the precious metals sector was building a complicated top from 2011 into 2012  a majority of the closed ETFs  such as Central Fund of Canada  ARCA CEF   displayed a premium to its net asset value  In other words  retail investors were bullish on Gold and Silver  just prior to a correction  Today  we have a totally opposite picture 
The sector corrected rather sharply in 2013 and ever since the sell off  retail investors have pushed the CEF ETF into discount territory  refer to Chart 4   While lower prices are still possible  it is almost always wiser to be a buyer when the majority are sellers  Therefore  if the ETF traded at a premium near its peak  most likely the current discount is a signal that we are closer to the final bottom 
Chart 5  Sentiment on Silver has been very negative throughout  13  14

Next up  we look at SentimenTrader s public opinion levels  As we can see  Silver continues to hold support around  19  while sentiment on the metal is rather negative  only 31  bulls today compared to 91  bulls in May 2011   Public opinion readings this low are a decent indicator of a possible reversal in price  However  at times  negative sentiment readings can also occur just prior to a final collapse 
Finally  there are many other indicators traders should research prior to making up their minds on the up and coming Silver move  These include Gold sentiment indicators  Gold Miners breadth readings  ETF fund flow data  volatility and put   call ratios  the ratio between Silver and Gold  Silver and Silver Miners and Gold and Gold Miners  and so forth  It is very important to do your own research before anticipating the next move 
However  when it comes to speculating on price directions  maybe the most prudent advice I could give is to follow Jesse Livermore  who famously said 

In a narrow market  when prices are not getting anywhere to speak of but move within a narrow range  there is no sense in trying to anticipate what the next big movement is going to be  The thing to do is to watch the market  read the tape to determine the limits of the get nowhere prices  and make up your mind that you will not take an interest until the price breaks through the limit in either direction ",2014-05-19,Tiho Brkan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/decision-time-for-silver-213199,213199

Central Fund of Canada  ARCA CEF   which does a great job representing prices of gold and silver  finds itself in an interesting position from a technical perspective  There is clear support protecting the downside and just as clear resistance  in the form of the downtrend line  which started in September 2012   keeping prices in a pattern of lower highs 
However  we now find ourselves in a major pressure cooker   a decision point in the apex of a triangle compression  Either the bulls or the bears must now win  I doubt the price and the volatility will stay this low indefinitely 
Which way will it go  I m not sure  But whichever way it breaks I will trade and update the newsletter with my position whenever a break in either direction occurs  Some wise words for the traders out there 

In a narrow market  when prices are not getting anywhere to speak of but move within a narrow range  there is no sense in trying to anticipate what the next big movement is going to be  The thing to do is to watch the market  read the tape to determine the limits of the get nowhere prices  and make up your mind that you will not take an interest until the prices breaks through the limit in either direction 
Successful traders always follow the line of least resistance  Follow the trend  The trend is your friend  Don t take action with a trade until the market  itself  confirms your opinion  Being a little late in a trade is insurance that your opinion is correct  In other words  don t be an impatient trader ",2014-06-13,Tiho Brkan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/big-move-coming-in-precious-metals-215934,215934
