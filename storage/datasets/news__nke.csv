3938,225453,NKE,Dick s Sporting Goods  Canada Goose  JinkoSolar  Sunrun And Bloom Energy Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 15  2020    Shares of Dick s Sporting Goods   NYSE DKS   as the Bull of the Day  Canada Goose   NYSE GOOS   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on JinkoSolar Holding   NYSE JKS    Sunrun   NASDAQ RUN   and Bloom Energy Corp    NYSE BE   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  In a historic economic expansion and 10 plus year bull run for the markets  the strength of the US consumer has been one of the most important drivers of increasing corporate revenues and earnings While traditional retailers have in some cases suffered from stiff online competition  the best  run retail companies have not only survived  but are absolutely thriving Dick s Sporting Goods is definitely among the best in that category The company began in 1948 as a single retail store aimed primarily at fishermen that was seeded with a  300 loan that founder Dick Stack received from a family member  Dick s current CEO  Ed Stack  is the founder s son and has been running the company   along with two of his siblings   since 1984  The company went public in 2002  but in a sense remains a family business As the largest sporting goods retailer in the US  Dick s currently operates approximately 730 retail locations and also owns the Golf Galaxy and Field and Stream specialty store chains   aimed at golfers and outdoor enthusiasts  respectively  They maintain an extensive internet presence   with all of their products available online as well as in stores In November 2019  Dick s turned in a nearly perfect quarterly earnings report in which they exceeded analyst estimates for both revenues and earnings and significantly raised full year guidance The company delivered third quarter 2019 earnings of  0 52 share  beating the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate of  0 38 share by nearly 37   Gross revenues of  1 96 billion were 5 6  higher than the prior year period  Consolidated same store sales were up 6  and e commerce sales grew by 13  Dick s also raised its full year 2019 earnings guidance to a range of  3 63   3 73 share  up from a previous range of  3 30   3 45 share That increase in guidance sent analyst estimates soaring  earning Dick s a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  In the wake of several deadly mass shootings  Dicks has taken an aggressive and somewhat controversial stand on the issue of gun control by eliminating the sale of some types of firearms  and discontinuing the sale of any guns or ammunition to customers under the age of 21 Dicks had been one of the country s largest retailers of firearms and analysts and investors rightfully worried about the potential effect of that the loss of revenues from hunting enthusiasts Those customers tend to be strong advocates of second amendment rights who might see the move to limit the sales of firearms as an intrusion on those rights The decision came in February of 2018 and by the end of the year  Dick s estimated that they had lost approximately  150 million in sales of guns in ammunition It turns out those initial investor fears were unwarranted because overall same store sales at Dick s have actually been increasing significantly  including that 6  jump in the most recent quarter The hunting and shooting items that Dick s stopped selling actually turned out to be fairly low margin business   and one in which they often went head to head with the nation s largest discount retailer  Walmart  NYSE WMT  Dick s selection of women s and performance athletic apparel sell in greater dollar volumes and at higher profits than the firearms products they replaced  That s largely due to an advantage of scale Dick s enjoys because of its sheer size  They feature popular brands like Nike  NYSE NKE   Adidas  DE ADSGN  and UnderArmour  but they also have several private label brands that are available exclusively at Dick s The company has developed a line of women s apparel and footwear called Calia with celebrity Carrie Underwood and also a brand of high performance compression athletic garments called Second Skin that take aim at UnderArmour s most popular items It s a powerful one two punch  Name brand items bring customers into the stores  but intense price competition and higher wholesale prices often mean reduced margins on those goods  Offering customers choices of in house brands gives Dick s the chance to also sell those customers items with a lower retail price  but at bigger profits Dick s shares saw a significant rally after that blowout earnings report  yet remain very attractively valued  They re still trading at less than 13 times 12 month forward earnings estimates   significantly cheaper than the S P 500 which is currently trading at almost 19 times next year s expected earnings They also pay a reliable dividend with a current yield of 2 4  annually and bought back approximately  100 million in stock last quarter Initial reports on the 2019 holiday shopping season suggest that retail sales at stores like Dick s were stronger than ever  With record low unemployment and rising wages  the economic situation in the US points to more big retail numbers this quarter Dick s Sporting Goods is likely to be a big beneficiary when they report Q4 2019 results next month  If you live in a cold winter climate   especially in Urban areas  you ve no doubt noticed the proliferation of bulky down parkas with fur lined hoods and collars and a distinctive embroidered patch signifying that they are from the collection of high end outdoor garment maker Canada Goose Around the downtown Chicago offices of Zacks  the Canada Goose parka is the winter wear de rigueur for the millennial crowd  It would be understandable if you thought it was actually a required uniform if you re going to be standing in line at Starbucksor the hip place next door that sells take out salads for 11 bucks You may also be aware that those garments are very expensive  with the price of the flagship parka starting at about  800 and going up to  1 400 and beyond  Other garments are priced at similar levels with lighter weight jackets  outerwear pants and premium knit items all selling for over  500 So how does a company with popular  premium priced products end up as the Bear of the Day Lowered earnings estimates  stagnating long term forecasts and the wildcard of selling products made from animal feathers and fur that have been the subject of negative press and an FTC investigation into the company s claims of  ethical sourcing  There s also the issue that while those expensive parkas have become ubiquitous in the big city coffee lines  they were noticeably absent from the slopes of ski resorts in places like Jackson Hole  WY and Vail CO during the holiday season  In fact  an informal survey of outdoor winter sports enthusiasts finds that that group still prefers high performance  technical outerwear from the likes of the North Face  Patagonia and Columbia Sportswear and considers Canada Goose a fashion  poser  brand Having a hot fashion brand can be a double edged sword  While consumer demand for the newest items can drive sales and help a company hold gross margins  those tastes are notoriously fickle and require a marketing spend that quickly becomes unsustainable if sales dip In the case of Canada Goose  the company relies on large  stylish  flagship  stores in prime luxury shopping districts across the US and Canada as well as in London  Paris  Beijing  Shanghai  Hong Kong and Tokyo Those stores utilize extremely expensive retail commercial real estate  Floor space is arranged to showcase new inventory and the stores function more as advertisements that draw attention to the brand rather than as a channel for significant retail sales Early reports are that Canada Goose outerwear   which was rarely discounted in previous seasons   has been the subject of steep markdowns during the 2019 holiday season  The average discount to MSRP this year was calculated at 13  by one industry analysis firm  Pushback from animal rights groups is affecting consumer demand for the garments at full price   Activists have been critical of the conditions in which geese for the down stuffing are raised as well as the use of leg traps   necessary to procure coyote fur from wild animals Recent downward revisions for Q4 2019 earnings from  0 96 share to  0 87 share earn Canada Goose a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   Though the company turned in an earnings beat last quarter  management declined to adjust future guidance and the shares have been declining   trading recently at less than   the all time high of  70 05 share reached at the end of 2018 During the same period  the S P 500 has increased more than 20  Additional content Renewables to Lead World Energy Usage by 2050  3 Stocks to BuyIn a recently released   the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  projected world energy consumption to grow nearly 50  between 2018 and 2050  Of this growth  renewables are estimated to constitute the maximum portion  surpassing petroleum and other liquids to become the most used energy source Statistically  worldwide renewable energy consumption is predicted to increase 3 1  per year in the aforementioned time period  compared with 0 6  annual growth in petroleum and other liquids  0 4  growth in coal  and 1 1  annual growth in natural gas consumption Why Renewables While the need for adopting clean energy to avoid environmental hazards arising from carbon emissions has been the primary catalyst driving the rise of renewables as the most preferred energy source  rapidly plummeting cost of electricity generation from the same has also been a notable motivation  There are several drivers leading to such notable cost deceleration  with improved product design being one of them  For instance  wind turbines are now much larger and have much higher capacity factors  Another reason for the cost decline is improvement in manufacturing efficiency  which has lowered the cost of producing solar PV panels dramatically Policies such as tax credits  preferential feed in tariffs  and increased adoption of renewable portfolio standards  RPS  have also been boosting usage of renewables in recent times  Increasing corporate investment in renewables has been another growth driver  Per the latest Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment report  2018 marked the fifth successive year in which global investment in renewables exceeded  250 billion   These factors set the stage for analysts to predict that renewables will lead global energy consumption in the near future Stocks to InvestConsidering the aforementioned discussion  let us focus on a handful of stocks that are working relentlessly to promote clean energy and have made notable progress in the same  These should thus

3939,225454,NKE,Snap Up 5 Mega Cap Stocks With Impressive Growth Prospects,opinion,"Last year turned out to be epic for U S  stocks  The market s relentless rally catapulted the key S P 500 index to new heights  which logged its best year since 2013  As a matter of fact  the broadest measure of the equity market added as much as 28 9  to its value in 2019  While 2019 was an exceptional year  going ahead  the odds of an extended run in stocks this year also appear to be good 
What Drove the Record Breaking 2019   
Let s see what went right for the markets in 2019  It s fairly simple  investors drove up equities on evidence of economic growth  Another big catalyst was the preliminary U S  China trade deal 
Investors cheered the Federal Reserve s decision to cut rates thrice last year   in July  September and October   coupled with the central bank s assertions of a robust labor market and strong economic activity  Impressive pace of hiring and a 50 year low unemployment rate added to the optimism  Moreover  domestic homebuilding market took off  while a buoyant consumer environment and rise in disposable income meant solid momentum for the overall economy 
The agreement on a phase one trade deal between U S  and China  the two biggest economies  further boosted the market sentiment  The development   coming after almost two years of wrangling   was seen to prop up the demand outlook and revive global economic growth 
How Will 2020 Unfold for the Markets 
The bull market turned 10 in March 2019 and Wall Street pundits expect the rally to continue in 2020  on the back of an accommodative monetary policy adopted by the Federal Reserve as well as strong fundamentals of the U S  economy 
Meanwhile  the OPEC  group announced cutting output by as much as 500 000 barrels per day from Jan 1 for three months to end a supply glut and prop up prices  This is in addition to the existing production curbs of 1 2 million barrels per day by OPEC  Russia and other non member oil producers  The cartel s renewed supply cuts lifted energy and commodity companies and helped give the markets another lift 
Invest in Companies with Strong Business Models
Naturally  when the broader market sentiments have a predetermined positive direction  there is hardly any strategy as lucrative as growth investing  However  at a time when volatility may continue to unsettle the stock market  as was the case during the recent geopolitical tensions in the Middle East   investors want to seek haven in safe income stocks 
We believe that one of the smartest plays would be to go for mega cap stocks  stocks with a market cap of around  100 billion or more  which still have high growth potential 
Mega caps  usually the largest and most established companies in the stock market  have been around for a while  They tend to be stable  and many of them pay dividends based on their earnings These companies enjoy leading market positions  have a global footprint  strong cash positions and are large enough to stay strong even in the face of unfavorable events 
Though mega caps may not see the exponential returns that the small caps sometimes achieve  they are equally less likely to see the big downturns frequently experienced by smaller companies  In other words  you may not want to be lured by the expectant triple digit returns  and end up losing money   but instead find a growth story in the relatively safer mega cap stocks 
Our Choices
We have used the  to narrow down on five mega cap stocks with excellent growth potential  These stocks have a solid Zacks Rank as well 
Growth stocks are fundamentally strong businesses that ensure solid portfolio returns  We have used the Zacks  to pick such stocks  Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer good investment opportunities  All our choices carry a Zacks Rank of 2

KO stock has popped 18  in the past year and it hit a new high Tuesday  This has somewhat stretched its valuation  but at 24 9X forward earnings  KO stock rests below its recent high and not too far above its three year median of 22 7X  Coca Cola  which is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   pays an annualized dividend that yields 2 85  at the moment  Plus  the soda powerhouse has consistently raised its quarterly payout and its yield comes in just above rival PepsiCo   NASDAQ PEP   and easily tops the 10 year U S  Treasury note s 1 81  
Peeking ahead  the company s fiscal 2019 revenue is projected to surge roughly 15 5   with 2020 s sales set to pop 4 4  higher  Investors should note that these figures include acquisitions and divestitures and KO executives expect  at least 5  growth in organic revenues  in 2019  KO s adjusted FY19 earnings are set to climb roughly 1   with fiscal 2020 projected jump nearly 7  higher  In the end  Coca Cola s transforming portfolio should help KO remain a solid large cap  dividend paying stock for years to come

The race was unofficial for technical reasons  but his running shoes   which reportedly had extra thick soles and three carbon plates   were nevertheless subsequently banned

190946,412462,NKE,Felix sets sights on fifth Olympics after year of change,news,"By Amy Tennery
NEW YORK  Reuters    With a possible fifth Olympics in her sights  Allyson Felix faces a year unlike any other   yet the goal in many ways is the same  especially as an athlete 
In the roughly 15 months since giving birth  Felix carved out a new role on the track and off it  advocating for better benefits for working mothers and maintaining her competitive edge as she looks to add to her long list of accomplishments 
The 34 year old six time Olympic champion will be the biggest name at the NYRR Millrose Games on Saturday at the Armory in New York  as the most decorated American track and field athlete 
But life could hardly be more different than it was when she competed in her first Olympics 16 years ago 
 I feel a greater sense of responsibility now   Felix told Reuters   Of course  qualifying and going after gold medals is still on the top of my list but I also feel this opportunity to show my daughter so many things  show other girls a lot and to really just stand by a lot of my values  
After giving birth in November 2018  Felix returned to competition last year and ran in the United States  record breaking 4x400 metres mixed relay at the world championships and said that consistency in training has been essential 
 With last year being a year coming back from pregnancy and all of that  it s not my usual buildup   said Felix  whose daughter  Camryn  was added to her entourage on the road for competition and training sessions 
  I m  just trying to be really smart about everything and being patient and sticking to the plan   as an athlete that s always difficult  
But the challenges of pregnancy went beyond the physical  In May last year  Felix penned an opinion piece in the New York Times in which she said she faced potential pay cuts from sponsors including  Nike   NYSE NKE  for having children 
 It was outside of my comfort zone  for sure  to talk about a super personal situation   she explained   But I do feel like the reception from women across all industries has been really encouraging  
The 16 time world championship medal winner also applauded middle distance runner Mary Cain for speaking out against coach Alberto Salazar for alleged abusive behaviour at the Nike Oregon Project 
 It just speaks to the power of the collective and what s happening right now with women and sports and her just feeling comfortable to be able to come out and to speak her truth   Felix said   It definitely was a wakeup call to a lot of other people  
 COMPLETELY NEW 
Her post pregnancy life has also led to a new chapter in her working relationship with longtime coach Bob Kersee  who has trained many of the world s elite athletes including wife Jackie Joyner Kersee 
 He s brought athletes back after they ve had children and so for him  he s done it  For me  it s completely new   said Felix   I think the relationship definitely has shifted  Communication as far as what I m feeling  what my body feels like  
Felix plans to compete in the 200 metres and 400 metres this year  with the U S  Olympic trials set for June 
 Each race is a stepping stone   said Felix    I m  just looking to get my legs turning over and getting back into competitive situations 
 It s kind of just  pieces of the puzzle  ",2020-02-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/felix-sets-sights-on-fifth-olympics-after-year-of-change-2079156,2079156

In a report released Friday ahead of Fed chairman Jerome Powell s twice a year update to Congress next week  the Fed said the recent emergence of the coronavirus could lead to disruptions in China that spill over to the rest of the global economy 
Major U S  airlines have halted flights to China  consumer brands including  Nike   NYSE NKE  have warned the coronavirus is taking its toll as stores remain shut  and manufacturing supply chains for the likes of Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  have been disrupted with workers forced to stay home 
Even with the potential fallout  the Fed says the likelihood of a U S  recession occurring over the next year has dramatically reduced in recent months 
It noted a manufacturing slump caused by an unwillingness for businesses to spend during numerous trade spats between the U S  and trading partners   wasn t enough to drag the economy into a recession 
And pointed to continued strength in the U S  job market and consumer spending 
The U S  economy is in the midst of a record long economic expansion that began after the financial crisis more than a decade ago 
The Fed cut rates three times last year amid fears the U S  China trade war threatened to slam the brakes on that recovery but has since declared it is no rush to move rates up or down

confirmed 17 205 coronavirus cases and the nationwide death toll stands at 361  per reports as of Feb 2  The second largest economic leader in the world already declared a state of emergency  quarantined major cities including Wuhan  which is the epicenter of the epidemic  Besides  it withstood the economic downturn in China from the shock of the rampant Novel Coronavirus  2019 nCoV  The infection is believed to have transmitted from animals into humans  and has now spread to more than 24 countries across the globe  Several countries imposed unprecedented travel ban on passengers moving in and out of China  Further  news of the first foreign death from this virus in the Philippines on Jan 2  also intensified the health scare The number of people afflicted by the coronavirus already crossed the victims of SARS and forced the World Health Organization to dub the crisis a global emergency China s Viral Outbreak Stalls Global GrowthPer a research conducted by Warwick McKibbin  a professor of economics at Australian National University  the coronavirus eruption could impact the global economy  three to four times larger than the  40 billion fatal blow from SARS  Globalization and the availability of cheap as well as efficient work force prompted several companies to open factories in China  Thus  even if an entity is of a foreign origin  its presence in China makes vulnerable to the coronavirus onslaught  From retail stores to companies expecting hefty sales this Chinese lunar new year  all have been sadly shut down Companies Bearing the Brunt of CoronavirusMore than thousands travel worldwide on the Chinese lunar new year  But the rush in the airports following this health emergency upset the vacation plans at large as several airlines  namely American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL  Group Inc   Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   Inc   et al canceled flights to China  In fact  entertainment and tourism providers are the worst hit  which is evidenced by the closedown of The Walt Disney s theme parks at Shanghai and Hong Kong as a result of this coronavirus fear Car manufacturers in China like General Motors  NYSE GM  and Toyota have to delay their productions as government has extended the lunar new year holiday to avoid the spread of the coronavirus  This apart  the footfall at the malls seems nearly negligible and pose a threat to the sales of major players like Under Armour and Nike  NYSE NKE   Until now  Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  shuttered more than 2 000 outlets in China along with curtailing the menus as the beverage giant runs out of raw stock China is widely known as the major buyer of semiconductor chips in the world as the country purchases more than  470 billion of the product  However  the virus restricts transport of goods  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  with nearly 10 000 direct employees in China has a supply chain of a million of workers fashioning its products  Due to the quarantine order issued by the Chinese government  the staff is allowed an extended holiday  This  in turn  induces a delay in production  sparking uncertainties around the reopening of the plants 5 Defensive Stocks to Buy  The virus is wreaking havoc not only across the health care space but also disrupting trade routes and companies  outlooks  Overall  this virus is creating similar tension as that of the U S  China trade war  compelling companies to find alternatives to their Chinese suppliers and shifting production sites to the United States and Mexico This chaos emanating from the 2019 nCoV is practically spiraling out of control at the moment and if this cannot constrained in time  companies will have to incur heavy losses  With the current instability caused by the coronavirus  investing in defensive stocks that include consumer staples and healthcare looks beneficial Defensive stocks have stable returns regardless of the volatile market conditions  as demand for these products or services is constant irrespective of market gyrations  However  these stocks do not promise high returns when the economy is expanding compared to technology and other sectors Below  we selected five defensive stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong

190954,412470,NKE,This Indicator Could Signal When Tesla s Parabolic Surge Is Ending,opinion,"There are certainly financial topics impacting more individuals and bigger companies  but there s arguably nothing more fascinating happening in markets than the parabolic explosion taking place in shares of Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA   CEO Elon Musk s provocative electronic car company is perpetually creating headlines  but even against that backdrop  the stock s surge is still astounding 
Below  we highlight a couple of the most fascinating statistics on the move 

Tesla  TSLA is trading up 115  year to date  271  from the Cybertruck  bricked launch  in late November and 400  from the low set last June 


At over  160B  Tesla  TSLA has a higher market capitalization than rivals GM  F  FCAU and Daimler  MI DAI    combined 


After this morning s surge  Tesla     862M in  profit  last year  market capitalization has exceeded that of McDonalds  NYSE MCD    6B in profit last year  and  Nike   NYSE NKE    17 4B in profit last year  








Source  TradingView  GAIN Capital 
So what s driving the surge 
At the most basic level  the situation is a textbook  short squeeze   albeit on an unprecedented scale  Midway through last year  approximately 25  of Tesla s shares outstanding were sold short  meaning that traders were betting that they d go down  As prices began to rise  some of those traders were forced to close their short positions and buy the stock back  This in turn pushed prices up further  forcing more short sellers to buy the stock  pushing prices to rise yet further and so on 
With any parabolic market move  the question isn t whether it s reasonable  but where it will stop  After all  in the words of the great John Maynard Keynes   markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent   As of writing  13  of shares are still held short  so there s still plenty of fuel for further gains  even if the stock ultimately settles lower than current levels 
During this type of sentiment  and positioning driven move  traditional forms of technical and fundamental analysis tend to lose their effectiveness  but one signal we ll be watching for a sign that the rally is ready to reverse is the peak to trough drawdown  Since Tesla  TSLA eclipsed its previous record high and started the true parabolic phase of its rally in mid December  the stock hasn t seen a peak to trough drawdown greater than 5  on a closing basis 
Accordingly  when TSLA does see a closing drawdown of greater than 5   it will represent a change in the character of the move  whether that occurs later today or after the stock surges to  2 000  At that point  bears could have more confidence that a sustainable reversion to more sensible levels may be at hand  While this methodology is far from foolproof or guaranteed  it can help bullish traders limit their risk and allow bearish traders to potentially put the odds in their favor ",2020-02-04,Matthew Weller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-indicator-could-signal-when-teslas-parabolic-surge-is-ending-200504530,200504530
190955,412471,NKE,NIKE To Witness Near Term Softness On Store Closures In China,opinion,"The outbreak of coronavirus in China has given rise to a tough situation for companies operating in the region  Leading sportswear retailer NIKE Inc    NYSE NKE   is among the companies that are anticipating the current situation in China to have a material impact on its results  Yesterday  NIKE announced that it has temporarily closed nearly half of company owned stores in Greater China in response to the coronavirus outbreak Further  it noted that the stores that are open are operating with reduced hours and witnessing lower than expected footfall  Given the epidemic outbreak in the country  NIKE is prioritizing on health and safely of employees and its partners  Consequently  it expects China operations to witness softness in the near term  which should have a pronounced impact on overall results The company stated that the current situation was not accounted for in its fiscal 2020 guidance  which was provided during the announcement of second quarter fiscal 2020 results  During the third quarter earnings call  it expects to provide an update on financial and operational impacts from the coronavirus outbreak on its results However  for the long term  the company remains confident about the sustainability of its brands and business momentum in Greater China and the neighboring regions affected by coronavirus  It continues to see China as a key long term opportunity  as consumers remain connected with innovative and inspiring offerings  This connection is well demonstrated by continued strength of the NIKE digital business in the region Notably  Greater China remains key part of NIKE s global strategy  with currency neutral revenues in the region rising 23  in second quarter fiscal 2020  This was the 22nd straight quarter of the company s double digit growth in Greater China  Its solid growth in China is attributed to improvement in almost all key categories and every marketing channel Further  the company continues to witness unmatched digital growth in the region  with 44  improvement in NIKE digital recorded in the last reported quarter  This growth was aided by partnerships with Tmall and WeChat  Moreover  the results benefited from the launch of the NIKE app in Greater China For fiscal 2020  the company had earlier anticipated revenue growth  on a reported basis  of high single digits  indicating slight increase from fiscal 2019  It projects gross margin expansion of 50 75 basis points For third quarter fiscal 2020  the company expects revenue growth in high single digits  even though at the very low end of the range  On a currency neutral basis  the Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company anticipates strong revenues despite foreign currency headwinds Price PerformanceIn the past three months  the swoosh brand owner has gained 13 3  compared with the  s growth of 9 4

190956,412472,NKE,Market s Wild Recovery Continues  Boosted By Virus Treatment Hope,opinion," Wednesday Market Open  It started as a buy the dip rally  but it seems to have morphed into a buy into strength rally  with major indices eyeing fresh all time highs  Whatever you call it  it s been a wild week  and we re not even at halftime 
The latest surge came in pre market trading Wednesday after Asian stocks climbed more than 1  on a report out of China of a possible coronavirus treatment  So far  it seems like it s been enough to turn U S  stocks around from earlier losses and is helping the market significantly  That said  some companies including  Nike   NYSE NKE  and Walt  Disney   NYSE DIS  are starting to talk about the virus and its possible impact on their sales in China  reinforcing the risk that s still out there  
Many investors appear to be throwing some  but not all  of those risk worries out with the bathwater the last two days despite predictions that the coronavirus might take a real toll on China s long term economic growth prospects  see more below   Tuesday s sharp rally brought the S P 500 Index  SPX  back toward levels it last saw before the virus in mid January  and some analysts were telling the media about great buying opportunities at lower levels of the market after last week s selloff 
That might be a little hasty  as a talking tree in a movie once said  At worst  the sell off last week took the SPX down to about 3  off its all time highs  Some market watchers had speculated about a 5  to 6  drop before buying interest would recharge  but now those predictions look way off 
Whatever the case  it s a big earnings morning  with General Motors  NYSE GM  up 1  after the company easily beat Wall Street analysts  estimates  This might be a call worth listening to for the company s discussion about the situation in China  where it has a huge business 
The news from Merck  NYSE MRK  was mixed  Shares are down nearly 2  after the company came up just short of Wall Street projections on the revenue side despite beating on earnings  It did project above consensus earnings for the full year  with revenue about where analysts had expected  
MRK is doing a little restructure  planning to spin off its women s health  legacy brands and biosimilar products into a new company  That might be interesting to watch  especially the biosimilars part  Those drugs were developed as cheaper versions of costly biologic products used to treat auto immune and other diseases and are part of a growing challenge for established biotech firms  
Late Tuesday served up disappointing results from Ford  NYSE F   which missed analysts  bottom line projections and gave guidance that came up short  Shares were getting run over  down more than 8  in pre market trading  DIS  however  saw shares bounce slightly ahead of the open after beating Wall Street consensus on both earnings and revenue and reporting strong Disney  streaming paid subscriber numbers of nearly 29 million since the service launched last fall 
On the data side  weekly crude oil inventories later this morning might also get a glance from investors as crude futures gyrate near  50 a barrel level and fell below it at times Tuesday to nearly 13 month lows  Crude demand out of China could slide 20  due to coronavirus  Bloomberg reported  meaning a three million barrel a day demand drop hitting producers  That would be the worst oil demand shock since the Sept  11 attacks  Bloomberg said  and might help explain why crude prices kept dropping Tuesday even as the U S  stock market took off  
Tesla Gyrates After Huge DayOf course  the big story Tuesday was Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA   up 20  at times and at one point knocking on the door of  1 000 before a turn lower at the end of the session  A classic  short squeeze  might be developing  with investors who went  short  in TSLA shares hoping to benefit from a slide in prices now trying to exit all at once amid a series of positive developments for the company  These include consecutive profitable quarters  the opening of its plant in China  and strong sales and deliveries However  as we noted yesterday  getting involved here is like entering the ring with a top prizefighter and hoping to land even one good punch  At this point  TSLA is probably only a stock for the professional to consider trading  Watch out  as a young futures trader was once taught  for  chocolate covered hand grenades   The stock might feel great when it s rising  80 in an hour  but it can fall just as fast  as we saw in the closing minutes yesterday Shares fell just a bit in pre market trading  but don t rule out another wild ride today  the way things have been going  If TSLA sputters today  it could suck some of the euphoria out of the market The meteoric rise of TSLA seemed to help some related stocks yesterday in the battery business  Lithium product producer  Albemarle   NYSE ALB  shot up almost 12   The huge upward swing by TSLA has some analysts talking about what they say might be the beginning of a  secular trend  favoring electric and autonomous car makers and the companies that help provide products for those cars  We shall see Taking a 180 degree turn  a little pity might be in order here for investors in Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   The company had bad timing with its disappointing earnings report late Monday and was one of the only major stocks with big losses Tuesday  falling more than 2   On any other day  as they say  Some Still Play DefenseWith DIS getting set to report after the close Tuesday  it looked like investors wanted to have their princess cake and eat it too 

Meaning they bid up stocks for the second day in a row  but also didn t entirely give up playing defense  The 10 year Treasury yield touched 1 6  during the day but its upward move hasn t been able to match the major stock indices Monday and Tuesday  Volatility dipped a little but the CBOE Volatility Index  VIX  stayed near 16 as of late Tuesday before settling down a little Wednesday morning to just below 16  That s down from highs near 20 late last week but still well above recent pre virus lows of near 12 
Gold was the one defensive metric that took a major step back Tuesday  falling all the way below  1 560 an ounce  From a technical standpoint  gold s failure last week to move solidly above  1 600 probably looks a bit bearish on the charts  Gold is down again this morning 






CHART OF THE AFTERNOON  FLIPPING THE RISK SWITCH  As the risk meter toggled from the  off  position to  on   traders unwound some defensive positions  Gold futures   GC  candlestick  bounced off the  1600 level  blue line  and quickly retreated to the mid  1500s  Meanwhile  the Cboe Volatility Index  VIX purple line  spent only one day above 18 before drifting down to the mid teens  Data sources  CME Group  NASDAQ CME   Cboe Global Markets  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results   
Beyond Coronavirus  China Slowdown Worries Fester  Even before the virus hit  China s economic growth had slowed to 6 1  in 2019 from 6 8  in 2018  Now some analysts think Q1 growth there could fall below 5   which would be around a three decade low for the Asian economic giant  Analysts surveyed by FactSet say China s economic growth will slow to 5 9  this year and 5 7  in 2021  the research firm said late last week  The 2020 number may be revised lower if the economic disruption persists   A significant hit to GDP growth in the world s second largest economy would reverberate across the global economy  this has been the fear hitting global equity markets in recent days   FactSet noted in a report  A decade ago  China s economy was growing between 7  and 10  a year  and that might have helped fuel a lot of the strength in U S  stocks between then and now  How U S  companies with exposure to China would do in a 5  China GDP environment is up for question 
Coffee Break  Overheard at a coffee shop after Friday s selloff   Don t worry too much about  the market   Just ignore things and look at your portfolio again in a month and it ll probably be back where it was   That s a paraphrase  but probably not too different from what many investors heard following the latest market hiccup  While it s sometimes a good idea to not glance at your portfolio for a few days so you don t sell out of fear amid geopolitical panic  you don t want to be complacent  either  A lot of investors probably feel like the guy in the coffee shop  considering how quickly the market s bounced back from so many downturns over the last few years  Brexit  trade wars  Iran  North Korea  rising bond yields whatever gets thrown at the market  things  seemed to recover and go even higher  
While you could see it that way and think coronavirus is no different  remember that nothing is forever  The market can t keep rising without a break  even though it s already coming back toward where it was before the virus   and recessions are still part of the economic cycle  The Fed has done an impressive job supporting the stock rally  but that s not really its role  If Fed officials see inflation  they re liable to do something about it that s not necessarily in the market s interest  All that is a long way of saying  don t panic  but don t put your feet up completely  either  Keep an eye on data and earnings  because those are what really drive things in the long run  whatever happens in geopolitics 
All or Nothing  No Way  How can you still participate in this long bull market without necessarily risking everything you have  By going in partially  not all the way  It s one of the things we often stress here  but it s worth saying again  One of the big mistakes people tend to make is thinking investing is an  all or nothing  game  On the other hand  most professionals think of it as a  partial  game  That means if you had a good 2019  you might consider taking a small percentage off the table and realizing a profit  Removing a bit of risk could give you some comfort and help you think straight

190958,412474,NKE,Week Ahead  After Strong Stock Action  Virus Selloff Sends Bearish Signals,opinion,"Renewed virus fears pressured stocks  overshadowing stellar NFP
Though all fell on Friday  SPX  Dow jumped 3  for the week  NASDAQ gained 4 
Multiple technical triggers flash warning signs for equities
Dollar climbs but weakens vs yen

Renewed concerns over the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak which continues to spread and  the number of fatalities from the 2002 SARS epidemic that also emerged from China overshadowed the strong employment data released on Friday in the U S  The Dow Jones  S P 500  NASDAQ Composite and Russell 2000 all slumped  Wall Street s major indices closed lower on the final day of last week s trade  ending a four day straight advance  
Notwithstanding the day s negative close  the indices still posted their most profitable week in eight months 
Rising Infection Rate Offsets Employment Beat  Phase One Commitment
News of the rising number of infections obscured the much stronger than expected employment growth  said to give the  economy an upbeat start to the year   The 225 000 new jobs created in January smashed the 160K expectation 
Other geopolitical developments that should have boosted equities  Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping held a phone call Friday  reaffirming their commitment to carrying out the first phase of an overall deal to end the trade war between their two nations that s been going on for nearly two years 
Nevertheless  coronavirus fears are back at the top of investor worries  Known cases of the illness have now topped 37 000 globally  with the death toll currently at 813  The Federal Reserve warned the virus could potentially disrupt global markets  creating a  new risk  to global economic growth  Since China is the world s second largest economy  the prospect also increases the possible negative impact on global financial markets 
Though malls within China have been closed for weeks in an effort to arrest the spread of the virus  retailers all over the world are also seeing the effects via a severe slowdown in Sino tourism  From luxury goods purveyors such as Canada Goose  NYSE GOOS  and Burberry  OTC BURBY   to sportswear giant  Nike   NYSE NKE  all are feeling the pinch as Chinese consumers remain in lockdown 
As well  the domestic workforce has been told to stay home  Automobile manufacturers such as  Honda  Motor  NYSE HMC  and  Toyota   NYSE TM  have extended plant shutdowns in China as they wait for the virus to abate  Foxconn  a crucial supplier of iPhone  NASDAQ AAPL  components was planning to reopen on Monday  but reports indicate local authorities have told the manufacturer not to restart work yet 
Dramatic Stop Sign
The S P 500 and Dow both jumped at least 3  for the week  their best performances since June  The NASDAQ topped 4  its biggest weekly advance since February 2018  when it gained 4 66   But  as opposed to the indices  weekly achievements  Friday s performance provided a dramatic stop sign  


It was  first  a selloff on the final day of the week  When this occurs  it signals a lack of confidence in an uncertain environment  since traders fear being unable to unwind positions amid increasing risk 

Second  the S P 500 and Dow Jones each respectively completed an Evening Doji Star  a three candle pattern that demonstrates a top  The location of the pattern  at the Jan  17 highs  underscores the fact that there is a line of supply at this level  An RSI negative divergence both since November and since the mid January highs adds to the bearish outlook 
Had volume spiked on Friday  the signal would have been even more potent  Still  the depth with which the price dug into Wednesday s candle effectively demonstrates a bearish comeback  Third  the fact that the Evening Doji Star completed specifically on Friday makes the pattern even more meaningful 
Combining all this technical evidence  it appears we might be witnessing the making of a double top with the 28 000 level the November resistance turned support to the previous selloff that ended Jan  31 as the neckline  Note  the elegant move on the chart as the previous  Dec  3 low found support the same way  by the September highs 


Yields on the U S  10 year Treasury fell back below 1 6 percent  after the RSI had been providing a negative divergence  On Friday  yields dropped after finding resistance by the previous support  from November through January  The 50 DMA fell below the 100 DMA  putting all three major averages in a bearish formation  with the longer MA higher than the shorter ones  demonstrating that the preceding prices were stronger 



The Dollar Index climbed for the fifth straight session on Friday  extending an upside breakout to a H S bottom  from the perspective of the Oct  1 high  or a H S continuation pattern within the context of the rally since the February 2018 bottom  above 88 and within the rising channel since August 
Still  the USD weakened versus the yen  amid the rush to safe havens 

Bitcoin extended a rally to a fourth straight session  surpassing the  10 000 mark  for the first time since Sept  21 



Oil slumped on the final day of trade last week  reversing toward the  50 level  back below the June to August to October lows  The commodity suffered the longest stretch of weekly declines since 2018 on the dismal outlook for demand as refineries in China are already processing 15  less crude since the epidemic began 
The forecast for crude prices remains bearish as OPEC continues to wait for Russia s decision on proposed deepening of production cuts  However  if Libya should return to exporting oil it would more than offset any additional cuts  pressuring prices  However  talks in Geneva between the warring factions within Libya ended yesterday without a deal  The UN  another round of negotiations which would begin on Feb  18

190961,412477,NKE,Dow Jones News  Disney Reports Streaming Success  Nike Warns of Coronavirus Impact,news,"Wednesday marked a third day of gains for the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJINDICES  DJI   The Dow was up 1 08  by 11 30 a m  EST  continuing its recovery from a steep sell off last Friday  While the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in China continues to rise  some promising results using drug treatment against the virus may be contributing to the rally 
Two Dow components left out on Wednesday were Walt Disney  NYSE DIS  and Nike  NYSE NKE   Disney reported better than expected quarterly results  but the bottom line plunged as streaming costs added up  Nike won t report its results until March  but it may miss expectations after the company announced temporary store closures in China 
Disney reports epic streaming numbers  tumbling profits
So far  Disney has found plenty of customers for its Disney  streaming service  The new entry in the streaming wars had racked up 26 5 million subscribers by the end of 2019  exceeding Disney s expectations  The company s other streaming services grew as well  ESPN  more than quadrupled its subscriber base over the past year to 6 6 million  while Hulu s subscriber base increased by 33  

Total revenue came in at  20 9 billion for Disney s fourth quarter  up 36  year over year and  50 million higher than the average analyst estimate  Revenue in the direct to consumer and international segment  which contains the streaming business  rose by more than 300  thanks to streaming growth and the full inclusion of Hulu s results 
The media networks segment was also a strong performer  with revenue rising 24  to  7 4 billion  The acquisition of 21st Century Fox closed in March 2019  so Disney s year to year comparisons are still benefiting from that deal 
The profit picture didn t look as good for Disney  Earnings per share plunged 37  year over year to  1 17  and adjusted EPS was down 17  to  1 53  The adjusted figure was ahead of analyst estimates by  0 09  The direct to consumer and international segment posted an operating loss of  693 million  worse than a  136 million loss in the same period last year  Disney expects Disney  to turn profitable by 2024 
Shares of Disney were down around 2 5  Wednesday morning as investors digested the company s results  The stock has risen nearly 30  over the past year  but the valuation has been stretched in the process  Based on the average analyst estimate for 2020  Disney stock now trades for roughly 26 times earnings

Nike s guidance for the third quarter  issued when the company reported its second quarter results in December  came before the first coronavirus case was detected  Nike hasn t adjusted its guidance  but it s possible the company will come up short of expectations  Nike will provide an update on the impacts of the outbreak during its third quarter earnings call in March ",2020-02-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/priif,2076986

190970,412486,NKE,Tesla Market Cap Passes Nike s as the Electric Car Maker s Stock Soars,news,"With shares of Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  continuing to rise sharply on Tuesday  the electric vehicle company s market capitalization crossed  163 billion    over four billion dollars higher than athletic apparel company Nike  NYSE NKE   At the time of this writing on Tuesday  Tesla had a market cap of about  163 3 billion  compared to Nike s market cap of  159 2 billion 
It took some staggering growth in Tesla s market cap required to surpass Nike  Tesla s market cap was only  40 billion just six months ago  This means the automaker s stock is up more than fourfold in six months  Interestingly  Nike has actually performed very well during this same timeframe  rising 25   But the consumer goods company hasn t grown fast enough to stay ahead of Tesla 

What investors should know
Tesla stock s wild move higher over the last six months comes as the company is seeing deliveries of its Model 3 soar  The automaker is also doing a better job of hitting management targets  increasing investors  confidence in the company s ability to execute 
Model 3 deliveries in 2019 crossed 300 000    up 106  year over year  This put total vehicle deliveries during the year at 368 000  within the guidance range for full year deliveries that Tesla laid out at the beginning of the year  Looking to 2020  management expects deliveries to exceed 500 000  fueled by an earlier than expected launch of the company s new Model Y 
Investors are also likely pleased with Tesla s improving financials  The company was free cash flow positive in 2019 and management expects to be able to fund its growth with cash from operations going forward instead of needing to raise capital through debt or equity as it has done in the past 
Tesla stock s sharp gain on Tuesday  specifically  is likely driven by a combination of a short squeeze and a major shareholder s prediction that the automaker s total revenue can surpass  1 trillion within 10 years ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pq-ec,2075764

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Nike due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  NIKE Beats Q2 Earnings   Sales Estimates NIKE reported strong second quarter fiscal 2020 results  wherein earnings and sales topped estimates and improved year over year  Results were driven by strength across categories and geographies  Further  the smooth progress of its Consumer Direct Offense strategy  backed by product innovation and unmatched digital experiences aided growth Earnings   RevenuesIn the reported quarter  NIKE s earnings of 70 cents per share improved nearly 35  from the prior year quarter and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents  Earnings mainly benefited from robust top line growth coupled with enhanced gross margin  decline in selling and administrative  SG A  expenses  and lower average share count Revenues increased 10  to  10 326 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  10 101 million  This outperformance was primarily driven by the solid execution of the Consumer Direct Offense strategy globally  which fueled balanced growth across all geographies led by strength in Greater China and digital  On a currency neutral basis  revenues grew 13   driven by growth across all geographies Operating SegmentsRevenues for the NIKE Brand increased 10  to  9 844 million  while constant dollar revenues for the brand were up 12   Results gained from continued growth in NIKE Direct and its wholesale business  Moreover  strength in major categories like sportswear  the Jordan brand and Running as well as improvements in footwear and apparel fueled top line growth Within the NIKE Brand  revenues in North America improved 5  on reported and currency neutral basis  owing to continued growth in NIKE digital  partly driven by solid Black Friday sale  The company is gaining from efforts to transform the North America marketplace  with growth in NIKE Direct and across key differentiated wholesale partners In EMEA  the company s revenues increased 10   up 14  on a currency neutral basis   backed by double digit growth in most key categories  including Sportswear and Jordan  Further  NIKE digital grew 27  in EMEA  Per the company  the NIKE Brand s growing popularity in all key cities across EMEA also drove growth in the region  Notably  EMEA includes five of NIKE s 12 key cities In Greater China  the company delivered the 22nd straight quarter of double digit growth  Revenues rose 20  year over year  up 23  on a currency neutral basis  Results were aided by double digit growth in almost all key categories and every marketing channel  Further  in the reported quarter  the company continued to witness unmatched digital growth in the region  with 44  growth in NIKE digital In APLA  NIKE witnessed a 13  revenue decline  up 18  on a currency neutral basis   Currency neutral growth in the region was fueled by strength in Korea and Japan as well as a 67  increase in NIKE digital  The company is expanding its digital business in the region by partnering with digital platforms such as ZOZOTOWN and Flipkart Revenues at the Converse brand rose 13  to  480 million  On a currency neutral basis  revenues of the segment were up 15   owing to double digit growth in Asia and Europe as well as strength in the global digital business Costs   MarginsGross profit rose 11  to  4 544 million  while gross margin expanded 20 basis points  bps  to 44   The expansion was mainly driven by an increase in average selling prices  and margin expansion in NIKE Direct and Converse  partly negated by tariffs implemented in September in North America  adverse currency rates and supply chain investments Selling and administrative expenses increased 6  to  3 324 million  As a percentage of sales  SG A expenses leveraged 130 bps to 32 2   SG A gains resulted from productivity gains under operating overheads  efficiencies in demand creation spending and the company s decision to postpone some demand creation expenses to the second half for events like the Air Max Day  the NBA All Star Weekend  European Championships and the Tokyo Olympics  However  investment in digital capabilities partly offset aforementioned gains Notably  demand creation expenses declined 3  year over year to  881 million due to the shift in timing of certain investment campaigns as stated above  Operating overheads were up 9  to  2 443 million  reflecting continued investments in transformational initiatives  particularly in NIKE Direct and global operations Balance Sheet   Shareholder Friendly MovesNIKE ended fiscal 2019 with cash and short term investments of  3 502 million  long term debt  excluding current maturities  of  3 462 million  and shareholders  equity of  9 351 million  As of Nov 30  2019  inventories increased 15  to  6 199 million  backed by strong consumer demand globally  robust growth in NIKE Direct and increased rate of on time deliveries from factories In the fiscal second quarter  NIKE bought back 10 1 million shares for  922 million under its four year share repurchase program of  15 billion approved in June 2018  As of Nov 30  it repurchased 33 6 million shares for  2 9 billion under this program OutlookDespite the volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical environment  NIKE expects to continue investing in key capabilities to aid digital transformation  and deliver robust growth in fiscal 2020 and beyond  Consequently  the company retained most of its initial guidance for fiscal 2020  It continues to expect high single digit revenue growth on a reported basis  suggesting slight growth from the increase reported in fiscal 2019  It expects foreign currency to hurt reported revenue growth by 2 3 points in the fiscal year  On a currency neutral basis  the company now expects revenues to be low double digits Gross margin for the fiscal year is expected to expand 50 70 bps  The company expects SG A expenses to increase in high single digits in fiscal 2020  including a slight impact from the recent Celect buyout  Other income  net of interest expenses  is now anticipated to be  100  150 million  Effective tax rate is now expected to be in the low to mid teens range For third quarter fiscal 2020  the company expects revenue growth on a reported basis to be in high single digits  even though at the very low end of the range  On a currency neutral basis  it expects strong revenues despite a negative impact of 2 points from foreign currency translations Gross margin for the fiscal third quarter is estimated to be flat year over year  reflecting strong underlying product margin expansion on robust product pipeline  offset by tariffs in North America and investments in supply chain Further  the company expects SG A expenses to increase in the low double digit to low teens range  backed by its decision to shift demand creation to the second half of fiscal 2020 to strengthen the focus on NBA All Star Weekend  European Championships  Tokyo Olympics and launch of innovative products  Other income  net of interest expenses  is expected to be  50  75 million  Effective tax rate is expected to be in the low to mid teens range

190983,412499,NKE,Stock   Wall Street Rebounds  Helped by ISM   Nike Leaps on Upgrades,news,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing com    U S  stocks bounced sharply at the opening on Monday as a measure of confidence returned to markets in the absence of game changing news regarding the novel coronavirus outbreak in China 
Markets that had had their worst week in months opened as much as 0 7  higher  not least on the back of reports that products from U S  pharma giants Gilead  NASDAQ GILD  and AbbVie  NYSE ABBV  had had encouraging results in treating the disease 
Gilead  stock rose 4 3   while AbbVie  NYSE ABBV  stock rose 1 5  
By 10 23 AM ET  1523 GMT   the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 325 points  or 1 2   while the S P 500 was up 1 2  and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1 5  
The overall tone was helped by the Institute of Supply Management s monthly business survey  where the main index showed activity rising to 50 9  its highest since August  Other purchasing manager indices published in China and Europe had shown a weaker picture  The eurozone manufacturing PMI was still below the 50 level that separates growth from contraction despite hitting an 11 month high of 47 9 
Airline stocks recovered a little of their poise after spreading bans on flights into and out of China undermined the outlook for the current year  American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL   Delta Airlines  NYSE DAL  and United Airlines  NASDAQ UAL  were all between 2 5  and 3 0  higher 
The biggest gainer  however  was   Nike    NYSE NKE  stock  The sportswear giant rose 4 1  after UBS and JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  both upgraded it  the latter putting it on its  analyst focus list   saying that last week s selloff had created a rare buying opportunity 
Nike is exposed to any short term weakness in the economy because it gets around 16  of its sales from China and sources nearly one third of its shoes and other sports gear there 
Another stock exposed to China fared less well  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  opened lower but turned around to be 1 0  higher  despite saying it would keep its Chinese stores and corporate offices closed for another week after the end of the Lunar New Year holidays 
However  oil and gas stocks continued to underperform as U S  crude futures market shrugged off reports of deeper production cuts by OPEC and its allies  The global benchmark Brent fell 1 3  to  55 89 a barrel

190984,412500,NKE,Dow Jones News  Apple Shakes off Coronavirus  Nike Seen as Strong Buy,news,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJINDICES  DJI  staged a big comeback Monday morning after suffering a large loss to close out last week  The news around China s coronavirus outbreak hasn t gotten any better  with the number of casualties rising sharply over the weekend  Despite that backdrop  the Dow was up 1 05  at 10 50 a m  EST 
In terms of individual stocks  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  rose despite an analyst warning about the coronavirus reducing iPhone shipments  and Nike  NYSE NKE  was up after two analysts made bullish arguments for the apparel and footwear stock 
Apple shakes off coronavirus
Shares of Apple were up 0 7  Monday morning despite the potential for the coronavirus outbreak in China to dent sales  China s economic growth could suffer if the outbreak continues to escalate  and the Chinese government is reportedly considering cutting their growth target for 2020 

In the near term  the tech giant announced over the weekend that it was closing its corporate offices  stores  and contact centers in China through Feb  9  Analysts at Wedbush don t see this as a big deal  saying that at most 1 million iPhone sales could shift into the quarter containing June  representing less than 3  of annual Chinese iPhone sales 
Another analyst expects a larger impact  Analyst Ming Chi Kuo of TF International Securities slashed his first quarter iPhone shipment guidance by 10  on Monday  citing a survey that indicated that iPhone supply is being impacted by the outbreak  Kuo expects Apple to ship between 36 million and 40 million iPhones in the first quarter  up from an estimated 38 million in the prior year period  Apple no longer reports iPhone unit sales 
When Apple reported its latest results  the company set an unusually wide revenue guidance range for the second fiscal quarter due to uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus outbreak  With the virus still spreading rapidly  Apple s iPhone business could take a serious hit 
Investors aren t showing much concern  Apple stock is up about 6  year to date  and up about 87  over the past year 
Nike gets a boost from optimistic analysts
Shares of Nike have been hammered recently by coronavirus fears  losing roughly 8  of their value in the final week and a half of January  A few analysts see this decline as a buying opportunity  Nike stock was up 4 3  Monday morning in the wake of this positive commentary 
Analysts at UBS upgraded Nike from  neutral  to  buy  on Monday  while JPMorgan added Nike to its  analyst focus list   JPMorgan called Nike a multi year buying opportunity in a note to clients 
Both UBS and JPMorgan believe Nike stock deserves an even higher valuation than it already has  UBS thinks a price to earnings ratio of 37 is appropriate  while JPMorgan pointed to a below average price to earnings growth ratio as justification for calling Nike undervalued 
Based on the average analyst estimate for 2020  Nike stock currently trades for 33 times earnings  Analysts are expecting modest 8 4  sales growth this year  UBS now has a  136 price target on Nike stock  while JPMorgan maintains an  111 price target  The stock currently trades right around  100 per share 
The coronavirus outbreak could derail Nike s growth  given that it depends on China for both a chunk of its sales and a large portion of its apparel and footwear sourcing  But neither analyst appears all that concerned ",2020-02-03,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqhi0,2074590

Investing com   Wall Street rose Monday  but was off earlier highs on rising fears that the coronavirus is now likely to become a pandemic as more cases of the disease were identified over the weekend 
The S P 500 rose 0 91   while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1 48  and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0 70   
The number of cases of the virus rose to 17 200  with the first death reported outside China in the Philippines prompting experts to warn of an impending pandemic as China battles to contain the virus 
With fears that the virus will take an economic toll on China s economy  leading to a slowdown in the global economy  the People s Bank of China said it would inject a stimulus of  21 7 billion to ease the impact 
 Roughly two thirds of the Chinese economy closed or impacted  and economists anticipate the coronavirus will have a deeper and more lasting impact than the SARS epidemic which subtracted an estimated 0 8  1 0  from annual Chinese GDP growth   Stifel said 
The bullish start to the week for stocks was led by a sharp upswing in consumer discretionaries thanks to strong gains for sector stalwarts like   Nike    NYSE NKE  and Ulta Beauty  NASDAQ ULTA  
 Nike   NYSE NKE  rose about 4  after UBS upgraded its rating on the company to buy from neutral and its price target to  136 from  103  The athletic footwear and apparel maker s product innovation investments and e commerce business are expected to boost growth  UBS said 
In addition  J P Morgan added the stock to its Analyst Focus List 
Goldman Sachs upgraded Ulta Beauty  NASDAQ ULTA  to buy from neutral and raised its price target on the stock to  307 from  285  citing a favorable valuation at current levels  There is little chance that of Ulta s operating margins  unraveling  in the event that its sales growth slows further  the investment bank said 
Investor sentiment on risk was also supported by a rebound in manufacturing in January

Fears about a significant slowdown in China denting global growth eased somewhat after the People s Bank of China said it would inject stimulus of  21 7 billion to curb the expected impact on the economy 
The action by China s central bank stoked hopes that other central banks could follow suit and adopt ultra easy monetary policy in the event of a pandemic 
But Allianz  DE ALVG  Chief Economic Adviser Mohamed El Erian warned that central banks were nearing a point where they are  ineffective if not counterproductive  in solving current issues 
Beyond virus concerns  consumer discretionary raked up gains on a rally in   Nike    NYSE NKE  and Ulta Beauty  NASDAQ ULTA  amid favorable upgrades from analysts on Wall Street

A rebound in manufacturing  meanwhile  also added conviction to the rally on Wall Street 
ISM manufacturing data for January showed an uptick to 50 9  beating expectations of 48 5

 When you look at what s going on with the virus  it is going to slow world growth  dampen demand  disrupt supply chains and be disruptive  On the other hand  interest rates have come down dramatically worldwide in reaction to that  which is very stimulative to the world economies and China is injecting a lot of stimulus into their economies  Whenever we get through this period  there will be pent up demand so hopefully by the end of the year  you will make it up

191000,412516,NKE,Nike  NKE  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Nike  NYSE NKE   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Nike currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for NKE that show why this athletic apparel maker shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For NKE  shares are up 0 79  over the past week while the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry is down 0 04  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 8 46  compares favorably with the industry s 2 93  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of Nike have increased 8 45  over the past quarter  and have gained 48 02  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 8 19  and 33 15   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to NKE s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  NKE is currently averaging 5 496 871 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with NKE 
Over the past two months  9 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost NKE s consensus estimate  increasing from  2 97 to  3 01 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 2 downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that NKE is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Nike on your short list ",2019-12-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nike-nke-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200494479,200494479

191004,412520,NKE,At trial  U S  says Avenatti s greed fueled Nike extortion  defense says tenacity is no crime,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK  Reuters    Michael Avenatti was bent on a big payday when he demanded millions of dollars for himself from  Nike  Inc  NYSE NKE   a federal prosecutor told jurors on Wednesday in his opening argument at the extortion trial of the celebrity lawyer and prominent critic of U S  President Donald Trump 
But a lawyer for Avenatti countered that the request was simply part of negotiations on behalf of Avenatti s client  Gary Franklin  a basketball coach in a Nike sponsored youth basketball league  and that Avenatti could not be held criminally liable 
 It s true  Mr  Avenatti is brash   his lawyer Howard Srebnick told the six man  six woman jury in Manhattan federal court   Tenacious  bullish  hard charging     At times he may be offensive  But that s not what we put people in prison for  
Avenatti was charged with threatening to publicize his client s accusations that Nike illegally paid families of college basketball recruits  unless the apparel company paid  15 million to  25 million for him and celebrity lawyer Mark Geragos to conduct an internal probe  and paid Franklin  1 5 million 
Prosecutors also charged Avenatti with defrauding Franklin by concealing a settlement offer from Nike  so that Avenatti could seek millions for himself 
Nike has denied wrongdoing  The trial could last 2 1 2 weeks  and Avenatti could face more than 40 years in prison if convicted 
Avenatti became famous representing adult film actress Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against Trump  and Srebnick and Assistant U S  Attorney Robert Sobelman mentioned both in their opening arguments 
Sobelman told jurors that Avenatti leveraged his fame to  shake down  Nike and  line his own pockets   in part because he had large debts and his law firm was struggling financially 
The prosecutor told jurors they would hear recordings made at Nike s behest of Avenatti making his demands 
 Why did the defendant do what he did  Simple  Money   Sobelman said 
Srebnick countered that Avenatti was simply fighting for  a client who wanted justice  by exposing corruption in youth basketball  and who wanted a high profile lawyer to help him 
 He had a platform to expose what happened at Nike   Srebnick said  pointing several times at his client 
Avenatti looked in jurors  direction for nearly all of Srebnick s argument  Most focused on Srebnick 
Later this year  Avenatti faces separate criminal trials in Manhattan for allegedly defrauding Daniels out of book contract proceeds  and in California for defrauding other clients 
Avenatti was jailed and had bail revoked after his Jan  14 arrest for an alleged bail violation in the California case  He is appealing the revocation ",2020-01-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/at-trial-us-says-avenattis-greed-fueled-nike-extortion-defense-says-tenacity-is-no-crime-2071137,2071137

BRUSSELS  Reuters    NBCUniversal was fined 14 3 million euros   15 86 million  by the European Union on Thursday for illegally restricting sales of merchandise linked to films such as  Minions   as the bloc cracks down on practices blocking cross border online trade 
The European Commission opened an investigation into the Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  subsidiary  and several other companies  on related issues in 2017 following an inquiry into the e commerce and cross border practices of thousands of companies in Europe 
The EU wants to promote cross border online trade to boost economic growth and catch up with the United States and Asia in this fast growing business area 
The Commission said NBCUniversal s sales curbs included restricting out of territory sales by licensees  restricting sales beyond allocated customers or customer groups and restricting online sales to particular territories or to the websites of specific retailers 
 Such sales restrictions undermine the very foundations of the EU single market and cannot be tolerated   European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement 
The EU reduced NBCUniversal s fine by 30  in return for cooperation with regulators  Its film merchandising products include mugs  bags  clothing and toys for  Minions    Jurassic World  and  Trolls

Fourteen provinces and cities have said businesses need not start operations until at least the second week of February  They accounted for almost 69  of China s gross domestic product in 2019  according to Bloomberg calculations 
All the key eastern manufacturing provinces have extended the holiday  They include Guangdong  home to the tech city of Shenzhen across the border from Hong Kong  Shanghai  home to China s largest port and a newly built Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  Inc  plant  as well as Jiangsu  where  Nike   NYSE NKE  shoes are manufactured  Henan in central China  which has a large Foxconn plant making iPhones  also announced the extended break 
The extended holidays come on top of other measures including quarantining whole cities that are set to disrupt supply chains and logistics  prompting economists to expect that this virus will deal a more severe blow to China s  economy in the near term than the effect of the SARS outbreak in 2003

191013,412529,NKE,It s very easy to feel alone   Cain finds balance in sport,news,"By Amy Tennery
NEW YORK  Reuters    Finishing 13th in the women s 3 000 metre race at the Dr  Sander Invitational Columbia Challenge on Saturday  American mid distance runner Mary Cain said completing the competition was  for her  a win in and of itself 
Once hailed as an athletics prodigy  23 year old Cain dropped a bombshell in an interview with the New York Times in November  in which she accused former coach Alberto Salazar and his staff at the now shuttered  Nike   NYSE NKE  Oregon project of emotional and physical abuse 
 What I have learned in this sport is that it s very easy to feel very alone   Cain told reporters on Saturday 
In 2013 then 17 year old Cain signed with Salazar  who last October was banned from the sport in October for four years for doping violations 
She told the New York Times she left the training group in 2015 after repeatedly being pushed to achieve an unhealthy weight in an environment she said eventually led her to have suicidal thoughts 
Salazar has denied her allegations and Nike has said it is looking into them 
Cain  who won the gold medal at the Junior World Championships in 2014 and set numerous juniors records  said one of her deepest regrets is not warning another young athlete who joined the Oregon Project after her 
 I never even admitted to her what I was currently going through  And in a lot of ways  it was because selfishly I was still trying to stay on the team   Cain said at an emotional post race appearance 
 I can t ever forgive myself for not being brave in the past and from here on out  I m never going to do that again  
Cain  who has battled back from numerous injuries including a stress fracture in 2017 and an Achilles injury last year  said she is unlearning a competitive mindset where winning was all that mattered 
 The coward of the past  the cowardly Mary  never would be racing right now   she said   Because if there was even a thought in my mind that I wasn t in it to win it  honestly I probably would have dropped out of that race eight laps in 
 I tied so much of my self worth   and trust me  if you re a runner  you understand this   to my performance  
Cain said she was looking forward to the upcoming outdoor track season while maintaining balance in her life  going for jogs with her boyfriend and chasing her dog Nala  who has a penchant for sprinting after squirrels 
  Nala  will fly and I think in the past I would almost get so scared to run with her because I d be like   This is extra miles that I don t need    said Cain    I  let loose with her and I kind of  in that moment  I m like  This is really fun  This is why I run   ",2020-01-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/its-very-easy-to-feel-alone-cain-finds-balance-in-sport-2067827,2067827
191014,412530,NKE,U S  trial accusing Trump foe Avenatti of Nike extortion kicks off,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK  Reuters    Lawyers in the extortion case of Michael Avenatti are expected on Monday to begin choosing jurors who will decide the fate of the celebrity lawyer and prominent critic of U S  President Donald Trump 
Avenatti  48  is charged with threatening to publicize accusations that  Nike  Inc  N NKE  illegally paid families of college basketball recruits unless the sportswear company paid him and another lawyer  15 million to  25 million to conduct an internal probe 
He is also charged with defrauding his client Gary Franklin  who coached in the Nike Elite Youth Basketball League  by concealing a settlement offer made by Nike  and using the coach s accusations to extract riches for himself 
Nike has denied wrongdoing 
Avenatti has pleaded not guilty  He could face more than 40 years in prison if convicted 
Prospective jurors will fill out questionnaires on Monday and be questioned by lawyers on Tuesday 
Avenatti s trial before U S  District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan federal court could last three weeks 
The charges announced last March  and separate criminal charges against Avenatti announced the same day by prosecutors in California  brought a sudden halt to Avenatti s roughly year long ascendance from obscurity to a self described  high profile nemesis  of Trump 
Much of that stemmed from his representation of adult film actress Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against the president 
Daniels  whose real name is Stephanie Clifford  received hush money before the 2016 election not to reveal her alleged sexual encounter with Trump  which he denies occurred 
Avenatti has said his tactics helped the government win a guilty plea from Michael Cohen  once Trump s personal lawyer and fixer  for campaign finance violations 
Jurors will be drawn from the Democratic strongholds of Manhattan and the Bronx 
Prosecutors do not want frequent mentions of the Republican president to politicize the trial  though Gardephe has acknowledged that Trump and Daniels will be mentioned 
Avenatti faces two other criminal trials this year 
Prosecutors in Manhattan have said Avenatti defrauded Daniels out of proceeds from a book contract  while prosecutors in California said he defrauded other clients and lied to the Internal Revenue Service and a bankruptcy court 
He has pleaded not guilty in both cases 
Avenatti was jailed and put in solitary confinement following his Jan  14 arrest for an alleged bail violation in the California case ",2020-01-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-trial-accusing-trump-foe-avenatti-of-nike-extortion-kicks-off-2068201,2068201
191015,412531,NKE,Are Nike s Vaporfly Running Shoes  Too Good  ,news,"Running records have been falling at a blistering pace lately  Eliud Kipchoge ran the first official sub 2 hour marathon in Vienna in October 2019  which was considered  like the sub 4 minute mile  a time mark that could not be broken  That same week  Brigid Kosgei set a new world record in the women s event in the 2019 Chicago marathon  beating the old one by 81 seconds  The common denominator  A brand of shoe 
When legendary Oregon track coach Bill Bowerman started pouring rubber on his wife s waffle iron in the mid 1960s to make the first shoe dedicated to running events  he soon after formed a company with one of his athletes  Phil Knight  that eventually became Nike  NYSE NKE   The shoe company has been at the bleeding edge of the running market ever since  Nike s efforts  along with such colorful running personalities as Steve Prefontaine  helped launch the jogging revolution of the 1970s 
Since then  running shoes have increased in quality and performance  and some have even been game changers  Now it appears we have another technological jump that is so good it is causing the governing body of track    World Athletics    to consider banning or restricting the shoe because it allegedly gives an unfair advantage 
So  what is this shoe  Nike s Vaporfly 

News reports say that World Athletics will come to a decision on the shoe in the next month or so  Nike has said it will respect whatever decision is made   We respect the IAAF  now World Athletics  and the spirit of their rules  and we do not create any running shoes that return more energy than the runner expends   It should be noted that  returning more energy than the runner expends  violates a few laws of physics   
Whichever way the ruling body rules  Nike stands to benefit from the shoe brand s growing popularity  Here s what that could mean for the company and for investors 
Technological leaps in running shoes are rare
The Vaporfly is Nike s elite running shoe  which gives the runner such a mechanical advantage that it has been referred to by some sports scientists as  technological doping   The sole is made of Zoom X  an ultra light material originally used in aircraft  A carbon fiber support in the sole helps return energy back to the legs with each step  Runners say it feels like the shoe is propelling them forward  The New York Times conducted a study on the Vaporfly and found it did make runners faster    by about 3  4   In an analysis of a series of races in 2018  it turns out that 25 of the 36 podium finishes in the Big 6 marathons were held by Vaporfly runners  So  there clearly is something special about this brand of shoes 
The Vaporfly is an expensive shoe    about  250 per pair  which is about double the typical price point for a running shoe  Will customers pay that  Given that running enthusiasts will spend thousands for a VIP package to a big marathon  spending an extra hundred bucks to shave 11 minutes off their competition time  and probably attain a personal record  seems like money well spent  In fact  the New York Times study showed a roughly 66  probability that a runner will set a personal best time while using the shoe 
Part of the problem with a better shoe revolves around the time comparison of records  That said  when tracks went from cinder surfaces to asphalt runners got faster too  So technological improvements have long been part of the track and field landscape 

Nike dominates the running shoe market already
Running shoes are a  13 billion market that is expected to grow 5  annually over the next 5 years  Nike already has a sizable share in running shoes  holding 51  of the market  Asics is a distant second at 15  market share and Adidas is third at about 6   Relative newcomer Under Armour has about 2  of the market 
Shoes account for about 47  of Nike s revenue  so increasing share will meaningfully affect revenue growth  Not only that  the improved performance may cause current Nike customers to upgrade to the new Vaporfly  especially given tangible evidence it makes runners faster  International sales are also a growth market    Nike has been working hard to increase overseas sales  and there the Nike brand name is second to none  
It should be noted here that any proposed regulations won t affect the typical amateur runner  and Vaporfly shoes will be fine for competing in your local 5k or marathon  So  unless you are an elite runner looking to set a ratified time  any potential ban likely won t affect you  In many ways  a ban should be immaterial for Nike s stock  In fact  you could make an argument that the publicity of a ban due to a shoe being too performance enhancing might actually be good for the company  A past example of this is Callaway s Big Bertha golf driver  which is banned in PGA events but found its way into the typical weekend duffer s golf bag anyway  
A premium multiple for a premium growth story
Nike is trading at a premium multiple    about 33 times expected 2020 earnings  although that is much less than publicly traded athletic apparel companies like Under Armour which trades at 62 times earnings or lululemon athletica which trades at 49 times  Nike is still considered a growth story  and it has been growing its shoe revenue at a faster rate than the industry  Certainly  this summer s Olympics will generate buzz for the running shoe industry in general  even if the athletes competing in the 2020 games end up being forbidden from using the shoe ",2020-01-27,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pnjv5,2068761

The report added that Nike is re evaluating how it will release Bryant s signature shoe series going forward 
According to ESPN  more than 100 NBA players have worn Bryant shoes this season 
Thousands of people reportedly stopped by and gathered throughout the day Monday at a 35 foot poster of Bryant at Nike World Headquarters in Beaverton  Ore  At Nike s regional office in Los Angeles  employees gathered in the office s auditorium  named  Kobe

191021,412537,NKE,Nike  NKE  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Nike  NYSE NKE  reports results for the quarter ended November 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 19  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This athletic apparel maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 57 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 6  
Revenues are expected to be  10 08 billion  up 7 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 13  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nike 
For Nike  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nike will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Nike would post earnings of  0 71 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 86  delivering a surprise of  21 13  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

To some  the stock may look somewhat frothy  The shares fetch a premium of 30 times next year s earnings estimates  It s not valued as highly as lululemon athletica  but investors are obviously expecting a lot of growth from this industry veteran  Is Nike worth it 
During the recent conference call  management discussed some things that contributed to the company s strong financial performance recently  They didn t chalk up last quarter s robust earnings growth to a fluke  It s clear there are substantial adjustments being made behind the scenes that could allow Nike to continue outperforming its earnings growth outlook through fiscal 2023  If it can maintain earnings growth above the mid teens  the stock could have more room to run in the year ahead 

No need for heavy marketing spending with demand this strong
One of the things that boosted profits last quarter was lower marketing expense  or what Nike refers to as demand creation expense  This spending increased 1  year over year over the last two quarters combined  That allowed more gross profit  which increased 11  over the last two quarters  to pad profits  For the first half of fiscal 2020  which ends in May   pre tax income was up 24  year over year  while revenue increased just 9  
The Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics and other world sporting events are on the horizon this year  so Nike will ramp its marketing back up in the second half of the year  But there is such strong demand for Nike footwear and apparel right now    management referenced the last quarter as  an incredibly strong pull market     that Nike was able to post solid revenue growth while not having to increase marketing much at all 
Nike has been leveraging its demand creation expense to fuel earnings growth for a while now  and this could be a source of further profit margin improvement through 2020 and beyond  The main reason Nike can do this is through its innovation  giving customers more choices and styles  which creates more demand 
Innovation is Nike s best marketing
On the innovation front  management is also outperforming its long term outlook  Two years ago  management said they would double the percentage of revenue that is driven by newly introduced products  Nike has actually tripled that percentage  As an example  management said its top three growth drivers in the fiscal second quarter for the Air Max footwear platform were all introduced in the last year  
Management calls innovation its best competitive advantage  but you could also say innovation is Nike s best marketing  CEO Mark Parker said during the call that their innovation initiatives are  creating a continuous cycle of scalable  distinct platforms   This is corporate jargon that can be translated this way  We have some sneakers that are considered classic and are in high demand  and we can save costs and increase margins over time by introducing new colorways and designs within those core sneaker styles 
An example of this is what Nike has done with its React cushioning system designed for runners  The designers take a performance cushion and apply it to a lifestyle sneaker like the Air Max  Nike creates additional demand by improvising on this popular sneaker style with a funky new colorway and applying the React cushioning technology for the sole  like the recent Air Max 270 React Engineered sneaker seen here 

Improving returns through smart capital allocation
Nike is also delivering high earnings growth through smart capital allocation  Management sold the Hurley brand recently  a non core sales category that will provide more resources to invest in the products that will drive long term growth  
Nike is also enhancing its inventory management  It acquired Celect last year  which will allow management to better determine how much of a certain style  color  and size it needs to make based on demand  Other investments in things like Nike Fit should reduce online returns by giving customers more confidence that they are ordering the right size  
The digital sales channel  including Nike com and the SNKRS app  could also drive higher margin sales  Nike s acquisition of Zodiac allows management to evaluate which new offering in digital channels affects customer engagement and the lifetime value of that customer  This should ultimately lead to greater member retention and repeat buying 
Taken all together  these investments should lead to several benefits  including limiting discounts  driving higher full price sales of products  and lowering the amount of time that products sit in the warehouse  
This veteran player has fresh legs
To sum up  Nike can deliver robust earnings growth by continuing to execute with innovation  keeping marketing expense down  outside of the expected increase for the Olympics   and improvements to inventory management and digital capabilities to drive higher sales and customer engagement with the brand 
Two years ago  Nike guided for an annual improvement to gross margin of 50 basis points per year through fiscal 2023  Over the last two quarters  management is outperforming that target  Gross margin is up 90 basis points year over year  and that s with the effect of tariffs on Chinese imports cutting 40 to 50 basis points out of gross margin in the last quarter  
Nothing is guaranteed  but if management continues to execute what it s already doing so well  there s a good chance Nike will continue to beat its long term outlook of mid teens earnings growth  That s why at a forward PE of about 30  Nike is a growth stock with room to run ",2020-01-20,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pkcv9,2063194

191025,412541,NKE,Nike Vaporfly runners eye peak form at Dubai Marathon,news,"By Alexander Cornwell
DUBAI  Reuters    Athletes wearing the controversial  Nike   NYSE NKE  Vaporfly shoes have backed themselves to set fast times at the Dubai Marathon this Friday as they make their case for Olympic selection 
Several elite men and women runners will wear the high tech footwear used by athletes in stunning performances since 2016 
At a news conference on Wednesday  elite athletes said they were expecting a grueling race that is stacked with a roster of Ethiopians 
 I am here to win and if I win  I think I will be in the Olympic team   Ethiopian Solomon Deksisa said in Dubai 
Deksisa said he could shave more than 40 seconds off his personal best of 02 04 40 this week but dismissed any suggestion the Vaporfly he will wear would give him an edge 
 It s just comfort   he said 
Compatriot Seifu Tura Abdiwak  also wearing the Vaporfly  said he could run the distance in around 2 03 00  That would set a new course record and smash 1 minute and 44 seconds off his personal best  Dubai has a men s course record of 2 03 34 and Eliud Kipchoge s world record is 2 01 39 
Tura told Reuters the Vaporfly was more durable than other footwear  and Mexico s Jose Luis Santana Marin said it acted like a spring but that the shoe was  not really an advantage  
Santana Marin said this week he was targeting to run under 2 10 00 which is below his personal best of 2 10 54 
Boston Marathon women s race winner Worknesh Degefa Debele said she was not worried about which shoes racers wore 
 I only believe in hard work  I don t care if anyone is wearing Nike or Adidas  DE ADSGN    she said  speaking through a translator

WADA wants to investigate all the athletes who trained with banned coach Alberto Salazar at the  Nike   NYSE NKE  Oregon Project  one of which was Britain s Farah  the 5 000m and 10 000m champion at both the London 2012 and Rio de Janeiro 2016 Games 
 UKAD has not refused any request from WADA  To clarify  at this moment in time we have not received any request from WADA for reanalysis of samples we hold for any sportsperson   the UKAD said in a statement 
 On the specific subject of the Nike Oregon Project  in Nov  2019 we proactively offered to assist WADA in their endeavors and to date we have received no such request for any assistance 
 We have been clear that we are happy to assist any anti doping organization including WADA  
Farah  who stopped working with Salazar in 2017 when he moved back to England from the United States  said in a Twitter post on Tuesday that he would gladly have any of his previous blood or urine samples retested

191028,412544,NKE,Athletics body to tighten rules after Nike s Vaporfly helps records tumble  sources,news,"By Mitch Phillips and Kate Kelland LONDON  Reuters    Athletics  ruling body will tighten regulations governing shoe technology  two sources familiar with the matter said  after Nike s popular Vaporfly brand helped re write running records and sparked debate about whether it was  technological doping   World Athletics expects to announce the findings of a review into technology used in road and track shoes by the end of January  Recreational runners  use of the fluorescent footwear will be unaffected  World Athletics said  Vaporfly combines carbon plate and ultra springy compressed foam and is now a familiar sight at starting lines across the world   World Athletics definitely agrees that there needs to be greater clarity on what is permissible in elite sport and in our competitions   it said in a statement to Reuters  adding that any change would need to be ratified by its council   It is not our job to determine the shoe running market for everybody  If people want to run a marathon in Vaporflys or any other shoe  it s not our job to stop them  But if you want a ratified record  then you are classified as elite and have to abide by the rules   When asked about the review and a possible change of rules   Nike   NYSE NKE  said   We respect the IAAF  now World Athletics  and the spirit of their rules  and we do not create any running shoes that return more energy than the runner expends   Regulations state that any shoe  must be reasonably available to all in the spirit of the universality of athletics and must not be constructed so as to give athletes any unfair assistance or advantage   The governing body  which has longstanding restrictions on midsole thickness for high jump and long jump shoes but has given free rein to running shoes  says more research is needed to determine exactly what benefits are provided by the Vaporfly  The sources did not specify what changes World Athletics is planning  Industry experts have suggested the organization might impose limits on the depth of foam  for example  or the amount of carbon used in elite competition  TIMES COMING DOWN Nike  the world s largest athletics clothing company  says Vaporfly shoes  which cost around  250 and have a lifespan of only around 200 miles  have  a built in secret weapon that provides a propulsive sensation   Other manufacturers have also released  or are developing  their own carbon insoled shoes  but they are playing catch up  Some athletes  including Eliud Kipchoge  the Kenyan who wore the Alphafly version of the shoes when he became the first man to run a sub two hour marathon in Vienna last year  celebrate the leap in efficiency the shoes provide  and say they are fair  Others would welcome rule changes that aim to put the brakes on the arms race for feet  Yannis Pitsiladis  a professor of sport and exercise science at Britain s Brighton University  described the advanced footwear as  technological doping   He said if World Athletics did nothing to halt such advances   the consequence is going to be a race between the manufacturers rather than a race between the athletes   The day after Kipchoge s unofficial sub two hour run  25 year old compatriot Brigid Kosgei ran 2 14 04 in Chicago  taking an astonishing 81 seconds off Briton Paula Radcliffe s 16 year old women s marathon world record  Kosgei was wearing a modified version of the Vaporfly shoe  featuring three carbon plates  and Vaporflys have featured in several other records in the last three years  The distinctive pink and green footwear is now widespread at every major race  recreational and professional  Strava  the global social network for athletes  said in its 2019 review that the median marathon finish time for runners in the Vaporfly model Next  was 8 7  faster than runners wearing the next fastest shoe  the Adidas  DE ADSGN  Boston       EFFICIENCY OR ENHANCEMENT  Sports scientists writing in the British Medical Journal said the Vaporfly deviates from conventional running shoes in three ways  it has embedded carbon fiber plates  its midsole is made of super condensed foam and its midsole is particularly thick   Each of these components has design features that reduce energy loss in isolation and  perhaps more so  in combination   they said  Kerry McCarthy  editor of Runner s World UK magazine  said the sensation was  almost like a mini pogo stick  The carbon fiber plates effectively push against the ground and help to push your foot off the floor quicker   Amateur runner Holly Grundon  who switched to the Vaporfly to target a new personal best for a half marathon  describes them as  a bit like running with marshmallows under your feet   According to Bryce Dyer  a sports technologist and specialist in product design at Britain s Bournemouth University  benefits like this are  the equivalent of bringing a gun to a knife fight   But he rejects the suggestion that it is unfair   If they produced more than 100  energy return  then I d agree they are enhancing  But from the studies we ve seen  these shoes don t appear to be doing that  so I d say it s purely a question of efficiency   he told Reuters  In 2008  Speedo delivered its LZR speed suit which helped swimmers claim a host of world records before it was banned

191033,412549,NKE,Michael Avenatti  former lawyer for Stormy Daniels  arrested in California,news,"By Dan Whitcomb
 Reuters    Celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti was arrested on Tuesday on accusations that he violated the terms of his release from custody while awaiting trial on charges that he sought to extort millions of dollars from  Nike  Inc  NYSE NKE    federal prosecutors said 
Avenatti  48  whose trial in the Nike case is set to start next week  was taken into custody by agents from the Internal Revenue Service  said Thom Mrozek  a spokesman for the U S  attorney s office in Los Angeles 
Mrozek said that he could not discuss the allegations that led to Avenatti s arrest because the documents had been sealed by a judge  An arrest warrant filed in U S  District Court in New York does not spell out the accusations 
Avenatti  who gained international notoriety representing adult film star Stormy Daniels in a legal battle with U S  President Donald Trump  was scheduled to appear in federal court in Santa Ana on Wednesday 
Earlier Tuesday  a federal judge in New York rejected a request by Avenatti to delay his trial in the Nike case after his lawyers complained that prosecutors had overwhelmed them with a  document dump  of new material 
Avenatti is accused of threatening to make public a client s claims that Nike had made improper payments to families of college basketball recruits unless the sportswear company paid him to conduct an internal investigation for  15 million to  25 million  and pay an additional  1 5 million to the client 
Avenatti has pleaded not guilty  Nike has denied any wrongdoing 
The high profile lawyer also faces an April 21 trial in Manhattan over accusations he cheated Daniels out of proceeds from a book contract  and a May 19 trial in Santa Ana  California over allegations of defrauding clients out of millions of dollars and lying to the Internal Revenue Service 
He has also pleaded not guilty to those charges

191038,412554,NKE,Could the  Nike of China  Wreak Havoc on Nike  Adidas  and Under Armour ,news,"China is a major growth market for Nike  NYSE NKE   Adidas  OTC ADDY Y   and Under Armour  NYSE UA   NYSE UAA   Nike s revenues from China grew 23  annually  on a constant currency basis  to  1 85 billion and accounted for 18  of its top line last quarter    making it the company s fastest growing region 
Adidas  revenues in China rose 11  annually  in constant currency  to 2 09 billion euros   2 33 billion  last quarter  making it the core growth engine of the Asia Pacific business which generated a third of its sales  Under Armour also considers China to be a top market in its Asia Pacific region  which grew its revenues 4  to  155 million last quarter    or 11  of its top line 

Nike  Adidas  and UA all attract Chinese shoppers with brand recognition and high profile celebrity endorsements  However  Anta Sports  OTC  ANPDF   a Chinese maker of footwear  athletic apparel  and accessories  has grown quickly in recent years and is now frequently referred to as the  Nike of China  
Could Anta s growth eventually throttle the growth of Nike  Adidas  and Under Armour in China  Let s take a closer look at its origins and expansion plans 
Understanding Anta s business
Anta was founded 26 years ago  but it didn t gain significant momentum until the Beijing Olympics in 2008  which boosted domestic interest in sportswear brands  Anta capitalized on that growing interest and went public in Hong Kong in 2007  
Anta acquired the trademark rights for Fila in China  Hong Kong  and Macao from Belle International in 2009  Fila subsequently became a major growth engine for Anta  and it continued growing faster than its namesake brand over the following decade 
It also expanded its brick and mortar footprint with Descente and Sprandi stores in China  as well as Kolon Sport and Kingkow stores across China  Hong Kong  and Macao  And it pulled NBA stars Kevin Garnett and Klay Thompson away from Adidas and Nike  respectively  with massive endorsement deals  Other Anta endorsed players include Gordon Hayward and Rajon Rondo 
Anta also recently led a consortium which acquired Amer Sports in a deal which values the Finnish sporting goods company at 4 6 billion euros   5 2 billion  

How fast is Anta growing 
Anta s growth decelerated slightly in the first half of 2019  but its revenue and earnings growth easily outpaces the growth of its Western rivals 

Data source  Anta  YOY   year over year  
Most of its growth comes from Fila  which generated 80  revenue growth in the first half of 2019 and accounted for 44  of its top line  Its Anta revenues  which accounted for the rest  grew 18     which still outpaced the growth of Nike  Adidas  and UA 
FILA s products  which generally cost more than Anta products  had a gross margin of 71 5  last quarter  which was significantly higher than Anta s gross margin of 42 5   Its total gross and operating margins expanded annually during the first half of 2019  which suggests that it has strong pricing power and firm control over its expenses 

Data source  Anta 
By comparison  Nike  Adidas  and UA posted gross margins of 44   52 1   and 48 3   respectively  in their latest quarters 
Looking ahead  Anta expects soft goods  like athletic apparel   direct to consumer channels  including e commerce and brick and mortar stores   and rising income levels in China to fuel its long term growth  It also expects Fila and Amer Sports    which owns Wilson  Louisville Slugger  Arc teryx  and other western brands    to bolster its overseas growth 
The market leaders should keep an eye on Anta
Anta s stock already delivered a near 15 bagger return since its IPO  and the stock could head even higher over the next decade 
It s growing at a faster pace than its Western rivals  it operates at higher margins  and it s quickly gaining recognition as China s  national  sportswear brand  Even President Xi Jinping was photographed wearing Anta apparel    which is noteworthy since most Chinese leaders don t wear clothing with visible corporate logos 
Anta s growth won t necessarily hurt Nike  Adidas  and Under Armour in China  since there could be plenty of room for these brands to flourish without trampling each other  However  investors in these Western footwear makers should realize that this resilient domestic competitor could cap their long term gains ",2020-01-17,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pjdvc,2062162
191039,412555,NKE,Can Foot Locker  FL  Turn Things Around With Upcoming Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"Foot Locker   NYSE FL   will report its Q3 financial performance before the market opens on Friday  November 22  The sneaker retailer has struggled to keep up with the broader market this year as it lags behind the S P 500 s 23 3  rise  with its over 18  decline 
Foot Locker is coming off a second quarter where it reported a mixed bag of results that sent its shares lower  To combat this  the company has adopted efforts to better adapt itself to the contemporary consumer 
Foot Locker Rejuvenates Itself 
In an effort to better market itself to the modern consumer  Foot Locker has undergone several initiatives to revamp its in store experience  Foot Locker announced the grand opening of its Washington Heights community based Power Store in New York  The 9 000 square foot store is the first among Foot Locker stores to showcase the Nike   NYSE NKE   App at Retail digital technology 
The Nike App at Retail allows users to look for their favorite brands in the Foot Locker store with all the information needed to get the best experience possible  Users can scan to see if an item is in stock  or they can reserve it for pick up in store  The NikePlus Unlock Box in the app works like a vending machine through which users can unlock free limited edition items  while the  Shoecase  capability gives app users early access to coveted sneaker releases 
Foot Locker hopes the exclusive access the app provides will bring more hardcore sneaker fans into its stores  while the user friendly accessibility attracts the casual shopper  Foot Locker is also doubling down on its exclusive merchandise by offering local brands that can only be found at its Foot Locker Power stores  The local merchandise is part of its  Home Grown  initiative that gives customers an exclusive taste of the local fashion  which might encourage the trendy customer to visit 
Will the Modernization Yield Results 
Foot Locker is playing on the exclusiveness to bring in customers who want to find unique looks that are only available to a select few  Only those who visit Foot Locker Power stores gain access to the local brands and can use the Nike digital app  Foot Locker is operating Power Stores in Detroit  Philadelphia  London  Liverpool  and Hong Kong and plans to open stores in Los Angeles and Vancouver  Canada as well 
The Foot Locker Power store seems like a great concept that brings digital shopping to its brick and mortar locations  The initiative seems poised to win over athleisure consumers with its enticing exclusive offerings  which might help Foot Locker gain stream into the upcoming holiday shopping season 
However  the new initiatives have come at a price  as Foot Locker s gross margin rate decreased and its general and administrative expenses rose in Q2  Foot Locker s investments in its digital capabilities and infrastructure have started to weigh on its margins but the athleisure retailer hopes investors can bear with the short term losses and keep their sights set on the long term picture 
Our Q3 consensus estimates forecast a bottom line hike of 12 63  to  1 07 per share and a sales jump of 4 31  to  1 94 billion  Same store sales in the third quarter are projected to come in at 4 3  and six more stores are estimated to be added  Looking ahead to the full fiscal year  estimates call for EPS to grow 4 9   while sales pop 2 14  and comp sales reach 2 8  
Bottom Line 
Foot Locker s revamping efforts look good on paper but time will tell if they can bear fruit  As far as its ability to finance the restructuring  the retailer is in good shape as it reduced inventory in Q2 and the company s cash totaled  939 million  while the debt on its balance sheet was  123 million 
Foot Locker pays out a dividend with a solid 3 48  yield that can anchor returns for shareholders  On top of its healthy dividend payouts  the pull back in Foot Locker s stock has it trading at a level well below the industry average  The current valuation can be a solid buying opportunity for those feeling optimistic about the company s outlook  Foot Locker sports a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

But when uncertainty abounds  it can sometimes lead to bargain purchases that pay off  and uncertainties in 2019 helped the world s largest shoe brand deliver with a 36  gain on the year  That tops off a nearly 100  return over the last three years  more than double what the S P 500 has offered up over the same time frame    
Sneakers are a hot commodity around the globe right now  and Nike s leadership in that department isn t going to fade anytime soon  However  as good as recent results have been  it s time for a pause  Don t bet against Nike  but I m looking for a pullback before jumping back in 

Recovering with the global economy
Fiscal 2018 and 2019  the years ended May 31  2018  and 2019  respectively  were relatively sluggish ones for Nike  Revenues rose 6  in 2018 and 7  in 2019  with last year s results being dragged down due to negative foreign currency exchange rates  Excluding those effects  sales would have grown 11   
Halfway through fiscal 2020  Nike is faring much better  Sales are up 9  so far  including a 10  gain in the recently reported second quarter  which again got hit by currency exchange rates  growth would have been 13  otherwise   Earnings per share are up 31   propped up by growing profit margins on products sold and Nike s generous share repurchase program  Sales in China are leading the way  up 21  in the first six months of the current fiscal year and bucking all the negative U S  China trade war doom and gloom during the period   

Data source  Nike  Pp   percentage point  
It s possible that the world economy reaccelerates this year as well  adding further support to Nike s recent uptick in growth  since 56  of the company s sales have come from outside North America so far in fiscal 2020   The International Monetary Fund sees global GDP increasing to 3 4  from 3  in 2019 if trade tensions ease and manufacturing recovers  Added to a rosier outlook for the economy  Nike has also been a case study in going digital the right way  After announcing it was parting ways with Amazon  management credited its digital selling prowess for its reinvigorated profitable expansion    besides its strong brand amid a general sports footwear craze around the globe 
Optimism increasingly priced in
However  Nike s stock run is showing signs it s losing a little steam  Q2 results were some of the best from the last few years  but they were greeted with a shrug from investors  Shares have actually been flat since the report card was released    not surprising since the stock is priced at a premium  Share prices have been handily outpacing earnings growth  and the stock is now priced at 29 times one year forward expected earnings  The high price tag is certainly warranted  the S P 500 currently trades for 19 8 times one year forward earnings on expectations for high single digit earnings growth   but the valuation prices in a fair amount of continued double digit earnings gains   
I m certainly not saying to bet against Nike  Sneakers aren t just a hot fad  but rather the new norm in footwear  and Nike is in command of the industry  However  given the run up in the stock in the last year  I say wait on a new purchase until shares notch a pullback  I for one am looking for a drop of about 10  before I buy in again ",2020-01-03,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pd8bd,2052097

191045,412561,NKE,For Another Way to Play Nike  Consider Foot Locker Shares,news,"Nike  NYSE NKE  shares  climbed 37  last year  but the average analyst price target is for just an additional 7  gain in 2020  so some investors might be a little nervous about buying into the athletic apparel giant now  But Nike shares aren t the only way to play this company 
Foot Locker  NYSE FL   whose shares stumbled last year    losing 27     is also a way to get in on the action  Nike accounts for about 70  of the retailer s merchandise purchases  Jefferies analysts wrote in a 2018 note 

Among the elements that could boost Foot Locker this year are the popularity of Nike s Jordan brand and a slew of new products connected to upcoming athletic events  Nike s decision to reduce the number of retailers it partners with    while Foot Locker remains a noted partner    could also be a positive for Foot Locker  as it means less competition  


Foot Locker could use a lift after the lackluster third quarter report it delivered in late November  Though the retailer beat analysts  earnings estimates  its apparel segment suffered  leading management to forecast flat same store sales for the fourth quarter  The company said full year comps would be in the low single digit range  after having predicted a mid single digit gain a quarter earlier  However  the footwear segment  powered by sales of Nike styles such as the Air Force 1  was a bright spot in the report 

First billion dollar quarter for Jordan brand
And here  in footwear  Nike recently reported good news that should flow through to Foot Locker s earnings in the coming quarters  The Jordan brand had its first billion dollar quarter  and the company said that  in many cases  demand exceeded supply  Jordan sales were strong in both North America and Europe  and Nike said it s just at the start of diversifying the brand s product line  The Tokyo 2020 Olympics and this summer s European soccer championships will drive new product launches as well  Nike said 
Nike s move    made public a couple of years ago    to reduce its number of retail partners and focus on about 40 might make some retailers nervous that they will get cut out of the action  but Foot Locker seems to have remained on Nike s favored partner list   
Fortune recently noted that Foot Locker s stores are connected to Nike s app  Another example of the Nike Foot Locker relationship  Foot Locker last year opened a  Power Store  in New York City in partnership with Nike  A variety of popular athletic brands line the stores  shelves  but what makes this a true Foot Locker Nike experience is the integration of the Nike app  Members of the NikePlus loyalty program get benefits including exclusive access to products and the option of reserving items online and picking them up in store  With this sort of initiative  as well as Foot Locker Nike exclusives like Nike swoosh footwear collections that celebrate Nike s famous  logo    it s clear that the companies  relationship is strong  There s good reason to believe Foot Locker will benefit from Nike well into the future 
One big concern is that Foot Locker might suffer from its dependence on the brand as Nike makes a push to increase its direct sales to consumers  Nike s efforts to bring customers into its own stores and onto its website surely will sap some sales from third party sellers  including Foot Locker  Still  Foot Locker s partnerships with Nike and sales of exclusive Nike products offer it the opportunity to benefit from the brand s growth  Investors will have to wait for a few more earnings reports from Foot Locker to determine whether the close relationship with Nike is enough to insulate Foot Locker from Nike s direct to consumer efforts   
Foot Locker is trading at about 8 times earnings  70  lower than a peak in 2018  Analysts  average price target is  47 14  24  above where it trades today and the average analyst recommendation is a  buy   Considering those numbers and all that Nike may contribute to Foot Locker s sales picture  the retailer s shares look like a bargain ",2020-01-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfy4w,2056010

191054,412570,NKE,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch for Dec  19,news,"Investing com   Here are three things that could rock the markets tomorrow 
1  Trump Impeached
The House of Representatives voted to impeach President Donald Trump Wednesday  as expected  Trump is the third president to be impeached in U S  history

As far as the numbers  S P 500 futures were little changed just after the vote came in 
Also on the political landscape  healthcare stocks will be active after a federal appeals court ruled unconstitutional the individual mandate that citizens must have health insurance  which is part of the Affordable Care Act  also known as Obamacare  
The Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the mandate was in the taxing power of Congress  but a Texas court ruled that was no longer applicable given that the penalty for not having insurance was later lowered to zero dollars 
The appeals court the Texas court would have to rule if the law could stand without the mandate

191057,412573,NKE,Are You Looking For A Top Momentum Pick  Why Nike  NKE  Is A Great Choice,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Nike  NYSE NKE   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Nike currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for NKE that show why this athletic apparel maker shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For NKE  shares are up 0 87  over the past week while the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry is up 2 89  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 7 72  compares favorably with the industry s 4 06  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Nike have risen 9 43   and are up 24 06  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 0 04  and 8 47   respectively 
Investors should also take note of NKE s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  NKE is averaging 7 342 967 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with NKE 
Over the past two months  11 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost NKE s consensus estimate  increasing from  2 90 to  2 97 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  8 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that NKE is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Nike on your short list ",2019-10-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-top-momentum-pick-why-nike-nke-is-a-great-choice-200474492,200474492

quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  NIKE Q1 Earnings   Sales Beat Amid Tariff WoesNIKE displayed a strong start to fiscal 2020  driven by smooth progress on its Consumer Direct Offense strategy  backed by product innovation and unmatched digital experiences  Notably  the fiscal first quarter marked the company s return to its more than 5 year trajectory of beating earnings estimates  after a miss in the last reported quarter  In the fiscal first quarter  NIKE s top line surpassed estimates for the 10th straight time and earnings represented its 29th beat in the last 30 quarters Earnings   RevenuesIn the reported quarter  earnings of 86 cents per share improved nearly 28  from the prior year quarter and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents  Earnings mainly benefited from robust top line growth  coupled with enhanced gross margin and lower average share count  However  higher selling and administrative expenses were a deterrent Revenues increased 7  to  10 660 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  10 451 million  This outperformance was primarily driven by the company s solid execution of the Consumer Direct Offense strategy globally  which fueled robust growth across all four geographies  as well as innovation  Additionally  continued strength in NIKE digital globally  led by Greater China  drove the top line On a currency neutral basis  revenues grew 10   driven by gains from investments in innovation and digital  This resulted in robust global consumer demand driven growth across all geographies Operating SegmentsRevenues for the NIKE Brand increased 7  to  10 096 million  while constant dollar revenues for the brand were up 10   Results gained from continued growth in NIKE direct and its wholesale business  Moreover  strength in nearly all major categories  led by sportswear and the Jordan brand  as well as improvements in footwear and apparel fueled the top line Within the NIKE Brand  revenues improved 4  in North America  up 4  on a currency neutral basis   owing to continued growth in NIKE digital and strong results for the sportswear category  led by the Jordan brand  The company is gaining from efforts to reshape the North America market  with more than 30  growth in NIKE digital and high single digit growth across key differentiated partners  The company s investments in delivering differentiated partner experiences are driven by efforts like testing new services and leveraging the NIKE app in partner doors In EMEA  the company s revenues increased 6   up 12  on a currency neutral basis   backed by double digit growth in NIKE digital and broad based growth across all categories  Per the company  NIKE brand  being the consumers  favorite in all key cities across EMEA  drove growth in the region  Notably  EMEA includes five of NIKE s 12 key cities  Further  the company delivered double digit growth in London  Berlin and Milan  Apart from NIKE digital  the company s sustained growth in the region is fueled by partnerships like JD and Zalando In Greater China  the company delivered 21 straight quarters of double digit growth  Revenues rose 22  year over year  up 27  on a currency neutral basis   Results were aided by growth in almost all key categories  led by sportswear and Jordan  Further  the company continues to witness unmatched digital growth in the region  with NIKE digital up 70  in the reported quarter  The growth was partly aided by partnerships with Tmall and WeChat  Further  the company anticipates gaining from the launch of the NIKE app in Greater China  which is now scheduled for late second quarter fiscal 2020 In APLA  NIKE witnessed a 6  revenue decline  up 13  on a currency neutral basis   Currency neutral growth in the region was fueled by nearly 50  increase in NIKE digital  The digital business gained from the launch of the NIKE app in retail stores across key city  Tokyo  Growth was also driven by a double digit increase in the Jordan brand  driven by the culture of basketball in the region Revenues at the Converse brand rose 5  to  555 million  On a currency neutral basis  revenues of the segment were up 8   owing to double digit growth in Asia and strength in the global digital business  partly offset by declines in the United States  The quarter also marked the brand s return to growth in Europe Costs   MarginsGross profit rose 11  to  4 871 million  while gross margin expanded 150 basis points  bps  to 45 7   This expansion was mainly driven by an increase in average selling prices and margin expansion in NIKE Direct  partly negated by adverse currency rates and higher product costs Selling and administrative expenses rose 9  to  3 328 million  driven by continued investments in digital transformation  brand marketing related to the Women s World Cup and the launch of the Joyride innovation  As a percentage of sales  SG A expenses grew 40 bps to 31 2   These also resulted in higher operating overheads and demand creation expenses  Notably  demand creation expenses increased 6  year over year to  1 018 million  due to increased advertising costs and sports marketing investments Operating overheads were up 10  to  2 310 million  reflecting higher wage related and administrative expenses  These included continued investments in transformational initiatives  particularly in NIKE digital and global operations Balance Sheet   Shareholder Friendly MovesNIKE ended fiscal 2019 with cash and short term investments of  3 644 million  long term debt  excluding current maturities  of  3 463 million and shareholders  equity of  9 200 million  As of Aug 31  2019  inventories increased 12  to  5 835 million In the fiscal first quarter  NIKE bought back 11 9 million shares for  995 million  under its four year  15 billion share repurchase program approved in June 2018  As of Aug 31  the company has repurchased 23 5 million shares for nearly  2 billion  under this program OutlookDespite the volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical environment  NIKE expects to continue investing in key capabilities to aid digital transformation and deliver robust growth in fiscal 2020 and beyond  Consequently  the company retained most parts of its initial guidance for fiscal 2020  It continues to expect high single digit revenue growth on a reported basis  slightly up from the increase witnessed in fiscal 2019 Gross margin for the fiscal year is expected to expand 50 75 bps compared with a 50 bp expansion projected earlier  Gross margin growth for the year is likely to be partly offset by the negative impacts of the recently imposed tariffs  However  gross margin gains in the fiscal first quarter  driven by timing shifts and other discrete items  should aid growth The company expects SG A expenses to increase almost in line with revenues in fiscal 2020  including a slight impact from the recent Celect buyout  Other expenses  net of interest expenses  are anticipated to increase  50  100 million  Effective tax rate is expected to be in the mid to high teens range For second quarter fiscal 2020  the company expects revenue growth to be in line with the first quarter fiscal 2020 level  On a currency neutral basis  it expects strong revenues  despite a negative impact of nearly 3 points from foreign currency translations Gross margin for the fiscal second quarter is estimated to expand 25 bps  reflecting slightly higher growth than expected for the second half of fiscal 2020  The company expects pronounced impacts from the recently enacted tariffs in the fiscal second quarter Further  the company expects SG A expenses to increase high single digit  Other expenses  net of interest expenses  are anticipated to increase  10  30 million  Effective tax rate is expected to be in the mid teens range

There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Currently  both Carter s and Nike are holding a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
CRI currently has a forward P E ratio of 13 73  while NKE has a forward P E of 30 79  We also note that CRI has a PEG ratio of 1 72  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  NKE currently has a PEG ratio of 2 43 
Another notable valuation metric for CRI is its P B ratio of 4 93  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  NKE has a P B of 15 58

191068,412584,NKE,Athletics  UKA launches review into handling of Nike Oregon Project issues,news,"LONDON  Reuters    UK Athletics  UKA  has commissioned an independent review into the processes under which issues concerning the  Nike   NYSE NKE  Oregon Project  NOP  were investigated in 2015 and 2017 after distance running coach Alberto Salazar was banned for four years  it said on Thursday 
American Salazar was banned in September by the U S  Anti Doping Agency  USADA  for  orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct  as head coach of the NOP 
The NOP was set up mainly to develop U S  endurance runners but athletes from other countries  including Britain s Olympic 5 000 and 10 000 meters champion Mo Farah  also trained there 
 UKA     commissioned the independent review to review the processes under which the issues concerning the NOP were investigated in 2015 and 2017 and the subsequent related decisions made by the UKA board at those respective times   the national governing body said in a statement  
 The independent review will also set out any recommendations to assist UKA ensure its future governance and assurance framework is robust  
The review aims to address questions such as whether the UKA sought advice from UK Sport  UK Anti Doping  UKAD  and USADA in relation to the issues that came up and whether informed decisions were made based on evidence available at the time 
UKA said in October that its 2015 investigation  which cleared Farah to work with Salazar  was  restricted to the interaction of the Nike Oregon Project with Mo Farah and not an anti doping investigation  
UKA chairman Chris Clark said his organization would publish its findings early next year 
 The UKA Board recognizes the seriousness of the USADA decision released at the start of October   Clark said   It has unanimously agreed that an independent review should now be carried out 
 We need to ensure we have a clear way forward that gives us confidence in the integrity of our coaching efforts   he added 
 If there are lessons to be learned  we plan to implement any recommendations into a future focused  transparent and accountable way of working  
The Court of Arbitration for Sport  CAS  said this month that it had registered an appeal from Salazar  who has denied any wrongdoing  with hearings unlikely to take place before March 2020 ",2019-11-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/athletics-uka-launches-review-into-handling-of-nike-oregon-project-issues-2030036,2030036

However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Nike  NYSE NKE  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this athletic apparel maker is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Nike is 9 3   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 19 1  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 6 9  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio  also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio  but it is an important feature of a real growth stock  This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Nike has an S TA ratio of 1 67  which means that the company gets  1 67 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 1 3  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
In addition to efficiency in generating sales  sales growth plays an important role  And Nike is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too  The company s sales are expected to grow 8  this year versus the industry average of 2  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Nike  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1 4  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Nike a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that Nike is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-09-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-growth-investors-shouldnt-overlook-nike-nke-200469138,200469138

191074,412590,NKE,Record busting shoes loom large in marathon debate,news,"By Amy Tennery
NEW YORK  Reuters    A shoe debate is raging ahead of Sunday s New York City Marathon after high tech sneakers played starring roles in two of the biggest distance running achievements this year 
Eliud Kipchoge s sub two hour marathon in Vienna and Brigid Kosgei s record breaking run at the Chicago Marathon last month brought the  Nike   NYSE NKE  Vaporfly shoes into focus  sparking heated debate over whether the hyper advanced footwear gave an unfair advantage 
Shalane Flanagan  who won in New York in 2017  told Reuters the running community should  always question what s going on  in her sport but said the debate should not overshadow individual performances 
 You could give the pair of shoes to Joe Shmo off the street   they can t go run what Eliud ran or Brigid Kosgei   said Flanagan  a Nike athlete who recently retired from competition and was consulted in the creation of the shoe 
 It s up to other companies now to match the innovation or the IAAF needs to come in and say  we re not having this innovation as part of our sport    the American added 
The International Association of Athletics Federations  IAAF  established a working group months before Kipchoge s historic run to establish whether the shoes were fair and expects the group to report back before the end of the year 
 The challenge is striking a balance between spurring development of  new technologies  while preserving  the fundamental characteristics of the sport    the association said in a statement 
IAAF rules state  shoes must not be constructed so as to give athletes any unfair assistance or advantage  and that  any type of shoe used must be reasonably available to all  
Nike said they  respect the IAAF and the spirit of their rules  in the running sphere 
 The shoe that Brigid wore in Chicago is the Nike ZoomX Vaporfly NEXT   In Vienna  Eliud wore a future version of the Nike Vaporfly that is currently unreleased   a Nike spokesperson said   However  a shoe is only one factor in a race  and Eliud s incredible run should be acknowledged  
Retired marathoner Meb Keflezighi  who won the New York City Marathon 10 years ago  told Reuters credit still belonged to the athletes despite high tech advances 
 You ve got to have the lungs  you ve got to have put in the work and all that   the Olympic silver medalist said   If there s a lot of aid at the end I m pretty sure it will make a difference  
Athletics is not the only sport to consider reining in the use of advanced technology in competition  In 2010  high tech suits were banned from swimming amid a glut of broken records 
 It s super frustrating that someone has an amazing race and we go  what are they wearing   It s not just the athlete anymore   2018 Boston Marathon winner Des Linden told reporters in New York 
 It s going to become   well  it is    an arms race and it should be a foot race   said Linden   We should find out who  is  the best athlete and who can cover 26 2  miles  better than the other person  not who has the newest  greatest technology  ",2019-11-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/recordbusting-shoes-loom-large-in-marathon-debate-2010500,2010500

SAO PAULO  Reuters    Brazilian mid sized lender  Banco Inter SA   SA BIDI4  on Thursday launched a smartphone app offering clients direct access to more than 60 stores selling products from appliances to sneakers to beauty products 
The launch marks Banco Inter s latest move beyond its existing free checking accounts to lure more clients and increase profitability by becoming a one stop shop for everything 
Among its retail partners are Alibaba s  N BABA  AliExpress  Lojas Americanas SA  SA LAME4   Natura Cosmeticos SA  SA NATU3    Nike  Inc  N NKE    Carrefour   PA CARR  Brasil  SA CRFB3  and HP Inc  N HPQ  
Chief Executive Joao Vitor Menin said in an interview with Reuters that he expects the so called super app to help the bank attract new clients  either at a faster pace or at a lower cost 
Menin said the bank could reach roughly 8 million clients by December 2020  more than double its current 3 3 million consumers 
The lender  in which SoftBank Group Corp  T 9984  bought a 14 9  stake earlier this year  will share a portion of commissions from the third party vendors on the app with its clients in the form of cash back rebates  The commissions will also provide the bank a new revenue stream 
Some analysts still doubt whether such multi function apps  widely used in China and elsewhere in Asia  will catch on in Latin America s largest economy 
 A bank s app is one that people use more recurrently   he said   So we believe clients will buy products and services through Inter s app  It will prove to be easier

Robust Sales Trend Continues 
Nike continued its robust sales trend in Q1 by investing in selling more sneakers and apparel in its stores  Designing high tech sneakers  fashionable athleisure apparel  and opening new stores to avoid selling their products in discount outlets have also helped Nike stimulate growth  Nike CEO  Mark Parker  cited  the global shift towards more active lifestyles continues to accelerate  and demand for athletic product is high   as additional catalysts for the sales surge 
Nike s subscription based service for kids  shoes helped the firm have its best back to school season ever in kids  sales  Consumers have the option of signing up for a plan that would deliver a new pair of shoes to them either quarterly  bi monthly  or monthly  Clients on the 90 day delivery plan pay  20 a month  bi monthly users pay  30 a month  and monthly subscribers pay  50 a month 
The move is Nike s latest initiative to cement itself in the US kid s footwear market  which is valued at around  10 billion  The footwear giant is also reportedly looking into offering a subscription for running shoes  The potential move would make sense as consumers who are avid runners go through shoes more often than the average person

For fiscal 2020  Nike continues to expect revenue growth in the high single digit range and anticipates gross margin to expand 50 75 basis points  The firm s CFO  Andy Campion  stated that even  amid the increasingly volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical environment  we expect our unrelenting focus on better serving the consumer to continue fueling strong  broad based growth across our global portfolio  
Nike has actively been expanding its portfolio as it has had a recent slew of acquisitions of some tech startups like predictive analytics company Celect  This past August s acquisition of Celect can put Nike in a better position to better predict what style of sneakers and apparel consumers will most likely want as well as when and where they d want it from  This acquisition is a move that the company s competitors are not doing  which shows that Nike is trying to think outside of the box and is truly focused on expanding its iconic brand 
The Celect acquisition comes after NIKE absorbed the consumer data analytics firm Zodiac and the computer vision company Invertex last year  Both firms helped Nike successfully launch a digital initiative to better incorporate themselves in the digital marketplace  Nike seems to be making many moves that put the company in a separate category from the rest of its industry peers  Shares have seen solid growth in 2019  and the firm s fundamentals continue to impress Wall Street  NKE sits at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  with a Style Score of A in Growth

191082,412598,NKE,Pence backs Hong Kong protests in China speech  slams NBA and Nike,news,"By Alexandra Alper and Matt Spetalnick WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday accused China of curtailing  rights and liberties  in Hong Kong and blasted U S  company  Nike  and the National Basketball Association for falling in line with Beijing in a disagreement over free speech  In a major policy speech on China that touched on an array of disputes ahead of talks with Beijing to ease a trade war  Pence said the United States does not seek confrontation or to  de couple  from its main economic rival  But he pulled no punches when addressing some of the political rifts between the two countries  Criticizing China s construction of a  surveillance state   and  increasingly provocative  military action  Pence held up Taiwan s Democracy as a better path for Chinese people and took Beijing to task for its handling of pro democracy protests that have rocked Hong Kong for more than four months   Hong Kong is a living example of what can happen when China embraces liberty   he said   And yet  for the last few years  Beijing has increased its interventions in Hong Kong and engaged in actions that curtail the rights and liberties that Hong Kong s people were guaranteed through a binding international agreement   He said the United States stands with the protesters in Hong Kong  millions of whom have taken to the streets in sometimes violent clashes over what they see as China s tightening grip    We stand with you  we are inspired by you  We urge you to stay on the path of non violent protest   Pence said in his address at a Washington think tank   He also slammed China for its treatment of Muslim Uighurs in the Xinjiang region   Pence directed some of his harshest words at sports apparel giant Nike  N NKE  and the NBA  which he accused of siding with China s Communist Party over freedom of speech in Hong Kong  The vice president  who is often the face of the Trump administration s tougher policies on China  said the NBA and Nike had failed to defend basketball team Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey  after he tweeted support of Hong Kong protesters earlier this month    Some of the NBA s biggest players and owners  who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country  lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of other peoples   he said   By  siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech  the NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime   Pence said   Nike stores in China removed Rockets merchandise after Beijing criticized Morey  Pence noted   Nike promotes itself as a so called social justice champion  but when it comes to Hong Kong  it prefers checking its social conscience at the door   he said   Pence said  far too many American multinational corporations have kowtowed to the lure of China s money and markets by muzzling not only criticism of the Chinese Communist Party  but even affirmative expressions of American values    Nike  the NBA and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the remarks   TRADE TALKS  The closely watched speech set a discordant tone just weeks before a summit in Chile where U S  President Donald Trump hopes to finalize a partial trade deal with China s Xi Jinping   The S P 500 U S  stock index briefly moved lower after his comments  Analysts said Pence s speech appeared aimed at keeping the way open for a trade deal while seeking to convince Trump s support base that he was tough on China going into the 2020 election  Douglas Paal  a China expert with Washington s Carnegie Endowment for International Peace  called it  a superficial and political speech  not a guiding strategic document   Scott Kennedy  of the Center for Strategic and International Studies  saw it as an bid to provide rationale for  policy moves on security  economics and politics which originally were much less coordinated and less integrated    A new round of talks between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese officials to try to end the bruising trade dispute is set for Friday  The United States launched a trade war with China 15 months ago  alleging unfair trading practices such as theft of U S  intellectual property and generous industrial subsidies at the expense of foreign competitors   Fears of antagonizing Beijing had prompted the White House to postpone Pence s speech  which was originally scheduled for June  ahead of a meeting Trump and Xi aimed at getting trade talks back on track   Many China watchers had expected Pence to tread lightly on sensitive topics on Thursday  in sharp contrast to the bombastic tone of his first major China policy address a year ago  But some saw signs of a rapprochement as well    In contrast to the Hudson Institute speech of October 2018  the Vice President s equally hard hitting Wilson speech offered the beginnings of a positive vision for U S  China relations   said Robert Daly of the Kissinger Institute on China   
Pence said the United States was  not seeking to contain China s development    We want a constructive relationship with China s leaders   he said  calling on Beijing to  seize this unique moment in history to start anew by ending the trade practices that have taken advantage of the American people for far too long  ",2019-10-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/pence-takes-aim-at-china-on-hong-kong-in-major-policy-speech-2003449,2003449

U S  Vice President Mike Pence criticized China s actions against protesters in Hong Kong while calling for greater engagement between the world s two biggest economies  delivering a long anticipated critique of Beijing s human rights record as the two nations try to resolve their trade war 
 Beijing has increased its interventions in Hong Kong and engaged in actions that curtail the rights and liberties that Hong Kong s people were guaranteed through a binding international agreement   Pence said Thursday in a speech at the Wilson Center in Washington 
Addressing the demonstrators  Pence said   We stand with you  
Pence s speech comes at a crucial time in the U S  China relationship as the two countries remain locked in a trade war and jostle for military and commercial dominance in the Pacific  White House officials have debated for weeks how critical Pence should be  underscoring the stakes of his remarks  which come just a day before negotiators talk about progress toward agreeing on a phase one agreement over trade 
The vice president was careful to balance his criticism with an olive branch  Rather than  decoupling  the two countries  the U S   seeks engagement with China and China s engagement with the wider world   he said   Despite the great power competition that is underway and America s growing strength  we want better for China  
Pence s most stinging criticism of China was indirect  in remarks targeting  Nike  Inc  NYSE NKE   and the NBA 
 Nike promotes itself as a so called  social justice champion   but when it comes to Hong Kong  it prefers checking its social conscience at the door   Pence said 
Representatives for Nike and the NBA didn t respond to requests for comment 
Delayed Speech
He accused the NBA of  siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech   The league apologized after an executive of the Houston Rockets issued a tweet supportive of Hong Kong protesters  outraging Chinese authorities and many NBA fans in the country 
 The NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime   Pence said 
Pence was originally supposed to deliver the speech on June 4  which marked the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square  NYSE SQ  massacre  The administration ultimately delayed the speech in the hopes that President Donald Trump would land a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 leaders  summit in Osaka later that month 
Trump is aiming to sign a limited trade deal with Xi next month  and a weakening American economy is chipping away at the U S  s leverage 
Meanwhile  pressure is building from Capitol Hill to stay firm  highlighting White House moves this month to sanction Chinese entities accused of connections to the surveillance and imprisonment of Muslim Uighurs in the northwestern region of Xinjiang 
National Security
Unrest in Hong Kong has underscored the heated tensions as many U S  lawmakers are pressing for legislation to support pro democracy protesters despite a threat of retaliation from China 
Leland Miller  chief executive officer of China Beige Book  said the administration is engaged in somewhat of a good cop  bad cop approach to China 
 Markets tend to assume the administration s China policy is monolithic  swinging either hawkish or dovish based on the president s moods  but that s not really the case   Miller said   Since late August the White House has certainly turned more dovish on trade  but on the national security side  hawks continue to run the show  
Analysts say it s hard to predict how the Chinese will react but caution it s unlikely that Beijing will hit back at the vice president directly  if they don t agree with elements of the speech 
Trade Pact
Under the terms of the partial trade arrangement reached earlier this month  Chinese spending on U S  farm goods will scale to an annual figure of  40 billion to  50 billion over two years  according to the White House  China would also agree to certain intellectual property measures and concessions related to financial services and currency 
In exchange  the U S  delayed a tariff increase scheduled for Oct  15    to 30  from 25  on about  250 billion of Chinese imports  More duties on Chinese products  targeted for Dec  15  haven t yet been called off 
While the limited agreement may resolve some short term issues  several of the thorniest disputes remain outstanding  U S  goals in the trade war center around accusations of intellectual property theft  forced technology transfer and complaints about Chinese industrial subsidies

191085,412601,NKE,In a Nike factory in Argentina s hinterland  the ghost of Macri s fall,news,"By Cassandra Garrison and Marina Lammertyn
ELDORADO  Argentina  Reuters    Rumors of layoffs started spreading among workers at a factory here in northeastern Argentina making  Nike  Inc  N NKE  shoes the night before Cristian Fredy Aquino s scheduled shift 
When his key card for the turnstile failed  Aquino realized the rumors were true  The plant was cutting hundreds of workers as orders from the U S  apparel giant stalled  amid a swirling economic crisis that has plunged the country into recession for most of the last year 
The Nike factory in Misiones province  one of Argentina s poorest  is proving to be the tip of the iceberg  Around Argentina  nearly 16 000 textile and shoe factory workers have lost their jobs in the last year  according to government data  including nearly a quarter of all shoe sector workers 
And the outlook is darkening  the peso currency has tumbled  interest rates are above 60  and annual inflation nearly 54  
In this lush jungle town with dusty red dirt roads  laid off workers  union delegates and locals Reuters spoke with on a recent trip had one person to blame  President Mauricio Macri  who was defeated outright in a general election on Sunday 
Macri  who came to power in late 2015 as a business friendly candidate to industry cheers  moved to cut trade barriers  helping bolster overseas ties and increase competition for domestic suppliers  That compounded an unexpectedly sharp economic downturn since last year that has hammered consumer spending inside the country 
At the Nike plant in Eldorado that meant the factory was up against a wave of cheaper imports even as local manufacturing costs got higher  As costs rose  importing finished products became a more attractive option  industry experts said 
 It s just another job the government is getting rid of   Aquino said of his first thought upon learning that the owner of the Misiones plant  Brazil s Dass Group  was cutting workers last December 
Aquino spoke to Reuters on the porch of the modest brick house where he lives with his wife and two children  He said his home was possible thanks to the previous government of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  vice president on the winning ticket on Sunday 
 I worked seven and a half years for the company  With my earnings  I could eat and support my family   said Aquino  who said he has since taken on an informal job as a driver to make ends meet   I can t let my children be in need  
Nike declined to comment on the reason for cutting back on its orders at the Misiones plant  but said in a statement it  continues to evaluate our sourcing strategy based on seasonal needs and the local marketplace  
Representatives from Dass Group  the Brazilian company that runs the factory  and the shoe workers  union  UTICRA  both blamed the job cuts on a steep 70  drop in shoe orders from Nike  which accounts for nearly all the factory s work 
The dynamics in Eldorado are a key reason Argentina s left leaning Peronists have toppled market friendly conservative Macri  whose popularity was hit as industries from carmakers to vinters in the country have reeled from falling sales 
 Production is down because of what is happening in the country  a drastic fall in consumption  It s a reality that is affecting us all   said Dario Vera  the factory s delegate for shoe workers  union UTICRA 
He said the sector had taken a turn for the worse in recent years under Macri s more open door policies  such as slashing red tape that required importers to seek authorization from the national revenue service  Vera pointed to another factory closure in Chivilcoy near Buenos Aires last December after Nike rival Adidas AG  DE ADSGn  cut back orders 
The union  he said  was now supporting Fernandez  who has pledged to support domestic industry and revive local consumption  and could roll back some of Macri s free trade policies to appease powerful worker unions 
HIGH PRICE TO PAY
The malaise in Misiones  a province sandwiched between Brazil and Paraguay  reflects a wider struggle for Argentina s clothing and textile sectors  which have been hit by a 14 6  drop in retail sales in the first seven months of 2019  according to government data based on shopping mall purchases 
Around the country  the textile and shoe sectors employ 107 000 people  the latest labor ministry data show  down around 13  over the last year  The shoe segment is down 23  
There were over 1 4 million unemployed people in Argentina in the second quarter of the year  an increase of 200 000 people versus the same period in 2018  government data show 
 With high tax pressure on the sector  plus recession and a very high interest rate  all that combined    means the sector produces less   said Jose Depena  director of the finance department at the University of CEMA in Buenos Aires 
He said that the mainly small and medium sized firms which make up the bulk of the sector were very capital intensive  with little automation to cut costs 
That means locally made clothes often come with a high price tag in the South American country  which has driven demand for cheaper imports that have risen steadily since 2015  hitting a peak last year of  331 million  industry data show 
 Making textiles here is unbearable because we have so many steps in the middle   said Gabriel Cures Sastre of Buenos Aires based trade focused consultancy GCS Commercial 
 Cutting the fabric  sewing it  doing the glue for the pockets  All of these processes end up as high added value and the product becomes very expensive  
 INDISCRIMINATE IMPORTS 
Vera  the Eldorado factory s delegate for UTICRA  said in recent years Nike had started importing 20 000 pairs of shoes daily   nearly the same amount the plant once produced  The union has called for rules to avoid  indiscriminate imports  
 In Eldorado  we are living a complex  sad situation  Being in a city that s not very big and being away from the big cities is a difficult situation for us   said Vera 
At its peak  the factory employed 1 500 workers and churned out 23 000 pairs of Nike shoes per day for the domestic market  factory officials said  It was the largest of 12 Nike manufacturers in Argentina  Nike s own manufacturing map shows 
Now production has dwindled to just 7 000 pairs daily 
Around 400 workers have lost their jobs since the layoffs started in December last year  Another 300 are set to be let go as soon as this week and hundreds more by the end of the year as orders dwindle further  Vera said 
Flavio Eduardo Olea  human resources and labor relations manager at the factory  said the plant was pursuing talks with Nike to stem the decline  but things were looking grim   a reflection of Argentina s challenge ahead to revive growth 




 The company  with this amount of workers that are left  would be economically unfeasible   he said ",2019-10-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/in-a-nike-factory-in-argentinas-hinterland-the-ghost-of-macris-fall-2005438,2005438

191093,412609,NKE,Athletics  New shoes put spring in marathoners  step,news,"By Steve Keating
 Reuters    Two remarkable marathon marks were breached in one spectacular weekend    one had belonged to Paula Radcliffe while the other broke the mythical sub two hour milestone    and both were accomplished with the help of space age shoes 
On a pancake flat course in Vienna on Oct  12  escorted by a rotation of 41 world class pacemakers  Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge stretched the limits of human endeavor by becoming the first person to run a marathon in under two hours 
A day later in Chicago  Radcliffe watched her 16 year old women s marathon world record fall to another Kenyan  Brigid Kosgei crossed the finishing line in two hours 14 minutes four seconds to smash Radcliffe s mark by 81 seconds 
Two different races  on two different courses on two different continents with one big similarity  both were wearing revolutionary specially designed  Nike   NYSE NKE  shoes  which critics argue come with a  spring like mechanism  that aids performance 
Those extraordinary performances have sparked a debate that continues to rage  Were these feats a triumph of the human spirit or technological doping 
 It is the nature of everything  technology is always improving and it is like the technology we have now to put a flu vaccine in place to stop people from getting sick   Radcliffe  promoting a campaign to get fellow asthma sufferers to take flu seriously and get the life protecting vaccine  told Reuters in a telephone interview 
 I think we need to put rules in place to make sure it is as fair as possible certainly in a sporting arena but the nature of humans is that we are continually improving   added Radcliffe 
While Radcliffe sees a need to ensure fairness  the 45 year old Briton did not sound any alarms 
The sport has seen a dramatic change from 1960 when Ethiopia s barefoot Abebe Bikila won the Rome Olympic marathon in two hours  15 minutes  16 seconds 
The top five times in men s marathons plus Kipchoge s unofficial record of 1 59 40 minutes set in Vienna were all run in the revolutionary footwear in the last 13 months 
LEGAL SHOES 
International Association of Athletics Federations  IAAF  rules say that an athlete can run barefoot  or even with one shoe but Rule 143 2 states   shoes must not be constructed so as to give athletes any unfair assistance or advantage  and that  any type of shoe used must be reasonably available to all  
Recent social media chatter  however  indicates that the IAAF is concerned enough that has launched an investigation into whether the new shoes are legal 
Contacted by Reuters the IAAF did not immediately respond for a request for confirmation 
Athletics is far from the first sport to wrestle with technology  Swimming  fast suits   tennis rackets  golf balls and putters have forced all of their sport governing bodies to step in with strict regulations 
Swimming took the extraordinary step in 2010 of banning high tech suits after dozens of records were being set at almost every meet 
Like climbing Mount Everest  runners will continue to attempt to scale higher peaks said Radcliffe  whether in high tech shoes or bare feet 
 The beauty around the two hours is because it was there   said Radcliffe 
 In the women s race  we don t actually know where that barrier equivalent might lie  The mythical element of that big number is to be broken through 
 I think it is a continued progression for people to improve and they are always looking to improve further  just the same as any area of life  ",2019-10-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/athletics-new-shoes-put-spring-in-marathoners-step-2000585,2000585

Overview and Q4 Recap 
The athletic wear giant sells its products to more than 23 000 retail accounts in the US and to over 24 000 retail accounts outside the US  reaching a wide array of consumers  The firm s execution of its Consumer Direct Offense initiative as well as strength in the NIKE direct business has driven a robust sales trend 
Q4 2019 marked the company s ninth straight revenue beat but earnings fell short of our consensus estimate  snapping its 28 quarter streak of earnings beats  The company reported net sales of  10 2 billion  jumping 4  from the year ago quarter  earnings fell 10  to  0 66 per share as administrative expenses and tax rates were deterrents in Q4  The NIKE brand grew 5  to  9 71 billion and the Converse brand dropped 4  to  491 million 
Within the NIKE Brand  the North America segment gained 7  thanks to continued growth in digital and significant market share gains across its wholesale partners  Continued innovation in their footwear department as well as strong demand in apparel also supplemented North American sales  Europe  Middle East  and Africa  EMEA  division sales were flat in the quarter but the firm reported that NIKE Digital grew 35   Greater China continues to provide consistent growth for Nike as it rose 16  Y Y  bringing in  1 7 billion in sales  Asia Pacific and Latin America sales came in at  1 38 billion in Q4  slipping 4  due to falloffs in footwear and apparel sales 
Q1 and Beyond 
Nike reiterated its fiscal 2020 guidance in Q4 as it expects strong sales results driven by brand recognition and the Nike Direct initiative  The company also expects higher SG A expenses and adverse currency to be headwinds for its bottom line 
Our consensus estimates anticipate for total sales to grow 5 05  to  10 45 billion while earnings rise 5 97  to  0 71 per share  The NIKE brand is projected to rake in  9 88 billion and the Converse brand is forecasted to bring in  538 million for jumps of 4 85  and 2 13   respectively  North America and Greater China sales are expected to continue their growth campaign with respective gains of 4 94  and 13 2   The EMEA division is expected to see growth of 1 38  while Asia Pacific and Latin America is projected to increase 2 24  in Q1 
Fiscal 2020 estimates call for a 16 06  bottom line rally to  2 89 per share on the back of a 7 78  sales leap to  42 16 billion  NIKE brand products are projected to rise 7 87  and the Converse brand is expected to climb 2 57

BEIJING  Reuters    The National Basketball Association  NBA  is pressing ahead with a exhibition game on Thursday in Shanghai  despite a Chinese backlash against the league after a Houston Rockets executive s tweet supporting pro democracy protests in Hong Kong 
The NBA on Thursday published a post on Chinese social networking platform Weibo promoting the match between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets  accompanied by a short clip featuring star players LeBron James and Kyrie Irving 
The game is scheduled to begin at 7 30 p m   1130 GMT  
NBA events scheduled on Tuesday and Wednesday were canceled and Chinese sponsors and partners suspended or severed ties with the league after Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted last week supporting anti government protests in Chinese ruled Hong Kong 
The NBA said in an email on Thursday that players and personnel would not be made available to the media  The league had scheduled a briefing before and after the game  and NBA commissioner Adam Silver had been expected to address the media 
State broadcaster CCTV and Tencent  HK 0700  will not show Thursday s game or the rematch scheduled for Saturday in Shenzhen on their platforms  underscoring the severity of the backlash 
The Hong Kong protests began in opposition to a bill allowing extradition to mainland China but have since evolved into broader calls for democracy  China has accused the West of stirring up anti Beijing sentiment in Hong Kong  and Chinese state media has characterized Morey s tweet as the latest example of meddling in China s own affairs 
Silver spoke out in support of Morey s freedom of expression on Tuesday  further angering Beijing  The NBA s business in China  which took years to cultivate and is estimated to be worth more than  4 billion  is under immense pressure 
The NBA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Saturday s Lakers Nets game would take place 
ROCKETS GOODS DISAPPEAR
Houston Rockets sneakers and other merchandise were pulled from several  Nike   N NKE  and NBA stores in major Chinese cities  with the franchise s direct association with Morey making it a central target of the furor  Managers at some of the Nike stores said they had been instructed to remove the goods via an internal memo from management

CHICAGO  Reuters    The winds of change are roiling through the sport of endurance running as athletes descend on the Windy City for Sunday s Chicago Marathon  with one of the sport s longstanding figureheads conspicuously out of the picture 
American Alberto Salazar  who has coached some of the world s top distance runners  including the marathon s two most recent men s champions  was handed a four year ban less than two weeks ago for doping violations 
The head coach of the elite  Nike   NYSE NKE  Oregon Project  NOP  was sanctioned for  orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct   the U S  Anti Doping Agency  USADA  said 
Salazar said he plans to appeal against the ruling 
Although he faced years of suspicion and allegations  his suspension nonetheless shocked the sport  with 2018 and 2017 Chicago Marathon Champions Mo Farah and Galen Rupp among his most decorated pupils 
Reigning champion Farah  who won Olympic gold in the 5 000  and 10 000 metres at both the 2012 and 2016 Games  worked with Salazar from 2011 to 2017 
Jordan Hasay  a top contender on the women s side  was still working with Salazar at the time of his suspension  as was 2017 Chicago winner Rupp 
Farah said after Salazar s suspension was announced that he has no tolerance for rule breakers  Neither he  Rupp nor Hasay were accused of wrongdoing in the USADA report 
Chicago Marathon Director Carey Pinkowski told Reuters on Thursday that he and the event embraced the announcement about Salazar 
 What you re seeing is the emotion of not only that announcement but it s been many years of frustration and challenge and it s been brought out in the light of day   said Pinkowski  who is celebrating his 30th year overseeing the marathon 
 For us as leaders of the industry  I think it s an opportunity for us to move forward  
The 42nd running of the race sees an elite field stacked with talent  with this year s Boston Marathon champion Lawrence Cherono of Kenya joining American Rupp and Briton Farah among the top contenders 
On the women s side  Hasay is on the hunt for her first ever major marathon title  while reigning Chicago winner Brigid Kosgei of Kenya will look to build on her momentum after claiming victory at the London Marathon in April 
In the men s wheelchair division  veteran 10 times Boston Marathon champion Ernst Van Dyk will battle against 21 year old Dan Romanchuk  who last year won in Chicago and became the youngest athlete to win the New York Marathon

NEW YORK  Reuters    British Olympic champion Mo Farah defended his reputation at a news conference ahead of the Chicago Marathon on Friday after being bombarded with questions about his former coach Alberto Salazar who has been banned for doping violations 
Farah  who has not been accused of any wrongdoing  worked from 2011 to 2017 with Salazar  who was given a four year ban by the U S  Anti Doping Agency  USADA  on Sept  30 
The 36 year old Farah  speaking for the first time since Salazar was suspended  responded angrily to questions about his former mentor  with whom he achieved some of his best performances 
 It s very disappointing to see you guys going at it again and again  and headlines   Farah  Farah  Farah    he said 
 I ll just say there s no allegation against me  I ve not done anything wrong 
 If I tell you guys and talk to you guys and be nice to you  you ll still be negative  If I don t talk to you  you ll still be negative 
 I m aware I can t win  You re already made up your mind what you re going to write    that is a fact  
Asked if he regretted staying with Salazar  particularly after a 2015 BBC documentary made a series of allegations against the American  Farah said he had confronted his coach 
 I was out in Birmingham  England  racing  I pulled out  of  the race in 2015   he told reporters   I wanted some answers and I flew to Portland to get some answers from Alberto 
 Talked to him face to face and he assured me at the time   These are just allegations  This is not true  There are no allegations against you  Mo   He promised me  And that hasn t been true  
FARAH UNAWARE
Farah  who won Olympic gold in the 5 000 and 10 000 metres at the 2012 and 2016 Games  said he was unaware until after the ban was announced that Salazar was charged with doping in 2017 
Salazar has denied any wrongdoing and said he plans to appeal against the suspension 
Defending Chicago marathon champion Farah and 2017 winner American Galen Rupp plus women s marathon runner Jordan Hasay are among Salazar s most decorated athletes 
 Nike   NYSE NKE  announced on Thursday that it would shut down the Nike Oregon Project  the elite programme overseen by Salazar  where Rupp and Hasay trained 
Neither Rupp nor Hasay has been accused of any wrongdoing 
The 33 year old Rupp  who missed the Spring marathon season due to surgery  deflected questions about Salazar  saying he had had no  professional  contact with his long time coach since the announcement of the suspension 
Hasay  who like Rupp was coached by Salazar until the suspension  said she was  very  very close  to her coach and it was hard not speaking with him in the days before Sunday s race 
 I trust what I know and what I ve seen and I ve never been offered anything or seen anything   Hasay said   If that were to happen I would have left long ago  
In the days leading up to the Chicago Marathon  race director Carey Pinkowski said he viewed the Salazar announcement as  an opportunity to move forward  
Paula Radcliffe  a Nike ambassador who holds the world record for the women s marathon  told Reuters the sport still needed to work to clean up competition

191105,412621,NKE,Athletics  Shutting down Nike Oregon Project the  right thing    USADA,news,"By Amy Tennery
CHICAGO  Reuters    The U S  Anti Doping Agency  USADA  has praised the decision to shut down the  Nike   NYSE NKE  Oregon Project  NOP   saying on Friday it was a necessary step after the elite distance running program s leader  Alberto Salazar  was suspended for doping violations 
Nike on Thursday shuttered the famed program  with its stable of elite competitors who added to the company s authority in the world of distance running  calling it a  distraction  for its athletes 
Salazar was given a four year doping ban by USADA on Sept  30 but has denied wrongdoing and plans to appeal 
USADA CEO Travis Tygart said shutting down the NOP program was  the right thing  to do 
 Now let s hope they accept that mistakes were made and truly commit to clean sport and the health  well being of athletes   he said 
Nike declined to comment on the USADA statement but reiterated that the decision to fold the NOP was done  to allow the athletes to focus on their training and competition needs 
 This situation including uninformed innuendo and unsubstantiated assertions has become an unfair burden for current OP athletes   a Nike spokesperson said   We will continue to support Alberto in his appeal  
The decision to close the program came two days before the Chicago Marathon  with NOP athletes Galen Rupp  the race s 2017 champion  and women s contender Jordan Hasay among the favorites 
Hasay  who was coached by Salazar  said she found out about the shutdown on Thursday but was staying  laser focused  on Sunday s marathon 
 That was unfortunate news   said Hasay   I don t know if it was to be expected but it is what it is  
Neither Rupp nor Hasay have been accused of any wrongdoing 
Despite the void left by the closure of the Nike program  analysts said the company should be able to weather the controversy with its brand relatively intact 
 I d call this a minor sprain for Nike   said Bob Dorfman  a sports marketing expert at Baker Street Advertising 
Regarding the company s competitors  he said that while the controversy  may help Adidas  DE ADSGN  continue to close the wide earnings gap   Nike still reigns supreme

There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Right now  Skechers is sporting a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Nike has a Zacks Rank of  4  Sell   This means that SKX s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
SKX currently has a forward P E ratio of 16 36  while NKE has a forward P E of 30 13  We also note that SKX has a PEG ratio of 1 09  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  NKE currently has a PEG ratio of 2 32 
Another notable valuation metric for SKX is its P B ratio of 2 43  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  NKE has a P B of 15 18

191108,412624,NKE,Athletics  Tygart says Salazar ban a wake up call for sponsors,news,"DOHA  Reuters    Travis Tygart  the head of the United States Anti Doping Agency  USADA   on Thursday called for sponsors to step up their efforts in the fight against performance enhancing drugs 
Tygart was critical of sportswear giant  Nike  for their involvement with coach Alberto Salazar who on Tuesday was banned by USADA for four years for doping violations 
The Anti Doping Agency said Salazar was punished for  orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct  as head coach of the Nike Oregon Project  NOP   a camp designed primarily to develop U S  endurance athletes 
Nike has denied any role in administering performance enhancing drugs and said in a statement on Tuesday that it does not condone the use of banned substances 
Speaking to Reuters from Tokyo on Thursday  Tygart said it was time sponsors stepped up and did their part in the fight against doping 
 I hope it  a wake up call for all sponsors frankly  and others  to take a step back and say what s really important about sport and why companies invest in sport  why companies profit in sport   said the USADA chief 
 Fair play has to prevail  the rights and health and safety of athletes has to prevail    and not make excuses for things that are clearly unacceptable  
Endocrinologist Jeffrey Brown  who worked for NOP on performance enhancement and served as a physician for numerous athletes in the training program  also received a four year ban 
The USADA report cited emails showing Nike Inc  NYSE NKE  Chief Executive Mark Parker was made aware of experiments by Brown involving AndroGel  a topical testosterone cream that is banned 
A Wall Street Journal report quoted a Nike representative who said Salazar was concerned runners  could be sabotaged by someone rubbing testosterone cream on them  
Speaking via Skype Tygart told Reuters   Having testosterone experiments  as the panel pointed out to independent arbitrators  that were possibly in violation of federal law  you can t have it or distribute without prescription 
 So that being distributed to employees on Nike s campus with full awareness all the way to the top as the arbitration decision showed is just frankly unacceptable 
Salazar has said he will appeal the decision while Nike said it would stand by him 
 The  panel  decision had nothing to do with administering banned substances to any Oregon Project athlete   a Nike statement said on Tuesday 
 As the panel noted  they were struck by the amount of care Alberto took to ensure he was complying with the World Anti Doping code 
 Nike does not condone the use of banned substances in any manner  
However  Tygart said the lengthy USADA investigation had shown that athletes were  manipulated  and their medical records tampered with by Brown and Salazar 
He added that their health was put at risk by being given medication they did not need to improve athletic performance 
 Are we satisfied putting athletes at whatever age  whether they are elite Olympic athletes or young athletes  in a position where they are going to have to start a medical program and to some extent become guinea pigs   Tygart asked 
 So that is going to be part of this ongoing discussion  this medicalisation program of elite sport and the environment that puts athletes into  ",2019-10-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/athletics-tygart-says-salazar-ban-a-wakeup-call-for-sponsors-1991596,1991596
191109,412625,NKE,IOC wants more details on Salazar s athletes in doping case,news,"By Karolos Grohmann
LAUSANNE  Switzerland  Reuters    The International Olympic Committee  IOC  will ask the World Anti Doping Agency  WADA  for details regarding the case of American top running coach Alberto Salazar and the potential involvement of athletes in doping    witting or unwitting 
Salazar  who has coached some of the world s top distance runners  including Olympic and world champion Mo Farah  was banned for four years for doping violations by the U S  Anti Doping Agency  USADA  this week 
USADA said Salazar was punished for  orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct  as head coach of the  Nike  Oregon Project  NOP   a camp designed primarily to develop U S  endurance athletes 
But USADA did not sanction any athletes who might have been the recipients of this prohibited doping conduct  even inadvertently 
 We will follow up on questions that remain open   IOC President Thomas Bach told reporters on Thursday   The IOC will write a letter to WADA in this respect 
 First of all to see how many athletes have been investigated  Have all the athletes been investigated who were training in this center there   Bach said 
 Does the report address the whole period of the existence of this project or only part of it  Could there be any Olympic results affected directly or indirectly  
Salazar  who was a celebrated distance runner  winning three consecutive New York City marathons starting in 1980  has denied any wrongdoing and has vowed to appeal against the ban 
Bach said athletes operated under the strict liability concept which meant that whether they knew they were being given banned substances or not would have little impact on potential sanctions 
USADA said Salazar  who also coached American Olympian Matthew Centrowitz among other top distance runners  trafficked banned the performance enhancing substance testosterone to multiple athletes 
Salazar also tampered with or attempted to tamper with NOP athletes  doping control processes  the agency said after concluding its four year investigation 
The USADA report also cited emails showing that Nike Inc  NYSE NKE  Chief Executive Mark Parker was made aware of experiments involving AndroGel  a topical testosterone cream that is banned 
Nike  which sponsors many high profile runners  is standing by Salazar 
Nike has denied any role in administering performance enhancing drugs and said in a statement on Tuesday that it does not condone the use of banned substances 
Bach also said that the IOC would now begin storing samples of its pre Olympics testing program  which starts months before the Games  for up to 10 years to allow for re testing  as it is doing with Olympic Games samples taken from athletes 
 We would like to see such long term storage also for the pre Games testing program to increase and strengthen the deterrent effect this long term storage has   Bach said 
Many positive tests at past Olympics have been revealed years later during re tests ordered by the IOC and dozens of athletes have subsequently been stripped of their medals ",2019-10-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/ioc-wants-more-details-on-salazars-athletes-in-doping-case-1991600,1991600

191111,412627,NKE,Successful world championships no desert mirage in the end,news,"By Steve Keating
DOHA  Reuters    A successful world athletics championships had looked like a desert mirage but the event eventually came to life with an oasis of thrills and packed houses to rescue Qatari organizers and officials before the curtain came down on Sunday 
Struggling due to a lack of interest from locals  the 10 day showcase delivered on the final weekend as criticism over an empty stadium and stifling heat of around 38 degrees Celsius was replaced by an atmosphere at last worthy of a world event 
The athletes responded with memorable performances in the air conditioned Khalifa Stadium  with temperatures kept at 21 degrees  highlighted by local hero Mutaz Barshim on Friday soaring to victory in the men s high jump for Qatar s only gold 
On the same night American Dalilah Muhammad broke her own world record to win the women s 400 meters hurdles while the sport s big men seized the spotlight on Saturday as the shot putters gave a show hailed as the greatest ever in the event 
The United States again topped the medals table  their 14 golds almost triple the next best of Kenya on five while Jamaica and China each had three  No other nation got more than two 
 It is pretty clear to us that on athlete performance this is the best world championships we have had   said International Association of Athletics Federations  IAAF  chief Sebastian Coe 
The head of the global governing body had spent a good amount of time during the opening days vigorously defending the decision to bring the championships to the Middle East 
 It is the athletes themselves who have come here better prepared for a championship that will be remembered for a long time     maybe in a large part to the almost perfect conditions that these guys have created in the stadium  
Before the last three sessions  a nearby super mall with its shops  ice rink and amusement park had generated more buzz than the Khalifa Stadium with its swathes of empty seats 
The warning signs came early when the blue riband 100 meters on the opening weekend did not attract even a modest audience 
American Christian Coleman s win was greeted with a smattering of polite applause  while Jamaica s Shelly Ann Fraser Pryce did a victory lap in a near empty stadium with her sleepy son nestled in her arms 
HUGE INTEREST
Qatar has shown huge interest in hosting the world s biggest sporting parties  including the 2022 soccer World Cup finals  but has displayed little desire to actually attend them 
The futuristic air conditioned Khalifa Stadium proved without doubt the country can build first class facilities but hosting an event does not end when construction is completed 
The crowds over the final three days were as manufactured as the stadium  with organizers giving away thousands of tickets to clubs and immigrant workers although the excitement was real 
While track and field athletes competing in Khalifa Stadium did so in air conditioned comfort  there was plenty of suffering and complaining on the Doha roads 
Marathoners and race walkers were forced to run at midnight along a soulless  almost spectatorless route to avoid the worst of the extreme heat and humidity  with temperatures hovering around 30 Celsius when the marathons and walks started 
Coe had little sympathy for those athletes who were complaining  saying at the midway mark of the meeting that they would be the ones leaving without winning titles 
 The athletes talking about externalities are probably not the ones who are going to be walking home with medals from here   he said 
The rousing end to the championships provided an upbeat note for a sport that continues to wrestle with complex issues  including a Russian doping scandal that looks set to linger  with the country s federation banned from the event 
If that was not enough  the championships were hit with another unwanted distraction when renowned American coach Alberto Salazar was banned for four years for doping violations  the news landing in the middle of the IAAF s biggest event 
Salazar has denied any wrongdoing and said he would appeal 
Track and field s focus now turns to next year s Tokyo Olympics before the 2021 world championships in Eugene  Oregon  home of the  Nike   NYSE NKE  Oregon Project which has been caught up in the sport s latest doping scandal 
The U S  Anti Doping Agency  USADA  said Salazar was punished for  orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct  as head coach of the Nike Oregon Project  NOP   a camp designed primarily to develop U S  endurance athletes 
Nike has denied any role in administering performance enhancing drugs and said in a statement on Tuesday that it does not condone the use of banned substances 
 Nike is not a part of the organizing committee  it s just not  so the issue around Eugene is very clear   said Coe  already defending the choice of Eugene as the next host city 
 There is the organizing committee  and there s the  U S   federation who will be working closely together  ",2019-10-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/successful-world-championships-no-desert-mirage-in-the-end-1992573,1992573

Goucher said the NOP  has to go  and advised double world athletics distance running champion Siffan Hassan to redirect her anger at Salazar instead of being angry with the world 
 If I was Nike I d be bringing in some new coaches and move on from this Oregon Project  because clearly it had principles not in line with clean sport and we have to just start over   Goucher told the BBC 
 These athletes should do the right thing  Staying in that uniform sends such a terrible message  They really need to shut it down and give athletes a chance to train under someone new and fresh   she said 
Goucher  silver medalist in the 10 000m at the world championships while training under Salazar in 2007  called for samples from Salazar s athletes to be retested 
 Every blood test should be retested  This is what needs to happen and then we can determine if there should be charges on athletes or not   she said 
 I know athletes there that are not doing anything wrong  but that s just the unfortunate situation about a conviction like this   Goucher said 
Salazar was banned on Tuesday for four years for doping violations  when the U S  Anti Doping Agency  USADA  announced the punishment for  orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct  
Salazar  a former world class marathon runner  said he will appeal against the decision

DOHA  Reuters    The athletics watchdog  AIU  will take a close interest in the 140 page report detailing the U S  Anti Doping Agency  USADA  decision to ban leading coach Alberto Salazar for four years  the sport s global head Sebastian Coe said on Sunday 
USADA said Salazar s punishment was for  orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct  as head coach of the  Nike   NYSE NKE  Oregon Project  NOP   a camp designed primarily to develop U S  endurance athletes 
American Salazar has denied any wrongdoing and said he would appeal while Nike has said it will stand by him 
Nike has denied any role in administering performance enhancing drugs and said in a statement on Tuesday that it does not condone the use of banned substances 
 We have the AIU  Athletics Integrity Unit   it clearly will take a big interest in the findings from USADA   said Coe  who is president of the International Association of Athletics Federations  adding he had not read the whole report himself 
 I am entirely comfortable and very confident that the AIU will want to look at the whole case and want to think about the implications  
The IAAF s efforts to separate itself from anti doping and corruption and rebuild athlete and fan confidence in the sport led to the setting up of the AIU in 2017 
 The AIU are permanently vigilant and there are tests that are intelligence led   said Coe   It is important that the unit is given the opportunity and the time to be vigilant and acts when it needs  but we also have to be protective of athletes  reputations  so it needs a sensible proportion of balance  
Several athletes participating at the world athletics championships in Doha  which finished on Sunday  train with the Nike Oregon Project  including gold medallists Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands and Donavan Brazier of the U S 
There has been no suggestion of any wrongdoing by 1 500 and 10 000 metres world champion Hassan or 800m winner Brazier 
But Coe said it was inevitable there would be speculation around the performances of Hassan after her unique double 
 Sadly  it is the world we live in   he said   It is inevitable that outstanding performance  given the nature of trust  is permanently in question  I think we have to be careful about how we draw judgement on the performance  
After her 1 500m triumph on Saturday  Hassan said she was winning races well before she joined the NOP in 2016

Bosnia s Amel Tuka  who won the bronze in Beijing in 2015  went one better by taking the silver  his country s best ever result in any event at the championship  and Kenya s Ferguson Cheruiyot Rotich got the bronze 
Brazier s win came less than 24 hours after Alberto Salazar  the head coach at the  Nike   NYSE NKE  Oregon Project  NOP  where he trains  was banned for four years by the U S  Anti Doping Agency for  orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct

DOHA  Reuters    The athletics world championships were hit by another unwanted distraction on Tuesday when renowned American coach Alberto Salazar was banned for four years for doping violations  putting the sport again in the drugs spotlight 
The timing of the U S  Anti Doping Agency  USADA  announcement that Salazar had been banned for  orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct  could not have come at a worse time for the sport 
The news landed like a grenade right in the middle of the International Association of Athletics Federations   IAAF  showcase world championships  adding another headache to an event already dogged by criticism over sparse attendance and searing heat 
Asked by Reuters if they had any issue with the timing of USADA s announcement  the IAAF declined to comment 
If the never ending Russian doping saga was not enough  the latest scandal hit home with several of the runners Salazar coached  members of the  Nike   NYSE NKE  Oregon Project  NOP     an elite long distance running training center he managed    competing at the championships 
Two of that group have won gold medals in Doha    the Netherlands  Sifan Hassan in the women s 10 000 meters and American Donavan Brazier in the men s 800m 
Hassan said on Tuesday she felt sad that the USADA had released the findings of an investigation that had been percolating for almost six years during the championships 
There has been no suggestion of wrongdoing by Hassan  who was quick to distance herself from Salazar  noting that the investigation was focused on a period before she joined the Oregon Project 
 I am saddened by the timing of USADA as it brings my championship out of balance but I will focus all my energy on my next race and my performance in the 1 500m  a race that I have worked hard to prepare for and am very excited to race in hopes of winning my second world title   Hassan said 
Salazar  who has coached some of the world s top distance runners including British multiple Olympic and world champion Mo Farah  was quickly stripped of his championships accreditation by the U S  track and field federation  leaving behind his runners to answer questions 
Both Brazier and eighth place finisher Clayton Murphy  also a member of the NOP  were grilled by the media the moment they stepped into the mixed zone after their race 
 Not at all   said Brazier when asked if the news had distracted him   I mean he s not my coach 
 The only contact I ve had with Alberto has been pleasant  I like Alberto  he s a cool guy 
 I m just really happy to win the race and get a gold medal out of today  
 The ban on Alberto is disappointing  at the end of the day he is the founder of the Oregon Project  
Salazar said in a statement that he had not done anything wrong and would appeal against the USADA s decision 
Few athletes asked about the ban at the worlds on Tuesday were critical of the 61 year old 
Jamaican sprint coach Stephen Francis said of Salazar   Like every coach  he wants to try and get a leg up on the competition but it s hard for me to really  I wouldn t say blame  but to disparage him because as I said  he s just pushing the envelope as far as coaching is concerned

DOHA  Reuters    Donavan Brazier stormed home and broke the world championship record to claim a first ever world title for the United States in the men s 800 meters on Tuesday 
The 22 year old  running in his first world or Olympic final  destroyed the field as he raced past Puerto Rican Wesley Vazquez with 300 meters left to win in one minute 42 34 seconds 
Bosnia s Amel Tuka  who won the bronze in Beijing in 2015  went one better by taking the silver  his country s best ever result in any event at the championship  and Kenya s Ferguson Cheruiyot Rotich got the bronze 
Brazier s win came less than 24 hours after Alberto Salazar  the head coach at the  Nike   NYSE NKE  Oregon Project  NOP  where he trains  was banned for four years by the U S  Anti Doping Agency for  orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct  
Salazar has denied wrongdoing and vowed to appeal and sportswear giant Nike has said it will stand by the 61 year old American 
Brazier said he had not been distracted by the Salazar issue   Not at all  I mean he s not my coach   he told reporters  adding that his coach was Pete Julian 
 The only contact I ve had with Alberto has been pleasant  I like Alberto  he s a cool guy    I m just really happy to win the race and get a gold medal out of today

191120,412636,NKE,Women s sports may reap big gains from California law on college endorsement deals,news,"By Steve Gorman LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Male stars of college basketball and football will likely reap the greatest immediate gains from California s new law allowing student athletes to profit from endorsement deals  but female athletes  and women s sports generally  could be big winners in the long run  Although relatively few college athletes of either gender ever advance to professional competition  women s opportunities for going pro are particularly scant compared with men  leaving them little or no chance of cashing in on their talents during their prime  proponents said  California s law   which upends restrictions long imposed under the National Collegiate Athletic Association  NCAA    could thus prove especially fruitful for female athletes  both individually and collectively   Giving female athletes the ability to market themselves at a time in their careers when the spotlight is on them   when they re in college   not only brings attention to female athletes but could be a game changer in the public starting to respond to the brilliance of women in sports   state Senator Nancy Skinner  the measure s leading sponsor  told Reuters  She cited the example of Olympic champion swimmer Missy Franklin  who gave up the chance to capitalize on her gold medal fame in order to keeping swimming for the University of California Berkeley  only to suffer a career ending injury as a senior  Conversely  Skinner pointed to superstar UCLA gymnast Katelyn Ohashi  who the senator said  will no longer be the only person on the planet denied the right to monetize 60 million YouTube followers   Some experts  however  said caveats built into the new law to protect California college team endorsement deals from conflicts with individual sponsorships minimize the potential for NCAA athletes  men and women alike  to market themselves  A college basketball star would be unable  for instance  to wear Adidas brand sneakers if his or her entire squad were already outfitted in  Nike   NYSE NKE  footwear under an existing exclusive sponsorship contract with the school  Skeptics also warned that for female athletes in particular  their individual success in winning lucrative deals with major brands may siphon finite endorsement dollars away from their teams as a whole   This thing could have the impact of money not going to support athletic programs  and that could be detrimental   said George Belch  a San Diego State University marketing professor who opposed the bill  LEVELING PLAYING FIELD  The Fair Pay to Play Act  passed unanimously in both houses of California s legislature and signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom  would make California the first state to allow college athletes to earn money from their names  images and likenesses  Proponents said the statute addresses a fundamental inequity in barring financial compensation for college athletes when academic institutions generate billions of dollars a year from student sports  even as a majority of their athletes live at or below the poverty level  The measure is due to take effect in 2023  assuming it survives a possible court challenge from the NCAA  the governing body for U S  college sports  which opposed the bill  The NCAA  backed by several major California universities and the Pac 12 Conference  has warned the new statute would give California teams an unfair recruiting advantage and lead to an uneven patchwork of rules across the country  Opponents of the law had urged California legislators to give the NCAA time to examine the issue and propose its own reforms  But California s law passed with broad bipartisan support  and lawmakers in several other states and on Capitol Hill are considering similar measures  Although only a handful of the estimated 500 000 students playing college sports nationwide may ever have the talent and fame to land major brand endorsement contracts  the new law allows those in California to at least earn money from smaller local sponsors  YouTube videos or from coaching youth   Elite athletes  meanwhile  gain a financial incentive to enroll in college and complete their degrees  rather than drop out or skip college to go pro  But for women s sports especially  providing financial incentives that raise an athlete s profile and market value will have another important  trickle down  effect  said Ramogi Huma  a former UCLA football player and executive director of the National Collegiate Players Association that helped lobby for the Fair Pay bill  He said the current NCAA prohibition on compensation for student athletes has helped freeze in place disparities that continue to favor men s sports over women s despite passage of the Title IX act in 1972 mandating an end to sex discrimination in federally backed education programs

191122,412638,NKE,SKX Vs  NKE  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in Shoes and Retail Apparel stocks are likely familiar with Skechers  SKX  and Nike  NYSE NKE   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Skechers and Nike are sporting Zacks Ranks of  1  Strong Buy  and  4  Sell   respectively  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that SKX has an improving earnings outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
SKX currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 54  while NKE has a forward P E of 28 12  We also note that SKX has a PEG ratio of 0 97  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  NKE currently has a PEG ratio of 2 16 
Another notable valuation metric for SKX is its P B ratio of 2 17  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  NKE has a P B of 14 20 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to SKX s Value grade of A and NKE s Value grade of F 
SKX is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that SKX is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-08-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/skx-vs-nke-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200454588,200454588

per share declined nearly 10  from the prior year quarter and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 66 cents  This marked a miss after 28 straight quarters of bottom line beat  While earnings gained from solid sales growth  improved gross margin and lower average share count  higher selling and administrative expenses and tax rate were deterrents Revenues of the Swoosh brand owner increased 4  to  10 184 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  10 154 million  This outperformance was primarily driven by the company s solid execution of the Consumer Direct Offense globally   which fueled robust growth across all four geographies as well as innovation  Additionally  continued strength in NIKE Digital provided a boost to the top line On a currency neutral basis  revenues grew 10   driven by gains from investments in innovation and digital  This aided robust global consumer demand  which was mostly led by NIKE Direct Operating SegmentsRevenues for the NIKE Brand increased 5  to  9 707 million while constant dollar revenues for the brand were up 10   Results gained from continued growth in NIKE Direct and its wholesale business  Moreover  strength in nearly all major

digital  mostly offset by declines in the United States and Europe Costs   MarginsGross profit rose 6  to  4 633 million while gross margin expanded 80 basis points  bps  to 45 5   This expansion was

191130,412646,NKE,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Wednesday,news,"Investing com    An impeachment inquiry into President Trump  whose words to the UN General Assembly on Tuesday continue to send a chill through global markets overnight  Plus  Adam Neumann is ousted as We Company CEO and oil prices weaken further on more happy talk from Saudi Arabia  Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday  25th September 
1  Impeachment inquiry against Trump
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump  the first step toward official proceedings to remove him from office  accusing Trump of violating his oath under the constitution 
The move comes after revelations that Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine while urging its new President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate possible corruption at a local energy company on whose board Hunter Biden   son of Trump s most likely opponent in next year s election   once served 
Impeachment would require the approval of both chambers of Congress  including a two thirds majority from the Senate  something that seems unlikely in view of the Republicans  control of the Senate and the party s loyalty to Trump 
2  Stocks to open lower after Trump blasts against China and Iran
U S  stock markets are set to open lower as the political storm in Washington triggers a wave of risk aversion  That follows a downturn in sentiment after Trump s harsh language against Chinese trade practises in his address to the UN General Assembly on Tuesday 
By 6 AM ET  Dow 30 futures and the S P 500 futures contract were both down 0 2   while Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0 3   Asian markets had also closed mostly lower overnight  while Europe s main markets were all down by 1  or more after early trading 
A rare bright spot among the gloom was   Nike    NYSE NKE   which looks set for a higher opening after rising 5 5  in after hours trading on the back of a buoyant first quarter to its 2020 fiscal year 
3  Fed speakers to pass judgment on gloomy data 
There will be speeches from three top Federal Reserve officials to inform those who want to know which way the monetary wind is blowing after a couple of days of largely discouraging economic data from around the world 
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans speaks at 8 AM ET  1400 GMT   followed by Esther George  who dissented from this month s decision to cut the target range for Fed funds  and Lael Brainard  who both speak at 10 AM 
4  Neumann ousted at WeWork
Adam Neumann was ousted as chief executive of We Company  the parent of shared office space provider WeWork  in an attempt by outside shareholders and directors to get the company s stalled IPO back on track 
His functions will be split between two new co CEOs  Artie Minson  currently the We Company s chief financial officer  and Sebastian Gunningham 
Neumann s voting rights will also be curtailed  his supervoting shares will now only carry three votes each instead of 10  The Wall Street Journal reported that We Company s IPO is now unlikely to take place this year 
The IPO of exercise bike maker Peloton is  by contrast  still on course to take place later this week  albeit at the low end of the marketing range  according to various reports 
5  Oil falls further ahead of inventories
Crude oil fell further overnight as concerns about global demand combined with reassurances about Saudi Arabian supply to depress prices 
Saudi Aramco announced that repair work at the Abqaiq processing facilities  which prepares much of the country s crude for export to world markets  was proceeding ahead of schedule 
At 10 AM ET  the U S  government will release its weekly overview of the domestic oil market  Private data from the American Petroleum Institute data released on Tuesday suggested that crude stocks had surprisingly risen by 1 4 million barrels  rather than the 250 000 barrel draw expected by the market  
By 6 AM ET  U S  crude futures were at  56 55 a barrel  down 1 3   while Brent crude was at  62 14  down 1 5  ",2019-09-25,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-wednesday-1985639,1985639
191132,412648,NKE,Is Nike s Chart Signaling A Massive Crash ,opinion,"The chart below is Nike s  NYSE NKE  monthly chart forecasting a bearish head and shoulders pattern  I use this timeframe to look at the bigger picture of any stock I consider trading  long term or short term   A novice trader may see a bullish pattern in the near term  but they can get burned  especially  when there is a catalyst such as earnings on the horizon  The longer the timeframe  the more reliable the chart pattern  Coincidentally  or not  Nike missed earnings for the first time in 27 quarters and with tariffs looming we could see a continuation in this trend 
The left and right shoulder are typically a similar distance in time apart from the head  Given it took two years to form the left shoulder  we can expect it will take a while for this pattern to play out 
To get an idea on how one might trade this pattern  let s take a look at Dave   Busters  NASDAQ PLAY   an options trade that netted over 2000  for us earlier this month 

We took puts at  15 contract on 6 11 prior to earnings that afternoon  Subsequently  the stock went down over 20  and our puts skyrocketed to  3 contract  This is a great example of how a combination of a catalyst such as earnings  a perfect pattern setup  and a not so innovative company can net huge returns by purchasing put options  playing the stock to go down  

Nike is a great company  but I will be waiting patiently to make a play down the line if this pattern plays out ",2019-06-28,Colby Dugger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-nikes-chart-signaling-a-massive-crash-200435729,200435729

191138,412654,NKE,Tariff Issues In The Foreground With Nike Q4 Earnings,opinion,"The U S  China trade dispute is likely to be in the foreground when Nike Inc   NYSE NKE  reports its quarterly earnings after the closing bell Thursday 
Some analysts say that NKE  which is up about 15  on the year  has so far defied expectations that trade tensions would dampen its run  but since the issue has shown virtually no signs of progress  it s still a key issue of concern for many investors 
For NKE  trade issues are a significant concern because  like most major athletic shoemakers  it relies heavily on imports from China  So escalating tariffs translate into escalating costs  which companies either have to absorb or pass on to customers  who may be less willing to spend more  With that said  it s no surprise that NKE is among the companies that have come out against increasing tariffs on Chinese imports 
Nike is among the shoe manufacturers that signed a letter to policymakers that took a hard stance against tariffs  which it said would be  catastrophic for our consumers  our companies and American economy as a whole  
Recall that last quarter  NKE s business in Asia was thriving  so going forward  it is expected by many that the topic of China related tariffs is likely to be in the foreground of its earnings calls in the near term 
On a side note  it might be worth keeping in mind that as NKE reports  President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jingping are scheduled to meet as the G 20 summit begins on Friday  So any news on the tariff front could change and possibly drive some movement in NKE shares on top of whatever comes out of its earnings report 
NKE s Q4 Numbers to Watch
For Q4  it might be worth keeping an eye on several figures in NKE s report  including its North American sales  which were a bit sluggish last quarter  and of course the sales in China  which were booming 
In March  shares slid even as NKE beat expectations with revenue  which was up 7  year over year to  9 6 billion  and net income of  1 1 billion  up from a loss the year prior  Shares likely tumbled because its fiscal Q3 North American sales were up only 7  year over year to  3 81 billion  softer than expected as customers seemed to lose interest its Converse brand  which saw total sales decline 2  year over year 
As for sales in China  they were up 24  last quarter  NKE executives said in a call with analysts that the company is still bullish about long term growth potential in China despite the current uncertainty around tariffs 
Looking ahead to the Q4 report  the third party consensus earnings estimate is  0 66 per share  down from  0 69 per share a year ago  Revenue is projected to increase about 3 9  to  10 17 billion from  9 79 billion last year 
Investors seem to be a little less enthusiastic than they were before the Q3 report  with shares losing ground throughout May  but rebounding so far this month  see figure 1 below   Earnings expectations may be lower  but some Wall Street analysts say fears about NKE s North American revenue growth and China tariffs may be overdone 
Some Wall Street analysts say they remain optimistic on NKE on the grounds that it has proven to be pushing ahead with technological innovation  such as with its SNKRS app and Nike app  It also appears to be well positioned in the market for women s athletic wear  which has been a thriving retail niche  In that line  NKE has indicated that it s planning to add its own Yoga collection  which is designed to pit it more directly against competitor Lululemon Athletica Inc  NASDAQ LULU  

FIGURE 1  RUNNING HIGH AND LOW  Shares of Nike  NKE  had a nice run higher at the start of 2019  but softer Q3 sales and concerns of tariff fallout seem to have put a damper on shares in recent weeks  Data source  NYSE  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Nike Options Activity
For NKE  the options market has priced in an expected share price move of about 4 8  in either direction around the earnings release  according to the Market Maker Move  indicator on the thinkorswim  platform 
Though options volume has been light overall  call activity has been a bit higher at the weekly 86 strike  Put activity has concentrated at the weekly 83 and 83 50 strikes  The implied volatility sits at the 54th percentile as of Tuesday

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  6 06   A quarter ago  it was expected that this athletic apparel maker would post earnings of  0 63 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 68  delivering a surprise of 7 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Nike  which belongs to the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry  posted revenues of  10 18 billion for the quarter ended May 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 29   This compares to year ago revenues of  9 79 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Nike shares have added about 11 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 16 2  
What s Next for Nike 
While Nike has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Nike was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 80 on  10 64 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  2 99 on  42 30 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

191141,412657,NKE,College football notebook  Oklahoma State booster Pickens dies,news,"Billionaire oilman T  Boone Pickens  known in sports circles as a mega booster of Oklahoma State athletics  died Wednesday at his Dallas home  He was 91 
Pickens reportedly donated about  500 million to Oklahoma State  which he graduated from in 1951 after beginning his college career on a basketball scholarship at Texas A M  He transferred to what was known then as Oklahoma A M after losing his scholarship following an elbow injury 
Much in the same way as  Nike   NYSE NKE  founder Phil Knight did at Oregon  Pickens and his money helped raise a football program  Oklahoma State renamed its football stadium Boone Pickens Stadium in the fall of 2003  His signature donation to Oklahoma State athletics was a  165 million gift in 2006    with about  120 million earmarked for football facilities    to help launch a wave of football success for the Cowboys and coach Mike Gundy  who was just beginning his second season 
Starting in 2008  the Cowboys have appeared in the Associated Press Top 25 in every year  haven t had a losing record and have posted six seasons with at least 10 victories  The Cowboys won the Big 12 title in 2011  then beat Stanford in the Fiesta Bowl to finish 12 1 and No  3 in the AP poll 
  The NCAA sent a letter to California Gov  Gavin Newsom  urging him not to sign a bill that would allow college athletes in the state to accept endorsement money without repercussions 
Both the state assembly and senate have approved the bill  known as the Fair Pay to Play Act  Now  it will be sent to Newsom  who has 30 days to sign it into law 
The NCAA contends the proposed legislation is unconstitutional and would  upend the balance  of competition in college sports  If approved  the legislation would take effect in 2023  Schools would not be allowed to declare a student athlete ineligible or take away scholarships for accepting endorsement fees

 As university processes have progressed relating to Bryce Thompson  we ve all taken this situation very seriously   Coach Jeremy Pruitt said in a statement announcing the reinstatement   I believe Bryce can grow by following the plan the university has put in place for him  As a result  I am allowing him to return to practice

191143,412659,NKE,Earnings Preview  Nike  NKE  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Nike  NYSE NKE  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended May 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on June 27  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This athletic apparel maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 67 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 9  
Revenues are expected to be  10 16 billion  up 3 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nike 
For Nike  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 75  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nike will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Nike would post earnings of  0 63 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 68  delivering a surprise of  7 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Nike doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-06-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-nike-nke-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200433315,200433315

strong owned and partnered Digital growth  is poised to boost the segment s performance  Further  growth across sportswear  Jordan  NIKE Kids and Running categories should aid the company In the fiscal third quarter  NIKE s wholesale business also witnessed improvement and NIKE Digital grew 30  in North America  On a currency neutral and reported basis  the company reported 7   or a high single digit  revenue growth in North America Moreover  NIKE expects the momentum in North America to continue in fiscal 2019 and beyond  driven by strong pipeline of innovative product  brand recognition and creation of digitally led consumer experiences The company s differentiated consumer experiences in North America through the rollout of the NIKE app in owned retail stores  and the testing of new services and concepts with retail partners  such as Foot Locker   NYSE FL   and DICK S Sporting Goods   NYSE DKS    should drive growth For North America  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter is pegged at  4 080 million  which suggests growth of 5 3  from the year ago reported figure China Holds More PotentialNIKE s business in China is gaining pace as sports is increasingly becoming part of the daily lives of the consumers in the country  The company has been a clear beneficiary of this trend  recording the 19th consecutive quarter of high quality  double digit revenue growth in China  In third quarter fiscal 2019  constant currency revenues improved 24  in Greater China  driven by strong performance at NIKE Direct  Notably  digital

seek opportunities for increasing global footprint  popularity and market share  Apart from acquiring new brands  the company has been focusing on broadening its territory through growth of e commerce

ExpectationsIn the last reported quarter  this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company warned that significant adverse impacts of FX headwinds should somewhat hurt results in fourth quarter fiscal 2019  Notably  the currency environment has turned unfavorable lately due to global trade and geopolitical dynamics  which led to strengthening of the U S  dollar  This is likely to weigh on the company s sales on a reported basis Driven by FX headwinds of nearly 6 points  NIKE expects reported revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter to be in a low single digit  This is largely softer compared with reported revenue growth of 13  in the prior year quarter  The soft reported revenue guidance also resulted from the dismal performance of the recently launched innovation platforms   React and Air Max 270   as well as impacts of the World Cup Further  gross margin growth in the fiscal fourth quarter is likely to be partly offset by higher input costs   including cotton  chemicals and labor  FX sourcing

191147,412663,NKE,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top three things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  Jackson Hole  All Eyes on Powell

The symposium of central bankers in Jackson Hole  Wyo   kicked off Thursday  but traders have been anxiously waiting for Fed Chairman Jay Powell s speech   

Powell s remarks  scheduled to start at 10 AM ET  14 00 GMT   will likely provide fresh clues on monetary policy measures at a time when global bond yields are on the backfoot on expectations that central banks will ramp up stimulus 

At the same time  the Commerce Department reports new home sales in July  

On average  economists expect that sales declined 0 2  in the month  but  on a seasonally adjusted basis  the annual rate rose to 686 000  from 646 000 in June  according to forecasts compiled by Investing com  
2  Oil Rig Count Rolls In

Traders will look to the latest rig count data due Friday for clues on crude production activity following an uptick in U S  production to 12 3 million last week  

Data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the U S  fell by 4 to 770  The number is down 11 4  from a year ago 
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand 

Oil prices look set to end the week up slightly as expectations that central bankers will adopt easier monetary policy measures to prevent a slowdown in the global economy have calmed fears of a deeper slip in oil demand  
3  Footlocker Earnings Due 

  Foot Locker    NYSE FL  is expected to report earnings of 67 cents a share on revenue of  1 82 billion before markets open on Friday  

With the U S  consumer showing little spending restraint  market participants are closely watching whether the athletic apparel company will rebound with an earnings beat  after unexpectedly missing estimates in the previous quarter 

Ahead of the report  Wedbush said it expects Footlocker s quarterly performance to receive a boost from the company s product pipeline of largely outperforming brands  including   Nike    NYSE NKE   Puma and Vans 

 After a choppy start to the year     Foot Locker   NYSE FL   management should assert confidence in the story given strong consumer demand for its products  the loyalty rollout  planned moderation in SG A pressure and resumption of share repurchase activity   Wedbush said

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  
Will Tariffs on Imported Shoes Tie a Knot Around U S  Footwear 
After increasing tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10  to 25   the Trump administration is reportedly mulling to impose additional tariffs on remaining  325 billion worth of imports to rake in more revenues  These include a wide array of consumer electronics items  toys and shoes that were hitherto left outside the purview of the trade war to shield the American shoppers from the cascading impact of higher tariffs 
With China playing a vital role in the supply chain process for most U S  footwear firms  the proposed tariffs are likely to be a death knell for the industry that is already reeling under a  3 billion annual duty bill  Consequently  advocacy groups from the industry are urging the administration to rethink the issue to avoid any  catastrophic  impact on consumers  the overall sector  and the U S  economy as a whole 
Open Letter
In an open letter posted on the website for the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America  the industry trade group made an earnest plea to Trump to desist from the temptation to slap 25  additional tariff on the footwear industry  Ratified by more than 170 footwear firms  the letter was also addressed to U S  trade representative Robert Lighthizer  treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin  commerce secretary Wilbur Ross and Larry Kudlow   the director of the National Economic Council     
The petition reasoned that tariffs are imposed disproportionately on the footwear industry  averaging 11 3  and often reaching as high as 67 5  in some cases compared with an average of 1 9  on all consumer good items  An additional 25  tariff will eventually lead to Americans paying almost 100  tax on some shoes  leading to  7 billion in added annual costs to consumers  This is likely to lead to lower demand for discretionary items like shoes  forcing several industry participants to run out of business 
Viable Alternatives    
Despite efforts in recent years to move out some of the production facilities to other low cost countries like Cambodia and Vietnam  footwear firms rely heavily on Chinese suppliers and its cheap labor force  In 2017  about  14 8 billion worth of shoes were imported from China  making it the fifth largest import product category  per the data by the American Enterprise Institute  Notably  China alone accounted for 72  of all shoes imported in the United States in 2017 
The footwear industry is highly capital intensive and requires effective planning and supply chain mechanism for seamless operations  Consequently  possible knee jerk reactions to shift manufacturing operations from such a dominant and established market to offset higher tariffs are likely to take considerable time with adequate planning and involve higher costs  Financially weaker companies could also find such an exercise to be potentially unviable  leading to an untimely death 
Moving Forward
Leading footwear manufacturer Nike Inc  has revealed that about 26  of its footwear was produced in China in fiscal 2018  The company maintained that the communist country was an integral part of its business operations  both in terms of raw material supply and end market consumption  With increased tariffs  the company would be left with no other option but to raise product prices  passing on most of the added expenditure to consumers and thereby  making a larger dent in their wallet 
Several other footwear firms such as adidas AG  Rocky Brands  Inc  and Wolverine World Wide  Inc  have echoed such sentiments and have collectively appealed to the government to save the industry from further distress 
Whether the administration will heed to such SOS calls from the industry remains to be seen

TOKYO  Reuters    Designer Junichi Kawanishi was still coming to terms with his sudden fame on Thursday  a day after his design for the medals to be awarded at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics was unveiled to the world 
Kawanishi  a graphic designer from Osaka  won a nationwide competition to design the medals for the Olympics and Paralympics next year 
His design was unveiled on Wednesday during an extravagant ceremony in the Japanese capital with exactly one year to go until the Games  which starts on July 24 
The medals  which are 85 millimeter in diameter  feature the Greek goddess of victory  Nike   NYSE NKE  in their design along with the Olympic symbol and are made from recycled metals  collected from 6 21 million electronic devices donated across Japan 
Kawanishi said he wanted the circular design on the front of the medals to represent the globe and reflect light 
 By receiving light from various angles     I thought about the cheers from the public and those thoughts are reflected   Kawanishi told reporters on Thursday 
 Reflection of light reaches various directions so  I hope that the reflected light from the medal would reach all directions when it is worn by an athlete  That is my intention  
Kawanishi said he received a call last year which told him his proposal was selected from over 200 applications  He had to keep the medal design  and his identity  a secret until Wednesday

 Reuters     Nike  Inc  N NKE   the world s largest sportswear maker  is exploring options for its surfwear brand Hurley International  including its possible divestment  according to people familiar with the matter 
Nike s potential retrenchment from the surfwear market is emblematic of the stance of most major consumer companies towards the sector  Surf brands have lost their appeal among non surfing consumers  who now prefer boutique brands and retro streetwear 
Among the options that Nike is considering for Hurley is an outright sale of the Costa Mesa  California born brand  the sources said  requesting anonymity because the deliberations are confidential 
It is not clear how much Nike could fetch by selling Hurley  Nike declined to comment 
Nike purchased Hurley from founder Bob Hurley in 2002 for an undisclosed sum in an effort to expand beyond athletic focused apparel and into other sportswear for surfing  skating  and snowboarding 
Bob Hurley founded the company in 1979 and achieved notoriety in the 1970s for shaping the surf board for world champion Wayne  Rabbit  Bartholomew 
In the last few years  the burgeoning appetite for clothing associated with the beach lifestyle and culture waned  to the point that former global leader Quiksilver filed for bankruptcy in 2015 before being taken over by private equity firm Oaktree Capital Management  N OAK  
Mainstream fashion has dropped surfwear in favor of athleisure  while emerging fashion is turning toward urban streetwear brands like Carlyle backed Supreme  and throwback looks like the revived sportswear brand Fila and Champion

191163,412679,NKE,Sports Direct Shares Fall the Most in 12 Years After Delayed Results,news," Bloomberg       Sports Direct   International Plc  LON SPD  shares plunged to an eight year low as the market gave a damning verdict on delayed results that were finally released after Friday s close 
Analysts noted an absence of guidance for the 2020 fiscal year  regrets over the purchase of the House of Fraser department store chain and a surprise tax bill from Belgian authorities 
The shares fell as much as 28   the most in 12 years  before paring the drop to 7 8  at 9 a m  local time 
The delay in announcing the results on Friday was likely due to the receipt of a payment notice for 674 million euros   749 million  after an audit of its taxes in Belgium  according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Allen 
The lack of a sales or earnings forecast for FY20 implies that a further decline is likely  Allen said 
Here s a round up of what analysts are saying 
Berenberg  Graham Renwick
 Sell 
It s alarming that Sports Direct s management seem to regret buying House of Fraser  raising questions about why the  terminal  issues weren t flagged during the due diligence processThis  highlights the risks around Sports Direct s  scattergun  acquisition strategy There s a high level of uncertainty over Sports Direct s ability to turn around House of Fraser  as well as  high uncertainty and risk over near term forecasts   given the lack of FY20 guidanceLiberum  Wayne Brown
 Buy  PT lowered to 400p from 500p 
FY19 results were  robust   with gross margins recovering in both its core U K  and European businessesThe performance has been overshadowed by the  challenging outlook  for House of Fraser and the  surprising contingent liability  related to Belgian taxesThe company s  elevation strategy is working  leading to improvement in ranges Sports Direct is a corporate client of LiberumPeel Hunt  Jonathan Pritchard
 Under review 
It s  highly worrying  that Sports Direct s focus on moving to an elevated offering isn t working because the better product isn t coming throughThe  most realistic  strategy seems to be for Sports Direct  to do the best it can  with its core assets and see if it can generate enough cash to fund growth elsewhereRBC  Richard Chamberlain
 Underperform  PT lowered to 200p from 220p

191173,412689,NKE,Bull Of The Day  Lululemon Athletica  LULU ,opinion,"The retail world is evolving and for companies who have failed to adapt to the changing landscape  it s been a painful stretch of disappointing earnings  store closures and in some cases   bankruptcy 
For those companies that have simultaneously figured out how to generate brand loyalty and navigate the modern marketplace of online and in person selling  these are the best of times 
Lululemon Athletica  definitely has it figured out right now 
Quarterly Report
LULU s most recent quarterly report was one of those true blowouts  and the sharp rally in the shares to new all time highs is evidence that investors loved what LULU management had to say 
Not only did they beat the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate  turning in a net of  1 85 share vs  an expected  1 74 share  as well as  1 2B in revenue   a 26  increase over the year ago period   they also reported an increase in same store sales and gross margins  raised 2019 guidance for earnings and revenues and announced additional share buyback plans 
The same store sales number is impressive because Lululemon opened 14 new locations during the quarter and didn t close any stores  Not only have the new stores been performing well  the stores that have been open for more than a year are also continuing to sell more product than ever 
Recently  we ve seen same store sales numbers rising at some retailers because they re closing underperforming locations  Bringing up the same store number while growing is a much more impressive feat 
Gross Margins
Another problem area we ve seen lately with some retailers is that although sales might be holding steady or even increasing  it s due to discount pricing that erodes gross margins 
Even more impressive than the raw sales number from LULU is the fact that they also increased gross margins by 110 basis points  Management s earnings presentation credited  lower product costs and a favorable mix of higher margin product  and lower markdowns  
That s a diplomatic way of saying that LULU customers are willing to pay full price for LULU s garments  There s big enough demand for the comfortable and attractive clothes that they don t have to rely on discounts to move excess merchandise  It s quite the opposite  in fact  Many of Lulu s most popular items sell out quickly when they are first introduced  adding to the brand cache and encouraging customers to move quickly rather than waiting for discounts 
International Expansion
In full year 2018  LULU increased sales by 70  in Asia and 55  in Europe  also an impressive achievement in today s retail clothing environment  Consumer tastes around the world are notoriously fickle  The hottest look in one global region is often out of fashion in another 
Lululemon is hot everywhere 
Increased Guidance
LULU issued guidance for both fiscal Q1 and full year 2019 that was above previous expectations  resulting in a slew of positive analyst revisions and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
The company expects to earn  0 68 0 70 share in Q1 and  4 48 4 55 share in fiscal 2019  nearly  1 share higher than previous estimates  In response  all 14 of the analysts included in our calculations have increased their full year estimates in the past 7 days  and the consensus of  4 62 share now stands even a bit above the high end of the company s own range 
The improvement in results will come from strategic investments in LULU s digital platform and supply chain improvements as well as a renewed focus on developing products for the half of the population that s not already wearing Lululemon   men 
While the garments from the company that invented the  athleisure  category have been popular with women for years  until now they ve been somewhat of a niche brand for men   The company is planning to change that as well with the addition of NFL Quarterback Nick Foles as a brand ambassador and an increased range of garments intended for males 
It s a shot right over the bow of Nike  NYSE NKE   and UnderArmour  in the market for clothes that are intended to be exercised in  but LULU is also in a position to take advantage of trends toward more relaxed dress codes in many workplaces   where high end althleisure wear now often replaces coats and ties for men 
Top of the Game
The retail graveyard is littered with the corpses of slow moving companies that failed to adapt to customer preferences in what and how they buy 
Companies that have put in the effort to determine the mix of product that customers are clamoring to buy and then combining that with desirable in person and online shopping experiences are picking up all the spoils  Lululemon is currently on top of that game

191188,412704,NKE,Nike Shares On A Run As Company Prepares To Deliver Q3 Earnings,opinion,"For one more hint about how the retail sector is faring  investors might want to consider glancing at athletic apparel giant Nike Inc  s  NYSE NKE  fiscal Q3 earnings  which are scheduled for release after the closing bell Thursday 
Nike is one of the last major companies to report for the recent wave of earnings  when retailers have been showing very mixed results amid changing consumer shopping habits and preferences 
In recent months  it seems not much has been able to slow NKE s momentum  This could be partly because NKE appears to be riding positive economic drivers behind consumer stocks  especially the mostly booming U S  jobs scene  NKE s Q3 report could potentially reveal whether it can achieve the same strong performance as it did last quarter  when it saw growth in every category 
Investors may have good reason to have high expectations for NKE this quarter after Foot Locker Inc   NYSE FL  crushed Wall Street estimates for Q3  citing in part success with Nike products  including new releases in Jordan and Air Max 
So far this year  NKE is up 17 2   having quickly brushed off a bit of a stumble after one of its shoes shredded on Duke forward Zion Williamson  who suffered a knee injury during a basketball game as a result  Shares fell more than 1  on the news  but soon resumed their climb  In comparison so far this year  the S P 500  SPX  is up about 12   and the Dow Jones   DJI  is up about 10  
Still  after a sell off late last year  NKE seems to have been underperforming its athletic apparel competitors  Its stock is up about 30  the past 52 weeks  whereas Under Armour  UAA  and Lululemon Athletica  LULU  shares rose 40  and 78   respectively  Both UAA and LULU beat earnings and revenue estimates in their last quarters  though LULU lowered its guidance for Q4 on softer holiday sales expectations 
As a multinational retailer with several sales channels and aggressive marketing  NKE is exposed to many of the important drivers in the retail sector  It relies both on brick and mortar locations as well as online avenues for sales  Its brand is fairly high end  so when NKE s business is booming  investors sometimes regard that as a sign that the consumer is spending freely  It has a large presence in China  so its business there may shed some light on how U S  companies are faring amid ongoing tensions between the U S  and China over tariffs 
Will Nike See Across the Board Growth Again 
The consensus earnings estimate from third party consensus is  0 64 per share  according to third party consensus analyst estimates CA1    Revenue is projected to increase about 6 5  to  9 57 billion from  8 98 billion last year 
Following the release of its fiscal second quarter results  NKE shares rose about 8  as it beat both earnings and revenue expectations and reported growth in every category  According to NKE  the strongest growth segments last quarter were in footwear and apparel  where it noted double digit growth in both  It also saw particularly strong online sales growth  including a 30  increase in U S  online sales over the year prior and a 40  increase on Singles  Day  China s largest online shopping day 
Overall last quarter  higher prices appeared to help boost its profits and gross margins  NKE s net income increased 10  to  847 million  or  0 52 per share  That was above the  0 46 per share Wall Street was expecting  according to third party estimates  And net sales increased by 10  to  9 37 billion  versus the Street view of  9 18 billion  At the time  company executives said they weren t seeing any significant impact from the ongoing tensions between the U S  and China regarding tariffs 
In fact  NKE said it saw significant growth in its China market last quarter  with sales up 26  to  1 5 billion from the year prior  In comparison  North American sales rose 9  to  3 78 billion and sales in Europe  the Middle East and Africa increased 8  
Moving forward  NKE recently announced it would focus even more on women athletes this year by rolling out new high tech products and by sponsoring 14 teams in FIFA Women s World Cup

191193,412709,NKE,Golf industry upturn is more Trump than Tiger,news,"By Uday Sampath Kumar  Reuters    Tiger Woods  Masters  triumph last month was an epic comeback for the former world number one after an 11 year major title drought  but it is Donald Trump who may better symbolize the U S  golf industry s improving fortunes after a long lean spell  While Woods  comeback has rekindled hopes of broadening the sport s appeal dashed by his past struggles on and off the course  the swelling ranks of older players  led by Trump s generation of baby boomers  are right now the main source of the industry s cautious optimism  Take Jeff Huber  an Omaha  Nebraska  resident and chief executive of elderly care company Home Instead  who said golf took on a greater role in his life after he turned 50   There s something about that milestone birthday that really caused me to think  okay how am I going to live my life intentionally  and golf has surfaced prominently as a major focal point for me   he said  Huber said not only he was dedicating more time to the sport  but also upgrading to more expensive clubs that are lighter and easier to swing  The number of people playing on U S  golf courses rose 1 7  to 24 2 million in 2018  the first reported increase in 14 years  according to data from the National Golf Foundation    Two percent growth may not sound heroic  but for those who view the sport of golf as  dead   we believe this should serve as a potent correction   Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said  While initiatives like computer aided Topgolf have helped the game s profile  analysts and industry insiders chiefly credit two factors for an upswing that is also expected to bring the first rise in the number of rounds played since 2016   First  more Americans are retiring than ever  Secondly  Wall Street s decade long bull run has finally helped replete savings wiped out by the financial crisis  making people willing to spend more on leisure  U S  retirement assets grew from  18 trillion in 2010 to just over  27 trillion at the end of last year  according to Investment Company Institute  an association of U S  fund industry   Likewise  the share of those 65 and older in the U S  population is expected to grow from 15 8  in 2016 to nearly 17  in 2020 and more than 20  by 2030  according to the United States Census Bureau  PAST THE CRISIS The lean times bankrupted many course operators and brought consolidation among equipment makers and retailers   Adidas AG  DE ADSGN  sold golf club maker TaylorMade in 2017   Nike  Inc  NYSE NKE  exited the equipment business in 2016  while Golfsmith and Sports Authority  two retailers dependent on golf goods  went out of business in 2016  Market research firm NPD  however  estimates mass market sales of golf equipment rose 8  in the 12 months ending November 2018  after a 4  drop in the prior year   Many people lost all their retirement savings in the crash and so had to work longer and I think we re getting past all that now   Matt Powell  senior industry advisor at NPD said  That is good news for equipment makers and golf course operators  among them Trump  himself a regular visitor on his golf properties  Clubmaker Callaway Golf Co has reported 14  average annual revenue growth over the last three years  and analysts expect its sales to rise 35  in its current fiscal year  largely as a result of rising sales of newer  more expensive equipment  A strong economy was underpinning the business  but demographics were helping too  Harry Arnett  Callaway s executive vice president for global marketing said    Baby boomers retiring could positively impact participation in the sport  and thus  potentially equipment sales as well   he told Reuters   Course operators say older players tend to spend more time and money on their hobby than younger ones  Robbie Kearney  General Manager at Cimarron Hills Golf   Country Club in Austin  Texas  said among members between 50 and 70 several would play four to six times a week and did not scrimp on equipment or instruction   Those individuals are looking for the new putter and the new driver  They re spending money on golf instruction trying to get better and beat their friends   Kearney said  Jefferies  citing National Golf Foundation data  says people play more rounds as they get older and no one plays more than those in their early 70s   the first cohort of the baby boom generation   those born during the first two post war decades  David Abeles  Chief Executive Officer of TaylorMade told Reuters his company s 20  revenue increases in 2017 and 2018 were largely due to new technology in golf clubs and higher selling prices   While baby boomers get credit for improving business  the sport still has its sights on the younger generations  Kenneth Ameduri  editor of financial publication CrushTheStreet said the sport would not fully recover globally until millennials  the first generation predicted to outnumber baby boomers  start reaching their 40s in greater numbers  And the industry has still high hopes for Tiger Woods   Now that  Woods  is back in the mix on Sundays  he s bringing a whole audience   back into the fold   Cimarron Hills  Kearney said

191201,412717,NKE,Nike s Q3 Earnings Expected To Show Growth Momentum Continuing,opinion,"  Reports Q3 2019 results on Thursday  March 21 after the market close  Revenue expectation   9 6 billion  EPS expectation   0 64
Nike s  NYSE NKE  powerful rally this year shows that investors have strong belief in the world s largest sportswear giant s growth momentum  And there is a little reason to question their faith 
The company has shown sales growth in its two most important markets  China and North America  During the second quarter  which ended on Nov  30  Nike posted the 18th consecutive quarter of growth in China  the world s most populous country  which proved Nike s fastest growing  This impressive growth performance provides a strong indicator that Nike products have so far remained insulated from the slowing Chinese economy and its trade dispute with the U S 
The latest evidence of this strength is expected tomorrow  when Nike reports its third quarter earnings  Analysts  on average  expect  0 64 a share profit with sales growing 7  to  9 6 billion 
And  riding high on the crest of this robust expansion  Nike shares have surged almost 20  this year  driving gains over the last 12 months up to 33 5  

On the domestic front  the company has been able to revive sales growth  helped by strong consumer demand  job gains  and the tax cuts which pushed retail spending higher  But this positive macro environment isn t the only reason why Nike is doing well  The company s recent efforts to restructure its business  focusing on its largest markets and revamping its online business  are also paying off 
Nike s Triple Double Push Is Paying Off
As part of the  Triple Double  campaign  the company is doubling its resources on its digital properties  accelerating innovation and product creation  and deepening one to one connections  The result of these efforts is that Nike is grabbing a greater market share from its main European rival  Adidas  OTC ADDYY   even in its home market  while outperforming in the major growth markets of Asia 
Encouraged by these positive undercurrents  during its second quarter earnings conference call in December  the Beaverton  Oregon based company boosted its full year outlook for both revenue growth and gross margin  Nike said it now expects currency neutral revenue to be in the high single digits over the full year 
This positive momentum bodes well for Nike s faithful investors  who have relied on the company s dividend payments and understand the cyclical nature of its business  Nike stock currently pays  0 22 per share on a quarterly basis  translating to an annual dividend yield of 1  
That yield obviously doesn t look attractive when compared to other high yielding stocks in the market  But analyzing stocks just based on their yields isn t a good approach  The best dividend stocks are the ones whose payouts are raised regularly  Nike has hiked its payout for 15 consecutive years 
Bottom Line
Trading near a record high  Nike stock had a great run last year  which appears set to continue if the economy remains favorable  If you already own Nike stock  we don t see any reason to sell them now  The company has managed to create new growth momentum through its business restructuring  For new investors  however  it would be better to wait for a more lucrative entry point to take a long term position in this great brand ",2019-03-20,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nikes-q3-earnings-may-show-the-companys-growth-momentum-continuing-200399314,200399314
191202,412718,NKE,Nike  NKE  Is An Incredible Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Nike  NYSE NKE  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this athletic apparel maker a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Nike is 11 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 9  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 8 9  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio  also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio  but it is an important feature of a real growth stock  This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Nike has an S TA ratio of 1 69  which means that the company gets  1 69 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 1 46  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot  so does the sales growth of a company  And Nike is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too  The company s sales are expected to grow 7 6  this year versus the industry average of 4 2  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Nike have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 3  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Nike a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination positions Nike well for outperformance  so growth investors may want to bet on it ",2019-03-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nike-nke-is-an-incredible-growth-stock-3-reasons-why-200399448,200399448
191203,412719,NKE,Opening Bell  Markets Wake To Fed s Economic Pessimism  Yields Tumble,opinion,"Global stocks drop as dovish Fed confirms economic slowdown
Treasury yields tumble to lowest level in a year  dollar rebounds from Fed led drop
Sterling falls on May s request for Brexit deadline extension
Oil hits  60 for the first time since November but later slips lower
Key Events
Asian markets chaperoned Wednesday s U S  losses into the European session this morning  with futures on the S P 500 and Dow suggesting that selloffs will resume in the upcoming North American session  A skeptical market is weighing the benefits of a dovish Fed which ruled out any rate hike this year and detailed the end of its balance sheet reduction yesterday against a backdrop of economic slowdown  Also weighing on sentiment  President Donald Trump s trade optimism  aired earlier this week  gave way to new warnings that U S  tariffs on Chinese goods may apply for a  substantial  period of time 
The STOXX 600 opened 0 15  lower  adding to yesterday s selloff  which erased two days of gains  Technically  the 50 DMA  which was approaching the 200 DMA from the bottom as bulls cast their hopes in a golden cross  may be heading towards a sell signal  as the 200 DMA forces the 50 DMA lower 
In the earlier Asian trading  most regional benchmarks posted a slide  Japanese indices and Hong Kong s Hang Seng were closed for a holiday 
Global Financial Affairs
In yesterday s U S  session  equities briefly rebounded from the immediate selloff that followed signals  from the Federal Reserve  that its pause in rate hikes was motivated by a slowing economy  After the short lived bounce  most stocks ended lower for the second day  while yields on 10 year Treasurys tumbled as investors rotated into bonds 
The S P 500 slipped 0 29   dragged down by Financials   2 06   shares  which stand to lose the most in a lower rate environment  Gains in Communication Services   0 9   and Energy   0 88   did little to offset losses in banks 

Technically  the SPX price fell below the most recent uptrend line  since the previous Tuesday  which turned into a proven resistance  erasing the dovish Fed rally  The trading pattern may be developing a short term H S top 

The Dow dropped 0 55   despite the fact that a lower dollar  prompted by a lower interest rate outlook  provided a potential tailwind for multinational companies  Technically  the gauge matched the SPX trading pattern  On the daily chart the picture is weaker  as last week s rally failed to seal a trough higher than February s low  While a Golden Cross was recently triggered  the 200 DMA could become the neckline of a top 
The Russell 2000 slid 0 44   while the NASDAQ Composite was the only index closing in green territory   0 07   

Yields slid toward 2 5  this morning  extending Wednesday s drop to the lowest rate in over a year in line with our expectations of a bearish pennant completion after a symmetrical pattern  bearish in a downtrend  after the long term uptrend line was violated  This outlook was at the core of our diffidence around the rally that started after Christmas 

The dollar index found support by the 200 DMA  acting as an organic uptrend line and ascending channel bottom  Increased demand for Treasurys naturally boosts the greenback  which rebounded overnight from an initial Fed driven drop  The USD also benefited from mounting pressure on the pound  which inched lower after U K  Prime Minister Theresa May asked for a three month extension on Brexit  heightening the risk of a disorderly separation from the EU 
Meanwhile  the yuan recovered from an initial sharp drop  but remained lower versus the dollar 
In Hong Kong  the de facto central bank once again bought the local dollar after the city s exchange rate fell to the weak end of its trading band against the greenback 

Oil crossed the  60 threshold on ongoing OPEC  supply cuts for the first time since November  before slipping back below the key mark over the European morning session  Technically  bulls will have to demonstrate their persistence facing the 200 DMA at the mid  61 levels  From a fundamentals perspective  traders are weighing the contrasting forces of strong U S  demand and weak European and Chinese indicators 
Up Ahead
Central banks in U K   Thailand  the Philippines and Indonesia are all scheduled for policy meetings this week

191204,412720,NKE,Chart of the Day  Nike Earnings Could Trigger New Rally  Despite Recent Dip,opinion,"Nike  NYSE NKE  is scheduled to release Q3 earnings today after market close  with analysts expecting EPS of  0 64 on revenue of  9 58 billion  The athletic shoe and clothing powerhouse has beaten expectations   sometimes drastically   in every single report over the past 22 quarters since September 2013 
Two major stories today that could weigh on the results are the Fed s forecast downgrade and President Donald Trump s concession of a lingering trade dispute  these issues may offset the export boost due to lower rates leading to a weaker dollar  One wholly positive point is that Adidas  OTC ADDYY   the shoemaker s competitor  is experiencing a supply chain shortage that is expected to hit its growth in the first half of the year 
With a complex and conflicting fundamental picture  we turn to the supply demand balance for more clarity 

As opposed to the broad market  Nike is in an unequivocal bull market after posting a record close of  87 84 on March 18 and an all time high of  88 59 on March 19  The decline of the last two days leaves the price  which closed yesterday at  86 69  still above the previous peak of Sep  21 
While the RSI provides a negative divergence with momentum  suggesting that prices will follow lower  the 50 DMA crossed above the 200 DMA  as the price reached new heights  triggering a golden cross  the most famous technical buy signal  The RSI divergence may be tolerable from a risk perspective  considering it remains above a major support  the November December congestion below  80 
Though we remain bearish on the medium term trend of the overall market  even if begrudging the S P 500 Index rising above its October peak  we are bullish about Nike  We should note  however  that a general downturn is likely to drag on Nike as well 
Trading Strategies
Conservative traders should stay clear until the RSI turns around  with an upside breakout of its descending channel 
Moderate traders may enter a long position  after the earnings release rally pulls back in a correction 
Aggressive traders may risk a long position before the release  counting on the statistical bullish outlook after yesterday s selloff remained above the September peak  demonstrating continuing demand

191215,412731,NKE,Nike  NKE  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of NIKE  NKE   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 3 7  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  88 59 in the previous session  NIKE has gained 18 3  since the start of the year compared to the 13 1  move for the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the 18 6  return for the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on December 20  2018  Nike  NYSE NKE  reported EPS of  0 52 versus consensus estimate of  0 45 
For the current fiscal year  Nike is expected to post earnings of  2 64 per share on  39 17 billion in revenues  This represents a 9 09  change in EPS on a 7 62  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 12 per share on  42 32 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 18 3  and 8 04   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Nike may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Nike has a Value Score of D  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 33 3X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 29 6X versus its peer group s average of 12 7X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 7  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Nike currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Nike meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Nike shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come ",2019-03-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nike-nke-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200399392,200399392

191218,412734,NKE,This Trade War  Winner  Looks an Awful Lot Like China,news," Bloomberg Opinion     An Asian Communist state with a government directed industrial policy churns out cheap goods for consumption in America  The country has a heavily controlled exchange rate  brandishes its low labor costs  enjoys a trade surplus and is wary of opening sensitive industries to foreigners  Add what might be politely described as some history of antipathy toward the U S 
You might be forgiven for thinking that place is China  whose trade dispute with the U S  is deepening  But no  it s Vietnam 
Lured by the low cost of manufacturing  companies from  Nike  Inc  NYSE NKE   to Ikea have been redirecting parts of their supply chain from China to the Southeast Asian nation in recent years  Foreign direct investment in Vietnam has climbed for six consecutive years  the economy is humming  with a growth rate of about 7 percent  and the government is relaxing at least some barriers to foreign ownership  These are all reasons the country is often cited as one of the few winners from the trade war 
It also begs the question why  despite sharing many of China s characteristics  Vietnam has avoided the ire of President Donald Trump and his army of trade protectionists bent on clipping Beijing s wings  If a much less threatening Germany   with its still high costs of labor  democratic government and shared currency   can end up on the administration s blacklist  surely Vietnam shouldn t be spared 
This is the context in which to view the reporting of my Bloomberg News colleagues Saleha Mohsin and Jenny Leonard that the U S  will expand the number of countries it scrutinizes for currency manipulation  Vietnam could be named a manipulator outright  according to people familiar with the situation  While the label isn t consequential in itself  it s worth considering as a warning of future policy trajectory   particularly for the growing number of businesses and investors that have considered parking their money and resources there lately 
What s probably saving Vietnam from Trump s onslaught  for the moment  is its size  The country s population of roughly 100 million people puts it on par with the Philippines  and its GDP is a mere 1  of the U S  s  Bottom line  It s no China  geographically  demographically  commercially or militarily  Nor is it currently perceived as a threat to American strategic interests  In the past few years  Hanoi s relations with Washington have been fairly amicable 
When I visited Hanoi in September  the optimism was almost unbridled  The air was thick with anecdotes about U S   European  Japanese  South Korean and even Chinese companies scouting for sites in Vietnam as a way to escape the vagaries of economic rivalry between Washington and Beijing  Yet doubts are starting to creep in about whether Vietnam s congested ports and roads can handle the influx of traffic  whether its workers have the requisite skills  and whether land costs are rising too briskly 
Is Vietnam s scale too small to draw comparisons with China  Quite possibly  But its industrial strategy and development model bear a resemblance to Beijing s decades ago 
The U S  once saw a burgeoning Asian economy as the investment opportunity of a lifetime  Fleets of investment bankers and business leaders showed up telling anyone who would listen that the country was the next big thing and an ideal place to set up shop  Superlatives abounded  Troubled political relations were a thing of the past   and Western style capitalism would make ties even smoother  It didn t work out that way in China 
The bullish on Vietnam scenario might be the real thing  Yet it s also worth asking what can go awry with the benefit of hindsight ",2019-05-14,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/this-trade-war-winner-looks-an-awful-lotlike-china-1868254,1868254

191239,412755,NKE,DECK Vs  NKE  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Shoes and Retail Apparel sector might want to consider either Deckers  DECK  or Nike  NYSE NKE   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Currently  Deckers has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Nike has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that DECK has an improving earnings outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
DECK currently has a forward P E ratio of 17 94  while NKE has a forward P E of 32 63  We also note that DECK has a PEG ratio of 1 50  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  NKE currently has a PEG ratio of 2 65 
Another notable valuation metric for DECK is its P B ratio of 4 07  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  NKE has a P B of 15 52 
Based on these metrics and many more  DECK holds a Value grade of B  while NKE has a Value grade of D 
DECK has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than NKE  so it seems like value investors will conclude that DECK is the superior option right now ",2019-03-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/deck-vs-nke-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200397693,200397693
191240,412756,NKE,Nike  NKE  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q3 Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Nike  NYSE NKE  reports results for the quarter ended February 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on March 21  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This athletic apparel maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 63 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 4  
Revenues are expected to be  9 50 billion  up 5 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nike 
For Nike  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  18 42  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Nike will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Nike would post earnings of  0 45 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 52  delivering a surprise of  15 56  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line

191241,412757,NKE,Trump foe Michael Avenatti indicted for financial crimes,news,"By Jonathan Allen  Reuters    Michael Avenatti  the combative lawyer known for his battles with U S  President Donald Trump  was indicted on charges of defrauding clients  including allegations that he withheld a multimillion dollar settlement he won for a paraplegic man  prosecutors said on Thursday  The indictment came about three weeks after Avenatti  who gained national fame for representing adult film star Stormy Daniels in her litigation against Trump  was arrested in New York on separate criminal complaints filed by federal prosecutors in New York and California  Federal prosecutors in California announced the indictment after a grand jury found late on Wednesday that there was probable cause to pursue charges against Avenatti  The 48 year old lawyer  a Los Angeles resident  said he planned to fight the charges and plead not guilty   I look forward to the entire truth being known as opposed to a one sided version meant to sideline me   Avenatti  who is free on a  300 000 bond  wrote on Twitter on Thursday   The federal complaint in California charges Avenatti with 10 counts of wire fraud  accusing him of misusing more than  12 million he received on behalf of clients following settlements and other negotiations    Money generated from one set of crimes was used to further other crimes  typically in the form of payments designed to string along victims so as to prevent Mr  Avenatti s financial house of cards from collapsing   Nicola Hanna  the U S  attorney for California s Central District  said at a news conference in Los Angeles  Avenatti became a prominent critic of Trump and a frequent guest on cable television news while representing Daniels  whose real name is Stephanie Clifford  She sued the president over a nondisclosure agreement that in the weeks before the 2016 U S  presidential election kept her from discussing her claims that she and Trump had an extramarital affair 10 years earlier   Prosecutors say Avenatti misled clients and misused their funds to pay personal and legal expenses  finance a coffee shop business he also ran  and pay for his share of a Honda private jet  according to the indictment  Federal authorities seized the jet on Wednesday  prosecutors said   In one case  prosecutors said that Avenatti concealed a  4 million settlement won by a client in 2015 from Los Angeles County after he became paraplegic in an unspecified incident  instead giving the man periodic advances of  1 900 and paying the rent at his assisted living facility  The client  referred to only as  Client 1  in the indictment  was identified as Geoffrey Johnson by his lawyer  Joshua Robbins   On Thursday  Avenatti said on Twitter that the accusation that he had mishandled clients  money was  bogus nonsense  and posted an undated testimonial signed by Johnson that praised him as an  exceptional  honest and ethical attorney    Johnson no longer stood by that statement  his lawyer said   It was signed before he was aware of the fraud   Robbins said in an interview  adding that Avenatti lied to Johnson in order to get him to sign the testimonial in March  shortly before Avenatti s arrest   Lawyers for Avenatti did not immediately return calls for comment on the statement  According to the indictment  Johnson s efforts to buy a house failed because Avenatti withheld the settlement money  and Avenatti lied to the U S  Social Security Administration about the settlement to conceal the embezzlement  leading the agency to cut off Johnson s benefits   TAX CRIMES The indictment also accuses Avenatti of various tax crimes  He is accused of failing to file personal tax returns since 2010 and to pay  3 2 million in payroll taxes on his coffee business  even though he withheld some portion of this money from employee paychecks  The indictment said he defrauded a Mississippi bank of  4 1 million in loans by submitting false tax returns for 2011 to 2013 that inflated his income  The most serious bank fraud charges carry a maximum sentence of 30 years per count  prosecutors said  Federal sentencing guidelines typically call for defendants to serve less than the maximum time  The New York prosecutors have separately accused Avenatti of trying to blackmail athletic wear maker  Nike  Inc  NYSE NKE  for more than  20 million

191243,412759,NKE,JD Sports Is the U K  s Best Performing Stock of the Century,news," Bloomberg     At a time when Britain s shopping streets are getting emptier  it s perhaps surprising that the U K  s best performing stock since the turn of the century is not a tech phenomenon but a humble sneaker seller 
 JD Sports Fashion  Plc  LON JD  shares have risen by 7 374 percent since Jan  1  2000  hitting a record on Tuesday after the retailer reported profit ahead of expectations  The stock is by far the best performer on the FTSE All Share Index over that period  with second placed Diploma Plc  a building components and seals maker  having returned a comparatively measly 4 200 percent  Bookmaker Paddy Power Betfair Plc is in third  up about 3 800 percent 
JD s growth is in contrast with the U K  retail sector s struggles  Sales in the financial year just ended were 4 72 billion pounds   6 2 billion   the company said Tuesday  up from about 171 million pounds in 2000  That s been mirrored by its market value  now clearly above 5 billion pounds compared with about 60 million pounds at the turn of the century 
The retailer s winning formula has been based around stocking exclusive ranges from the likes of Adidas AG  DE ADSGN  and  Nike  Inc  NYSE NKE    enabling it to attract growing numbers of fashion savvy customers  It s now extending the formula to the rest of the world  adding stores from Spain to Australia  while acquiring Finish Line Inc  in the U S  last year 
 It s hard to think of such an impressive showing anywhere else in retail   Peel Hunt analyst Jonathan Pritchard said in a note  He described the firm s sales and profit growth as  stellar   and sees no reason why it shouldn t continue 
Shore Capital analysts Greg Lawless and Clive Black also think there s more to come  saying the acquisition of Finish Line adds international growth potential to the equity story  This means the shares remain attractive despite the rising multiples and deserve to trade at a premium to peers  they wrote ",2019-04-16,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/jd-sports-is-the-uks-bestperforming-stock-of-the-century-1837145,1837145

191256,412772,NKE,Why Nike  NKE  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Nike  NYSE NKE   This company  which is in the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This athletic apparel maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 11 81  
For the last reported quarter  Nike came out with earnings of  0 52 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 45 per share  representing a surprise of 15 56   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 62 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 67 per share  delivering a surprise of 8 06  
Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Nike lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Nike has an Earnings ESP of  8 37  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on March 21  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

191277,412793,NKE,DECK Vs  NKE  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Shoes and Retail Apparel stocks have likely encountered both Deckers  DECK  and Nike  NYSE NKE   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Deckers and Nike are sporting Zacks Ranks of  1  Strong Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that DECK has an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
DECK currently has a forward P E ratio of 17 77  while NKE has a forward P E of 31 33  We also note that DECK has a PEG ratio of 1 49  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  NKE currently has a PEG ratio of 2 54 
Another notable valuation metric for DECK is its P B ratio of 4 04  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  NKE has a P B of 14 88 
Based on these metrics and many more  DECK holds a Value grade of B  while NKE has a Value grade of D 
DECK has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than NKE  so it seems like value investors will conclude that DECK is the superior option right now ",2019-02-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/deck-vs-nke-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200386323,200386323

191286,412802,NKE,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Thursday  March 21 
1  Futures point to subdued open  Treasury yields hit 1 year low after Fed pivot
The Federal Reserve took a 2019 rate hike off the table on Wednesday and released details of a plan to end the monthly reduction of its balance sheet  The decision was a marked about face from its prior December forecasts to raise interest rates twice this year 
Although U S  stocks turned positive after the decision  financial stocks dragged on the market due to their sensitivity to low interest rates  leaving the Dow lower at the close 
The market s cautious stance continued to reign on Thursday with U S  futures stuck around the unchanged mark  At 5 41 AM ET  9 41 GMT   the blue chip Dow futures fell 22 points  or 0 1   S P 500 futures dropped 1 point  or 0 1   while the Nasdaq 100 futures edged forward 5 points  or 0 1  
10 year Treasury yields reacted most to the change in policy stance  dropping as far as 2 51   their lowest level since January 2018 
The U S  dollar initially fell over half a percent in reaction to the Fed s decision but recovered during Asian market hours as worries over a disorderly Brexit took its toll on sterling 
2  U S  China trade talks progress without progress
U S  President Trump warned on Wednesday that he will keep tariffs on China in place until he is sure that Beijing is complying with the terms of any trade agreement 
Overnight  however  China sounded more positive on trade developments  confirming that high level talks will continue next week 
The Chinese commerce ministry said that U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will travel to Beijing on March 28 29  while China s Vice Premier Liu He will then travel to Washington in early April 
3  EU preps for decision on Brexit extension
With the current March 29 deadline for the U K  to depart the European Union running down to the wire  British Prime Minister Theresa May is scheduled to meet with the bloc s 27 other heads of government at the EU summit at 10 00 AM ET  14 00 GMT  
May is currently seeking an extension until June 30 to work further on a withdrawal agreement 
However  the other member states must all approve such an extension  Reports suggest that they will only allow the deadline to be pushed back to May 22  the day before elections to the European Parliament 
4  Oil holds above  60 despite profit taking
Oil prices slipped back from 2019 highs but U S  crude remained above the  60 level it breached a day earlier for the first time since November 
U S  crude oil futures fell 12 cents  or 0 20   to  60 11 by 5 46 AM ET  9 46 GMT   while Brent oil traded down 3 cents to  68 47 
Despite profit taking on Thursday  WTI is still up more than 5  this month and has skyrocketed more than 30  in 2019 on support from production cuts from OPEC and its allies led by Russia 
U S  sanctions on Iran and Venezuela have also served to support oil prices  while last week saw the largest decline in U S  stockpiles since July  giving further evidence that the market is responding to a tightening of supply

Revenues increased 10  to  9 374 million  which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  9 158 million  This outperformance was primarily driven by the company s solid execution of the Consumer Direct Offense globally along with revenue growth  in constant currency  of 20  at international locations and 9  in North America  Additionally  continued strength in NIKE Digital  which delivered 41

costs Selling and administrative expenses rose 14  to  3 142 million on account of higher operating overheads and demand creation expenses  Notably  demand creation expenses increased 4  year over year to  910 million due to increased advertising and marketing costs  with higher cost of investments toward digital platforms  Operating overheads rose 18   mainly owing to wage related costs

encouraged by solid first half fiscal 2019  However  the company remains concerned about rising volatility and uncertainty on a macro level  Nevertheless  the company s solid execution of the Consumer Direct Offense has been consistently aiding its performance  Going forward  this momentum is expected to consistently drive sustainable growth and boost shareholders  value For fiscal 2019  the company projects revenue growth in the high single digit range in constant currency  thus approaching toward low double digits  Depending on the existing foreign exchange rates  revenues are anticipated to grow more than 3 points lower than the currency neutral revenue growth or at the lower end of the high single digit range The company expects gross margin expansion of 70 bps for the

191316,412832,NKE,Managing Earnings Reports On Long Term Holdings,opinion,"Never sell a covered call or put option when there is an earnings report due to be reported prior to contract expiration 
I have repeated this rule so many times over the years because I want our members to avoid the losses I incurred back in the 1990s before I realized how important it was to integrate this guideline into our methodology  For traditional option selling  we can simply remove stocks about to report from our portfolios and add them back in after the report passes if the security still meets our system criteria  Frequently  there are situations when we want to retain the shares in our covered call portfolios  but still  want to avoid the risk of capping the upside  with the call strike  while still being exposed to the downside 
Reasons for retaining shares through an earnings report 
Shares were purchased at a much lower cost basis and are in a non sheltered account exposing investors to negative tax consequences if sold
The stock has a history of positive earnings surprises and we are confident that risk to the downside is limited
We simply like the stock and have no intention to sell
Does the rule  of not selling the option  still apply if we choose to retain shares through an earnings release 
Yes  We do not cap the upside prior to the report  Statistically  we will benefit more often than not from positive reports compared to suffering from negative surprises  The argument for writing the call is that the premium will somewhat mitigate a loss from a disappointing report  Let s take two  50 00 stocks to create a hypothetical  Both stocks return a 2   1 month premium return for selling the  52 00 strikes   1 00 per share   Stock A has a positive report resulting in a 10  price gain to  55 00  Stock B has a disappointing report and suffers a 10  price decline to  45 00 
Writing the calls prior to earnings
Stock A   1 00    2 00  share appreciation from  50 00 to the  52 00 strike       3 00
Stock B   1 00    5 00  share depreciation from  50 00 to  45 00       4 00
Net loss of  100 00 for the combined positions
Avoid writing the calls prior to the report
Stock A has a share appreciation of  5 00
Stock B has a share depreciation of  5 00 per share
Net combined position results in neither a loss or gain
Over the past decade or so  there have been more positive than negative surprises as more companies will provide muted guidance so as not to disappoint or may pre announce prior to earnings if results are not meeting previous guidance  This means that by avoiding earnings reports will average out even better results than the hypotheticals presented  This has been my personal trading experience for over two decades now 
Real life example with Nike Inc  NYSE NKE 
NKE has earned its way onto our Premium Member Blue Chip  Dow 30  reports for the first half of 2018  After the expiration of the June contracts  we were faced with an upcoming earnings release on 6 28 2018  The report was positive as reflected in the screenshot below 

Note the following 
From mid November through the end of June  NKE  brown line  out performed the overall market  blue line 
On 6 29 2018  NKE enjoyed an  8 00 per share price increase  a result of the after market close earnings release on 6 28 2018
Over the past 1 year  the S P 500 was up close to 15   while NKE appreciated by 45 

How to best manage this situation
June contracts expired on 6 15 2018
Write a Weekly call option on 6 18 2018 expiring on 6 22 2018
Skip writing any calls the week from 6 24 2018 through 6 29 2018
7 2 2018  Write the monthly call for the July contracts expiring on 7 20 2018
This will result in capturing 4 weeks of time value while still avoiding the risk of capping the upside through the earnings release
Discussion
Never sell an option for contracts expiring after an earnings report  Weekly options  when available  can be useful to circumvent these risky scenarios  When Weekly options are not available  we can simply write the monthly option after the report passes  When the report is due out near contract expiration  with no available Weekly  we may need to just pass on writing the option that contract month

191326,412842,NKE,Nike Flashes Death Cross Ahead Of Earnings,opinion,"Nike Stock Has Been More Volatile Than Usual
It s been a volatile stretch for Nike  NYSE NKE   per its 60 day historical volatility of 30 4    in the 100th annual percentile  The options market is expecting even more volatility for NKE shares after the athletic apparel retailer reports earnings after the market closes Thursday 
Specifically  Trade Alert places the implied earnings deviation for Nike at 10 3    more than double the 4 5  next day move the stock has averaged over the past two years  Those earnings reactions have been equally positive and negative in the last eight quarters  with just post earnings performances  11  one day gains in June 2017 and 2018  large enough to exceed the move the options market is pricing in this time around 
At least some options traders are betting on NKE s post earnings price action to resolve to the upside  The December 70 call has seen the biggest increase in open interest over the last two weeks and data suggests a number of these options were bought to open on Monday  If this is the case  the call buyers expect Nike to break out above  72 50 by expiration at the close this Friday  Dec  21 
Meanwhile  short term volatility expectations have ramped up ahead of earnings  as evidenced by the stock s 30 day at the money implied volatility  IV  of 38 9    in the 99th annual percentile  Plus  the 30 day IV skew of 16 5  registers in the 89th percentile of its 12 month range  indicating short term call premiums have rarely been cheaper  relative to puts 
Outside of the options pits  short sellers have been increasing their exposure to Nike  Short interest jumped 14 7  in the most recent reporting period  but the 11 59 million shares currently sold short account for just 0 9  of the equity s available float 
Looking at the charts  Nike shares topped out at a record high of  86 04 on Sept  21  before pulling back dramatically in October alongside the broader equities market  And while the Dow stock has recently found a foothold near the  70 mark   a former layer of resistance that coincides with its  10  year to date return   its 50 day and 200 day moving averages just formed a death cross for the first time since October 2017

What s Next for Nike

191335,412851,NKE,NIKE s  NKE  North America Business To Drive Earnings In Q2,opinion,"NIKE Inc    NYSE NKE   is about to report second quarter fiscal 2019 results on Dec 20  The company witnessed continued momentum in its North America division  after a comeback in fourth quarter fiscal 2018  This segment  which is the company s largest market  should contribute meaningfully to the upcoming results Notably  the NIKE stock has surged 16  year to date  outperforming the  s 9 4  growth 
 
North America Division s Q1 PerformanceRevenues for NIKE s North America business  which returned to healthy and sustainable growth  improved 6  in first quarter fiscal 2019  This was backed by solid growth across both footwear and apparel  fueled by new innovative platforms  and strong growth at both owned and partnered digital channels  Notably  NIKE Digital grew double digits in North America  contributing primarily to growth  The company s locations  which leveraged digital connections with customers  drove most of growth in North America Outlook for North AmericaNIKE expects the momentum witnessed in North America to continue throughout fiscal 2019 and beyond  The company continues to target mid single digit revenue growth in North America in the next five years Additionally  the company is on track to return the Jordan brand to growth in fiscal 2019  After tightened supply in the second half of fiscal 2018 for the Jordan brand  the company is focused on bolstering its iconic styles  Additionally  it is extending dimensions of the brand by expanding sizes and making collaborations  mostly for women  Additionally  apparel and performance basketball represent significant growth opportunities Furthermore  NIKE is working to further amplify its wholesale business in North America  which returned to growth in the fiscal first quarter  The company sees immense opportunity here by creating a differentiated experience by leveraging the learnings from the NIKE app at retail and NIKE by Melrose For North America  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the fiscal second quarter is pegged at  3 688 million  which reflects growth of 5 8  year over year Overall Business TrendsApart from the trend reversal in North America  NIKE owes its robust surprise history to continued growth at international and NIKE Direct businesses  as well as strong progress on Consumer Direct Offense through innovation  Notably  the company has delivered positive earnings for over three years now  with first quarter fiscal 2019 marking the 25th straight quarter of earnings beat  Moreover  sales topped estimates for the sixth straight quarter  Furthermore  the company continues

revenues increased 10   up 9  on a currency neutral basis  Apart from the return to growth in North America  this included double digit growth at international locations  Solid momentum in high

this range  For second quarter fiscal 2019  it expects revenue growth of 9   in line with the fiscal first quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is  9 158 million  reflecting an increase

geopolitical dynamics led to the strengthening of the U S  dollar in the last 90 days  This turned foreign exchange into a headwind for the company  Taking into account the FX scenario  the company

191336,412852,NKE,Nike Earnings Ahead  Can North American Growth Maintain Momentum ,opinion,"Nike  NYSE NKE  is scheduled to report fiscal second quarter earnings after market close on Thursday  December 20th 
For the quarter  NKE is expected to report EPS of  0 46  flat compared to last year  on revenue of  9 17 billion  according to third party consensus analyst estimates  Revenue is projected to increase 7 2  year over year 
The last time NKE reported  it beat on both the top and bottom line  Continued double digit growth in international sales and Nike direct to consumer  combined with sales momentum in North America  were some of the drivers management attributed the top line growth to 
Still  the beat last quarter didn t seem to live up to expectations as shares dropped 4  in after hours trading  One area many analysts and investors honed in on were gross margins  which were up 50 basis points to 44 2  in fiscal Q1  While that was an improvement  it s still below the 45  to 46  range the company had achieved for several years 
Can North America Keep up Growth Streak 
2016 and 2017 was a tough stretch for athletic companies as Sports Authority and several other major sporting goods retailers went out of business  flooding the market with discounted inventory at a time when consumer demand was already showing some weakness 
NKE was no exception and the company posted sales declines in its core North America market for the past two fiscal years  NKE s North America sales in fiscal 2018 declined 2  year over year to  14 86 billion  but the fourth quarter started to show signs of a rebound as sales were up 3  to  3 88 billion 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019  momentum had continued and sales in the region increased 6  year over year  to  4 15 billion  On the earnings call  CFO Andy Campion said it was  very strong sustainable growth in North America   so analysts and investors are likely to be expecting a similarly strong performance this quarter 
Some Questions About International
Despite weakness in the North American market for NKE  its international segments had generated faster growth in the past that allowed the company to continue to grow its top line at a faster pace  In fiscal Q1  sales in the Europe  Middle East and Africa  EMEA  region were up 11  year over year to  2 61 billion  Greater China sales increased 24  to  1 38 billion  and the Asia Pacific and Latin America  APLA  region delivered the slowest growth  up 7  to  1 27 billion 
Now  after many quarters of analysts being concerned about North America  their attention has turned towards NKE s international segments  Analysts have said they re still widely expecting strong sales momentum from China  which has delivered double digit revenue growth for 17 consecutive quarters  However  tariffs and global trade uncertainty have left some questioning the extent that this will impact NKE s results  if at all  in a material way 
Another headwind is the strong U S  dollar  which has continued to trend higher against many major currencies in the back half of 2018  Last quarter  management said they expected it to only be a slight headwind in fiscal q2  In fiscal Q1  NKE s reports showed the impact of currency exchange had cut the APLA region s revenue growth in half  while both the EMEA and Greater China benefitted from changes in exchange rates 

Still Up  NKE has given up some ground since it hit an all time high of  86 04 towards the end of September  but the stock is still up 10  year to date  outperforming both the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite by a wide margin  Heading into earnings  the stock is trading around the  70 mark  a level of support since

191343,412859,NKE,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Friday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Friday  Dec  21 
1  Threat of U S  government shutdown in focus
Although the U S  House of Representatives passed a temporary funding measure on Thursday that included funding for the proposed southern border wall  odds were low that the Senate would give its approval  causing fears that an agreement would not be reached to avoid a government shutdown ahead of Friday s midnight deadline 
The House passed a bill to keep the government running until Feb  8  but the Senate  which convenes at 12 00 PM ET  17 00 GMT   would likely shoot down the proposal precisely because of the more than  5 billion in funding for the wall 
The Senate had approved a bill to keep the government running  but U S  President Donald Trump refused to sign it because it lacked the funding for border security 
 Any measure that funds the government must include border security   Trump insisted 
If temporary funding is not approved  nine government departments including Homeland Security will close ahead of the Christmas holiday  according to Bloomberg 
2  Global stocks drop on growth fears  imminent U S  government shutdown
Global stocks continued a sharp selloff on Friday as global growth concerns and the pending closure of the U S  government continued to weigh on risk appetite

Elsewhere  European stocks traded lower as concern over the pending U S  government closure and the recent policy tightening stateside convinced investors to remove risk from their portfolios 
Earlier  Asian stocks shared in the risk off sentiment  Japan s Nikkei 225 lost 1 1  to close at its lowest since mid September last year  after giving up 5 6  this week  while China s Shanghai Composite ended 0 8  lower 
3  U S  data deluge to keep investors on their toes

191351,412867,NKE,NKE  KHC  AAL  1 Buy and 2 Sell,opinion,"US markets were down on Tuesday with all three major indices Dow Jones Industrial Average  S P 500 and NASDAQ losing over 3 per cent each  The main reason was fear due to narrowing and eventually a crossover between the short term and the long term treasury notes  which is called yield spread  The yield spread indicates the likelihood of a recession or recovery one year forward 
Experts suggests that such negative crossovers earlier  where the short term rates rise over longer term rates  have been followed by a period of recession  Only time can tell if this fear is short lived and the yield spread starts to widen again or if it is going to overshadow the markets in the future 
Today we have analysed three US stocks that are world renowned companies and belong to different sectors  one sports brand  another in consumer packaged goods and one in aviation 
Nike Inc  NYSE NKE   Close  75 79
Nike Inc is in a rising trend channel in the medium term  This signals increasing optimism among investors and indicates continued rise 
The stock tested its earlier support at 71 dollars and reacted upwards to rise above its resistance of 75 40 dollars  On the upside there is resistance around 78 79 70 dollars in the short term and 85 50 or equivalent to 12 8 per cent higher in the medium term  In case of a downward reaction  there is support between 72 and 70 dollars Investtech s outlook  one to six months   Buy
The Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC  Company  Close  49 98
The Kraft Heinz Company shows weak development in a falling trend channel both in the short  medium and long term  Falling trends indicate that the company experiences negative development and falling buy interest among investors 
The stock prices have almost halved since the top in February 2017  There is no sign of respite seen in the stock as it closed yesterday at its all time low  Negative volume balance and weak momentum adds weightage to the falling prices  The stock has resistance around 54 40 dollars  However  in the short term chart there are multiple resistance levels which the stock needs to break and close above before the sell recommendation can be revoked Investtech s outlook  one to six months   Sell
American Airlines Group  NASDAQ AAL  Close  36 69
Investors over time have sold at lower prices to get out of American Airlines Group Inc  as the stock is inside a falling trend channel in the medium term 
The ceiling of the falling trend channel was being tested around 40 dollars before the stock price resumed its downward trend  The stock is just above its interim support of 36 dollars  which if broken may lead the price to tumble down to 30 dollars or lower  There is resistance between 43 30 and 45 70 before a change in trend can be seen 
Further  negative volume balance indicates that volume is high on days with falling prices and low on days with rising prices  which weakens the stock  The stock is overall assessed as technically negative for the medium term Investtech s outlook  one to six months   Sell

191352,412868,NKE,Nike  NKE  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Nike  NYSE NKE  reports results for the quarter ended November 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 20  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This athletic apparel maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 46 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 2  
Revenues are expected to be  9 16 billion  up 7 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 13  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nike 
For Nike  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 18  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Nike will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Nike would post earnings of  0 62 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 67  delivering a surprise of  8 06  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Nike appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-12-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nike-nke-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200367841,200367841

191359,412875,NKE,SKX Vs  NKE  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Shoes and Retail Apparel sector have probably already heard of Skechers  SKX  and Nike  NYSE NKE   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Right now  Skechers is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Nike has a Zacks Rank of  4  Sell   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that SKX likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than NKE has recently  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
SKX currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 20  while NKE has a forward P E of 27 47  We also note that SKX has a PEG ratio of 2 03  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  NKE currently has a PEG ratio of 2 25 
Another notable valuation metric for SKX is its P B ratio of 1 88  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  NKE has a P B of 12 74 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to SKX s Value grade of B and NKE s Value grade of F 
SKX stands above NKE thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that SKX is the superior value option right now ",2018-11-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/skx-vs-nke-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200363101,200363101
191360,412876,NKE,Why Nike  NKE  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Nike  NYSE NKE   which belongs to the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this athletic apparel maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 7 94   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Nike came out with earnings of  0 67 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 62 per share  representing a surprise of 8 06   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 64 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 69 per share  delivering a surprise of 7 81  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Nike lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Nike has an Earnings ESP of  0 34  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on December 20  2018 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

191395,412911,NKE,Nike Offers Dividend Diversification  Potent Brand  Resurgent Fundamentals,opinion,"There s a simple rule for those seeking income from dividend stocks make sure you diversify  When inflationary pressures are building up  like now  and bond yields are rising  some top quality dividend stocks are coming under pressure  Higher rates hurt non cyclical stocks such as power and gas utilities and telecom operators 
But when the economy is going strong and consumers have more money to spend on discretionary items  that s when industrial and consumer stocks outperform  In this group we particularly like Nike  NYSE NKE  
US Sales  And The Stock  Are Coming Back
Nike s powerful comeback this year is a reminder to bears that the Oregon based sportswear giant hasn t lost its allure for income investors  And it s doing many things right in order to revive lackluster sales in its home market 

Trading near its record high  the stock closed yesterday at  83  Nike shares are up more than 45  in the past year  proving it s one of the best dividend stocks to own in this bull run  The biggest sign that the company is on the right track to deliver superior returns is the revival of sales growth in North America 
After three quarters during which US sales contracted  the company reversed that trend in the second quarter as consumers  encouraged by a strong economy  tax cuts and rising wages  flocked back to malls 
This reversal in the domestic market comes at a time when Nike remains a powerful brand overseas  from where the company generates more than half its revenue  China sales rose 35  in the quarter ended May 31  while revenue from Asia Pacific and Latin America gained 12   Sales in Europe  the Middle East and Africa rose 24  
Nike s strong global brand provides a solid hedge against any slowdown in US sales  But so far  the company doesn t see any sign that consumers will put the brakes on their spending  Nike is now forecasting annual sales growth in the high single digits  up from a previous estimate for growth in the mid  to high single digits 
Dividend Yield Is Low  But Payouts Are Consistent
This positive momentum really bodes well for Nike s faithful investors  who have relied on the company s dividend payments and understand the cyclical nature of its business  Nike stock currently pays  0 20 per share on a quarterly basis  translating to an annual dividend yield of 1  
That yield obviously doesn t look attractive when compared to other high yielding stocks in the market  But analyzing stocks just based on their yields isn t a good approach  The best dividend stocks are the ones whose payouts are raised regularly 
On this metric  Nike has done a great job  It has hiked its payout for 14 consecutive years  meaning Nike has the financial power to successfully ride through downturns and recessions  such as the one we saw in 2008 that forced many consumer cyclicals to suspend their payouts and seek government sponsored bailouts 
Rising dividends is a good reason for income investors to hold onto Nike stock without worrying too much about quarterly performance  Those that did have been handsomely rewarded  Since the start of 2008  Nike stock has gained 461  in value  including re invested dividends 
Bottom Line
To balance the risk from interest sensitive sectors  you should also hold stocks that tend to do well when rates rise and the economy is going strong  Nike is one of those low risk stocks that have an impressive track record of performing well in many economic cycles  This is not a bad time to include this powerful brand in your income portfolio ",2018-09-13,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nike-stock-offers-dividend-diversification-resurgent-fundamentals-200343575,200343575

At last check  Trade Alert pegged the implied daily earnings move for NKE at 8 6     well above the 4 8  next day move the stock has averaged over the last two years  It s been a mixed bag as to whether the reactions have been positive or negative  though Nike shares swung 11  higher the day after the retailer s June report  What s more  this post earnings performance and an 11  surge in June 2017 are the only two times in the last eight quarters the stock has met or exceeded the percentage move the options market is currently pricing in for the stock

However  the weekly 9 28 84 50 strike and 90 strike calls are most active  and it looks like traders may be selling to open these options  If this is the case  the call writers are either setting short term ceilings for NKE stock  or anticipating a post earnings volatility crush  The at the money implied volatility  IV  term structure on weekly 9 28 Nike options is 66 25   compared to 30 85  for the standard October series 
Looking at the charts  Nike shares were last seen trading down 1 1  at  84 59  as broad market headwinds offset a price target hike to  96 from  90 at Stifel  The Dow stock has put in a strong performance over the long term  though  up 35 1  year to date  Plus  NKE quickly shook off a negative reaction to the company s use of controversial NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick in its latest ad campaign  and topped out a record high of  86 04 last Friday  Sept  21 ",2018-09-25,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/shortterm-nike-options-price-in-outsized-earnings-reaction-200345374,200345374

191402,412918,NKE,Exclusive  Sri Lanka risks EU trade concessions if any back sliding on rights,news,"By Sanjeev Miglani and Shihar Aneez COLOMBO  Reuters    The European Union will consider stripping Sri Lanka of its duty free access if it backs off commitments on rights  the EU ambassador said  amid worries stoked by the president s replacing of the elected premier by a wartime nationalist  The European Union is worried the return of Mahinda Rajapaksa  as prime minister  could derail halting progress made toward national reconciliation following a war with ethnic minority Tamil separatists that killed tens of thousands  many during the final stages under his watch as president    The government got GSP on the basis of certain commitments  if these commitments are not met  then we would consider withdrawal   EU ambassador to Sri Lanka  Tung Lai Margue  told Reuters on Thursday  Margue was referring to Generalised System of Preferences Plus status  under which Sri Lanka s top exports of garments and fish get lucrative concessions in the world s largest single market  Margue was among a group of diplomats who met President Maithripala Sirisena this week for a briefing on the crisis sparked by his sacking of the prime minister  The EU provides the trade concessions to developing countries  while it also monitors certain conditions including human rights  Sri Lanka promised the EU in 2016 it would work toward reconciliation with Tamils  who mostly live in the north and east of the predominantly Buddhist nation  through greater political and economic autonomy  Sri Lanka also pledged to provide justice and reparations to victims of human rights violations committed during the 26 year civil war  many of which were blamed on Rajapaksa and his brother  Gotabaya Rajapaksa  who was his defense secretary   Both say the military only targeted insurgents  not civilians  Margue said some progress had been made toward human rights by the administration of sacked prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe  such as the establishment of a missing persons  office to trace the thousands of Tamils and minority Muslims who disappeared during the war  But more needed to be done and there were questions about whether a government led by Rajapaksa would pursue justice for victims as vigorously    I don t know what his policy on reconciliation would be like  I have fears it won t be the one we agreed on   Margue said  Rajapaksa was not available for comment  but his son Namal Rajapaksa  who is a member of parliament  defended the family s record and cautioned against pre judging policies of the administration    Reconciliation has  and always will be  a focal area for us  If there is concern that GSP will need to be withdrawn  these concerns are unfounded and presupposed in error   he said   Soon after he was appointed prime minister on Oct  26 Rajapaksa also struck a conciliatory note  saying he would  eschew the politics of hate   protect human rights and the independence of the judiciary and establish law and order   STRONGEST WARNING  Sirisena suspended parliament last week  after he sacked Wickremesinghe  Wickremesinghe has denounced his removal as illegal  Both the United States and the EU have called for parliament to be convened at the earliest to let lawmakers decide who should be prime minister of the country of 21 million people   On Friday  the speaker of parliament said Sirisena had agreed to summon a session on Wednesday next week  The EU warning on trade is the strongest yet from Western powers which  along with India  the island s nearest neighbor  have urged Sirisena to abide by the constitution  On the other hand  China  which invested billions of dollars during Rajapaksa s presidency  has called for non interference and said Sri Lanka could tackle its own problems  Diplomats said trade was key to Sri Lanka s  87 billion economy and the EU is its biggest export market  accounting for nearly a third of exports in 2017   Sri Lanka regained the GSP plus preferential treatment in 2017  Its exports to the EU have since jumped 18 percent  and the financial year was not yet over  Margue said   Fish exports had jumped 100 percent  he said  China  in contrast  has faced criticism for its big projects that have left Sri Lanka so much in debt it had to hand over control of a port to China    It s better to do trade than have friends  friends who give loans   said a Western diplomat referring to China s lending

191412,412928,NKE,Trade Headwinds Again  Second Half Starts On Rocky Note,opinion," Monday Market Open  Market sentiment was once again overshadowed by negativity surrounding global trade as Wall Street appeared set to open the first trading day of the second half of the year on the back foot 
Tariffs And Retaliatory Tariffs
The pessimism comes after President Trump talked up a threat to impose global auto tariffs and an Axios report stated the administration had drafted a bill that would allow the White House to raise tariffs without congressional consent  U S  goods could face  300 billion in new tariffs from the European Union if Trump implements threatened duties against EU automakers  the Financial Times reported  Meanwhile  Asian stocks fell sharply  Tariffs from China and the U S  are scheduled to take effect at the end of this week  Canada on Friday announced billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs on more than 200 U S  products  Those tariffs went into effect Sunday 
Crude oil also started the second half of the year on a negative note after Trump tweeted that Saudi Arabia could raise production  However  today s moves comes against a backdrop of crude being up sharply in recent weeks 
Positive End To Q2
U S  stocks ended last week and the first half of the year on an upbeat note with the three major indices in the green for the day  But they were down on the week 
Before selling off later in the day Friday  bank stocks had been higher after largely positive results from the second part of the Federal Reserve s stress tests  After the tests were completed  some banks that were deemed adequately capitalized said they would raise dividends and buybacks 
On Friday  Nike  NYSE NKE  shares gained more than 11  after the shoe and apparel giant reported stronger than expected earnings and revenue and said it had returned to sales gains in North America  The company also announced a  15 billion stock buyback plan  to be completed within its fiscal 2019 
Holiday Week And Jobs Data
With U S  markets closed for the Independence Day holiday on Wednesday  and some perhaps taking off other days this week  trading could be light  Plus  with the monthly employment report set to be released on Friday morning  see figure 1 below   some traders tend to lighten their positions ahead of the number  then settle in and wait for the data before re initiating positions  It may be worth keeping in mind that thin trading can heighten volatility  exacerbating moves either to the upside or downside 

Figure 1  Civilian Unemployment Rate  1946 2018  The market heads into Friday s release of employment data at one of the lowest points in the postwar period  Note the various peaks and troughs over the long cycles  Source  Federal Reserve s FRED database  FRED  is a registered trademark of the Federal Reserve Bank of St  Louis  The Federal Reserve Bank of St  Louis does not sponsor or endorse and is not affiliated with TD Ameritrade  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Jobs Report on Tap  Arguably the biggest piece of economic news the market will get this week is Friday s jobs report  June nonfarm payrolls are expected to show a gain of 195 000  according to economists polled by Briefing com  The unemployment rate is expected to come in at 3 8   which would be unchanged from last month  This report can move the market if it comes in with a big miss to the upside or downside  Investors watching these figures may also want to consider taking a look at average hourly earnings  which are also included in the report  Wages are an important part of the inflation outlook  and a big jump in wages because of the tight labor market could be viewed as reason for the Fed to get more hawkish on interest rates 
GDP for Q2  Second quarter gross domestic product looks like it may come in stronger than the readings for Q1 according to some related data recently released  The market won t see the official advance estimate from the government until July 27  But it s possible that the economy performed better in Q2 than the 2  annualized growth shown in the government s third GDP estimate for Q1 released last week  Don t forget  many companies reported Q1 slowness due to weather  potentially adversely affecting GDP  Consider the Institute for Supply Management s manufacturing index  which rose to 58 7 in May from 57 3 in April  an indication of strong growth in manufacturing for the 21st month in a row  According to the ISM  the past relationship between the index and the overall economy indicates that the May reading corresponds to a 4 8  increase in annualized GDP growth  The June ISM manufacturing index reading is scheduled to be released this morning 
Consumer Spending  While 2Q GDP may come in higher than last quarter s  Briefing com said that forecasts could be tempered by last week s data on consumer spending  Personal spending in May showed a 0 2  gain  That was lower than economists polled by Briefing com had expected despite personal income rising by an as expected 0 4   Real personal consumption expenditures    an inflation adjusted estimate that excludes the effects of price changes    decreased less than 0 1    Real PCE was  essentially  flat  which is likely to prompt some downward revisions to Q2 GDP forecasts   Briefing com said  Still  the headline personal spending number does show growth  however slight  And the same report showed gains in the headline and core PCE price indexes   The price indexes are moving in the direction anticipated by the Fed  which means the Fed is also likely to keep moving the fed funds rate higher as anticipated   Briefing com said

191413,412929,NKE,Nike Retreats From All Time High Of 81 00,opinion,"Nike Inc  NYSE  NYSE NKE  traded lower on Monday and Tuesday  after it hit an all time high of 81 00 on Friday  The stock continues to trade within the upside channel that has been containing the price action since the beginning of September 2017  and thus  despite the latest setback  we believe that the medium term outlook is positive 
On Tuesday  the stock closed the session slightly above 76 00  a support defined by the inside swing high of the 7th of June  If the bulls are strong enough to take the reins from near that zone today  then we would expect them to aim for another test near the 81 00 level in the days to come  A decisive close above 81 00 would confirm a forthcoming higher high and perhaps signal the continuation of the prevailing uptrend towards new unchartered territories 
Looking at our daily oscillators though  we believe that there is likelihood for the current pullback to continue for a while more  The RSI turned down after it hit its 70 line  while the MACD  although above both its zero and trigger lines  shows signs that it could turn south soon as well 
A dip below 76 00 could confirm the case for further retreat and could pave the way for the lower bound of the aforementioned upside channel  That said  even if this is the case  we would still consider the trend to be positive and we would still see a decent chance for buyers to jump in near the lower end of the channel 
We would like to see a dip below the psychological zone of 70 00 before we abandon the bullish case  at least in the short run  Such a dip could initially open the path towards the 67 00 mark  the break of which could trigger more declines  perhaps towards 64 00 ",2018-07-04,JFD Team,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nike-retreats-from-its-alltime-high-of-8100-200329261,200329261

191428,412944,NKE,Nike Earnings Preview  What Might Be Expected From Q4 ,opinion,"Nike  NYSE NKE  reports fourth quarter earnings after the closing bell on Thursday  June 28 
The stock had been trading in a narrower range between  50 and  60 for much of 2016 and 2017  Then  After hitting a 52 week low of  50 35 in October 2017  NKE started to trend upwards and reached a new 52 week high of  75 91 a few weeks ago 
In the weeks leading up to its upcoming earnings report  NKE has received some analyst upgrades and price target increases  Several of the analysts cited signs of improvements in the North America market  which has been heavily promotional and competitive in recent years amid a string of bankruptcies across major sporting goods retailers 
For Q4  NKE is expected to report adjusted EPS of  0 64 on revenue of  9 4 billion  according to third party consensus analyst estimates  On last quarter s earnings call  management said it expects revenue growth to be in the high single digit range  In the same quarter last year  NKE reported adjusted EPS of  0 60 on revenue of  8 7 billion 
When the company last reported  NKE s North America revenue decreased 6  year over year to  3 57 billion  while its other regions grew at a double digit pace  Europe  Middle East and Africa revenue increased 19  to  2 3 billion  China revenue was up 24  to  1 34 billion  and the Asia Pacific and Latin America region s revenue increased 13  to  1 27 billion  Revenue in the company s smallest division  Converse  declined 3  to  483 million 
At the same time  gross margins declined 70 basis points to 43 8  in Q3  which management said was largely a result of foreign exchange headwinds  offset by slightly lower product costs  NKE s declining gross margins have been a cause of concern among analysts in the past  However  some analysts have said they think more favorable foreign exchange rate trends  combined with higher direct to consumer sales and improvements in average selling prices could help turn around the declines in Q4 
One area that some analysts have expressed concern about is the potential impact of tariffs escalating between the U S  and other countries  So far  footwear hasn t been targeted in a major way  but footwear trade organizations have expressed concerns that the industry could be impacted since both Europe and Asia  specifically China  are important markets from a sales and manufacturing perspective 
Nike 2018 StockChart  NKE hit a new all time high of  75 91 on June 7  The stock got close to that level again on June 15  but it has pulled back a bit since then  along with the broader markets  So far this year  shares are up 14 29  year to date  Chart source  thinkorswim  by TD Ameritrade   Not a recommendation  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Nike Options Trading Activity

The stock set a new all time high of  75 91 on June 7  Since the beginning of June  the stock has brushed up against  76 twice but it hasn t been able to break through that level  Ahead of earnings  shares have pulled back to the mid  72 range 
Around the upcoming earnings release  option traders have priced in about a 4 8  stock move in either direction  according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim  platform  As of this morning  implied volatility was at the 80th percentile 
In short term trading at the June 29 weekly expiration  volume on the call side has been concentrated at the 72 strike price  while volume on the put side has been heavier at the 68 and 70 strikes 
At the July 20 monthly expiration  there hasn t been a lot of trading that stands out  On the call side  recent volume has been concentrated at the 72 5 strike price  right at the money  Trading has been lighter on the put side  and mostly spread out around the 67 5 to 70 strike prices 
Note  Call options represent the right  but not the obligation  to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time  Put options represent the right  but not the obligation to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time  
Looking Ahead

191504,413020,NKE,Dollar Extends Declines After Fed Meeting  BoE And US Tariffs Decision In Focus,opinion,"Here are the latest developments in global markets 

FOREX  The dollar extended its declines from yesterday on Thursday  touching its lowest in nearly two weeks versus a basket of currencies  FOMC policymakers  decision to continue signaling three hikes in total for 2018 was seen as the catalyst behind the US currency s decline 
STOCKS  US markets closed a little lower yesterday in the aftermath of the Fed decision  as the upward revision in the rate projections for 2019 and 2020 raised concerns that this tightening cycle would last longer than previously anticipated  The Nasdaq Composite dropped by 0 3   while both the S P 500 and the Dow Jones closed 0 2  lower  Moreover  futures tracking the Dow Jones  S P 500  and Nasdaq 100 are all well into negative territory  pointing to a lower open today  possibly due to reports the US will unveil new tariffs against China today  In Asia  Japan s Nikkei 225 and Topix indices gained 1 0  and 0 65  respectively on their first day back from a public holiday  but in Hong Kong  the Hang Seng was down by more than 0 9   In Europe  futures tracking all the major indices are currently flashing red 
COMMODITIES  Oil prices traded somewhat lower today  with Crude Oil WTI and Brent Crude being 0 1  and 0 2  lower respectively  both benchmarks giving back some of the notable gains they posted yesterday  Both WTI and Brent rose to levels last seen in early February on Wednesday  after the weekly EIA crude inventory data surprisingly showed a drawdown in stockpiles  signaling that US demand remains healthy  The decline in the US dollar was also positive for oil prices yesterday  In precious metals  gold surged yesterday on the back of a declining greenback  reaching its highest level since early March  A weaker US currency makes the dollar denominated metal appear more appealing for investors using foreign currencies 

Major movers  Dollar broadly weaker in the aftermath of Fed meeting
The dollar s index against a basket of currencies traded 0 35  lower at 89 47  after losing 0 65  on Wednesday  Earlier on Thursday  the index touched 89 45 at its lowest  a level last tested on March 8  The fall in the dollar came after FOMC members continued to project three interest rate hikes in total for 2018 upon completion of the Fed s meeting on monetary policy on Wednesday  In an environment of rising expectations for four hikes  this was viewed as dollar negative for market participants who in turn sold off the greenback  Meanwhile  as widely expected  the Fed did raise rates yesterday for the Fed funds rate to enter a target band between 1 50 1 75  
Interestingly  the dollar was not supported by Fed policymakers  decision to revise upwards their expectations of the number of hikes for 2019 and 2020 on the back of an improving economic outlook according to their view 
Indicative of dollar weakness  the yen  euro and sterling were all building on yesterday s notable gains  At 0732 GMT  dollar yen was down by 0 25  at 105 74  around a yen below Wednesday s one week high  while it also recorded a two week low of 105 55  Euro dollar was up by 0 35  at 1 2379  recording an eight day high of 1 2388 previously  Pound dollar traded higher by 0 25  at 1 4173  close to the one and a half month high of 1 4177 posted earlier in the day  sterling will be in focus later on Thursday as the Bank of England will be completing its meeting on monetary policy 
Commodity linked currencies  including the Loonie  Aussie and the Kiwi  which took a beating recently on the back of concerns over global trade  also recorded hefty gains versus the US currency overnight  On Thursday  dollar Loonie traded lower by 0 15  and not far above a nine day low of 1 2873 hit earlier in the day  Aussie dollar was 0 15  down after previously posting a six day high of 0 7783  while Kiwi dollar was up by 0 15   Australia has strong economic ties with China and an anticipated US tariff announcement on Chinese imports later on Thursday likely weighed on the currency  Meanwhile  data on Australian employment growth were relatively strong   the unemployment rate did rise but that was due to more individuals entering the labor force   while the Reserve Bank of New Zealand held rates steady at the record low of 1 50  as it completed its meeting on monetary policy  providing very few fresh signals on policy 
In emerging markets  USD CNY hit a one week low of 6 3020  The Chinese currency benefited from the overall weaker greenback but also a firmer fixing of the exchange rate by the PBOC which also proceeded with raising a key short term interest rate on Thursday  Day ahead  BoE decides on interest rates  while US prepares to unveil new tariffs
Today  sterling traders will likely focus on the Bank of England s  BoE  rate decision at 1200 GMT  No change in policy is expected  and since this is one of the  smaller  gatherings without a press conference  investors will probably scrutinize the accompanying statement and the meeting minutes for updated signals on policy  Specifically  for any hints regarding the likelihood of a rate hike at the May meeting  something markets seem to consider very probable judging by the 70  implied probability for such action  according to the UK overnight index swaps 
Any signs suggesting as much   for instance an optimistic assessment of the latest acceleration in wages   could push the May probability higher  alongside the British pound  Conversely  a more cautious stance by the Bank that downplays the likelihood for a near term hike could spell bad news for sterling  The vote count will also be important  It is forecast to be a unanimous 9 0 for staying on hold  but if some of the more hawkish members like Ian McCafferty dissent and vote for a hike  the pound could rally immediately on the news  The nation s retail sales for February are also due out a few hours ahead of the decision  at 0930 GMT 
Those will not be the only events for the pound though  as the two day EU summit will also commence today  A transitional Brexit deal has already been largely agreed  and it is simply expected to be formalized at this meeting  Still  many of the details of that deal have not been publicized yet  and the specifics could prove cause for volatility in the pound  as can any comments from the various officials at the summit 
Elsewhere  the  trade war  narrative is about to get a new chapter  as media reports suggest the Trump administration will unveil new tariffs against Chinese goods as early as today  Besides the details of these tariffs  what will be equally important is the response from Chinese authorities  China noted that it will retaliate in kind to any US tariffs  to which US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer responded that any Chinese retaliation will be met with new US measures  further amplifying concerns of a tit for tat escalation  In case the risk of a trade war increases further  the most vulnerable G10 currencies appear to be the Aussie and the Kiwi  given that the economies of Australia and New Zealand are highly reliant on commodity exports  Stock indices would probably take a serious hit as well  particularly Japanese benchmarks like the Nikkei 225  Meanwhile  safe havens such as the yen and the Swiss franc could extend their gains 
As for economic data  eurozone s preliminary Markit manufacturing and services PMIs for March will be in focus at 0900 GMT  Expectations are for these indices to decline somewhat  but to still remain safely above the critical 50 barrier  signaling continued expansion in those sectors  In Germany  the Ifo survey for March is due out at 0900 GMT as well  with forecasts pointing to a decline in both the current conditions and the expectations indices 
In the US  the preliminary Markit manufacturing PMI for March and initial jobless claims for the week ended March 16 are due for release 
In equities  Nike  NYSE NKE  will be among companies releasing quarterly results on Thursday 
Finally  in terms of speakers  we will hear from Norges Bank Governor Oystein Olsen at 1615 GMT  as well as BoE Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden  at 1700 GMT  Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins is also due to deliver remarks  at 1845 GMT  Technical Analysis  EUR GBP short term bearish  trades not far above 2 month low
EUR GBP has experienced considerable declines in recent weeks  Specifically  the pair has retreated in all but three of the twelve trading days that followed after it recorded a four month high of 0 8967 on March 7  while on Wednesday it touched a two month low of 0 8706  The RSI is declining  pointing to a negative short term picture  notice also that the indicator has just marginally crossed below the 30 oversold level 
A hawkish stance by the Bank of England later today is likely to see the pair extending its declines  Initial support in this case might come around yesterday s low of 0 8706  with a downside violation turning the focus to the nine and a half month low of 0 8686 recorded in late January  and even steeper declines shifting the attention to the 0 86 handle that may hold psychological importance 
A cautious tone by the central bank on the other hand  could see the pair advancing  The range around a previous bottom at 0 8771  which also encapsulates the 0 88 round figure and was congested recently  might offer resistance in the event of gains  A barrier to stronger bullish movement could come around the 50  and 100 day moving average lines at 0 8829 and 0 8842 respectively ",2018-03-22,XM Group,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dollar-extends-declines-after-fed-meeting-boe-and-us-tariffs-decision-in-focus-200299878,200299878

191509,413025,NKE,U S  Equity Indices Pushing Higher,opinion,"Risk appetite has certainly improved  although I remain unconvinced and feel the risks through the remainder of the week  for asset classes such as equities and credit remain symmetrical and broadly balanced 
For today  however  we can see US equity indices pushing up over 1   although volumes are somewhat on the light side  given the extent of the rally  and this has been a key thematic on most of the positive days in the past month  That said  market breadth has been upbeat and Nike  NYSE NKE  is the only stock lower in the Dow  while 89  of S P 500 listed companies are higher on the day  Corporate credit remains unconvinced as well  with the high yield  HY  credit index lower by two basis points  which seems at odds with a 33 handle move higher in the S P 500 
The lack of any move in HY credit spreads is also a red flag because one could argue it should have performed more favourably given we have seen US crude gain 2 2  on the session  However  if we look at correlations in markets  it does feel that the rally in the barrel from  61 10  from around 01 15 aedt  into  62 79 was at the epicentre of the move higher in stocks and US Treasury yields too  where we can see the US 10 year pushing from 2 82  to 2 89  with the move higher in crude 
Granted  we were also treated to an above consensus US services ISM print of 59 5  but the flow into risk assets had already materialised prior to this data point  The interesting aspect here  as I say  is the lack of any move in credit markets and that suggests to me that when we see a 33 handle gain in equities  on subdued volume  and no real move in credit then the gain in the S P 500 is either of a low quality or credit is fully priced 

So crude remains a dominant driver of broad market sentiment and whether this is being driven by a news flow around temporary halts to production in Libyan oil fields or a positive feel to this week s inventory data  crude has rediscovered its mojo  This is also largely helped by the fact the crude futures curve is still in  backwardation   which is lowering the incentive to store crude and where we can see the difference between the front month and August crude futures contracts sitting at a premium of  1 48 
Trade disputes continue to be a key focal point  as has European and UK Brexit political drama s  However  despite key Republicans such as Paul Ryan speaking out against trade tariffs  Trump is sticking to his guns and maintaining a defiant message and clearly not backing down  China seems to be at the heart of this stance  although if we look at the reaction in FX markets it s really Canada which is getting the lion s share of the treatment from the market  with the CAD which is being taken to the woodshed here  USD CAD is eyeing the 1 30 handle and currently at the highest levels since mid 2017  while AUD CAD is also looking quite attractive here  with a huge break out of the recent consolidation and through parity 
So AUD CAD is on the radar today  as will be AUD USD and the suite of AUD crosses given the event risk seen in Australia today  where the market has seen a number of data points to already feel the balance for tomorrows Q4 GDP is skewed to a print below the current 0 5  qoq and 2 5  yoy consnesus estimates  Today s net exports as a percentage of GDP  due at 11 30 aedt  is a clincher for the growth read  with the consensus expecting net exports to subtract 60bp from the Q4 GDP read  while we also get retail sales   0 4   and the RBA meeting shortly after  One suspects the RBA statement shouldn t deviate too greatly from the prior statement  and should not be a volatility event and it seems unlikely that rates pricing will alter too greatly either  If we look at the Aussie 30 day bank bills futures  we can see just 3 5bp of hikes priced for August and 11 5bp priced for December and for a sustained reaction in the AUD one suspects this sanguine pricing structure will also need to change 
So many are putting weight on the fixed income markets and the ever increasing yield premium the US 10 year Treasury commands over the Aussie 10 year  However  I would turn the focus to the rates markets and the relative differential between what is priced in Australian interest rates  I ve looked at the 90 day bank bill futures  relative to US rates  Eurodollar futures   Specifically  if we look further out the interest rate curve to what is priced from December 2018 to December 2020  we can see Aussie rate expectations have come down far more aggressively than its US peer and while Aussie rate  through this period  still trades at a premium  we can see this advantage has come into 15bp   which is the lowest since December and actually argues that the AUD USD should be closer to 76c 

A gain is a gain though and after a tough day at the office for Aussie equity traders and investors of late  we can see the ASX 200 eyeing an open closer to 5952   57 points   so the bulls will feel a little more optimistic today  Naturally  energy should do well  with materials supported  where we can see BHPs ADR sitting up 0 8   Aussie financials will put in the bulk of the points though and I would expect the likes of CBA to also open around 0 8  higher  So a constructive open and it will be interesting to see if we see follow through buying after the full unwind of the index from 10 10 AEDT  or whether traders use this strength to raise cash levels in the portfolio  It could tell a lot about sentiment and whether Asia feels we are in for better days ahead  As is say  I remain unconvinced  but the market is always right when it comes to trading ",2018-03-06,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-long-and-the-short-of-it-200295994,200295994

191515,413031,NKE,Athletics   Kenyan officials cleared of extortion charges,news,By Mitch Phillips LONDON  Reuters    Former senior Kenyan athletics official David Okeyo  who was last week banned from the sport for life for siphoning sponsorship funds  has been cleared a extorting money from athletes in exchange for lighter sentences in doping cases  Okeyo  a former Secretary General and Vice President of Athletics Kenya  AK  as well as a member of the IAAF Council  and Isaac Mwangi  former CEO of AK  were both cleared of extortion changes by an IAAF Ethics Board on Thursday in a 62 page judgment  Despite the verdicts  however  the panel noted deep concerns about the evidence and the procedures and structures of the sport s governing body in Kenya  the dominant force in distance running for decades  and said that extortion may well have taken place and recommended changes   Last week Okeyo was banned and fined  50 000 after being found guilty of diverting thousands of dollars of  Nike   NYSE NKE  sponsorship payments for his personal use  He has denied any wrongdoing and said he plans to appeal  Thursday s Ethics Panel report concerned a separate issue  namely that he tried to extort money  to help  Kenyan athletes who had tested positive for performance enhancing drugs  either by covering up their tests or for arranging lighter sentences  a charge he and Mwangi both denied  The charges against Okeyo related to four athletes   Ronald Kipchumba  Peris Jepkorir  Viola Kimetto and Wilson Erupe  Mwangi was charged with trying to extort money from Erupe  Jepkorir  Joy Sakari and Koki Manunga  Mwangi was suspended in February 2016 pending the hearing following reports that sprinter Sakari and hurdler Manunga said he had asked them for  24 000 to reduce the four year bans they were given after testing positive in 2015  Following the investigation the Ethics Panel published its findings on Thursday  saying none of the allegations of extortion made against Okeyo or Mwangi  who they described as a witness who gave a positive impression  had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt  However  the panel added   We cannot conclude that the evidence Ms Sakari and Ms Koki Manunga gave was untrue nor can it conclude that Mr Mwangi was lying when he denied their allegations  The panel is thus left in the uncomfortable position of having heard contradictory evidence from witnesses that  in the main  it has found to be credible   In the case of     Mr Kipchumba     it considers there to be credible evidence to suggest that extortion may have taken place  even though ultimately the panel has concluded that the evidence does not meet the standard of proof required in terms of the rules of the Ethics Board   The panel added that the evidence raised enough concern to warrant the attention of both AK and the IAAF and urged them to take steps to ensure that appropriate procedures are in place to prevent extortion by officials and others involved in the processes that enforce the anti doping rules  The panel noted two particular concerns   Firstly  given the power and authority of national athletics officials over athletes  there may be a risk that unscrupulous officials will seek to take improper advantage of athletes    Secondly that should this happen  it is difficult for athletes to seek to vindicate their rights because often athletes are persons of limited or moderate means and often they are considerably younger and less experienced than sports administrators   In the view of the panel  the development of policies and practices to prevent the abuse of athletes  including well publicised whistle blower procedures within the sport  should be an urgent priority for the IAAF and its member federations  ,2018-09-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/athletics--kenyan-officials-cleared-of-extortion-charges-1600267,1600267

191527,413043,NKE,NFL notebook  Trump calls Kaepernick ad  terrible message ,news,"A day after  Nike   NYSE NKE  unveiled an ad campaign featuring controversial quarterback Colin Kaepernick  there was no shortage of reactions   I think it s a terrible message   President Donald Trump  speaking to The Daily Caller  said of Nike using Kaepernick to commemorate the 30th anniversary of its  Just Do It  campaign   Nike is a tenant of mine  in a building at 6 East 57th St  in New York   They pay a lot of rent   When discussing the matter further  Trump said he doesn t like Nike s decision but also respects the company s right to hire the spokesperson it chooses   As much as I disagree with the Colin Kaepernick endorsement  in another way    I mean  I wouldn t have done it   Trump said   In another way  it is what this country is all about  that you have certain freedoms to do things that other people think you shouldn t do  but I personally am on a different side of it     Days before his expected return after a 20 month absence  Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck opened up about the dark moments he went through during his drawn out recovery from shoulder surgery   I was a sad  miserable human   Luck told the Indy Star   I was not nice to myself  nor was I nice to anyone else  I was a miserable SOB to be around  I was nervous  I was scared   After initially injuring his shoulder in Week 3 of 2015  Luck opted not to have surgery after that season  but a procedure became necessary a year later after he struggled to make it through 2016  He had surgery in January of 2017 and then admittedly rushed his recovery in hopes of playing in 2017 despite battling pain in his shoulder all the while   I convinced myself I could force things to happen  and I paid for it   he said    Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin told reporters he has not been in contact with Le Veon Bell this week and does not know when the running back will return to the team   I hadn t thought about it   Tomlin said when asked if he expected Bell to report Wednesday   We ll see     When he gets here  that s when we ll start quantifying all Le Veon Bell related things  his overall readiness  the amount of time that we have between his arrival and our next competition  etc   etc   Tomlin added he doesn t have a specific deadline in mind for Bell s arrival in order to play in Sunday s opener at the Cleveland Browns  saying that will depend on what sort of shape Bell is in when he shows up    Sam Darnold told reporters  it s an amazing feeling  to know he s the starting quarterback of the New York Jets  but despite all the excitement  he isn t getting carried away   It s awesome and I m really happy to be the starting quarterback  but I also know that I ve got to go out there and do my job   Darnold said  meeting the media a day after head coach Todd Bowles announced the No  3 overall pick would take the reins in the opener against the Lions  At 21 years  97 days old  Darnold will become the youngest opening day starting quarterback in NFL history  The feat is not lost on the rookie  but he also said it reminds him of work to be done   I mean  yeah  it s cool   he said       I think that s more of just affirmation of knowing that I ve got a long way to go     Doug Pederson delayed making the call at quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles because last season s starter  Carson Wentz  is close to being medically cleared  Pederson  who named Nick Foles the starter for Week 1 against the Atlanta Falcons on Thursday in the opening game of the 2018 NFL regular season  said Tuesday he didn t decide on Foles until Monday despite reports last week that pointed to Foles  Wentz continues to practice on a limited basis but has not yet been cleared for contact  He s recovering from surgery on his left knee in December necessitated by an injury against the Los Angeles Rams   He s in a great spot   Pederson said    Pederson officially ruled out wide receivers Alshon Jeffery  shoulder  and Mack Hollins  groin   and the team re signed wideout Markus Wheaton    who spent training camp with the team    to provide depth for Thursday s opener  Jeffery is  week to week  as he recovers from shoulder surgery  while Hollins sustained  a little bit of a minor setback   Pederson said  Also missing practice was defensive end Michael Bennett  knee   whose status for Thursday is unclear after he was not on Monday s injury report  Running back Jay Ajayi  foot  returned to a full practice after being limited on Monday  To make room for Wheaton on the roster  tight end Richard Rodgers  knee  was placed on injured reserve    New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski told reporters he s  super satisfied  with his adjusted contract and relieved to have it out of the way as the regular season begins  Gronkowski  who had  4 3 million in incentives added to his deal last week  was asked if he was frustrated by the lucrative extensions signed by superstars around the league    including Khalil Mack  Aaron Donald and Julio Jones    that have been borne out of holdouts   I m super satisfied with my situation   Gronkowski said   If I wasn t  I would try to pull a move like they did  It works out    they get rewarded for holding out    but I m not frustrated at all or anything  I m super satisfied and just ready to go     Patriots left tackle Trent Brown is expected to return to practice Wednesday and play Sunday after missing Monday and Tuesday with an excused absence  according to an ESPN report  Brown  25  was acquired in a trade during April s draft from the San Francisco 49ers and has spent the whole offseason starting on Tom Brady s blind side  The team also re signed recently released offensive lineman Brian Schwenke and reportedly waived wideout Amara Darboh  who was claimed off waivers earlier this week  According to an NFL Network report  Darboh is having surgery Tuesday  although it s unclear what kind of surgery  He missed the preseason with hip and collarbone injuries    Carolina Panthers wide receiver Curtis Samuel is expected to miss the team s season opener against the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday after undergoing a small procedure to correct an irregular heartbeat  according to a report from NFL Network  Samuel was absent from practice Tuesday  Panthers coach Ron Rivera offered no details when speaking to reporters  saying Samuel is  dealing with a medical issue    He saw the doctor today  so we ll wait to see what the doctor has to say   Rivera said  Samuel had missed practice Sunday because he was sick  but Rivera was not sure if the issues were related    Quarterback Davis Webb  released by the New York Giants  was signed to the practice squad of the New York Jets  Webb will be paid a full salary as if he were on the 53 man roster  NFL Network reported  He made  600 000 with the Giants last season  Quarterback John Wolford was released from the practice squad to make room for Webb  who was cut by the Giants in favor of rookie Kyle Lauletta and Alex Tanney    The Miami Dolphins listed both Kenyan Drake and Frank Gore as starting running backs on their official depth chart  with Drake s name listed first  Head coach Adam Gase has said he hopes to get Drake 15 20 carries and six to eight targets per game  but Gore is expected to work in as well  and perhaps draw the occasional start  Elsewhere  the Dolphins are signing former New England Patriots running back Brandon Bolden and cutting center Travis Swanson in a corresponding move  according to a Miami Herald report  Swanson was signed on Monday after being released by the Jets at final cutdown  Bolden is primarily a special teams contributor who was among the Patriots  final cuts    The Kansas City Chiefs announced a contract extension for offensive lineman Cameron Erving  Terms were not announced  but multiple reports said it is a two year extension worth up to  15 7 million based on playing time incentives  with  6 45 million guaranteed  Erving  a former first round pick of the Cleveland Browns  was entering the final year of his contract after his fifth year option was declined and was set to make  1 72 million this year  Erving  26  has played in 42 games  21 starts  through three seasons  seeing time at all five positions up front  He saw action in 13 games  four starts  in his first year with the Chiefs last season  playing right guard and left tackle    The Arizona Cardinals and State Farm have agreed on an 18 year naming rights commitment that results in the team s home venue becoming State Farm Stadium  the Cardinals announced  The Cardinals  home venue has been known as University of Phoenix Stadium since its inaugural season of 2006  The team expects much of its rebranding to be in place by its season opener against the Washington Redskins on Sunday  University of Phoenix will remain connected to the Cardinals as the team s official education partner    The

without All Pro running back Le Veon Bell  Bell was absent when practice began Monday morning at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex  He didn t show up for training camp and has not signed his  14 54

said in a statement   Coach  Mike  Tomlin and the coaching staff will continue to focus on preparing the players on our roster for our regular season opener on Sunday against the Cleveland Browns     No  3 overall pick Sam Darnold was named the starting quarterback by coach Todd Bowles as the New York Jets close in on their Sept  10 opener against the Detroit Lions  Darnold  who won the job over veteran Josh McCown  will become the youngest opening day starting quarterback in NFL history at 21 years  97 days when he takes the field for the Monday night contest against the Lions   We feel like he gives us a good chance to win   Bowles told reporters   We re not starting him because he s a rookie and he s not ready  We re starting him because he gives us a good chance to win the game     Colin Kaepernick and  Nike   NYSE NKE  unveiled a new ad featuring the quarterback as part of the company s 30th anniversary  Just Do It  campaign  The image  which Kaepernick tweeted out  shows a black and white closeup of the quarterback s face and the words   Believe in something  Even it if it means sacrificing everything  Just do it   According to ESPN  Nike has kept paying Kaepernick    who signed with the brand in 2011    despite not using him in ads over the past two years  but planned to bring him back at the right time    Philadelphia Eagles coach Doug Pederson finally confirmed what everyone already knew  Nick Foles will start Thursday s season opener against the Atlanta Falcons  Pederson made it official Monday when he addressed reporters in the auditorium at team headquarters  ending months of questions   Nick Foles is the starter and we have complete confidence  obviously  in what he can do  We re ready to go with Nick   The announcement follows a testy exchange Pederson had with reporters on Sunday when he was angry about a published report that said he had named Foles the starter  He said he never made such a declaration    Nathan Peterman  not first round pick Josh Allen  was named starting quarterback of the Buffalo Bills  Peterman  a fifth round pick in 2017  threw five interceptions in his first NFL start against the Los Angeles Chargers last season when former Buffalo quarterback Tyrod Taylor briefly lost the job  A stern test awaits Peterman  with the Baltimore Ravens  San Diego Chargers and Minnesota Vikings on the schedule the first three weeks of the season  Allen  the No  7 pick in the 2018 draft  is the No  2 quarterback for the Bills to open the season    Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck returned to practice after taking a week off to recover from a minor foot injury  He injured the foot Aug  25 in a preseason game against the San Francisco 49ers  As long as Luck does not sustain another injury  he is on track to make his first start since the end of the 2016 season when the Colts meet the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday  Luck  who turns 29 on Sept  12  missed all of last season while recovering from surgery to his throwing shoulder  but all indications are his shoulder won t be an issue when the season opens    Browns wide receiver Josh Gordon returned to practice and is expected to play in Sunday s regular season opener against the Steelers  The team s No  3 wideout was slowed by a hamstring injury last week  Coach Hue Jackson said Gordon  who was away from the team during training camp while in rehab at the University of Florida  would not start against Pittsburgh  Rookie fourth round pick Antonio Callaway will start in Gordon s place  per Jackson    Bills running back LeSean McCoy will not be placed on the commissioner s exempt list and is eligible to play Sunday in the opener at Baltimore  the NFL said  NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told the Washington Post that the running back s status  has not changed  as police continue to investigate an alleged home invasion at McCoy s Milton  Ga   house  which happened in July  Meanwhile  the Bills are bringing in former Denver Broncos quarterback Paxton Lynch for a visit Tuesday  according to an NFL Network report  and coach Sean McDermott named Ryan Groy the starting center over Russell Bodine    The Dallas Cowboys intend to keep center Travis Frederick on the active roster instead of sending him to injured reserve  according to multiple reports  The plan means the team expects Frederick to return sooner than midway through the regular season  If he were placed on IR  he could not be recalled until after Week 8  though the team would have a free roster spot to use in the interim  If kept on the active roster  Frederick can return to play whenever he is healthy  No timetable has been given for Frederick s return since he was diagnosed with Guillain Barre syndrome two weeks ago  after he saw several specialists to determine the cause of repeated stinger like symptoms experienced during training camp    New York Giants coach Pat Shurmur expanded on the decision to waive quarterback Davis Webb to make room for other players claimed on waivers Sunday   I think I mentioned long ago there was no depth chart behind Eli  Manning    Shurmur told reporters    Webb  got a lot of reps  and I think it was probably that where people start to assume because he s taking second string reps that he s a second string quarterback  and it didn t play out that way   Meanwhile  tight end Evan Engram practiced on a limited bases but remains in the concussion protocol  and defensive end Olivier Vernon missed practice as he recovers from an ankle injury  Shurmur said the team is hopeful both players can play Sunday against the Jacksonville Jaguars    The Denver Broncos will start rookie third rounder Royce Freeman at running back  coach Vance Joseph told reporters  Freeman will be the first rookie to be the Broncos  Week 1 starting running back since Terrell Davis in 1995  He and third year veteran Devontae Booker shared first team reps throughout training camp and the preseason  but the rookie shined in preseason games with 15 carries for 84 yards and three touchdowns  Joseph has been vocal about the team s plan to use multiple backs throughout the season  He reiterated Monday that Freeman will handle the bulk of early down work  while Booker is likely to take the lead in passing situations    Tennessee Titans tight end Delanie Walker and outside linebacker Brian Orakpo said they will be ready for Sunday s season opener against the Dolphins in Miami  while right tackle Jack Conklin is getting closer to a return  Walker  who has been battling an apparent toe injury  and Orakpo  shoulder  each returned to practice last week after missing all of the preseason  The Titans have been extremely tight lipped about injuries under new head coach Mike Vrabel  but both players expect to play  Conklin  who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in the divisional playoffs in mid January  was activated from the physically unable to perform list before final cuts and did limited work in individual drills at Monday s practice  General manager Jon Robinson said Conklin is  progressing nicely   but no timetable has been given for the tackle s return    Starting left tackle Donovan Smith and rookie first round defensive tackle Vita Vea both missed practice as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers prepared for Sunday s game at the New Orleans Saints  Smith sprained his right knee two weeks ago in practice and was given a timetable of two to four weeks to return  Vea  drafted 12th overall in April  has missed more than a month with a strained calf muscle  which initially was not expected to cost him regular season games  The Bucs also announced four roster moves  claiming defensive end Carl Nassib off waivers from the Cleveland Browns  placing defensive tackle Mitch Unrein on injured reserve  releasing defensive end Will Clarke and re signing long snapper Garrison Sanborn    The Detroit Lions and safety Quandre Diggs agreed to a contract extension

safety after Tavon Wilson sustained a torn biceps  In five starts  he had three interceptions and a forced fumble  Diggs is expected to pair with Glover Quin at safety for the Lions    The 49ers officially placed running back Jerick McKinnon on injured reserve  two days after he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee during a non contract drill in practice  McKinnon  26  played four seasons with the Vikings before signing a four year   30 million deal with the 49ers in the offseason  He rushed for a career best 570 yards last season  San Francisco also announced it signed offensive lineman Matt Tobin and safety Antone Exum Jr  to one year contracts  placed safety Marcell Harris on injured reserve and signed offensive lineman Zack Golditch to the practice squad    The Oakland Raiders signed veteran wide receiver Brandon LaFell and released wideout Johnny Holton  the team announced  LaFell  31  was released by the Bengals in early August after two years with the team  He will serve as another veteran target after the Raiders released Martavis Bryant    acquired for a third round pick in April    during final cutdowns  The Raiders also announced they claimed

191540,413056,NKE,NIKE  NKE  Stock Loses Track  Will Strategies Aid Recovery ,opinion,"NIKE Inc    NYSE NKE   stock seems to be jittery following a mixed second quarter fiscal 2018  While the company seemed composed with revenues topping year over year and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  earnings dipped year over year  Further  the company s pessimistic view for the third quarter and fiscal 2018 are probably the factors responsible for the stock s doom Notably  shares of the swoosh brand owner declined 0 1  since reporting earnings results on Dec 21  2017  against the  sector s growth of 2 7   Moreover  the company s performance graph disappoints relative to the solid 24 4  growth witnessed in the past three months 
That said  let s discuss in detail the core reasons for the stock s dismal performance Nike s Earnings Comparison Hurt by Soft Margins   Higher Costs
Though the athletic apparel  footwear and accessories retailer topped earnings estimates for the 22nd straight time in the fiscal second quarter  earnings lagged year over year primarily due to gross margin reduction and SG A deleverage  Gross margin shriveled due to foreign currency headwinds and rise in product costs per unit  Moreover  higher SG A expenses can be attributed to increase in operating overheads and demand creation expenses Nike  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   North American Business Continues to DisappointWhile the company s overall sales performance remains impressive  sales in its key North American market continues to suffer  The company posted 5  decline in sales for North America in second quarter fiscal 2018  Its soft sales in North America can be attributed to the lackluster product assortments  increased promotions due to growth of e commerce and intensified competition  Moreover  the company s wholesale business in the region has been impacted due to increased focus on online sales  Moreover  we believe the overall environment is likely to remain promotional in North America  hurting the results in this segment  These trends in North America make us cautious about the company s overall performance Soft FY18 and Q3 OutlookFollowing the mixed quarter and continued softness in North America  NIKE reiterated the previously stated soft outlook for fiscal 2018 and provided third quarter view  For fiscal 2018  the company anticipates mid single digits increase in revenues  with gross margin expected to contract about 50 100 basis points  bps   Additionally  SG A expense are anticipated to increase in the mid single digit range  including prudent operating overhead management  alongside investing in Consumer Direct offence Further  the company s third quarter view also remained bleak  forecasting revenue growth of flat to slightly below the second quarter level due to the timing of new product launches coming late in the quarter  While the company anticipates the underlying drivers for gross margin to improve in the third quarter  currency headwinds and a promotional retail environment across the United States is likely to outweigh margin growth  Consequently  gross margin is projected to decline 125 175 bps in the third quarter Further  the company expects SG A expense to increase in the low double digits range in the third quarter  due to increased demand creation opportunities and higher operating overheads to boost digital capabilities Estimates Slide in Response to the Soft ViewInfluenced by the soft outlook  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter and the fiscal years witnessed a downtrend  Estimate for the third quarter and fiscal 2018 declined by 13 cents and 3 cents  respectively  to 54 cents per share and  2 25 per share  Further  estimate for fiscal 2019 dipped by 1 cent to  2 61 per share Where s NIKE Heading   Is a Recovery Coming Up Though the softness in second quarter earnings and soft outlook are concerns  we cannot surely ignore the company s otherwise strong results  which included solid top line growth and earnings beat  Moreover  the company s focus on strategies like Consumer Direct offense and Triple Double Strategy remain noteworthy  Furthermore  the company is poised to gain from strength in international business and the global NIKE

191547,413063,NKE,Tariffs Will Hurt U S  More Than Rest of World  Maersk Says,news," Bloomberg     The U S  economy will be hit many times harder than the rest of the world by an escalating global trade war  according the the chief executive officer of A P  Moller Maersk A S 
Soren Skou  who runs the world s biggest shipping company from Copenhagen  said the fallout of the current protectionist wave  could easily end up being bigger in the U S   Tariffs could slow global annual trade growth by 0 1 to 0 3 percent  though for the U S  the effect could be  perhaps 3 or 4 percent   he said at Maersk s headquarters on Friday   And that would definitely not be good  
The company transports about 20 percent of the world s seaborne consumer goods  putting it in a unique position to gauge the fallout of tariffs on trade flows  Maersk has in the past broken with its culture of steering clear of any political debate to criticize the trade policies of U S  President Donald Trump 
Maersk focuses on trade flows between Europe and Asia and so far its industry hasn t been directly hurt by tariffs  In fact  demand grew 4 percent in the second quarter  But Skou says that may change if the U S  starts targeting consumer goods 
 The first thing the American importers would do if tariffs are put on Chinese consumer goods would be to buy in Vietnam  in Indonesia or elsewhere in Asia   Skou said   Big U S  consumer brands like  Nike   NYSE NKE  produce in all of Asia  not just in one country  so there will be a substitution effect  
The U S  put duties on  34 billion of Chinese goods last month  citing unfair trade practices by the world s second biggest economy  The Trump administration has said it will impose tariffs on a further  16 billion on Aug  23  and even signaled it won t shy away from targeting the entire  500 billion in Chinese exports to the U S 
 The other factor is that there s a lot of stuff that s now imported into the U S  that just isn t produced anywhere within the U S    Skou said   You can t get Nike sneakers or iPhones that are produced in the U S  So it will end up being pushed on to the consumer  ",2018-08-19,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/tariffs-will-hurt-us-more-than-rest-of-world-maersk-says-1579280,1579280
191548,413064,NKE,Asian Stocks Mixed as Markets Await Developments on Proposed Trump Xi Traded Talks,news,"Investing com   Asian markets were mixed on Monday as traders awaited developments on proposed trade talks between U S  President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping 
China s Shanghai Composite was up 0 1  by 12 30AM ET  04 30 GMT  while the Shenzhen Component slipped 0 3   Hong Kong s Hang Seng Index gained 1 0  
Reports over the weekend said Trump and Xi may meet in November as trade tensions escalated in recent weeks  The reports came after the two governments announced on Thursday that lower level trade talks would be held later this month to resolve intensifying trade disputes  A nine member delegation from Beijing will hold meetings with U S  officials later in the month  according to officials from both countries 
 This has given markets some reason for optimism that a de escalation of Sino US trade tensions is possible one side or other of November s US mid term elections   Ray Attrill  head of foreign exchange strategy at the National Australia Bank  said in a morning note 
Soren Skou  CEO of A P  Moller Maersk  said the U S  would get hit many times harder than other countries if a full blown global trader war were to happen 
Skou said the fallout of the current protectionist wave  could easily end up being bigger in the U S  
 The first thing the American importers would do if tariffs are put on Chinese consumer goods would be to buy in Vietnam  in Indonesia or elsewhere in Asia   Skou said at Maersk s headquarters on Friday 
 Big U S  consumer brands like  Nike   NYSE NKE  produce in all of Asia  not just in one country  so there will be a substitution effect  
The Trump administration imposed duties on  34 billion of Chinese goods in July as they accused China of unfair trade practices  adding that they will impose tariffs on a further  16 billion on Aug  23 
Trump warned earlier that the U S  may eventually target the entire  500 billion in Chinese exports to the U S 
 The other factor is that there s a lot of stuff that s now imported into the U S  that just isn t produced anywhere within the U S    Skou said   You can t get Nike sneakers or iPhones that are produced in the U S  So it will end up being pushed on to the consumer

191561,413077,NKE,HollyFrontier  Bojangles And Nike Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Dec 22  2017    highlights HollyFrontier   NYSE HFC   as the Bull of the Day and Bojangles   NASDAQ BOJA   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on the Nike  Inc    NYSE NKE   Here is a synopsis of all three stocks  As the market cheers the tax reform on Capitol Hill  there will be big winners and bigger winners  You ll have to forgive my over the top enthusiasm here but I can t emphasize the benefits for small caps enough  By some estimates  we re talking about over 40  earnings growth next year  In a market fueled by earnings  that should be music to investors  ears Perhaps the largest beneficiary will be small cap energy stocks  So it should come as no surprise that today s I ve named my Bull of the Day in this industry  I m talking about HollyFrontier  HollyFrontier Corporation is engaged in refining petroleum  It produces and markets gasoline  diesel  jet fuel  asphalt  heavy products and specialty lubricant products  HollyFrontier Corporation  formerly known as Holly Corporation  is headquartered in Dallas  Texas HollyFrontier is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  in an industry that currently ranks in the Top 19  of our Zacks Industry Rank  The reason for the favorable rank is the recent influx of earnings estimate revisions to the upside  Over the last thirty days  five analysts have come out and increased their earnings estimates for next year  while six analysts have done so for the current year  The bullish attitude has helped push the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year from  1 48 to  2 38 while next year s number has ballooned from  2 09 to  2 88 It s no wonder why investors have been handsomely rewarded in this name  The huge earnings momentum has carried over to big moves in the stock  After a spike took shares up over  30 in August  the stock retraced to its 50 day moving average  From that support  the real action began  Since then  huge momentum to the upside  with virtually no retracement has taken the stock up over  50  With earnings estimates helping to fuel the fire  this could just be the first stop along the way  There is such a huge opportunity in the market right now  With this tax reform bill comes earnings estimate revisions to the upside  Across the board stocks are receiving a big boost  Think about what another 10  or 20  upside in earnings will do to your favorite stock  favorite industry  favorite sector  With all this good news  investors need to develop a very antsy approach  What I mean by that is  you have to think   What have you done for me lately   when looking at your holdings  If they are stale  your opportunity cost is just too great Today s Bear of the Day is one of those stale names that just hasn t gone anywhere but down  I m talking about Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Bojangles For those unfamiliar with the name  Bojangles develops  operates  and franchises limited service restaurants in the United States  Its restaurants offer never frozen bone in fried chicken items  made from scratch buttermilk biscuits  fixin s  and iced tea  As of June 25  2017  the company had 740 system wide restaurants  including 314 company operated and 426 franchised restaurants located primarily in the Southeastern United States The reason for the rough Zacks Rank is the series of bearish earnings estimate revisions the company has seen recently  Seven analysts have come out and dropped their estimates for the current year while eight have done so for the next year  The downward moves have dropped the current year Zacks Consensus Estimates from 82 cents to 79 cents for the current year  Next year s number has gone from 86 cents all the way down to 7 cents The bearishness doesn t just rear its ugly head in the estimates  Looking at the stock chart since late Spring it s just as bad  After trading above  22 in early May  shares have tumbled  getting all the way down to  12  There s a ton of negative momentum here as the stock is searching for support  The commodity channel index recently gave a  Sell  signal after crossing down below the zero line Additional Content Nike  NKE  Posts Earnings Beat Praises Direct to Consumer EffortsNike  Inc  just released its second quarter

191625,413141,NKE,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch ,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  Durable Goods  Sentiment Data  Powell in Play 
As geopolitical tensions continued to grip market focus  a slew of U S  economic data could prove a timely distraction in what is expected to be subdued day ahead of a three day weekend in the US 
The Commerce Department released its preliminary report on April core durable goods orders due 08 30 am ET expected to show the 0 5  rise 
Michigan s consumer expectations Index due 10 00 am  is expected to show a reading of 86 9 for May  while consumer sentiment is forecast to show a reading of 98 8 unchanged from the previous month 
A speech by Fed chair Powell will likely garner special attention following the release of dovish fed minutes on Wednesday  The Federal Reserve s minutes showed policymakers were content with inflation temporarily overshooting the 2  target 
Speeches by FOMC Member Raphael Bostic at 11 45AM ET and  FOMC Member Robert Kaplan will also be in focus 
The dollar fell on Thursday amid a slump in U S  bond yields as expectations for a faster pace of rate hikes cooled 
2   Foot Locker  Earnings Eyed
Foot Locker is slated to release first quarter earnings before U S  markets open on Friday amid expectations that a stronger domestic performance from  Nike   NYSE NKE  bolstered the sports retailer s same store sales  
Foot Locker is expected to report earnings of  1 25 per share on  1 96 billion revenue 
Investors are also likely to zone in on whether the firm altered its guidance of delivering flat to slightly positive same store sales in the second quarter 
Shares of Foot Locker Inc  NYSE FL  closed 3 02  higher at  46 39 
3  US Rig Count Data to Ramp Up Pressure on Oil Prices

Data last week showed the number of U S  oil rigs steadied after rising for five weeks in a row

191626,413142,NKE,Nike  NKE  Stock Dips On Downgrades  Adidas Passes Jordan Brand,opinion,"Nike   NYSE NKE   stock received two analyst downgrades that caused shares of the sportswear powerhouse to dip on Tuesday  and investors might also be worried after a recent report showed that Adidas   OTC ADDYY   surpassed Jordan as the second most popular sneaker brand in the U S 
Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Sam Poser  Nike on Tuesday from  positive  to  neutral   Poser also updated his Nike price target to  54 a share from  64 a share  Nike closed at  53 50 per share on Monday 
On top of the Susquehanna downgrade  Jefferies analyst Randal Konik and his team lowered Nike s price target for the second time in the last 30 days  Konik cut his Nike price target from  60 per share to  49 per share and reiterated his  hold  rating 
The title of Jefferies  note to clients is very telling as well   DATA Shows Nike Losing to Adidas at Home   Away   The note pointed to the fact that Nike has started to lose market share to Adidas in the running shoe space 
According to Konik  Nike has only 35 shoes in the top 60 sellers in the U S  this year  Last year  the Oregon based company boasted 52 
But what might scare Nike investors further is that its competition is coming from one key competitor  Adidas  The German company had two shoes in the top 60 a year ago  This year  the Adidas earned 24 spots 
Nike has also started to discount its shoes more regularly than its European counterpart  The poor performance of Foot Locker   NYSE FL   and Finish Line   NASDAQ FINL   were also cited as reasons for concern 
According to the note  Nike s best upside scenario is that it  regains recent share losses in running and protects bball category dominance as competitive pressures lessen  
On the downside   Adidas penetration in North America accelerates faster than anticipated  driving incremental NKE share losses  Pricing power loss more severe than expected  compressing gross margins  
Shares of Nike dropped 1 9  premarket after both notes were published  The sportswear giant s stock now rests around 0 60  lower than yesterday s close and sits  7 below its 52 week high at roughly  51 20 per share 
Aside from the analyst notes  Nike took another massive blow after market research firm NPD Group reported that Adidas passed the Jordan brand as the second most popular sneaker in the U S   I ve never seen a brand in the sneaker industry grow this fast   NPD analyst Matt Powell said Adidas has overtaken Jordan as the  2 brand in U S  sport footwear  This is an achievement I never thought I would see in my lifetime   Matt Powell   NPDMattPowell  Through the first eight months of the year  Adidas claimed 11 3  of the U S  shoe market share by dollars  up from a 6 6  share in the year ago period  Nike s Jordan brand was nearly unchanged and hovers at 9 5   Nike brand s market share fell 2  but still dominates overall  claiming 37  of the market 
Bottom Line
In 2015  Adidas only claimed   The fact that Adidas eroded some of Nike and Jordan s cultural clout that quickly might make some investors very nervous  And rightfully so  because fashion and what s  cool  rarely lasts forever

191627,413143,NKE,Should You Buy Adidas  ADDYY  Stock As It Passes Jordan Brand ,opinion,"Nike   NYSE NKE   stock dipped on Tuesday after the company received two significant analyst downgrades  and one of the biggest reasons for this cautionary stance is based on increased competition from one sportswear power in particular  Adidas   OTC ADDYY   
On Monday  market research firm NPD Group reported that Adidas passed Jordan brand as the second most popular sneaker in the U S  Through the first eight months of the year  Adidas claimed 11 3  of the U S  shoe market  up from a 6 6  share in the year ago period   I ve never seen a brand in the sneaker industry grow this fast   NPD analyst Matt Powell said Adidas has overtaken Jordan as the  2 brand in U S  sport footwear  This is an achievement I never thought I would see in my lifetime   Matt Powell   NPDMattPowell  Jordan s market share was nearly unchanged and hovers at 9 5   Nike s market share fell 2  but still dominates the overall U S  market  claiming 37  of U S  shoe dollars 
The German brand is the number two sportswear company in the U S   but Adidas  impressive American growth might signal that it is poised to one day overtake Nike at the top of the sports apparel world 
Now  let s take a look at Adidas  stock and some of the company s current fundamentals to see if investors should consider the Bavarian sportswear power as Nike begins to stumble 
Fundamentals 
Adidas is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock  as it has been since the beginning of August  The company also sports  B  grades for both Growth and Momentum 
Adidas  27 29  Price Cash Flow ratio blows away the industry average of 9 83   It also tops Nike s 12 08  and helps demonstrates how much more cash the company is racking up than shipping out right now  Also  the company s Current Ratio of 1 33 and 4 75  Net Margin are both strong for the industry  which  along with Adidas  stellar cash flow  help prove its strong financial position  
Value wise  the stock is trading at nearly 30x earnings  which is not great  However  Adidas  PEG ratio of 1 44 matched the industry average  and although the company s 2 10 P S ratio rests above the industry average  it is still below Nike s 2 58  Both of these figures help to show that despite Adidas  run of success  its valuation is not entirely out of whack 
Adidas has surpassed earnings estimates in 13 of the last 16 quarters  including eight straight beats  and this trend seems likely to continue  According to our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  Adidas  earnings are expected to pop by 48 26  this quarter and skyrocket 42 33  for the year 
In the current quarter  the company s sales are expected jump 19 84   while 20 22  growth is projected for the full year  Based on our estimates  Adidas  revenues are projected to jump to between  25 29 billion and  25 88 billion for the year  Sales are expected to climb again next year and reach  29 81 billion 
Stock Movement
Despite tough times for the overall retail market  Adidas operates in the  Shoes and Retail Apparel  industry  which sits in the top 26  of the Zacks Industry Rank 
The sportswear giant s 41 18  52 week price change is outstanding and looks even better compared to the industry average of 2 78   Adidas stock has soared from  82 38 per share a year ago to rest near its all time high of  118 15  which it reached last week 
Although Adidas has also experienced a 50 48  year to date price change and only recently broke through a new high  the company might still have room to grow 
Adidas has received two upward earnings estimate revisions for this quarter within the last 60 days  In that same time frame  the company received one positive revision for next quarter  three for its full year  and two for the following year 
Bottom Line
In 2015  Adidas claimed  of the U S  shoe market by dollar value  Then  the company began to make some big changes  which included hiring a new CEO and collaborating with popular recording artists Kanye West and Pharrell Williams 
With a new brand focus and direction  Adidas has slowed chipped away at Nike and Jordan  while also building its own revamped cultural cachet in the U S 
Adidas has been king of Europe for years  but it has always been second to Nike in the global sportswear market  But sports dynasties don t always last  and now it seems that Adidas could be on the cusp of an American push that could see it close the gap with Nike

On top of that  overall U S  retail sales during the holiday season are expected to grow by 3 1   while e commerce sales are projected to skyrocket 16 6  according to 
Today  we re here to look at sporting goods and sports apparel companies with exposure in the back to school shopping market and the newly lengthened holiday shopping season

Adidas AG   OTC ADDYY   is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   The German sportswear powerhouse with a market cap of  45 billion has experienced a strong 2017  and it is coming off a particularly solid second quarter earnings report 
The sportswear giant  which also owns Reebok  saw overall quarterly revenues skyrocket 19  year over year to  5 038 billion  or  5 950 billion  Adidas attributed much of its growth to double digit increases in its running sector  But maybe  more importantly  its  Adidas Originals  and  Adidas Neo  sales rose substantially

The company s strong first half of 2017 prompted it to increase its financial outlook  Adidas now expects full year fiscal 2017 sales to increase between 17  and 19   up from previous projections of 12  to 14  growth 
Jefferies analyst Randal Konik downgraded Nike   NYSE NKE   stock on Monday  based partly on Adidas  rise in North America  Konik noted that Adidas grabbed 44  of the secondary shoe market from Nike since January 2015 and stole some of Nike s running sector dominance as well  He also noted that traffic to Nike s website has slipped  while Adidas  website has added visitors 
Konik pointed out that Adidas  move into fashion forward looks and lines  including partnerships with Kanye West and Pharrell Williams  has served the company very well in terms of slowly eroding Nike s U S  dominance in the  cool  department 
Shares of Adidas have skyrocketed from  76 69 a share in early January to rest at  111 per share on Tuesday morning  which is roughly  7 below its 52 week and all time high that Adidas reached after its second quarter results were released earlier this month

Johnson Outdoors  diving equipment sales grew by 17   which was also spurred by new products  However  slow kayak sales led to lower growth in its watercraft segment 
The outdoor company sells many big ticket items that are often reserved for the holiday season  and warm weather could potentially boost sales in the outdoor recreation sector overall 
Shares of Johnson Outdoors have climbed from  37 22 a share since early January to sit below its new 52 week and all time high of  64 39 per share

FINL Technical Analysis

FINL opened trading yesterday at  10 66 which was down from the previous day s trading close of  10 67  FINL closed trading yesterday at  10 42 and spiked down after market to  8 09  equivalent to a 22  decrease from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see the last time FINL traded below these levels we have to go all the way back to month of June 2009 when it traded at  7 42 
Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike down FINL had been in an overall downward dating back to December 8th  2016 when it traded at  24 36  FINL has a float of 35 89 million shares and traded below the normal daily trading volume on Monday 
For  purposes  I would like to see FINL open trading on Tuesday below  8 85 and if it does I would be looking to take a short position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 20 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap down

191686,413202,NKE,Nike To Invest In Asia After Weak US Sales,opinion,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average recently recorded a five day losing streak  mainly driven by Nike s  NYSE NKE  huge plunge after a weak earnings report on Wednesday 
The sportswear giant delivered a weak revenue growth at 5  to  8 43 billion missing consensus analyst estimates of  8 47  Investors have taken note of the increasing US market competition from brands such as Adidas  DE ADSGN  and Under Armour  Despite this  the retailer reported earnings of 68 cents per share  beating expectations of 53 cents per share 
Nike reported a slow sales growth in the U S for the quarter at 3   which accounts for 50  of their business  while sales in Asian countries such as China have risen by 9  and 8  in other emerging markets for the quarter 
Just recently  the company launched another effort into extending their products in Asian markets with the launch of their performance hijab for Muslim women  Nike also recently expanded their products into a plus size line  Both product launches have been received positively by the market 
This has led investors and shareholders to speculate that the company might shift a huge part of their focus to developing and expanding their Asian market  Although this hasn t been confirmed  Nike did state that they will focus on direct consumer and online in the coming months 
As the company changes its focus  analysts are now predicting that this year may not be the time to expect a recovery from the company has warned further losses in the future  Nike also reported negative futures at 4   driven by a weak wholesale order and demand for their products in the past quarters 
 To expand our leadership and ignite NIKE s next phase of growth  we re delivering a relentless flow of innovation through performance and style  increasing speed throughout the business and creating more direct connections with consumers leveraging digital and membership   said Nike Chief executive Mark Parker 
Still  investors are looking for signs of recovery in the US market as the company s ineffectiveness to succeed in the US has raised doubts from investors that the company may also lose their consumers from Asian markets if they will not be able to recover in the U S 
Nike shares fell down until extended trading by as much as 7  as investors digested the earnings report 
In their conference call  the Nike management stated that future orders have declined by 4  compared to last year  Nevertheless  analysts have stated that the company is set to return to their high single digit revenue growth as soon as Nike starts to see actual returns from their investment in direct to consumer marketing and expansion in Asian countries such as China and Taiwan ",2017-03-23,Trade12,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nike-to-invest-in-asia-after-weak-us-sales-200179974,200179974
191687,413203,NKE,Nike  NKE  Up 3 6  Since Earnings Report  Can It Continue ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Nike  Inc    NYSE NKE    Shares have added about 3 6  in that time frame  outperforming the market 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock s next earnings release  or is it due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers Nike Beats on Q4 Earnings  Revenues Soft   Mar 21  2017NIKE Inc  reported third quarter fiscal 2017 results  wherein earnings topped estimates for the 19th straight quarter but revenues fell short  Both the top line and bottom line improved year over year The lower than expected revenues mainly reflected the rise in competition for Nike s basketball shoes in North America  which is the company s largest market  and also the shifting retail backdrop  The company reported a 3  rise in North American revenues in the quarter  NIKE has been unbeatable in the U S  footwear segment for long  thanks to the popularity of its namesake and Jordan brands  However  the company is lately losing market share to Adidas AG  DE ADSGN  and Under Armour given their schedule of new product launches and efforts to redefine brands This has also led to the company reporting lower gross margins in the quarter  Further  it has provided a soft sales growth outlook for fourth quarter fiscal 2017 due to the competitive environment and challenges in the retail segment Earnings   RevenuesThis athletic apparel  footwear and accessories retailer s third quarter earnings per share of  0 68 rose 24  year over year  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 52  Earnings were fueled by sales growth  selling   administrative expense leverage  lower tax rate and a 3  decline in average share count  somewhat offset by a drop in gross margin Revenues of the swoosh brand owner advanced 5  to  8 432 million in the reported quarter but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  8 446 million  Sales grew 7  on a currency neutral basis  The year over year growth was backed by superb global demand for the NIKE Brand portfolio across all regions  Additionally  results benefited from strong eCommerce growth Revenues of the company s NIKE Brand increased 7  on a currency neutral basis to  7 923 million  The segment gained from a double digit increase in Western Europe  Greater China and Emerging Markets  along with solid growth across Sportswear and Jordan Brand categories Moreover  the NIKE brand s Direct to Consumer   DTC   revenues improved 13  in the quarter mainly on the back of robust online sales growth  6  comparable store sales growth and expansion of new stores Additionally  revenues at the company s Converse brand rose 3  on a currency neutral basis to  498 million  chiefly driven by North American growth The NIKE Brand s future orders declined 4  on a reported basis and were down 1  on a currency neutral basis  While future orders form an important part of the company s operating model  its relevance and dependence in gauging revenue growth has declined due to many factors including  the growth in eCommerce and the non inclusion of sales of its Converse brand  NIKE Factory Stores and shorter lead time businesses Costs   MarginsGross profit improved about 2  to  3 750 million  while the gross margin shriveled 140 bps to 44 5   The decline in gross margin is attributable to higher product costs  foreign currency headwinds and increased off price sales mix  which neutralized the gains of higher average selling prices Selling and administrative expense fell 3  to  2 496 million on account of lower operating overhead costs and demand creation expenses  Operating overheads dropped 1  in the quarter as lower bad debt expenses and lower administrative costs more than mitigated the expenses related to investments in the DTC business Balance Sheet   Shareholder Friendly MovesNIKE ended the quarter with cash and short term investments of  6 160 million  long term debt  excluding current maturities  of  3 472 million and shareholders  equity of  12 722 million  Inventories as of Feb 28  2017  grew nearly 7  to  4 932 million During the fiscal third quarter  NIKE bought back 8 9 million shares for  475 million under its four year  12 billion program that was approved in Nov 2015  As of quarter end  the company s total repurchases under the program amounted to 64 9 million shares for roughly  3 6 billion Looking ForwardThough NIKE is facing various hurdles  the company remains confident of driving sustainable and profitable capital efficient growth over the long term  Looking into the future  the company has embarked upon a new  triple double  strategy  focused on doubling the cadence and impact of innovation  doubling the speed to market  and doubling NIKE s direct connection to consumers in the marketplace However  the company exhibited caution in providing fiscal fourth quarter guidance as it expects the rising competition and difficult retail environment to take a toll on the top line  The company projects sales growth in the mid single digit range in the fiscal fourth quarter  slightly short of the growth reported in the third quarter  On a currency neutral basis  it anticipates revenues to increase in the high single digit range  During the fourth quarter  the company expects to see tremendous sales growth internationally  including Greater China  Europe and Emerging markets However  NIKE remains cautious on sales projections for North America  The company plans to tighten supply of newly released products in North America to maintain demand For fourth quarter fiscal 2017  gross margin is projected to fall by nearly 150 to 175 bps in the quarter  mainly due to adverse currency movements  Further  SG A expenses for the fourth quarter are estimated to remain flat year over year  backed the productivity gains from the ongoing Edit to Amplify initiative  Further  the company expects interest expense of about  15 million and tax rate of 22  in the fourth quarter

NKE Technical Analysis

NKE opened trading yesterday at  58 78 which was up from the previous day s trading close of  58 68  Shares closed trading yesterday at  58 01 and spiked down after market to  55 97  equivalent to a 4  decrease from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see that the last time NKE traded below these levels we have to go all the way back to February 9th  when it traded at  55 31 
Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike down NKE had been in an overall upward trend dating back to December 30th  2016 when it traded at  50 83  NKE has a float of 1 3 billion shares and traded 1 68 times the normal daily trading volume on Tuesday 
For trading purposes  I would like to see NKE open trading on Wednesday below  56 65 and if it does I would be looking to take a short position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 20 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap down

191709,413225,NKE,Market Inches Higher As 2017 Nears,opinion,"As the final days of the calendar year wind down  the equity market continues to grind higher  Way back when during the first two weeks of the year  if you would have predicted equity markets were poised to end the year with double digit gains  well  let s just say you would have been greeted with more than a little skepticism  Even with the nice performance  equities remain the most distrusted asset class 
Naysayers accurately point out the various issues which any owner should always be aware of  you know  little things like valuation  sentiment  profitability  inflation  deflation  interest rates  the middle east  the current President  the new President  the sun  the moon  etc  etc  Instead  other asset groups bonds  cash  Cd s  gold  real estate  private equity  hedge funds  commodities  are viewed as more stable and less unpredictable 
Maybe  but  investors who have stayed invested and persevered through the inevitable stomach turning fluctuations  have been well rewarded over the past eight years  Of course  the key question is what will happen during the next eight annums  If you know  shoot me an email  please  as all help is duly noted and appreciated 
The markets were generally pretty quiet this week with trading volumes the lowest all year  Many are skeptical of the idea that inflation will begin to pick up and question the dramatic move of interest rates higher over the last few months  Finish Line  NASDAQ FINL  reported a poor number and Nike  NYSE NKE  generally met expectations  but retail remains a much shunned sector 
During the gold rush in the 1840 s  many individuals struck out searching for gold but the business of selling picks and shovels proved stable and lucrative  The popularity of more stable and dependable businesses remains ingrained in institutional investors  hence the disgust with the retail area  Oil stayed flat  with gold being sold on the prospects for continued dollar strength and higher interest rates 
The 10 year yield trended down and finished at 2 543 as the bond market firmed a touch  Looking forward to next week  I suspect we will see more of the same as tax loss selling beckons  The major issues for markets during the first quarter remain earnings  prospective legislation regarding corporate and individual tax reform and repatriation of capital  and whether a large infrastructure bill can be reached 
Finally  under the idea  it is not how you start  it is how you finish  when Barack Obama took office in 2008  the Democratic party controlled all three branches of government  When he leaves in less than a month  they will have none  As his term winds down  his actions regarding the energy industry  declaring the Atlantic and Alaska as off limits  and Israel  not vetoing a UN resolution for the ban of settlements  leave plenty of people in both parties questioning his loyalty to our country 
Donald Trump will become President and assume a divided land with a population skeptical of his temperament and ability to be a good leader  As is the case with Mr  Obama  Mr  Trump will be evaluated on the overall progress of the country  or lack thereof  In that light  you can make the case the same is true for all of us

Tianji is 25 and lives in Shanghai  China  When we visited him  he complained that he hadn t been to the gym for four months because he d been too busy planning for his wedding  He earns only RMB  5 000  US 750  a month  but he made it clear that it was lack of time rather than money that prevented him from attending the gym as often as he would like 
In Guanghan  a lower tier city in Sichuan province  Jingyong  30  told us he d bought a treadmill online because he thought he was putting on weight and developing a beer belly 
Growing Interest in Staying Healthy
These examples highlight the increasing interest in exercise and staying healthy among China s consumers  And the trend is not confined to China  with rising incomes across many Asian markets  consumers are now spending more on services and lifestyle experiences  As people get wealthier  they also want quality  to stay healthy and feel and look good 
Global brands are benefiting from some of these trends  According to Euromonitor International  the combined market share of sportswear manufacturers Nike  NYSE NKE  and Adidas  DE ADSGN  in China rose from 19  in 2011 to 28  in 2015 
Smaller Companies Understand Local Needs
Smaller capitalization companies in the region are also winning big from the trend  helped by their niche focus  strong home base and keen understanding of local market needs  They re particularly attractive from an investment point of view  as they often do not register on the radar screens of international investors who  in emerging markets  tend to focus on larger cap stocks 
It s not just gyms  fitness equipment makers and sportswear companies that are profiting  for investors  the opportunity is much broader 
Between 2000 and 2015  according to Euromonitor International  food and autos were among the fastest growing areas of consumer spending in Asian emerging markets  along with healthcare  Display   We estimate that during the next 15 years  the growth in consumer services will match the growth in healthcare spending and exceed the growth in food and autos 

Within consumer services  some of the areas of fastest growth in 2015 2030 will be recreation  healthcare and accommodation  Display   In health and personal care  HPC   cosmetics are among the top categories 

Asia  for example  demand for South Korean cosmetics among younger women  and  increasingly  men  is growing strongly  New brands and products are constantly coming to the market  competition is fierce and brand loyalty is low  We find it s important to take a ground level perspective on the companies that are most likely to succeed 
From Cosmetics to Entertainment 
Cosmax  KS 192820  is a good example  The small cap South Korean cosmetics researcher  designer and manufacturer is a leading original design and equipment manufacturer in South Korea  Since it provides many global cosmetic brands access to South Korean innovation in beauty products  Cosmax is exposed to fewer risks related to brand loyalty and competition 
Health and nutrition are increasingly top of mind for Asian emerging consumers  In China alone this category grew 15 1  year over year last year  Several smaller companies  such as Nutribiotech  South Korea  and Grape King Bio  Taiwan   are focusing on the growing demand for food supplements and nutrition  Healthcare is expected to be one of the fastest growing categories in the next 15 years  Consumers want higher quality care  and it is no coincidence that some of the best smaller cap hospital operators are expanding around the region to tap this opportunity 
Consumers also increasingly want more affordable entertainment  IMAX box office ticket sales grew 50  last year in China  Given the low penetration of mega screens in China  the trend is in its early stages  Korean company Loen Entertainment  KQ 016170   a provider of affordable online music  is well placed in this market  as it provides access to the largest selection of Korean pop music among its peers  K pop  being the music of choice for many hundreds of millions of Asians 
According to global strategy consultant Roland Berger  30 emerging market households join the global middle class every minute  and the phenomenon has many years to run  Larger cap companies can only tap a small portion of this exciting opportunity  By expanding a portfolio s horizons to include smaller caps  investors can find less known companies that are poised for powerful growth as millions of people across Asia redefine the way they live their lives ",2016-11-06,ValueWalk,https://www.investing.com/analysis/small-caps-in-asia-capture-big-lifestyle-trends-200162977,200162977
191744,413260,NKE,Nike  NKE  Unveils Price And Release Date For The Futuristic HyperAdapt 1 0,opinion,"On Monday  Nike   NYSE NKE   unveiled the release date and price for their highly anticipated HyperAdapt 1 0 shoe  After months of speculation  it was reported that the revolutionary shoe will be released on December 1  at the steep price of  720 
What makes this shoe so highly regarded is the new technology Nike has created that allows the shoe to self lace itself  The idea is that the HyperAdapt 1 0 will be able to create a secure  unique feel for each individual  It will provide stability  support and style all while adjusting to the individual s foot 
Nike s CEO Mark Parker believes that this technology is going to change the sneaker world for the better    Parker stated   It s great to be able to put a product out there that is a step toward the future of adaptive performance  The performance that adapts to you real time to suit your needs as an athlete is going to be a part of product more and more as we head into the future  
A major issue for athletes  or anyone who loves sneakers  is the fact that not every shoe can fit each person s foot perfectly  Parker and his team of designers believe they have eliminated this issue  The goal  according to Nike designer Tinker Hatfield  is to   Wouldn t it be great if a shoe  in the future  could sense when you needed to have it tighter or looser  Could it take you even tighter than you d normally go if it senses you really need extra snugness in a quick maneuver  That s where we re headed  In the future  product will come alive   This may be years down the line  but Nike is definitely heading in the right direction with the HyperAdapt 1 0 
There are no reported sales projections for the HyperAdapt 1 0  but the steep price for the product may turn some casual customers away  Considering this shoe is a first of its kind product  it makes sense why it is retailing at  720  There will be plenty of sneaker heads ready to pay this steep price in order to get their hands on this remarkable pair of shoes  The shoes will be   Metallic Silver White Black  Black Blue Lagoon Landscape White  and White White White 
Currently  NKE is trading at an even  50 00 as of 12 45pm CT  Zacks Rank has Nike at a  3  Hold  and a VGM grade of  C   Check back later in the week to see how Nike s Zack Rank may adjust

191753,413269,NKE,Stock Exchange  Energy And Schwab Worth A Look,opinion,"Each week Felix and Oscar host a poker game  We listen in on current trading ideas in the few minutes before the game starts  They like to call this their  Stock Exchange   I am the only human present  and the only one using fundamental analysis  Their methods are excellent  as you will learn if you join us for a few weeks  Since the time frames and risk profiles differ  so do the stock ideas 
Background on the Stock Exchange
What is this about  Since launching this series I have had good questions on three general themes  Here are the questions and some brief answers 
The model characters are fun  but please tell me more about what they do 
I include the general personality of the model at the end of each article  I will begin featuring one approach each week with more detail  and soon provide a reference page for readers  

Why don t you show a track record on performance 
I understand that those trying to sell a newsletter or chat room often provide some sort of time stamped real time record  You will find that most of these people are not subject to compliance rules  The  track records  tell you nothing  since they do not have enough trades to get into the  long run   Confidence in a model comes from knowing how it is developed and tested  I would rather ask a few questions to a developer than see a few months of real time picks  It is pretty easy to spot the amateurs  
This is a brief answer  and I promise to follow up with a longer post  Meanwhile  here is our model developer  my partner Vince Castelli  in his  from 2002  It is one of the few projects he worked on that are now in the public record  He has applied his scientific knowledge to finance for decades 

Why should I care about these model picks 
You probably read many articles with stock ideas  Some are a single idea based upon technical analysis from a source you do not really know about  At the Stock Exchange you get four different recommendations from technical  experts  as well as some fundamental commentary as a rebuttal  I am not trying to sell anything  We are developing an institutional product  The results are good enough that I am willing to share and discuss with readers  Some of my clients are invested in these models  so I am not going to provide every trade in real time  It is supposed to be interesting and fun  Look at the ideas and do your own research  

This Week s Ideas Focus on Holmes
This week s featured expert is Holmes  Vince designed Holmes to be a trader  but one that would be safe enough for average investors  It is not a crazy  day trading program  Holmes looks for stocks that have sold off  formed a base  and have promising rebound potential  The criteria are strictly technical  so the stocks may not be appealing for long term investors  Holmes is very cautious in making new picks and aggressively dumps losers  Like most traders  Holmes also includes profit taking and trailing stops  The average holding period is a few weeks  There may be as many as sixteen positions at one time   all from our universe of 700 liquid stocks 
Holmes reduces risk in three ways 
Going completely to cash when market conditions are poor 
Reducing the number of positions when indicated 
Using stops and trailing stops on individual holdings 
I analyze the risk of each of our strategies  While it is partly subjective  I rate Holmes as lower risk than buy and hold for the overall market 
Here are the ideas for this week  beginning with Holmes 
Holmes
I am the rebounding specialist  I love great stocks that investors traders have bailed on  My Bounce Play of the Week is NIKE  NYSE NKE   This mega sports apparel and sneaker maker just keeps running a marathon while investors treat it like a sprinter  Coming off its highs of 67 in early 2016  this stock has been consolidating  digesting  and hanging out at the bottom of its channel  I see a good chance to power back up a few percent or more  I also love the risk reward aspects of this trade  I would use 48 as hard stop  so I m risking 3 8 to make 10 or more points  Like Nike says   Just Do It  

This is definitely a  bounce  play  It is close to the lower edge of the channel  I ll be happy with a few percent 
J  Valuation is reasonable  but it is not exciting based upon the fundamentals 
H  The chart shows the rebound potential  Most of my ideas are quick winners  I ll cut bait and move on if this does not work 
Felix 
I still like energy and have added a new position last week  Some current holdings are dipping dramatically and some are rising out of those dips  but the long term strength appeals to me  You can see the sector strength in VanEck Vectors Oil Refiners  NYSE CRAK  

J  Oil prices are still in a trading range  I think that it is the sweet spot for the economy  I agree with the long term potential 
F  Oil appears to be making a slow bullish move going into Winter in the Northern Hemisphere  There have already been a number of long range weather forecasters who are calling for a severe Winter in the US this year 
J  Since when do you pay any attention to weather forecasts 
F  My selections are always based upon the charts  but I also am interested in the message of the market 
And to my many fans  Please keep your questions coming  I could use the overtime pay  Ask about a specific stock  or perhaps an ETF  I am interested in sectors  but need a representative ETF to help 
Oscar
This week I like Oil   Gas exploration  illustrated below by Cimarex Energy Co  NYSE XEC   Sure  the stock s been hanging around yearly highs for a while now  But would you have bet against World Heavyweight Champ Joe Louis  I see at least a couple months of progress hanging around here 

This is a wonderful textbook example of momentum  It looks like a real long term winner in the making 
J  That seems crazy  The PE multiple is over 300  Where did you get such an idea 
O  My turf accountant also has stock picks 
J  You take stock advice from your bookie  
O  He is better than one of those robo advisors  He says that 2017 earnings will be a lot better 
J  Sixty eight cents this year  but 3 34 in 2017  I still think it is expensive 
O  As usual  I ll either cash or go for a small loss 
Athena 
Following some steep losses in January and June  Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW  has spent the last few months on a rebound  The forward average suggests it s leveling off  but I think there s room to catch a few points just before the peak here 

What a great recovery from a major pullback  Very strong  This could have a long run 
J  This is trading around the long term P E ratio and earnings are rising  In that sense it is fairly valued  Here is   which shows why I still think it is expensive 

A  You and Chuck are just too cautious  If you want a big reward  you have to take some chances 
Questions
If you want an opinion about a specific stock or sector  even those we did not mention  just ask  Put questions in the comments  Address them to a specific expert if you wish  Each has a specialty  Who is your favorite   You are allowed to choose me  although my feelings will not be hurt very much if you prefer one of the models  
Cast of Characters
Felix is fussy  precise  and very cautious  He looks for what is working  but it also must have upside potential  He is an investor who thinks long term  Felix will not usually announce new picks  but he will answer questions  saying what he thinks about specific stocks  He will also comment on favorite themes and sectors 
Oscar is naturally optimistic and a bit excitable  He definitely likes to go with winners  and focuses on a one month time frame  He trades either sector ETFs  or a basket of stocks  equally weighted  that reflect a sector  Oscar will mention a favorite sector each week  and will also answer questions about sectors 
Holmes is a trader  but a cautious one  Holmes emphasizes asset protection through profit taking  stops  and trailing stops  He is careful in selecting new positions  and generally looks at an intermediate time frame  While he does not know the definition of  mean reversion  he loves rebounds  There is no set holding period  but two or three months is not unusual  Holmes will tell us one stock recommended that week  For those who sign up for his email list  no charge  privacy respected  holmes at newarc dot com  he will report exits with a one day delay 
Athena trades more frequently than the others  but still limits risk  Her inspiration helps to find good ideas  Her excellent quant skills find attractive risk reward opportunities  Her wisdom leads her to exit trades that are not working  Athena will provide a new idea each week 
Jeff usually has some comments about stock or market fundamentals  Unlike the other witty participants  he sounds like an old prof 
Disclosure  The conversation is light hearted  but the stock analysis is serious  We own positions in each of the stocks mentioned ",2016-10-21,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stock-exchange:-featuring-holmes-and-nke-—-energy-and-schw-worth-a-look-200159916,200159916
191754,413270,NKE,Fossil  FOSL  Q3 Earnings  A Beat In The Cards This Time ,opinion,"We expect Fossil Group Inc    NASDAQ FOSL   to beat expectations when it reports third quarter 2016 results after the market closes on Nov 3 
Last quarter  this global consumer fashion accessories maker and distributor posted a positive surprise of 33 33   In fact  the company has delivered positive surprises in the past four quarters  with an average surprise of 29 10  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement FOSSIL GRP INC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Fossil is likely to beat earnings this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Zacks ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  stands at  3 33   This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  Please check our  that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises 
Zacks Rank  Fossil carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which when combined with  3 33  ESP makes us confident about an earnings beat 
Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2 or  3  Hold  have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  The Sell rated stocks   4 or  5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  
What is Driving the Better Than Expected Earnings 
Product innovation and continued momentum at the Fossil brand have been driving the company s growth  Fossil s foray and continued expansion into wearable technology allows it to bring smartwatches to its customers  shaping the fusion of fashion and technology  Despite competition from traditional watchmakers and soft watch sales of late  connected wearables and smartwatches are expected to bring a unique branded experience to customers  thereby aiding a turnaround in Fossil s results 
For the third quarter of 2016  Fossil expects the bottom line to be in the range of 15 40 cents per share  This will include 20 cents per share of currency impact and 9 cents of charges related to the Misfit acquisition  The company expects net sales to decline in a range of 2  6  due to currency headwinds of 110 basis points  bps   It expects operating margin in a range of 2 5  4 5  for the third quarter  which includes 100 bps negative impact from currency and 80 bps from Misfit acquisition expenses 
Other Stocks to Consider

Michael Kors Holdings Limited   NYSE KORS    with an Earnings ESP of  1 14  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see

191796,413312,NKE,Twilio And 4 Internet Stocks To Buy With Strong Momentum ,opinion,"Twilio Inc    NYSE TWLO   has gained a whopping 259  since its Jun 23 debut on the stock market at  15 a share  The company  which offers a cloud based API that enables software developers to include communications features  voice and video calls  text messages  etc  in their apps at much lower costs is clearly benefiting from the tremendous growth prospects in the Internet Software industry  driven by a massive rise in worldwide online spending According to eMarketer  a market research firm  online purchases will likely double to  3 578 trillion or 12 8  of the total retail sales of  28 trillion by 2019  as online shopping continue to gain popularity  Additionally  demand for smartphones in the U S   China  India and Russia is projected to remain strong through 2018  thereby leading to increased Internet transactions At the same time  technological advancements have been leading to a change in recreational habits  as confirmed by the growing popularity of online books  TV  on demand video  and games  This is equally responsible for growth in this space  These trends indicate that now is the perfect time to invest in Internet stocks Some of the optimism surrounding Twilio stock can be attributable to its better than expected results for the second quarter of 2016  For the second quarter  Twilio reported a loss of 19 cents per share  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 29 cents  Moreover  the company s total revenue of  64 5 million surged 70  on a year over year basis and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  58 million The top line improvement reflects high demand for the services offered by the company  Also  Twilio s clientele includes some of the most influential companies in the world such as Facebook  Inc    NASDAQ FB    Nike  Inc    NYSE NKE   and Uber  which gives a major boost to its digital sales The company also saw a robust improvement in the number of active customer accounts from the year ago quarter  Twilio has offered another metric to investors   base revenues which comprise revenues from the long term contracts  Base revenues witnessed a year over year surge of 84  to  56 million   a positive indicator indeed Ever since the stock reported second quarter results on Aug 8  it has added approximately 27  to its total market value  The momentum in Twilio s shares has earned it a Zacks Momentum Style Score of  A   making it a good option for investors seeking high returns  Currently  Twilio carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  What s the Momentum Style Score The Momentum Style Score theory basically states that what has been going on so far will possibly continue in the near future  This is an indication of the time to buy a stock that is likely to benefit from rising share prices  Nothing is more frustrating than watching a fundamentally sound or inexpensive stock remains stagnant  or even decline  after an impressive price increase Momentum investors thus strongly believe  the trend is your friend   They make short term choices among stocks that are scaling up and tend to sell them at the first signs of a downtrend  The basic idea is that once a trend is recognized  it is likely to retain that direction and not move against the flow Gambling on momentum stocks often helps investors earn higher returns by cashing in on the latest fad and benefiting in the short term  Nevertheless  investors should remember that this is a speculative strategy and not meant for the faint hearted Where to Put Your Money Although finding the right momentum stocks is not an easy feat  especially amid market volatility  if executed properly  these stocks could bring hefty returns for your portfolio It is here that our new  comes in handy  The Zacks Momentum Style Score indicates when the time is ripe to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success  Back

You see  these are hotly contested rivalries  You can t really jump from one side to the other  Another one of these rivalries deals with the shoes you choose to wear  While there are countless brands you can put on your feet  everyone knows about the rivalry between Adidas   OTC ADDYY   and Nike   NYSE NKE   
At some point in your life  you ve probably worn a pair of sneakers from one of these two companies  if not both  You might not think you have a preference between the two  but admit it you do  You certainly wouldn t dare to wear Adidas socks with Nike shoes  that s for sure 
With that said  the Adidas and Nike rivalry translates to the stock market as well  When we take a look at sneaker based stocks  it always feels like either one of these brands is leading the way  and that s definitely the case right now 
Leader of the Sneaker Stocks
As of right now  Adidas is on top and Nike is struggling  Adidas currently has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   thanks to its impressive earnings related data  In the most recent quarter  Adidas posted earnings of 82 cents per share  which smashed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents per share 
As a result  analysts have been busy revising Adidas  estimates upwards  In the past 60 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the German shoemaker s current quarter earnings has gained three cents  We now expect Adidas to see earnings of  1 01 per share this quarter  which would represent growth of 9 78  on a year over year basis 
Shares of ADDYY are up nearly 70  on the year 
On the other hand  Nike has seen a lot of negative earnings estimate revision activity as a result of its recent performance  In the past 60 days  we have seen nine negative revisions for its current quarter earnings  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has lost 15 cents  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 55 per share would represent a decline of over 17  year over year 
Shares of NKE are down over 12  on the year 
Interestingly enough  Nike recently decided to follow in the footsteps of Adidas by significantly reducing the   The company will no longer be manufacturing golf clubs  balls  and bags and instead will focus solely on footwear 
Bottom Line
With the Rio Olympics in full swing  sports are certainly on everyone s minds  For right now  Adidas is taking home the gold at least in the sneaker stock race ",2016-08-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sneaker-stocks:-should-you-buy-adidas-(addyy)-or-nike-(nke)-200147016,200147016
191802,413318,NKE,IPO Stocks Twilio  TWLO  And Acacia  ACIA  Soar After Earnings,opinion,"The IPO market this year has been rather  well  boring  Due to several factors contributing to global economic uncertainty  we simply haven t seen many companies going public in 2016  With that said  however  investors will still recognize names like Twilio   NYSE TWLO   and Acacia Communications   NASDAQ ACIA   that have debuted recently 
Investors may also recognize these companies because they have both been among the biggest movers throughout the stock market over the past several days  In just the past week  shares of TWLO have gained over 11   and shares of ACIA are up over 45  
Both of these stocks have gained a significant amount of momentum since their most recent earnings announcements  When it comes to newly public companies  earnings reports are incredibly important because they help investors gain confidence in the relatively unproven stocks 
Twilio in the Clouds

Bottom Line
Companies are often reluctant to IPO because publicly traded companies are forced to be much more transparent with their financial information and therefore receive much more scrutiny from shareholders  Plus the global economy was uncertain to start the year  and that will always make things more sluggish for the IPO market 
However  Twilio and Acacia are proving that success is definitely possible right now  which could inspire other companies to look towards an IPO soon  If you d like to read more about the state of the IPO market right now  check out our  ",2016-08-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ipo-stocks-twilio-(twlo)-and-acacia-(acia)-soar-after-earnings-200148051,200148051

191808,413324,NKE,Trump factor weighs as Vietnam intensifies crackdown on dissidents,news,By Matthew Tostevin  Reuters    A crackdown on communist Vietnam s increasingly vocal dissidents has become the biggest in years and activists say authorities have been emboldened by the Trump administration s lack of emphasis on human rights  U S  President Donald Trump s early decision to drop the Trans Pacific Partnership  TPP  trade deal also removed a clear incentive for Hanoi to show a better rights record  they said  The U S  State Department  however  said it continues to insist that better bilateral ties will depend on Hanoi s progress on human rights   Vietnam has stepped up measures to silence bloggers and critics whose voices over issues such as a steel mill s toxic spill last year have been amplified by social media in a country that is among Facebook s top 10 by users  At least 15 people have been arrested so far in 2017   more than in any year since a crackdown on youth activists in 2011   according to a Reuters tally of arrests for anti state activities reported by local and national authorities  Four dissidents    a pastor  an engineer  a journalist and a lawyer   were arrested last week  FREEDOM OF SPEECH  Civil society and the democracy and human rights movement increased quite a lot in the last few years and with social media their voices are stronger and stronger   said Nguyen Quang A   a retired computer scientist and vocal government critic   That poses a problem for the leadership   Over the past 18 months  Nguyen said he had been detained 12 times without being charged  compared to not once in the previous 18 months   Vietnam s government says it is only acting against lawbreakers  with its strict curbs on freedom of speech often flouted on social media   All acts of violation of law are strictly treated in accordance with the provisions of Vietnamese law   said foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang  responding to U N  criticism of the jailing of one blogger  Economic growth of more than 5 percent a year for over 16 years has turned Vietnam into a manufacturing powerhouse for everything from Samsung  KS 005930  phones to  Nike   NYSE NKE  sneakers and brought a surge in prosperity and a revolution in social openness  Politics has changed more gradually  LEADERSHIP SHIFT The start of the crackdown is dated by activists  diplomats and analysts to the Communist Party congress in January 2016  when the leadership balance shifted toward conservatives prioritizing internal security and discipline   Although Vietnam has only one party as per the constitution  it actually has many factions and interest groups behind the scenes   said activist Nguyen Lan Thang   The political landscape is going through strong movement  not only for activists  but also within the Communist Party   Indications of fissures in the ruling Communist Party Politburo came this week when the party proposed sacking a vice minister over alleged corruption at her former role in an electricity company  Early this year  a top official was demoted and expelled from the Politburo in a rare move  Maneuvering had intensified ahead of the expected selection of a new General Secretary of the Communist Party  said Jonathan London of Leiden University  although no date has been set for that  Meanwhile  activists had grown more vocal after street protests erupted last year over a toxic spill from the Taiwanese owned Formosa steel mill  Among bloggers whose profiles rose over the Formosa protests was Ngoc Nhu Quynh   known as Mother Mushroom   who was jailed for 10 years in July  Another was Tran Thi Nga  She was given a nine year prison sentence last month  TRUMP FACTOR Every activist and analyst that Reuters interviewed mentioned a perceived shift in U S  priorities under Trump as a new factor in reducing pressure on Vietnam s government  Not only was Washington paying less attention to the region or to human rights  but Trump gave Vietnam less reason to show willingness to address human rights issues when he dropped the TPP trade deal  in the name of an  America First  policy   Vietnam now finds there is much less of a downside for cracking down the way it wanted to in the first place   said Phil Robertson of U S  based Human Rights Watch  which recently reported on the beating of activists   Trump and his policies bear a lot of responsibility for this worsening situation   In May  U S  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson signaled that the United States would de emphasize human rights concerns in some of its interactions with other countries  saying that while U S  values remain constant  they needed to be balanced against national security and economic interests  The U S  State Department said the trend of increasing arrests of activists in Vietnam since early 2016 was  deeply troubling  and it called for the release of all prisoners of conscience   Progress on human rights will allow the U S  Vietnam partnership to reach its fullest potential   said Justin Higgins  the spokesman for the State Department s East Asian and Pacific Affairs bureau

191809,413325,NKE,Will The Olympics Help Nike  NKE  Stock ,opinion,"With the 2016 Summer Olympics just over a week away  the eyes of the world will soon turn towards Rio de Janeiro  where the best athletes on the planet will compete for Olympic glory  Although this year s Games have already been marred with controversy  the competition will surely still captivate audiences from around the globe 
It is these global audiences that will also be the target of an onslaught of Olympic themed advertising  All sorts of companies will be incorporating sports  athletes  and patriotism into their commercials in order to tug on the heartstrings of fans 
 Also read   
Olympic sponsorships don t just come in the form of commercials  For example  Nike   NYSE NKE   is an official sponsor of Team USA  meaning that jerseys  warmups  and licensed apparel will prominently feature the Nike swoosh logo 
In fact  the stakes are incredibly high for Nike  which is currently a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock  After a relatively disappointing earnings report last month  Nike will need an impressive Olympics season to turn things around 
While one might think that Nike s Olympic success is a near guarantee based simply on the exposure the company will have during the Games  this hasn t necessarily been the case for Nike during international competitions in the past  
In fact  Nike shares tend to struggle in the lead up to things like the Olympics  dropping in 75  of earnings releases preceding a major event over the past decade  It can be easy to forget that becoming an official Olympic sponsor is incredibly expensive  which can put a dent in profits 
This trend continued when Nike reported its fourth quarter earnings on June 28  Despite posting earnings of 49 cents per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  Nike fell 7  in after hours trading on weak revenues and margins  The company s gross margin contracted 30 basis points to 45 9  in the quarter 
Looking ahead  Nike expects first quarter revenue growth to be in the single digits  with currency headwinds continuing to cause problems  In the past 60 days  we have seen nine negative revisions for Nike s current quarter earnings  and its EPS is currently expected to fall about 16 9  from the same quarter last year 
With spending on Olympic advertising coming in both the fourth quarter and the current quarter  this earnings data shows that Nike isn t an automatic winner during the Games  It appears that Olympic spending can indeed contribute to short term headaches for the company 
Nevertheless  it s important to remember that something like the Olympics also kick starts a new period of design and innovation for Nike  The new styles of shoes  uniforms  and other gear that Nike designed for use at the Games will continue to be used and sold going forward 
Traditionally  Nike s struggles prior to the Olympics don t continue in the long term  Between the 2012 and 2014 Olympics  shares of Nike gained over 50   and the stock is currently up about 57  since the 2014 Games ",2016-07-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-the-olympics-help-nike-(nke)-stock-200144047,200144047

First up  we have soft drink king Coca Cola  KO  which reports later this week  The company was just upgraded to Zacks Rank  3  hold  territory from the sell range  though it still maintains an  F  Grade for fundamentals  And while the company has an amazing track record in earnings season  its recent earnings estimates suggest stagnation  potentially making it difficult for KO to go for a knockout punch this earnings season COCA COLA CO Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   
McDonald s  MCD   on the other hand  has finally broken out of its slump and is trading near fresh all time highs  The fast food king is also running on a nice earnings surprise streak  while its breakfast initiative is also helping to boost estimates  The main concerns here is a negative earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank  3  hold  that was just upgraded from  sell  territory MCDONALDS CORP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   
Under Armour  UA  is also a top notch performer in earnings season  as the surging apparel company hasn t missed estimates in more than five years  However  we should note that earnings estimates have been falling  and growth levels don t look great for this firm  And with a Zacks Rank  4  sell  and an  F  score for fundamentals  it is hard to like this stock going into the report  and especially given that their main rival  Nike  NYSE NKE   also has a sell rank and is seeing slumping estimates UNDER ARMOUR A Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

191812,413328,NKE,Nike Follows Adidas  Millennials Away From Golf  Time For Callaway To Worry ,opinion,"Nike Inc    NYSE NKE    the world s largest maker of sporting goods  will stop selling gold equipment  striking another blow to the sport of golf  The company will shift away from the golf clubs  balls  and bags that became popular during Tiger Woods  reign atop the sport  but will continue selling footwear and apparel for the sport  according to a statement from Nike Wednesday  Sales at the Nike Golf division fell 8 2  to  706 million in Nike s most recent fiscal year that ended in May 
While the company is committed to continuing to innovate in apparel and shoes  but it is unclear what the move means for Nike s star studded list of golfers  which includes Tiger Woods  Rory McIlroy  and Michelle Wie 
The move from Nike follows a similar one from Adidas   OTC ADDYY    who put the bulk of its golf unit up for sale earlier this year  The company has had its golf unit for nearly 20 years  but said it has been a drag on profitability  Adidas said it was planning to sell its Taylormade brand  as well as Adams golf clubs  Ashworth polos and cardigans  It will keep its Adidas branded golf shoes and clothing  which makes up about 40  of the company s golf unit 
Both Nike and Adidas have seen profits from their golf units sink in recent quarters  mostly because the pastime has become less popular  especially with millennials  Participation rates have steeply declined  and its hurting the sport as well as the retailers that sell apparel and gear  The number of people playing gold in the United States  which accounts for about half the global golf market  has shrunk from nearly 30 million in 2000 to an estimated 23 million 
With Nike pulling out of much of their skin in the golf game  and Adidas searching for a buyer for their golf unit  one stock that could benefit  and has seen a jump today  is Callaway Golf   NYSE ELY    ELY has popped more than 6  today  likely on investors thinking that the company could see an increase in sales  as well as possibly a few new sponsorships of high profile golfers 
Callaway recently released its second quarter fiscal 2016 results  posting a 6 5  increase in net sales  as well as a 140  increase in earnings per share compared to the same period for 2015  The company cited its continued brand strength  additional hard goods market share gains  increased gross margins  and an  0 18 per share gain from the sale of a portion of its investment in Topgolf International Inc  Callaway also reaffirmed its full year financial outlook for 2016  as well as increased guidance for the third quarter 
Bottom Line
Nike s move out of golf was somewhat surprising  though its golf unit was its worst performing segment in the most recent quarter  Declining participation rates have hurt not only the sport but the retailers involved with it as well  which caused both Nike and Adidias s move away from their golf units  Callaway had a very strong second quarter  and had positive projections for the current quarter and the rest of the year  but it will be something to watch whether they will benefit further from Nike s move out of the space  or whether declining participation rates and interest in the sport will hurt the company like it has others 
Nike is currently a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Adidas is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   and Callaway currently is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  Shares of Nike are down nearly 12  year to date  where Adidas has seen a major gain of over 66   and Callaway has gained more than 19  ",2016-08-04,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/nike-follows-adidas,-millennials-away-from-golf,-time-for-callaway-to-worry-200146131",200146131

191827,413343,NKE,Adidas  ADDYY  Hits The  Ye Button With New Kanye West Partnership,opinion,"Adidas   OTC ADDYY   stock is up 2 5  as of 2 20 EDT on Wednesday after announcing a new long term partnership with rapper designer Kanye West 
Adidas  the German retailer known for selling shoes  clothing and accessories first partnered with Kanye West in 2013  West was associated with Nike at the time  and severed his ties with the company in order to join Adidas on a  10M deal 
The new deal is said to be the most significant partnership Adidas has ever formed with a non athlete  The  adidas   KANYE WEST  fashion line will have products for men and women  and will incorporate both fashion wear and athletic gear into its offering  Although not confirmed  there is speculation that Adidas will open stores specifically to sell this line 
Going along with the announcement  West publicly announced that the partnership  illustrates that anyone with a dream can dream without limitations    
How Will This Help 
From the beginning of their relationship until now  Adidas has released two popular West designed shoes under the  Yeezy Boost  label  When the Yeezy Boost 750 first went on sale in January of last year  the first run of 9 000 sold out in minutes  and now sells on eBay   NASDAQ EBAY   for prices as high as

191833,413349,NKE,Time To Short FINL ,opinion,"The Finish Line Inc  NASDAQ FINL  Consumer Discretionary   Specialty Retail   Reports March 24  Before Market Opens
Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of 23 cents on  451 45 million  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top
Finish Line is struggling to gain traction in this volatile retail environment
One way Finish Line intends to spark YoY earnings growth is by closing 150 of its least profitable stores over the next 4 years
What are you expecting for  
Retail footwear chain  Finish Line  is scheduled to report first quarter earnings tomorrow  before the opening bell  Investors are hoping the retailer can replicate the success they had during the holiday season  but realistically  expectations have been tepid 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of 23 cents on  451 45 million  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top  Compared to a year earlier this reflects a 21  decline in earnings with sales expected to rise by 2  
Per share and revenue estimates have dropped since its last report reflecting analyst s pessimism towards the company  Besides downward trending earnings  the stock has suffered as well  In the past 12 months  shares of Finish Line have dropped 35  and the stock typically falls even further during earnings season  
Despite exceeding expectations last quarter  estimates for Q1 remain rather muted  Last quarter featured increases in key financial metrics including net sales and comparable store sales  Digital channels continue to be the fastest growing and most reliable driver of earnings 
The first quarter will likely be negatively affected by a tough retail environment  Additionally  Nike  NYSE NKE  and Under Armour s efforts to expand their direct to consumer models have hurt sales  Consumers now just need to visit Nike s website to purchase their workout gear rather than visit a local Finish Line store 
Also its store in store business with Macy s has struggled to gain traction  One way the company intends to improve profitability is by shutting the doors on 150 of its worst performing stores  or 25  of its store base  in the next 4 years  On the competitive front  Sports Authority s recent bankruptcy creates some customer acquisition opportunities for Finish Line  but Foot Locker  NYSE FL  still remains the biggest threat

191837,413353,NKE,TopBuild  American Railcar Industries And Nike Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   June 29  2016   highlights TopBuild Corporation    as the Bull of the Day and American Railcar Industries  Inc     as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on  Nike Inc  NYSE NKE      

	Here is a synopsis of all three stocks 

  

TopBuild Corporation    is cashing in on the hot housing market  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  is expected to grow earnings by the double digits both this year and next 

	TopBuild is the largest purchaser  installer and distributor of insulation in the United States  It distributes through TruTeam which has 175 branches in 40 states 

	It also distributes insulation through Service Partners from 70 branches in 33 states 

	The company is a small cap  with a market cap of  1 3 billion 

3 Earnings Beats in a Row

	On May 11  TopBuild reported first quarter results and beat the Zacks Consensus for the third straight quarter  Earnings were  0 31 compared to the Zacks Consensus of just  0 15 for a massive 106  beat 

	A mild winter  which boosted the housing construction market  aided sales in the quarter 

	Net sales rose 15 5  to  414 million year over year 

	Historically  the first quarter is the slowest of the year and even though it was a hot quarter  the company still expects it to remain that way this year  But given how hot it was  the swing in seasonality might not be as strong in future quarters 

	However  it still expects business in the remainder of the year to remain strong 

	 From a macro perspective  we believe the U S  housing recovery will continue for the next several years   said Jerry Volas  CEO 

	 Although we expect that TopBuild will certainly be advantaged by that  we intend to outperform that recovery with organic growth and strategically selective acquisitions in both the residential and commercial space  Additionally  we believe that continued improvements in operating efficiency will optimize the impact of this expected growth on operating margins   he added 

Earnings Estimates Rise

	Given the positive sentiment from TopBuild  it s not surprising that the analysts are bullish as well 

	2 estimates were raised for 2016 in the last 60 days which pushed the Zacks Consensus up to  2 02 from  1 80 

	That is earnings growth of 51 8  over 2015 which saw earnings of only  1 33 

	The growth is expected to continue into 2017  Analysts see further earnings growth of 17 3  

  

American Railcar Industries  Inc     is heading into the rail car down cycle this year and next  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  is expected to see falling sales and earnings over the next two years 

	American Railcar makes and sells railcars  specifically hopper and tank cars  custom designed railcar parts and other industrial products  It also leases railcars it manufactures to some markets 

	Additionally  the company provides railcar repair services through various repair facilities 

Earnings Miss in Q1

	On Apr 28  American Railcar reported first quarter 2016 results and missed the Zacks Consensus by 16 cents  Earnings were  1 16 versus the consensus of  1 32 

	Revenue fell 33  to  176 2 million from  263 8 million for the year ago quarter  It was driven mostly by lower manufacturing revenue 

	It was producing more hopper railcars in the quarter  Hoppers have lower average selling prices than tank railcars due to less material and labor content 

	Tank railcars  which are often used by the energy industry  continues to be in a soft market  with decreasing sales 

	One bright spot  however  was railcar leasing  Revenue rose 33  to  32 8 million year over year due to an increase in the number of railcars on lease 

	As of March 31  2015  there were 10 556 railcars in its lease fleet  up from 8 381 the year before 

	The backlog remains substantial  with 5 958 railcars  with an estimated value of  569 1 million as of March 31  2016 

Earnings and Sales Expected to Decline

	2015 was a record year for American Railcar  as earnings jumped to  6 46 a share  The railcar business is cyclical  however  With tank car orders softening  sales and earnings are now expected to slide 

	Analysts expect 2016 revenue to fall 29  year over year with another decline of 23  in 2017 

	The 2016 Zacks Consensus Estimate has fallen to  4 23 from  4 64 in the last 90 days  That is a decline of 35  from 2015 s record year 

	Earnings are expected to fall another 26  in 2017 to  3 12 

What About That Dividend 

	American Railcar pays a dividend which is currently yielding 4 1  

	As of March 31  the company had working capital of  267 9 million  including  208 1 million in cash and cash equivalents  The dividend in the first quarter only cost  7 8 million 

	Because of its solid cash flow  it has also been buying back shares  In Q1  it bought shares worth  10 9 million and is authorized to buy another  181 7 million under its current share buyback authorization

191840,413356,NKE,Top 5 things that moved markets this past week,news,"Investing com   Take a peek at the top 5 things that rocked U S  markets this week 
Oil prices posted worst first half performance since 1998
Despite settling higher for the seventh session in a row on Friday  oil prices suffered their worst first half yearly performance since 1998  falling 14  as traders continued to fret about oversupply in the market  despite Opec and its allies  efforts to tackle the supply and demand imbalance in the industry 
The rally in oil prices in the latter part of June culminated with an unexpected dip in the number of active U S  drilling rigs  after Baker Hughes reported that its U S  rig count fell by 2 to a total of 756  ending a trend that has seen the number of U S  rigs increase for six straight months 
Prior to the recent rally crude prices had dipped into bear market territory  on the back of data showing that Nigeria and Libya  countries exempt from the Opec production cuts  are set to ramp up crude production  adding to the glut in supply 
Nike bagged nearly 11  after revealing solid quarterly performance 
Shares of  Nike   NYSE NKE  surged nearly 11  on Friday  a day after the sportswear maker posted quarterly earnings and revenue that topped analysts  expectations 
Nike reported earnings of 60 cents per share on revenue of  8 68 billion  well above Wall Street estimates of earnings of 50 cents per share on revenue of 8 63 billion 
The sportswear giant based its solid quarterly performance on steady revenue growth in its international geographies and direct to consumer businesses 
Gold suffered its first monthly loss for the year
Investor expectations that central banks would begin to tighten monetary policy pushed global bond yields higher  and decreased demand for non interest bearing gold  resulting in the precious metal s first monthly loss for the year 
Gold s losses  however  were limited  by a slump in the dollar  as the greenback fell to a fourth straight month of losses despite Fed chair Janet Yellen on Wednesday  reiterating the need to raise rates  very gradually  
Nasdaq notched its best first half yearly performance since 2009
Despite ending Friday s session in negative territory  the Nasdaq outperformed both the Dow and S P 500 year to date  surging 14  and posting its largest first half gains since 2009 
The tech heavy index has had to contend with a recent slump in technology stocks  which fell more than 2  over the past month but failed to dent overall optimism  as the tech sector has added about 15  in 2017 
The dollar wobbled to its worst quarterly performance in seven years 
The dollar came under heavy selling pressure this week  falling to multi month lows against its rivals  after the euro  pound and Canadian dollar surged  following comments from central bank leaders  hinting at tapering ultra low accommodative monetary policy measures 
GBP USD surged above the  1 30  after Bank of England governor Mark Carney  appeared to reverse his recent assertion that there  was no need to raise rates soon   suggesting earlier in the week that  some removal of monetary stimulus is likely to become necessary  
USD CAD hovered above four month lows  as the Canadian dollar soared  after Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz reiterated the central bank may be considering raising interest rates  asserting that rate cuts from 2015  have done their job  
The euro had its best quarter in seven months  as traders continued to pile into the single currency  despite European Central Bank  ECB  sources saying markets misjudged ECB president Mario Draghi s comments earlier in the week ",2017-06-30,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/top-5-things-that-moved-markets-this-past-week-501181,501181

Among those problems is the bevvy of counterfeit merchandise being sold  Multiple companies have launched lawsuits against the Chinese ecommerce group  alleging that Alibaba encourages and profits from the sale of knock off items on its platforms  
In recent comments  Mr  Ma doesn t exactly sound like he s helping the problem  Ma said  We have to protect IP  we have to do everything to stop the fake products but original equipment manufacturers are making better products at a better price  The problem is that fake products today are of better quality and better price than the real names  They are exactly the same factories  exactly the same raw materials but they do not use the names  
Maybe something is getting lost in translation here  If a factory makes Nike  NYSE NKE  shoes using Nike s intellectual property to figure out exactly how to manufacture the shoes and which products to use  then they shouldn t be using the same IP  the same manufacturing process and the same materials to make similar products using a different name  Taking off the swoosh and charging half price for your Psyche s does not protect IP  What are thooooooose 
He s getting cocky over there too  Chinese regulators have investigated Alibaba s practices in the past but have never found violations egregious enough to warrant shutting them down  Taking a swing at a couple competitors  Ma said  You can t stop Alibaba for two hours otherwise it s going to be a disaster for China  You can stop Tencent for two days  you can stop Baidu  BIDU  for two weeks and everything will still be okay   Shots fired  
Even with projected 48  revenue growth for 2017  analysts really aren t buying the BABA story yet  The stock has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  to go along with a Value Score of D  and Growth and Momentum Scores of F  The Internet Commerce industry also ranks in the Bottom 17  of our Zacks Industry Rank  Four analysts covering the stock have dropped their estimates  changing our Zacks Consensus Estimates from  2 44 to  2 03 for the current year while next year s number has gone from  3 15 to  2 47

U S  Inflation on tap 
U S  inflation data on Friday will be the most closely watched economic data release during the session  as it s the first set of inflation figures since the Federal Reserve hiked rates in June and shrugged off the slowdown in inflation as transitory 
Expectations for Core PCE  a key measure of inflation the Fed considers in its interest rate decisions  is expected show a dip to 1 4  year over year in May 
Some analysts believe that Friday s inflation data will be key in determining if the Fed can deliver on its promise of three hikes this year 
  the FOMC does not take the recent inflation developments lightly  and though it believes the near term weakness will prove to be transitory  inflation data is front and center and will be key in determining if the Fed can deliver on its promise of three hikes this year   Morgan Stanley said in research note to clients 
Nike set to open higher
 Nike   NYSE NKE  reported fourth quarter fiscal earnings and sales on Thursday that topped Wall Street expectations  boosting shares of the company more than 4  higher in after hours trade 
Nike reported earnings of 60 cents per share on revenue of  8 68 billion  well above Wall Street estimates of earnings of 50 cents per share on revenue of 8 63 billion 
The sportswear giant based its solid quarterly performance on steady revenue growth in its international geographies and direct to consumer businesses 
Investors will look ahead to the open of US trade on Friday  to gauge whether the solid quarterly earnings report spurs a rally in the sportswear giant s shares 
Baker Hughes rig count 
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday  is expected to show that demand from U S  oil producers remains healthy  with the number of drilling rigs set to rise for the 24th consecutive week 
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand 
The steady increase in the number of U S  oil rigs has added to fears that U S  output will continue to swell  weighing on Opec and its allies  efforts to drain the glut in supply

191847,413363,NKE,Nike Vs Under Armour In The NBA Finals ,opinion,"June is my favorite time of year  The weather is nice  work slows down  people I don t like go on vacation  and three professional sports are in full swing  This is one of those rare years where the Blackhawks aren t winning the Stanley Cup but there s a familiar face on the Finals court  Lebron James is back for a 6th time in a row and 7th time overall  Standing between him and his 3rd ring in 7 tries is this guy  Steph Curry  

	This is bigger than Steph versus Lebron  Golden State versus Cleveland or west versus east  This is Under Armour  UA  versus Nike  NYSE NKE   Two of the biggest brands going head to head at the pinnacle of basketball competition  I ll admit  I m partial to Nike  If I was a high schooler in Naperville I d probably be partial to Under Armour  But here I m going to use some unbiased  head to head comparisons in order to figure which of these companies ends up the winner  

	As far as the Finals series goes  I think we all know Golden State is going to be the winner  They shoot better  move the ball better  and play better defense  We ll know the real outcome next week after the sweep  UA one  Nike zero  

	Now let s look at the superstars  Steph Curry versus Lebron James  Steph was named MVP for the second straight season after leading the Warriors to a 73 9 mark on the year  Lebron set a personal record for most flops  Getting ready for Space Jam 2 I see  UA two  Nike zero  

	What about the shoes  Under Armour released the Curry Two this year in an attempt to attract those basketball show dollars  The Nike Lebron XII came in like 112 different colorways  Some epic and some awful  Comparing the two side to side  it s a tie  they both lose  UA two  Nike zero  

	To the Zacks Rank  both Under Armour and Nike are Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stocks right now  But there s a distinction in the Style Scores here  Nike has a Value Score of D but an A in both Growth and Momentum  The edge here goes to Nike  UA two  Nike one  

	Now let s look at the price  consensus and EPS charts for both  This is my favorite analysis tool  I can see the evolution of earnings estimates over time along with the stock s price reaction  Both stocks have dipped recently as retail has cooled off  Estimates have come down for both companies  However  look at how Nike s estimates have leveled off as Under Armour continues to drop down  Suddenly that growth premium looks a little expensive  We re tied up at two a piece now  

	So who s the winner of the NBA Finals here  Under Armour or Nike  Looks like it will have to be played out on the hardwood but if I was a betting man  I d put my money on the swoosh  Just do it ",2016-06-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nike-vs-under-armour-in-the-nba-finals-200133965,200133965
191849,413365,NKE,Philadelphia 76ers   Ebay s  EBAY  StubHub Make History  Ads Officially On Jerseys,opinion,"Ebay Inc   EBAY  subsidiary and ticket marketplace StubHub and the Philadelphia 76ers reached an agreement making the NBA franchise the first team in the four major U S  sports to sell advertisements on their jerseys 
The 76ers announced Monday morning that StubHub will have its logo on the team s jerseys beginning in the 2017 18 season  when the NBA s three year pilot program will start 
ESPN s Darren Rovell today  the following   Sources with knowledge of the deal say the team has sold all three seasons at  5 million a year  with the option to extend the contract with StubHub should the league continue to allow the 2  by 2  inch logo patch to be on the jerseys in the future  
 This marks another groundbreaking first for the Philadelphia 76ers and StubHub   Our brands are now inextricably linked as we create lifelong memories for our fans in Philadelphia and around the world    Philadelphia 76ers CEO Scott O Neil   Our partnership with StubHub continues to generate progressive and forward thinking platforms created to improve the fan experience and advance our industry   
NBA teams are allowed to have advertisements from any company excluding those involved in gambling  alcohol or politics  The NBA has given protected status to a number of its national partners  This means that the companies  competitors cannot show up on a team jersey 
Therefore  competitors of the league s media  apparel  and on court partners   Disney  DIS  subsidiaries ESPN and ABC  Time Warner  TWX  division Turner Broadcasting System  Nike  NYSE NKE  starting in 2017 18  Tissot  and Spalding   cannot strike deals with NBA teams to have their products advertised 
 This is strategic beachhead property for us   StubHub CEO Scott Cutler said   We  as a company  have been very transaction oriented  We want to be more a part of the emotional experience fans have with their teams  and we think a deal like this gets us closer   per ESPN 
According to Rovell  the money generated by selling sponsorships on jerseys will be divided in the following manner  one half will go to the NBA teams with one portion going to an individual team and the other portion going to a revenue sharing pool  The half that does not go to the franchises will be split amongst the players and will contribute to a rising salary cap 
NBA jerseys sold to fans nationwide will not have the corporate sponsor logo on them  but O Neil said the 76ers do plan to sell jerseys with a StubHub logo   We have a very strong opinion that little Scottie   a hypothetical fan  who is 9 years old  will want to wear what the players are wearing on the court   O Neil said

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for EPS of  0 80  right in line with Wall Street  and revenue expectations of  690 04   2 million below the Street
Athleisure has been one of the hottest industries in apparel  paving the way for Lululemon s rapid growth
Lululemon is well positioned to maintain its loyal high end customers  but must stave off competitive threats from Nike  NYSE NKE  and other smaller yoga brands
Moreover  currency headwinds and weak economic conditions have severely inhibited Lululemon s growth strategy 
Athleisure has been one of the fastest growing segments throughout the apparel industry  supported by big names like Nike and Lululemon  This trend meets an overwhelming demand for fashion forward styles that can be worn in the office or at the gym  Much of Lululemon s success has been tied to this burgeoning space  resulting in high hopes for its earnings  In early January  the upscale retailer raised its fourth quarter guidance after holiday season sales exceeded expectations  The company raised its forecast as high as  695 million from  670 for the quarter ending Jan 31 
The Estimize consensus is calling for EPS of  0 80  right in line with Wall Street  and revenue expectations of  690 04   2 million below the Street  However our Select Consensus  which more heavily weights historically accurate analysts and recent estimates  is expecting a loss of  2 million on the top line  Compared to the year prior  this predicts a 2  increase in earnings while revenue is expected to grow 14   On average  Lululemon beat earnings estimates  trumping the Estimize community and Wall Street in 63  and 93  of reported quarters  respectively  
This past quarter was highlighted by a 14  increase in revenue supported by growth in key channels including comp store sales and direct to consumer revenue  Lululemon remains focused on undertaking new investments and initiatives to strengthen its position in the burgeoning athleisure space  In particular  the revamped women s bottom segment and the introduction of men s clothing has accelerated same store sales growth and improved margins

The company s growth strategy consists of new product lines and expansion domestically and internationally
What are you expecting for    
Best known for UGG boots  Deckers Outdoor    is scheduled to report FQ3 2016 earnings February 4th  after the market closes  The rise of athletic apparel for all purpose use have put companies like Nike  N NKE  and Under Armour in a strong position to infringe on Deckers  market share  For Deckers the fourth quarter and holiday season is important to the company which relies heavily on sales of its cold weather UGG boots  The unusually warm weather and the overall lack of snow have made investors nervous about the retailer s quarterly earnings 
The Estimize community is expecting EPS of  4 88 and revenue of  839 30 million  significantly higher than Wall Street s estimates  On the other hand corporate is guiding third quarter earnings of  5 00 per share with a 9  rise in revenue  Compared to FQ3 2015  Estimize is projecting YoY growth in EPS and revenue of 9  and 7   respectively  The biggest question facing investors is whether Deckers will be able to beat expectations for another quarter this fiscal year  After a generally weaker holiday season  the company is expected to see a modest contraction in sales and operating margins of its core brands  Tha said  sales of its weather sensitive UGG brand are still expected to be strong despite unusually warm weather  Deeper discounts have helped Deckers  move key products and avoid an inventory hangover  Moreover  Deckers recently released a new line of weather universal UGGs with a slimmer fit  Besides new product lines  Deckers  growth strategy consists of improving its direct to consumer channels and domestic and international expansion  Like other multinationals  currency headwinds have constrained revenue growth in global operations  As Deckers  continue to innovate products and distribution channels  it should emerge from the holiday season strong

191875,413391,NKE,Nike s African trio target sub two hour marathon,news,"By Mitch Phillips LONDON  Reuters    This weekend  aided by a host of technological and environmental advances  three carefully selected elite African athletes will attempt to run the first sub two hour marathon  The  Breaking2  project is the latest enterprise of American sportswear giant  Nike   NYSE NKE  and has split opinion in the world of athletics  not to mention physiology  In one camp are the  purists   who claim that the host of benefits being bestowed on the runners  including revolutionary shoes  a pack of interchangeable pacemakers and a non traditional course  mean the attempt is a marketing gimmick  In some ways this is possibly the worst time to start shouting about fast marathon times with Kenya s Rio Olympic and London marathon champion Jemima Sumgong s recent positive doping test landing a body blow to the event  Nike  and others  however  insist projects like  Breaking 2  show that a combination of talent  training and technology can produce astounding results without the need for chemical assistance  Many people are intrigued to see just how much difference such a collection of  marginal gains  can make and suggest that  at a time when athletics is reeling from relentless bad news  such a quantum leap in human endurance  arguably the greatest in the sport s history  is something to be welcomed and celebrated  Below we look at the key aspects of the project  The current record and its progression Kenyan Dennis Kimetto set the current record of two hours  two minutes  57 seconds in Berlin in 2014  which is about four minutes faster than it was in 1988  Kimetto s time works out to 4 41 5 minutes per mile  a sub two would require less than 4 35 per mile   an improvement of about seven seconds per mile  or around 2 5 percent  On the face of it  that appears an impossible leap   In 2014 the respected Runners World magazine published a data driven analysis of more than 10 000 top marathon performances over 50 years that predicted a sub two under normal race conditions would not happen until 2075  The key to this attempt is that Nike are trying to ensure all the other variables make such an impact that  in theory  the athletes will produce effort levels that equate to a 2 03 time but  boosted by all the extra help  will actually produce sub 2  Maybe the fastest ever  but not a world record The course will be ratified by the International Association of Athletics Federations  IAAF  and the athletes will satisfy all the usual anti doping requirements  but the attempt will not be an officially sanctioned world record due to a host of variables  detailed below  Who is running  After extensive physiological research  Nike put together a team of three  Eliud Kipchoge  The 32 year old Kenyan is the stand out performer  Last year s Olympic marathon gold medalist and former 5 000 meters world champion has won seven of his eight marathons  His best of 2 03 05 is the third fastest in history  Zersenay Tadese  The Eritrean is the half marathon world record holder with 58 23 minutes and  although he has nothing much in his locker over the full distance  Nike s scientists identified him as having the potential to go much faster  Lelisa Desisa  The 26 year old Ethiopian has a marathon best of 2 04 45 and is another athlete whose numbers in the area of VO2 max  which measures the maximum rate of oxygen consumption  lactate profile  which provides an indicator of fatigue during exercise  and running economy were second to none  The shoes The 200 gramme Zoom Vaporfly Elite are central to the whole project  Nike says the combination of a new foam and curved carbon insert  which also helps change the angle of the foot  means runners require four percent less energy to go at the same speed in comparison with their previous best shoe  The shoes have been further custom fitted for the three athletes   which should help prevent a repeat of the blisters that scuppered Ethiopian Keninisa Bekele s London Marathon bid in similar Vaporfly 4  shoes      A recent meeting of the IAAF technical committee ruled the shoes and their technology to be within their  admittedly vague  rules   though the Elite version will not be available for the public to buy  The kit Nike is also kitting their intrepid trio out in new socks  shorts and singlet  all of which are claimed to offer an advantage in terms of aerodynamics and or ventilation and support  Again  many scoff at the idea but they also did that nearly 50 years ago when Briton Ron Hill broke the marathon record aided by a self designed  cooling  string vest  The course The sub 2 attempt will be run on about 17 laps of a 1 5 mile  2 4km   loop that forms part of the Monza F1 track in northern Italy  After extensive research it was selected due to a combination of environmental factors  including average temperature  air pressure and wind levels  The surface  with no kerbs or cambers  was also considered optimal  The course satisfies the rules on elevation that  for example  rule out records set on the overall downhill route of the Boston Marathon  One area where the Monza track could give a tangible advantage is that the athletes will run exactly the marathon distance  Even on the fastest road courses  the fact that the  blue line  has to follow curves and is marked a minimum distance from the kerb means that runners often actually cover many more meters than the 26 miles  385 yards that has been the standard since the 1908 Olympics  Pacemakers drafting This is another area where quantifiable benefits can be seen   and is the one that seems to have turned many people against the attempt  The three runners will be sheltered throughout the attempt by a group of pacemakers  who will dip in and out at various times to ensure they maintain the demanded pace  Similar packs are used at big city marathons  with the only real difference being that they have to start the race together  Such a controversy is not new  Roger Bannister s sub four minute mile was achieved with the aid of two pacemakers  while IAAF head Seb Coe s golden run of world records in the early 1980s  and dozens more since  have all been set that way  An indication of how having pacemakers for the entire distance can help is the women s world record  Radcliffe set her 2 15 25 while being shielded by male runners throughout in the London Marathon of 2003  Nobody has got remotely close to it since and  as a result  there are now two official women s world records  The Briton s 2 15 25 and another set in  women only  races  Radcliffe s mark under those rules being beaten by Mary Ketainy s 2 17 01 at London last month  Mobile drinks Nike organized a practice event at Monza in March  where the athletes ingested core temperature pills and used taped on muscle oxygen and skin temperature sensors  The runners followed a car with a large clock on the back showing elapsed time  splits  and projected finish time  They were also served drinks  on the move  via a moped  avoiding the need to slow and lose rhythm at traditional drinks stations   another innovation the IAAF have concerns about  Is anyone else chasing sub two  The last four world record holders   Kimetto  Wilson Kipsang  Patrick Makau and Haile Gebrselassie   have been sponsored by Nike s great rival adidas and the German company is also running its own  Sub2  project  complete with a new shoe of the same name   Our Sub2 focus will continue to be led by innovation that helps to achieve new speeds in race environments  with more to come later this year   adidas said  
In 2014  Yannis Pitsiladis  a professor of sports and exercise science at the University of Brighton in Britain  launched another Sub2Hr Project with an initial goal of breaking the barrier within five years  but his independent project appears to have stalled as he struggles to raise the  30 million he estimates will be needed over the five year period ",2017-05-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/nike's-african-trio-target-sub-two-hour-marathon-479240,479240
191876,413392,NKE,Athletics  Experts divided over chances of sub two hour marathon,news,"By Andrew Both  Reuters    Nike s  Breaking 2  attempt in Italy this weekend might not produce a sub two hour marathon  but it will probably lead to a world best time  three exercise physiology experts have told Reuters  Assuming conditions are conducive to fast running   cool and not too windy   all three predict a time inside Dennis Kimetto s 2014 world record of two hours  two minutes  57 seconds when Kenyan Olympic champion Eliud Kipchoge  Ethiopia s Lelisa Desisa and Eritrea s Zersenay Tadese take to the Monza motor racing track  aided by a group of  in and out  pacemakers  But shaving three minutes off the world record  albeit in a run that would not stand due to the in out pacemakers  is a tall order  no matter what the conditions  It would mean bringing down Kimetto s average pace of four minutes  41 seconds per mile  to 4 34  or the equivalent of nearly two seconds for every 400 meters  An improvement of seven seconds per mile might not sound much to an average weekend jogger  but it is an extraordinary challenge for elite runners already at the limit   This is physiologically possible  the athletes attempting it  the pacing scheme  the shoes and the course should all make a difference   Michael Joyner  an expert in human performance at the Mayo Clinic  told Reuters   However  a 2 5 percent jump in a distance running record is very big by historical standards and the weather is the wild card   Joyner thinks there is a roughly 50 percent chance one of the runners will better 2 01 30   That time would represent a great accomplishment and really reset the whole conversation   said Joyner  who wrote a paper back in 1991 predicting that a sub two hour marathon was feasible  The world record at the time was 2 06 50  Another expert  Mike Hahn  predicts a winning time of roughly 2 00 30   It is physiologically possible  for someone to break two hours   It s a little harder to pin down exactly when it will happen   said the director of the Bowerman Sports Science Clinic at the University of Oregon  Apart from the usual marathon variables  Hahn is curious as to whether the new  Nike   NYSE NKE  Zoom Vaporfly Elite shoes the runners will wear will provide extra assistance   One of the major ways to improve running economy is to get more propulsion out of the footwear   he said  before observing that the apparently super lightweight shoes  potentially could be the least comfortable running shoes ever   Another factor will be how well the pacemakers do their job   both in hitting various distances at pre planned times  and in shielding Kipchoge and company from any headwinds on the loop course  Erring on the side of caution would be wise for them  said Evan Day  a PhD student at the University of Oregon and an expert on running economy and foot mechanics  Day observed that most major marathons ask the pacemakers to pass halfway in just over 61 minutes  He suggested the Monza pack aim for a few seconds under one hour  Any quicker  he said  and there is a big risk of losing huge chunks of time late in the race  Day is going out on a limb in predicting the two hour barrier will fall  probably to Kipchoge  a former 5 000 meters world champion who has sizzling track speed to back up his endurance

191884,413400,NKE,This Chinese Sector Continues to Score,opinion,"Over the summer the Chinese market experienced a major hiccup  causing concern that many Asian industries would be slow  or unable to recover  Since the June collapse  however  there is one sector that continues to score with investors  both here and overseas   sportswear 
The Great Soccer Revival Back in March the Chinese government announced its plan to improve the country s outlook on sports  beginning with soccer   issued by the State Council separated the Chinese Football Association from the General Administration of Sports of China  according to China Daily 
Hopes for the reform include decreased corruption and increased professionalism within the sport of soccer  or  football  as it s called in China  Perhaps too  Chinese sports enthusiasts would be able to witness their men s soccer team regain ground  having only competed in  back in 2002 
The Chinese education ministry has also played a role in this  soccer revival   The ministry  with sportswear brand Adidas  OTC ADDYY  to help promote soccer in schools   with the hope of creating interest in the sport   according to Barclays luxury goods analyst Julian Easthope 
ANTA Sports Products Ltd  HK 2020   the world s fourth largest sportswear brand  that just launched its soccer line in November   is one of the direct beneficiaries of such reforms  in addition to better known names like Adidas  Nike  N NKE  and Puma SE  OTC PMMAF   Anta has seen steady growth since the beginning of this year   keeping pace even throughout the rough summer downfall 

Follow the Leaders
Perhaps another reason the people of China are paying more attention to soccer now is current leader Xi Jinping s love for the sport  Average Chinese citizens look up to their leaders  and often will follow or play their leaders  sport  explains portfolio manager Xian Liang who grew up in Shanghai 
Mao Zedong  for example  was best known for his passion for swimming   In the 1950s and 60s public swimming pools were built all over Shanghai  just because Mao Zedong was a devoted swimmer and swam across the Yangtze at the age of 73   says Xian 
Similarly  Deng Xiaoping  paramount leader of China from 1978 to 1992  was remembered for playing bridge  a card game also enjoyed by Warren Buffett and that Deng learned in France as a young student and revolutionary 
Mao and Deng enjoyed soccer  too  Mao played goalie in high school and Deng collateralized his clothes to pay for a soccer game ticket in Paris in his earlier years 
China s Catching Up to America s Love for Sports
Past game preferences aside  it s clear that Xi s ongoing spirit for soccer  paired with the opportunities presented by recent reform  is transforming China s outlook on sports as well as consumer habits 
Although America still beats China when it comes to sportswear spending per capita  China is catching up  Spending per capita in China is U S   17 per year  compared to U S   285 per year spent by Americans    Nevertheless  Deutsche Bank highlights Chinese sportswear sales at 16 percent  surpassing that of the broader retail market

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus calls for revenue of  7 838 billion and EPS of  0 89  slightly more bullish than Wall Street s estimates 
Nike s long term growth will be driven by strong global reach  ongoing product innovations and an expanding direct to consumer business 
Despite a strong U S  dollar  Nike has offset pressure on margins with price increases  lower labor costs and a DTC strategy 
Best known for its transcendent swoosh  Nike is expected to report FQ2 2016 earnings on December 22  Although the retail industry has fluctuated  Nike has consistently beat analysts  estimates with share prices increasing 30  just this year  Poised for another solid report the Estimize consensus calls for revenue of  7 838 billion and EPS of  0 89  slightly more bullish than Wall Street s estimates of  7 785 billion and EPS of  0 85  Compared to FQ2 2015  this represents a YoY increase in revenue and EPS of 6  and 20   respectively  Despite its size and market share  Nike still manages to post above average growth rates  driven by a strong global reach  ongoing product innovation and an expanding direct to consumer  DTC  business 
International markets have consistently generated more than half of all Nike s sales in any year  Given the strength of the dollar and foreign currency headwinds  there has been growing concern of dampened sales and margins  In spite of this  Nike is supporting healthy growth around the world  While a majority of Nike s currencies have weakened  global margins have remained unaffected  offset by rising average shoe prices  Nike s direct to consumer strategy and greater operational efficiencies 
In China  Nike is expected to revitalize growth supported by a greater demand for active wear  Nike continues to take proactive measures to improve distribution channels and DTC business in China  Despite China s economic woes  Nike has performed remarkably well and saw revenue increase 30  last quarter  That being said  Nike also expects to remain strong in Europe amidst a deceleration in soccer sales  Key sectors such as running  cross training and basketball are expected to keep the company modest as they amplify their direct to consumer and merchandising  Given how well Nike performs on the global stage  the upcoming Eurocup and summer Olympics will help propel the company amid concerns of slowing growth 
Long term  Nike is making investments to create sustainable and profitable manufacturing infrastructure  Automated manufacturing can help offset rising labor  production and material costs  Through increased manufacturing investments  Nike expects to improve margins  increase prices and transition away from wholesalers to DTC  A direct to consumer strategy minimizes the overhead costs of selling in brick and mortar stores or to wholesalers  A large portion of Nike s DTC business has been tied to the success of its e commerce platform which has grown almost 50  in the past quarter

191894,413410,NKE,Textile company places rare bet on Turkey s Kurdish southeast,news,"By Daren Butler and Humeyra Pamuk DIYARBAKIR  Turkey  Reuters    In Turkey s mainly Kurdish southeast  deeply scarred by conflict between state forces and militants  a textile firm that supplies companies across Europe plans three new factories   a rare bet the government can deliver on a vow to regenerate the region  The government announced a  2 8 billion investment scheme for the area in September  hoping to win over the population with the prospect of economic revival before a referendum later this month on expanding President Tayyip Erdogan s powers  The Iskur group  a supplier to fashion brands including Zara  Adidas  DE ADSGN  and  Nike   NYSE NKE   sees its  100 million investment as showing the way for other companies from western Turkey to take advantage of government incentives and lower wages in the east  Undaunted by the militant Kurdistan Workers Party s  PKK  decades old insurgency  it has been operating a  30 million cotton thread plant outside the region s biggest city Diyarbakir since 2014 but few others have followed its lead   We have opened a door in Diyarbakir  creating an example for other investors in the west   plant manager Ekrem Kul told Reuters as workers tended to rows of machines spinning thread  Iskur halted expansion plans in 2015 with the outbreak of some of the worst fighting since the PKK took up arms in 1984  but Kul said it revived them after the government initiative  It aims to employ more than 2 000 people in the new Diyarbakir plants  up from just 330 now  Its optimism is rare in a region where  according to the United Nations  the upsurge in violence between July 2015 and December 2016 killed around 2 000 people  devastated whole neighborhoods and drove half a million people from their homes  The ruling AK Party  founded by Erdogan  owed much of its early success to its stewardship of the economy after coming to power in 2002  improving roads  building bridges and hospitals  The pro Kurdish HDP says the government has  however  failed to solve the problems of the southeast  where more than 40 000 people have been killed in three decades of conflict  The government counters it has boosted per capita income in the area to  5 000 from  800 with extensive state investment  Prime Minister Binali Yildirim promised new factories  housing  hospitals and sports stadiums under the investment plan  Urbanisation Minister Mehmet Ozhaseki told reporters on Saturday state investments have so far focused on reconstruction of buildings damaged in the conflict  Alican Ebedinoglu  president of one Diyarbakir trade association  is skeptical private investment will follow   Every new government has made fresh legislation to provide incentives for investment in the region  But without peace and calm  these incentive packages don t mean much  If there is peace  the region hardly needs any incentives   Ebedinoglu said   BUSINESS EVAPORATED  Erdogan won support among Kurds for spearheading a peace process in 2013  the first time Kurdish political demands had been addressed  and for easing some restrictions on them  But after a ceasefire with the militants collapsed in July 2015 he has ruled out a return to negotiations  saying security forces will  annihilate  the PKK  which is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey  the United States and Europe  In events echoed in other towns in the southeast  armed youths dug trenches and laid explosives in Diyarbakir s ancient Sur district that is encircled by towering  Roman era walls  Security forces fought back with tanks  Security operations ended in Sur a year ago  but there are checkpoints all across the city and concrete blocks placed in front of buildings deemed vulnerable to the sporadic bombing attacks on security forces that have taken place since  Ebedinoglu said the fighting caused 500 businesses to shut down completely  while shopkeepers were forced to close their stores for weeks or months at a time when the violence surged  meaning they fell behind on rent and debt payments   The government has said it will provide interest free loans but that s a myth  You wouldn t be able to find 100 people around here that the banks would lend to unless their credit background is entirely erased   Mustafa Avcilar  owner of a cafe in a 16th century courtyard once popular with tourists  closed it for months as clashes raged nearby   Once the fighting began  business evaporated in the blink of an eye  A wave of tension swept over the city   said the 52 year old  speaking as trade was picking up in the Sur district  The industrial zone where the Iskur thread factory is based is 20 km  12 miles  north of the city  far from the focus of the fighting  but it was not immune   It affected our workers  ability to come to work easily   their psychological states  their productivity  We experienced difficult days   Kul said  Household disposable incomes are around half the national average of  4 500 in the southeast and official unemployment in some provinces is 28 percent  more than twice the national average  a figure some local business say is an underestimate  In the four provinces  including Diyarbakir  most affected by the recent conflict  the pro Kurdish HDP won around three quarters of the vote at the last parliamentary elections in November 2015  However  the AK Party attracts greater support in less troubled provinces of the southeast  Diyarbakir  a city of more than 1 5 million  is better off than rural areas  Apartment blocks have mushroomed and modern shopping malls add to the appearance of growing prosperity  but Ahmet Sayar  head of the Diyarbakir Chamber of Commerce said there is a long way to go   For there to be a leap forward in achieving the economic potential as a region there needs to be an environment of predictability  stability  peace and confidence    he said  For workers too  a return of the ceasefire is vital   We did not have these troubles during the peace process  we could come to work easily   said Ramazan Yildiz  an employee at the Iskur plant   We go home in fear in the evenings  we come to work in fear  thinking   Will there be any problem or clashes on the road

Forecasts continue to call for mainland industrial decline
Emerging market bond issuance at record lows

We begin with China  where indicators point to weakening industrial and construction activity  However we may also be seeing a potential improvement in consumer demand  The aluminum  steel rebar  and steel coil January futures on the Shanghai Futures Exchange are hitting multi year lows  showing diminishing confidence in next year s industrial construction demand 


Moreover  China s industrial profits are under pressure 
On the other hand  consumer sentiment continues to improve in spite of the recent stock market rout  We saw some signs of that in Nike s  NYSE NKE  profit report recently  It s unlikely that consumer demand will offset the slowdown in manufacturing and construction  but together with fiscal stimulus it should keep the economy from a  hard landing  
Now let s look at a few developments in other emerging markets 
 1  Here we have the loan to deposit ratio for EM banking systems  Brazil stands out  with banks there using more debt  rather than deposits  to finance their assets  
2  Brazil s corporate foreign currency borrowing in recent years is going to be extraordinarily painful going forward due to the real depreciation  especially for firms with revenues in reals 
3  Q3 saw tremendous outflows from emerging markets   both bonds and stocks

191902,413418,NKE,Bear Market Rallies Are Vicious,opinion,"The past week  it seemed markets were ready for a nice rip to the upside  on at least a couple of occasions  That is something actually  as since late August the bulls have been struggling to string some momentum together  While Monday was a solid win  the sellers came out in earnest the next day with a gap down and close lower that did not give the bulls a chance  Friday seemed to be all about the upside  given the big rally off the monthly lows the prior day 
A 25 handle gap up in the futures was sold down mercilessly  The internals were deteriorating all day long  so it was really no surprise when the futures went negative  Notable was the weakness in NASDAQ and the Russell 2000  part in parcel to the deep losses in biotech  Though the Dow Jones Industrials were shining all day long thanks to Nike  NYSE NKE   that stock was only one in a handful to close positive on the day 
Bear market rallies tend to be strong and often elusive unless you are willing to guess on the outcome  like Friday  If you decided to go long Thursday  you guessed right  But if you stayed long  you most likely gave it all back  This market is not giving you much chance to take a breath  That is sign of an unhealthy market environment 
This is bear market action  Period  There is just no spinning it any other way  and eventually all stocks will get hit   and hard  if it hasn t already happened   Now  the Fed has been a huge boost to equity prices  that is well understood  But with policy shifting on the horizon as the committee sees more influences that could cause inflationary expectations to arise  they are likely to be more proactive with tighter policy   sooner rather than later 
Take a look at the S P 500 chart  We can see several doji days this week  which measures up to indecision  Answer me this  If prices are at such a bargain now  as many would have you believe   some well over 20  lower and the indices about 8  off their highs  why is there so much indecision  The price action tells the truth   always  It is poor and prior leaders are faltering  Friday it was the biotechs  see iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  NASDAQ IBB  chart   which were taken down particularly hard across the board  A former leader now has made significantly lower levels 
A bearish chart pattern that keeps coming up is the evening star  correctly noted by my good friend Rob Moreno several times over the past month  Rob reminds us this pattern shows a doji top and confirms the move the next day  which is a pattern gamechanger  At least three of these have shown up in September  and another one may have occurred on Sept 25  with another down day there will be more downside to come 
While you may look at the indices and believe this is just a short lived correction  the action has me more concerned  Time is always a major factor  and prior corrections were always short and sweet  Over the last few years we have often seen a V shaped bounce  a scary nosedive and then very sharp recovery  This time however  by all standards is not a correction in time that we are used to  So far  prices have remained lower for well over a month and though prices did rally sharply they only met strong resistance and resumed the downtrend  I suspect this will continue onward as the journey to lower prices continues ",2015-09-27,Bob Lang,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bear-market-rallies-are-vicious-266296,266296

191906,413422,NKE,NBA s Chris Paul  other celebrity athletes  invest for a cause,news,"By Elizabeth Dilts NEW YORK Reuters    Giving back to their communities has always been a challenge for pro athletes who get rich quick because they tend to lose the money even more quickly  But even those who manage to build a substantial amount of wealth have a hard time using it charitably in a way that truly has a long term effect  Some celebrity athletes are turning to  impact investing   a growing niche of do gooder strategies that aim to put money toward charitable causes but that would otherwise lack support  Fund managers  of course  also aim to generate income in the process  The Turner Multifamily Impact Fund  a private equity style vehicle focused on preserving affordable housing  has lately drawn financial support from NBA All Star Chris Paul   He joins former World No  1 tennis player Andre Agassi and Basketball Hall of Famer Magic Johnson  who have invested in other funds and projects run by the parent company  Turner Impact Capital and its founder  Bobby Turner  Their contributions work with dollars from hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman  the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and actress Eva Longoria  In an interview with Reuters  Paul said he was frustrated by the feeling that giving away his own millions only  put a Band Aid on a situation   As a point guard for the Los Angeles Clippers  he has earned money not just from the 5 year   107 3 million contract he signed in 2013  but also from lucrative endorsements for companies like  Nike   NYSE NKE  and State Farm Insurance   Paul is worth an estimated  30 million  according to Forbes   We were doing basketball courts here or there  we d always do giveaways during the holidays  and we did 10 computer labs   Paul said  referring to a few of the projects the Chris Paul Family Foundation has organized for disadvantaged kids   But at times  philanthropy can be frustrating   Whether impact investing is more successful than pure charitable giving is unclear  Unlike simply giving money away  impact investing does provide a return  which could enable philanthropists to sustain or grow their charitable giving  But broadly speaking  impact funds have delivered lower returns than straightforward stock or bond market indexes  according to data from the Global Impact Investing Network  a trade group   The funds also charge higher fees than traditional investment tools like mutual funds and index funds  because of the amount of work that goes into the investments  such as scouting apartment complexes for affordable housing funds  But impact investing proponents argue that analyzing financial returns alone is misguided  That is because they are more concerned with whether their money is achieving an outcome  like preserving affordable housing in a gentrifying neighborhood  than whether the investment generates a certain profit  Around 40 percent of impact investors polled by Global Impact said they seek below  market returns  Counter intuitively  funds that deliver below market returns may be the most successful because it indicates they would not otherwise receive funding  said Paul Brest  a professor at Stanford University who teaches courses on impact investing   That s the sweet spot for impact investing  because by definition  ordinary investors are not going to invest in that   he said       REDUCED RENT FOR SERVICES There were over 400 impact investing funds and products  with  31 billion in committed money  in 2015  the latest year for which data is available from Global Impact  Run by former hedge fund manager Bobby Turner  the Turner Multifamily Impact Fund launched in 2015 and raised  264 million in capital  It has so far acquired nine garden style apartment complexes on the outskirts of cities like Dallas  Austin and Las Vegas  according to the fund s website   We re trying to give housing to people who make too much money for subsidized housing but do not make enough for luxury rentals or home ownership   Turner told Reuters  The apartments are mostly filled with tenants who earn up to 80 percent of an area s median income  and rent is no more than 35 percent of a tenant s salary   To make the investment sustainable  Turner said tenant turnover must be kept low  The fund tries to do that by providing additional services like community watch groups  free tutoring and on site clinics run by other residents who work in law enforcement  healthcare or education and receive half price rent for running these programs  At the Turner owned Regency Pointe Apartments  a cluster of two story red brick apartments 10 miles from Washington D C   the typical tenant would earn  54 666 a year  according to U S  Census data  Rent for a three bedroom starts at  1 456 a month  according to the complex s website  The fund is aiming for 10 to 12 percent returns net of all fees over the next few years by keeping tenant turnover and insurance costs low  Turner s firm does not disclose fees  but generally speaking  industry sources said similar  private equity style funds typically charge annual management fees of 1 5 to 2 percent of assets  plus 20 percent of profits  A benchmark generated by Global Impact Investing Network shows impact funds generated 5 58 percent returns over 15 years ending last June  The benchmark underperformed stock and bond market indexes across all timeframes it measures   But Paul says that earning a financial return is essential to the fund s success  
 That s the fuel we need to bring in investors and reach even more communities and families   Paul said   When you combine a positive financial return with positive social impact  you can make a huge difference for people ",2017-03-20,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/nba's-chris-paul,-other-celebrity-athletes,-invest-for-an-impact-467329",467329
191907,413423,NKE,How To Generate 10  Per Year In Bear Markets By Selling Stock Options,opinion,"Covered call writing and put selling generate monthly cash flow with the inherent risk of share depreciation  One of the major advantages of these conservative strategies is that they can be tailored to all market environments  In today s article  I will address one way to  stay in the game  even when market conditions are working against us  as they have been recently  with global economic concerns in China and Greece along with the technical breakdown last week at the New York Stock Exchange  Our goal is to achieve an annualized return of 10  per year in bear and volatile market conditions  and NO  this concept is NOT taken from the Bernie Madoff School of Sociopathic Investing 
Overall concept
We will initiate our trade by selling a deep out of the money cash secured put targeting a 1   one month return
If that option expires worthless  we continue to sell similar put options
If exercised  the stock is purchased at the discounted strike price less put premium as our cost basis
Once shares are purchased  in the money covered calls are sold targeting a 1   one month time value return
With both calls and puts  we select as deep out  or in the money strikes as possible  while still approaching our one month option profit goal
We will assume no greater than a 1 month price decline of 5   so if the put is exercised  it will be purchased near market price
In the event that share decline is catastrophic  use of our exit strategy arsenal is essential
Real life example
The challenge as I write this article is to find a security not reporting earnings prior to September 18  2015  as I am crafting a two month trade  Our Premium Watch List shows that Nike  NYSE NKE  is due to report on September 24  2015  so that will represent our underlying security  The trades will initiate on July 9  2015 and terminate on September 18  2015  Here are the initial stats 
Entering the trade
NKE is currently priced at  110 42
The out of the money August 21  2015  105 00 put generates a premium of  0 99  near our 1  target
The in the money  105 00 call generates  6 43  of which  1 01 is time value  meeting our 1  target goal
We will make the assumption that strikes that are in the money strikes by  5 00 in future months will also return about 1  in time value  with the understanding that stock implied volatility may change
Calculating the out of the money put

NKE  Calculating Put Options
Note the following
NKE calculations are in the last column circled in red
The return of the put option sale is 0 95   green arrow 
If exercised  our cost basis is  104 01  a discount of 5 81  from the price when the trade was initiated
Calculating the in the money call  in the money by approximately  5 00 

NKE  Calculating Call Options
Note the following
The time value return by the strike about  5 00 in the money is 1   meeting our target
That profit is protected as long as NKE does not decline in value by more than 4 9 
Our 10 week return in a bear market is 0 95    1 0    1 95   which annualized to our target of 10 
Discussion
This article was designed to show how flexible option selling can be  even in extreme bear and volatile markets  In order to accomplish this  certain assumptions were made  with the understanding that there are a myriad of exceptions that may occur  The concepts behind these assumptions  however  are  gold  and can be applied in countless other scenarios ",2015-07-12,Dr. Alan Ellman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-to-generate-10-per-year-in-bear-markets-by-selling-stock-options-257981,257981

191919,413435,NKE,3 Great Reasons Nike Stock Is A Buy,opinion,Nike Inc  NYSE NKE  is one of the largest and most well known sports apparel brands in the world  With a market cap of a little over  87 21 billion  they are a giant  Nike s principal business activity involves the design  development and worldwide marketing of high quality footwear  apparel  equipment  and accessory products  The company sells its products to retail accounts in the United States and through a mix of independent distributors  licensees and subsidiaries in numerous countries around the world  Between its Nike and Jordan Brand lines  the company controls 62  of the athletic footwear brand market share  which is more than four times the combined values of its competitors of Adidas  XETRA ADSGN   Skechers  NYSE SKX   and Asics  TOKYO 7936   The company currently has 322 stores in the US and 536 non US retail stores  Nike can be found is nearly 50 countries worldwide  With consumers becoming more health conscious and increasing exercise levels  along with the increased popularity of the  casual comfort  fashion style  the demand for sportswear is increasing  and Nike definitely stands to benefit  This is part of why Nike is such a compelling investment these days  though that is by no means the only reason  In fact  NKE finds itself in the top 13  of all industries  while it is also seeing strong growth prospects as well  Below  we highlight in greater detail three of the best reasons to buy NKE stock now  and how this dominant player in the space could continue to grow despite its already massive size 1  Strong Growth Numbers Nike has seen strong sales growth numbers across the board in their regions  As of late  the dollar has been strong against a number of currencies  and in the case of the euro especially  it is not likely that it will continually decrease in worth greatly each quarter  so in this case it pays to view the company s revenue numbers excluding currency issues  When using constant currencies  Western Europe saw the greatest growth of any region at 21   with Greater China in a close second with 17  growth  Central and Eastern Europe increased by 7   and the company s emerging markets sector revenues grew 12   of 2015  overall revenues have increased by 7  to  7 5 billion  and growth was 13  excluding currency issues  These numbers show that even being such a large company already  NIKE still has the capability and leadership to continue to grow  and at significant rates no less 2  Improving Profit Margins Increased growth is always something that investors enjoy seeing in a company that they are analyzing  But a company that is growing revenues and increasing the amount of profits they make on their revenues  That is something that investors love to see  In the report from NKE  the company states that net income increased 16  in the third quarter  up to  791 million  The company s success in increasing their profit margins stems from the continuation of a shift to higher margined products  where the selling price is a significant amount more than the cost of its production 3   Trust the Experts Nike Inc  is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and for good reason  We expect EPS growth of 19 79  for this year  while not a single analyst in our consensus has slashed estimates for this time frame in the past 60 days  Nike s earnings returns are promising and the company has shown the ability to consistently beat estimates  Nike has had an average earnings surprise of 9 54  over its last four earnings reports  so there is no reason to think that it can t continue to match lofty analyst expectations in the quarters ahead  Nike s largest earnings surprise came last year  after the summer in their quarter ending 8 2014 with a 23 86  surprise  If Nike can have anywhere near the success the company had last summer  the next earnings report has the possibility of showing extremely strong numbers Bottom Line With increasing numbers of individuals getting more into exercise and increasing popularity of the casual comfort fashion trend  the sportswear industry stands to gain immensely  Nike  with a capability for and history of growth  and an improving profit margin  is in position to be extremely successful for itself and its investors moving forward   The company posted incredibly successful numbers after last summer in their earnings report  and with substantial growth numbers continuing over the last two quarters  Nike is very likely to post great numbers once again at its next earnings report date in August 2015  The stock is definitely worth a closer look by investors seeking a top pick in the consumer sector ,2015-06-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nike-(nke)-stock:-3-great-reasons-it-is-a-buy-254805,254805

191924,413440,NKE,Ex Energy  Dollar  Expect Pretty Strong Q1  15 Earnings From S P 500,opinion,"Forward 4 quarter estimate   119 38  down  0 40 from last week
P E ratio  17 x 
PEG ratio  21 63 x    Yowzers  The dollar and Energy revisions have crushed the forward estimate
Earnings yield  5 66   down from last week s 5 83 
Year over year growth of forward estimate   0 82   the same as last week s y y growth rate

With just one full week left in the quarter  here is how Thomson Reuters is seeing Q1  15 sector growth rates for the S P 500  both as of Friday  March 20th  and as of January 1 2015 

Cons  Discretionary   7    14 6 
Cons  Staples   0 6    5 3 
Energy   63 4    32 2 
Financials   11 2    13 9 
Health Care   7 2    11 1 
Industrials   4 2    11 5

Telco   0 8    1 2 
Utilities   6 6    5 9 
S P 500   3 1   5 3 

Summary   conclusion  To be totally upfront  when I saw the reaction to Nike s  NYSE NKE  earnings on Friday  where the futures orders  Nike s key metric  that typically gets the most weight in terms of the health of future business was  2   but when adjusted for currency  or what Nike calls  constant currency  was  11   and the stock rallied 3 5  Friday on 5 x  average volume  it was clear to me that  currency  will likely be discounted when companies report Q1  15 earnings 
Looking at the above ranking of the sectors in terms of growth rates  if we assume Energy is 10  of the S P 500 by earnings weight  then Energy alone is a 6 3  drag on the S P 500 and  operating earnings  of  3 1  should be 6 3  higher or  3 2   If we take Standard   Poor s  Howard Silverblatt s estimate that Energy s operating earnings weight within the S P 500 is 4    5    let s use 5    then after adjusting for Energy s drag  the current estimate of Q1  15 earnings growth for the S P 500 is flat or 0   and none of this includes the dollar influence since it can only be identified by individual company 
If I stretch or extrapolate the math or logic a little more  and tell readers that for  most  of the companies I own within client accounts which are primarily the top half of the S P 500 by market cap the  average  dollar drag in Q4  14 and Q1  15  given management guidance  is between 4    7   Thus  if I further factor that into the above   3 1   S P 500 growth rate with 10 days left in the quarter  I can confidently tell readers that it is probably a safe bet that the S P 500 as a whole will report a pretty strong earnings quarter starting in mid April  2015 
My  forecast  or prediction for 2015 for readers  and clients  I tell clients exactly what readers see here   was for 

0    10  earnings growth for the S P 500 in 2015
0    10  total return for the S P 500 in 2015
I didn t think the S P 500 would see much  P E expansion  in 2015
Financials was my best pick in terms of sector selection  although I m probably overweight Technology more than Financials in client accounts

Year to date  Financials are flat to slightly negative  versus the S P 500 s 1    1 5  return 
There is one key Energy metric I m watching to see when energy might bottom  I ll try and be out with that analysis later this weekend  I ve got a couple of what I hope are useful articles for readers  but it takes time to flush out the topic  and get it camera ready for readers ",2015-03-22,Brian Gilmartin,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/ex-energy,-and-dollar,-expect-pretty-strong-q1-’15-earnings-from-sp-500-245757",245757

trafficking victims rises  Italian prosecutors   lawyers who gather evidence before presenting it in court   are finding more and more of their time taken up with unpicking Nigeria s criminal networks  Nigerian prostitutes frequently end up working as recruiters or  madams  for new arrivals from Africa  prosecutors say   These former sex workers also help with the logistics of slavery  driving trafficking victims to the cities where they become prostitutes  Trovato said  But trends are changing  Armed robberies  murders and drug related crime have spread south to the Sicilian city of Palermo from larger Nigerian communities in the northern cities of Turin and Castel Volturno  justice officials say   It is a compact community  in which there are lots of people who practice crime   said Leonardo Agueci  prosecutor in Palermo s justice department  Earlier in 2016  the boss of notorious Nigerian criminal organization Black Axe was sentenced to 12 years in jail after a number of Nigerian men were brutally attacked in Palermo  The incident happened late one night in January 2014 in Palermo s Ballaro street market  where police later found the victims with gashed foreheads   It was the first time a Palermo court has convicted a Nigerian on mafia related crimes   said Gaspare Spedale  another prosecutor in the Sicilian city  Police fear the relatively small time crimes committed by members of the Nigerian gangs in Palermo might become more serious in a city famous for Italy s most storied mafia organization  the Cosa Nostra  Agueci said  For now  the prosecutors said there was no evidence mafia were running the Nigerian sex trafficking network from Palermo  but it could have connections with organized crime gangs on mainland Italy   The people who export  Nigerian victims  are in other countries   Spedale said   But there is a mastermind controlling it in Italy  It exists    NIGERIAN OMERTA In Palermo s vibrant Ballaro market  Nigerian shopkeepers and customers brushed shoulders with Sicilian fruit stallholders touting bright pink pomegranates and blood red tomatoes  Nigerian women  loading their baskets with sardines and olives  refused to answer questions about the quality of life in Palermo when they were approached by the Thomson Reuters Foundation  At night  a few hundred meters away  West African women in short cut dresses plied their trade in dimly lit streets alongside the port  Many work for pimps who remain out of sight  local campaigners say  But the killing in 2011 of one Nigerian trafficking victim still strikes fear in the community   Favour   Nike   NYSE NKE  Adekune was murdered in Palermo s historic center in a crime that shocked the 500 strong Nigerian community  according to Nino Rocca  a local rights activist  Adekune   from Benin City in Nigeria s southern Edo state   had been working as a sex worker to pay off debts to her pimps  Rocca said   After one of Adekune s clients was convicted of her murder  something mysterious happened to her body  he said   When the corpse was prepared for burial  months after her death   we noticed that only a few bones remained  We do not know why   Rocca told the Thomson Reuters Foundation   We have no idea if the mafia or Nigerian  gangs  stole the body   But he added that some members of the Nigerian community suspected the local mafia were involved  MAPPING THE CRIME The macabre nature of more and more crimes committed against Nigerian women  including black magic or  juju  rituals  is one reason victims are reluctant to come forward  prosecutors say  Fear plays a large part in Nigerian juju  with pubic hair  fingernails and blood collected from trafficking victims as they are made to swear never to report their situation to authorities  rights groups say  In some cases  fearing the juju  spell  may be turned on them and they may die  Nigerian parents insist their daughters obey traffickers  testimony from Italian court documents shows   One woman we spoke to was made to swallow an egg whole   Kevin Hyland  Britain s anti slavery commissioner  said in an interview in London   It obviously had some kind of drug in it  She was raped daily   Victims of sex trafficking often do not want to point the finger at the madams or pimps because they are worried about repercussions or juju  Catania based prosecutor Lino Trovato said  Even so  the number of trafficking related cases in her file has risen   This year  I handled about 40 cases  compared with 20 the year before   Trovato said  SPANISH PROBLEM TOO The problem is not isolated to Italy  The authorities in parts of Spain have also been grappling with Nigerian sex trafficking rings   In Catalonia  99 percent of prostitution is controlled by organized crime  much of it by a dominant Nigerian crime group known as the Supreme Eiye Confraternity  SEC  or Air Lords   It s a criminal network comparable with the mafioso in Chicago in the 1930s  said Xavi Cortes  chief of the central unit of human trafficking at the Mossos d Esquadra  the Catalan regional police force   Every single Nigerian knows who they are   Cortes said in an interview   If you ask a Nigerian boy  he will know who an Eiye is    But many women who are trafficked to Spain end up working as  madams   who are essentially pimps who control prostitutes on the streets of Barcelona  Cortes said  The Mossos s operations have led to the jailing of 25 trafficking gang members in the Barcelona region  with a further 13 currently under a European arrest order because they are abroad  Cortes said   Experience tells me that  finally  all the traffickers will find new routes and new ways  It is impossible to stop this phenomenon   the Catalan police chief said

191948,413464,NKE,Sneakers show limits of trade policy in reviving jobs for Trump,news,"By Timothy Aeppel and Mai Nguyen  Reuters    American companies from appliance makers to auto parts suppliers have lined up to offer a quiet caution to President elect Donald Trump as he considers pulling the United States from trade deals  most lost manufacturing jobs aren t coming back  but higher costs for consumers could  Consider the sneaker industry  one of the first to move to Asia because of the sharply lower cost of production in China and Vietnam   Nike  Inc  N NKE  and its smaller  privately held rival New Balance Shoes Inc split over the question of whether the United States should back the Trans Pacific Partnership  TPP  trade deal  But if Trump and a Republican controlled Congress nix that trade deal as expected  both companies and the analysts who track them agree Asia is poised to keep its dominance as the industry s manufacturing hub  Companies like Nike have invested too much in those lower wage economies to consider moving factories  even if tariffs rise and push up costs for American consumers  analysts say  Any new hiring in the United States will be years down the road and depend on refining production technologies like 3 D printing that could make it profitable to hire relatively small numbers of American production staff  The same dynamic applies to other industries  like auto parts  which have moved production to Mexico over the past two decades  executives say  That suggests a problem that the Trump administration will bump against if it tries to pursue a harder line on trade agreements from NAFTA to TPP  Shoe companies  like other manufacturers  could be forced to pass on higher costs to consumers  but few executives see a serious case for new hiring in the United States because of a change in tariffs on imports   The idea of moving shoe manufacturing to advanced countries is a little bit of a farce   says Ed Van Wezel the CEO of Hi tech International Holdings BV  an Amsterdam based shoemaker that sells about 30 percent of its shoes in the U S   The U S  imports about 98 percent of its footwear   2 5 billion pairs last year  or nearly eight pair for every man  woman and child  Shoemaking went offshore decades ago  mainly to China  because the process is so labor intensive  Making a single pair of running shoes can require up to 80 production steps  The average shoe worker in Vietnam earns about  245 a month  while shoe tariffs can range from zero up to 48 percent  according the U S  International Trade Commission  The average is just over 13 percent   The ones that stand to lose out here are consumers  because if we start to eliminate trade deals  they ll be paying a lot more for shoes   says Matt Priest  president of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America  which represents the industry in Washington  The same dynamic is seen in other industries   Ford Motor Co   N F  CEO Mark Fields said last week that big tariffs on cars and trucks imported from Mexico would hurt the auto industry and the U S  economy  But he remained committed to making small cars in Mexico because the profits on making those cars in the U S  are so low   TAKING THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRADE New Balance  based in Boston  makes only about a quarter of the shoes it sells in the U S  at its five New England factories  and figures that costs 25 percent to 35 percent more than it would to make them in Asia   The private company  owned by former marathoner Jim Davis and his wife Anne  says it makes up for that cost disadvantage in part by producing higher end and customized shoes in those U S  plants  If the company were publicly traded  it would likely face pressure from shareholders to move all its production abroad  Beaverton  Oregon based Nike imports nearly all its shoes  and fought for the Trans Pacific Partnership  a trade deal that became a lightning rod in the recent presidential campaign  Nike said last year that it would create 10 000 manufacturing and engineering jobs in the U S  if the deal were adopted  Nike has clarified that those jobs would largely be aimed at creating more automated factories  not old style production that would employ thousands of assemblers  New Balance fought the TPP  arguing that it would jeopardize its U S  plants by giving competitors like Nike more profits they could pour into developing new machines  products and advertising  That opposition has proven costly for the iconic brand  In the wake of the election  a New Balance spokesman welcomed what he saw as a likely defeat for TPP  Many critics seized on his comments as an endorsement of Trump  and some consumers burned their shoes  Backlash flared again after a neo Nazi website proclaimed New Balance the  official shoes of white people   The company said the original comments were only meant to reflect its opposition to the TPP  not support for Trump   For us  this is and always has been about the creation and retention of manufacturing jobs in support of our five New England factories   the company said in a statement  TURNING TO ROBOTS  NOT PEOPLE  Beyond the furor  shoemakers are experimenting with ways to take human labor out of manufacturing their goods  wherever they are made  Reebok  the Canton  Massachusetts based shoe company now owned by Germany s Adidas AG  DE ADSGN   is building a laboratory in Rhode Island to refine a process to make shoes with liquid plastic   We re looking at the entire process of shoe making from end to end with a clean sheet   says Bill McInnis  who heads up the program to develop the company s manufacturing process  Skeptics like Hi tech s Ed Van Wezel emphasize that the industry s advanced automation efforts are still years away from being able to produce whole shoes at large scale and at low prices  He says at least for now  many of the materials used to make shoes will continue to come from Asia because that s where suppliers are clustered   At this point  what you have is what we call  lick and stick   putting together uppers and outsoles imported from Asia   Van Wezel said   It s as much about a public relations story   that you re producing close to the market    Matt Powell  an analyst who follows the shoe and other sports industries for NPD Group  a market research group  said the main problem with the new technologies is that Americans like cheap shoes and demand them in huge quantities    The only process of scale today is Nike s Flyknit   he said   They ve made 1 million of those  But it s important to remember that they sold 400 million shoes last year  So it s still tiny

191949,413465,NKE,3 Reasons Why You Should Become More Cautious On Stocks ,opinion,"Trend Model signal summary
Trend Model signal  Risk on
Direction of last change  Negative
The actual historical  not back tested  buy and sell signals of the Trend Model are shown in the chart below 

Equities poised for a pullback
Despite the positive performance shown by US equities last week  I continue to believe that they are poised for a pullback for the following reasons 
High valuation 
Excessive risk appetite and crowded long positions in pockets of the market  and
Possible growth scare
The first two are latent risks  which can lurk for a long time without any negative consequences  much like Bank of Governor  when he talked about the Canadian real estate market 
It s like if the tree in the backyard has a crack in it  you worry it s vulnerable to a storm  But if no storm happens  it goes on and on  and maybe eventually strengthens through growth  If the right storm comes along and knocks it onto your neighbour s house you ve got a problem 
The the possible growth scare scenario is the catalyst that could wake the hibernating bears 
Equities richly priced
I have written before about how US equities appear expensive on a P E  P B and dividend yield viewpoint  see   and those conclusions haven t changed  Valuations are elevated  though not crazy high  which indicates that investors should lower their long term equity return expectations  My observations were confirmed by the latest BoAML Fund Manager Survey which showed that a consensus of fund managers believed that equities are richly valued  Note that these readings have not been this high since the NASDAQ bubble of the late 1990s 

As well    recently wrote that he had trouble finding many good deep value stocks  defined as stocks trading at a EV EBIDTA multiple of 3 or less 

It s not just deep value investors that are having trouble finding cheap stocks  In a  interview  venture capitalist Bill Gurley warned about the stretched valuations and frothiness in Silicon Valley 
Silicon Valley is a risk driven place  But over the past year  it may have taken on more than it can handle  according to one prominent venture capitalist   I think that Silicon Valley as a whole  or that the venture capital community or startup community  is taking on an excessive amount of risk right now unprecedented since  99   said Bill Gurley  a partner at Benchmark  referring to the last tech bubble 
Here are some selected quotes from that interview 
In  01 or  09  you just wouldn t go take a job at a company that s burning  4 million a month  Today everyone does it without thinking    Right now  the cost of capital is super low here  If the environment were to change dramatically  the types of gymnastics that it would require companies to readjust their spend is massive  So I worry about it constantly    The most obvious one is just the acceptable burn rate  And that can be seriously  negatively reinforced by the capital market  In the software as a service world  where the risk is potentially among the highest  Wall Street has said it s OK to lose tons of money as a public company  So what happens in the board rooms of all the private companies is they say   Did you see that  Did you see they went out and they re losing tons of money and they re worth a billion  We should spend more money   And there are people knocking on their door saying   Do you want more money  do you want more money  
In a recent letter to investors   also warned about increasing complacency in the market  emphasis added  
We don t know now  nor do we ever know  what the overall market will do  As we ve discussed in recent letters  there are reasons for investors to be frightened but also numerous individual opportunities worth seizing  Today s limited opportunity set means that we are still holding sizable cash balances  about 35  of the portfolio at June 30  This dry powder will become more valuable if the markets become more turbulent  Equity markets continue to hit successive record highs  volatility remains strikingly low in equity and most other markets  and inflation is ticking higher  Investors have clearly grown weary of worrying about risky scenarios that never seem to materialize or  when they do  don t seem to matter to anyone else  U S  GDP  for example  was recently restated to minus 2 9  for the first quarter of 2014  Normally  this magnitude drop signals recession  Equities  nevertheless  marched relentlessly higher In today s ebullient markets  we see many investors ratcheting up their own risk levels buying substandard credits and piling up leverage are two favorite methods in an attempt to generate near term performance 
He concluded 
It s not hard to reach the conclusion that so many investors feel good not because things are good but because investors have been seduced into feeling good otherwise known as  the wealth effect   We really are far along in re creating the markets of 2007  which felt great but were deeply unstable when shocks started to pile up  Even Janet Yellen sees  pockets of increasing risk taking  in the markets  yet she has made clear that she won t raise rates to fight incipient bubbles  For all of our sakes  we really wish she would 
Crowded long in risky assets
To confirm Klarman s view  I am seeing pockets of crowded long positions in risky assets  The BoAML Fund Manager Survey shows that the two biggest crowded long trades are US HY  or junk bonds  and eurozone peripheral debt  which could cause concern for the market in light of the disappointing TLTRO results 

As an example of how pervasive risk taking is in the fixed income market  consider this  report about how an establishment figure like Bill Gross of PIMCO raised returns using a combination of financial leverage  derivatives and peripheral European and emerging market debt 
Bill Gross is relying on derivatives rather than Janet Yellen to raise his returns on government bonds  The co founder of Pacific Investment Management Co  sold most of the  48 billion of U S  Treasuries held by his  221 6 billion Pimco Total Return Fund  PTTRX  in the second quarter  replacing them with about  45 billion of futures  according to an August filing  The contracts require small up front payments  freeing up money for Gross to invest in higher yielding securities including Brazilian  Spanish and Italian debt   They are taking the cash and buying all these peripheral bonds that have a lot of spread on them relative to Treasuries   a trend that is occurring across the money management industry  said Erik Schiller  a Newark  New Jersey based senior money manager at Prudential Fixed Income   It is levering their fund  
As well  read this  report on how investors  desperate for yield  are plunging into the illiquid world of bank loans  Aside from the excesses of institutional behavior  the American individual investor is nearing a crowded long position in equities   recently pointed out that that US households have equity positions equal to pre Lehman Crisis levels and cash allocations are at near historic lows 

 confirmed the conclusions of the AAII asset allocation survey with this analysis and pointed out that US households are most invested in stocks since 2000  the year of the NASDAQ peak 

His take is that while risk levels are high  there could be more upside 
What is the significance of the current reading  As we mentioned  it is the highest reading since 2000  Considering the markets are at an all time high  this should not be surprising  In fact  while most of the indexes surpassed their prior peaks in early 2013  household stock investment did not surpass the 2007 highs until the first quarter of this year  The financial crisis put a dent in many investors  psyches  along with their portfolios  and they ve been slow to return again  However  along with market appreciation  investor flows have seen at least streaks of exuberance over the past 18 months  boosting investment levels  Yes  there is still room to go  7 5 percentage points  to reach the bubble highs of 2000  However  one flawed behavioral practice we see time and time again is gauging context and probability based on outlier readings  This is the case in many walks of life from government budgeting to homeowner psychology to analyzing equity valuations  The fact that we are below the highest reading of all time in stock investment should not lead one s primary conclusion to be that there is still plenty of room to go to reach those levels 
Having set the stage that  in effect  there is a crack in the backyard tree  the tree could stay up indefinitely  In order for the tree to go down  you need a storm 
A gathering storm 
A possible storm warning comes from the BoAML Fund Manager Survey indicating that global growth expectations are starting to roll over 

What s even more disturbing is the fact that growth seems to be slowing across the board in virtually all countries  Let me go through the three major regions in the world  one by one 
China  Stimulated but not aroused
Let s start with China  Last week  the news that PBoC injected 500b yuan  or roughly USD 81b  into the banking system rallied the market  but excitement petered out later in the week as the move was interpreted as being done for technical reasons instead of a broadly based stimulus program   recounts the details here 
Sina com reported that the PBOC provided the funds under a program called the standing lending facility  introduced last year as a collateralized provision of funds to meet large scale demands for financial institutions  long term liquidity and to help address fluctuations in money market rates   While the action was probably driven by considerations including economic weakness and liquidity volatility around the weeklong National Day holiday that starts Oct  1  the fact that the PBOC used the SLF instead of a cut in banks  reserve requirements suggests that the  central bank does not want the market to interpret it as a clear sign of monetary easing   JPMorgan Chase   Co  economists wrote in a report   The central bank has left reserve requirements for the largest banks and benchmark interest rates unchanged for more than two years 
Sara Hsu s article entitled    summed up the recent PBoC targeted stimulus perfectly 
China s central bank recently implemented a limited stimulus by injecting 100 billion RMB into each of the top five banks  The stimulus took the form of direct injections in order to prevent other areas of the economy  such as real estate  from heating up once again  However  given China s restructuring status  it will likely take more than a stimulus to arouse the economy back to strong growth levels  For this  China can look to its own reform plans to alter the sectoral balance of the economy 
She believes that Beijing needs to press on with financial reforms 
To combat its own malaise  China needs real reforms in targeted industries  In general  the state sector remains too pervasive  and challenges to the growth of private sector enterprises are difficult to surmount  In contrast to what other analysts have asserted  the reform process does not have to be stalled in order to combat slowing growth  Slowing growth can only be addressed in a meaningful way by changing policies to promote employment and the expansion of particular sectors  Economic resuscitation and long term growth need not  and should not  be mutually exclusive 
The market barely reacted to the news of the limited stimulus program  as commodity prices  via the CRB Index  which represent a real time measure of the health of the Chinese economy  are having trouble breaking out of their well defined downtrend 

The industrial commodity complex  whose prices held up fairly well  weakened and breached a key technical support level 

China bulls may point to the fact that commodity prices face a headwind because of the strength in the US Dollar Index  a fact that I recently highlighted  see    One way of untangling the China effect from the USD effect on commodity prices is to focus on the AUD CAD exchange rate  Both Australia and Canada are resource based economies of similar size  but Australia is more China sensitive while Canada is more US sensitive  As the chart below shows  the AUD CAD shows a technical breakdown through a key support level and it is falling with little sign of a bottom in sight 

What about the recent rally in Chinese stocks  Isn t that an indication that the markets remains upbeat about China  Don t count your chickens before they re hatched  Analysis from  suggests that the Chinese stock rally may be due for a pause 
MSCI China has outperformed the developed market stock index  the MSCI World Index  by about 11  since the middle of March  Over that period the percent of stocks outperforming the World Index increased from a paltry 14  to an elevated 79   blue line in the chart below   In the past  when the percent of stocks in the MSCI China outperforming the MSCI World Index reached around 80  the relative outperformance was all but over and a new downtrend resumed  We are careful not to call for a renewed downtrend in Chinese stocks  but perhaps they are ready for a breather 

 Bottom line  Don t count on China for any help with global growth expectations 
No European growth boost
The bulls got a boost late last week when Scotland voted  No  to independence  and my daughter breathed a sigh of relief because her biggest worry  who would get Hogwarts in the divorce  evaporated   Unfortunately  the relief rally was brief  via   
Sterling and the stock market rose  of course   but not by much in the end  The FTSE 100 didn t set any records  as some had hoped  and the pound soon began to reverse its gains   Why  The first drag was expectations  The financial and betting markets had been pricing in a No vote with a very large probability  once again  it was confirmed that the weight of money is far more powerful a barometer of public opinion than the analysis of specialist pundits  The wisdom of the crowd   at least the cash rich  let s put our money where our mouth is variety   does work  The pound recovered the ground it had recently lost   but within hours  traders were once again focused on all of the usual big global macro issues 
Another reason was because the City was looking ahead to the prospect of Brexit  emphasis added  
The business community faces several other issues  In the long run  the chances of a Brexit   a UK exit from the EU   are now higher than they were  though not as high as if Scotland had voted Yes  It is clear that campaigners can make huge headway even if the establishment is against them  Expect the Out campaign to use a similar strategy to that embraced by Mr Salmond   though with actual facts and genuine arguments this time  rather than bluff  bluster and denial 
It appears that Brexit fears are surfacing  as evidenced by this  from Simon Armstrong of Saltus Investment Partners 

Across the English Channel  the ECB s TLTRO auction was a major disappointment as the amounts were far less than expected  TLTRO injected  83b into the eurozone banking system  but the banks promptly repaid  20b of LTRO money the next day  The market s hope that TLTRO would be a QE program that would significantly expand the ECB balance sheet were shattered 

Eurozone inflationary expectations continued to tank 

The  highlighted the fact that money has been coming out of European equities  These recent developments are likely to exacerbate the trend toward further withdrawal 

I had written that since the intent of the TLTRO is to stimulate local businesses and SMEs  European small caps may benefit  see    Oh well  in light of the disappointing TLTRO results  maybe next time  Don t expect Europe to contribute positively to global growth 
Slowing US growth 
Across the Atlantic  the US growth outlook is starting to lose some steam too  The momentum in Russell Investments   is slowing down  ht    Russell does  however  note that the US economy is far from a recession and dismiss the weakness as  noise   at least for the time being 
While the BCI model still shows the U S  economy has a very low probability of recession and is on a path of moderate growth amid low inflation  the growth path is a touch more muted because of the soft consumption and nonfarm payrolls release  However  this is seen as more noise than signal 

The Citigroup US Economic Surprise Index also appears to be starting to roll over after reaching a zone of excessively high expectations  see my recent comment   

What s more  the Atlanta Fed s   the  nowcast  of Q3 GDP  continued to fall  The latest reading on September 18 was 3 2   down from 3 4  on September 12 and 3 6  on September 4  Falling macro growth expectations will eventually translate to a loss of EPS momentum  While bottom up estimates remain relatively upbeat right now  investors should be prepared for downgrades in the near future as growth headwinds intensify  Another headwind for SPX EPS comes from a combination of slowing foreign growth  whose risks I detailed above  and the surging USD  Large cap S P 500 companies derive roughly 40  of their sales from foreign sources and a rising greenback  If this remains unhedged  it would cut into earnings translated back into USD  Under that scenario  large cap and small cap EBIT margins could converge  from my previous post   
While the characteristics of US large and small capitalization stocks are not directly comparable  this chart from UBS shows the differential in EBIT margins between the two  Should foreign growth start to slow  large and small cap EBIT margins will likely start to converge  with large cap margins falling toward their small cap counterparts for cyclical reasons 

Should we start to see an operating margin squeeze because of a weakening economic cycle  large caps will likely see a double whammy of reduced risk appetite  which would then see PE ratios compress 
For another perspective  see this  showing the concerns of the effects of greenback strength on Consumer Discretionary stocks like Nike  NYSE NKE  
Risk appetite is falling
The combination of heightened valuation  crowded long positions in selected risky assets and falling growth expectations are negative for the stock market outlook  Indeed  my Risk Appetite Index  which consists of long positions in the high beta NASDAQ 100  via PowerShares QQQ ETF  NASDAQ QQQ     and the Russell 2000  via iShares Russell 2000 Index  ARCA IWM   and short positions in Consumer Staples  via SPDR   Consumer Staples  ARCA XLP    Utilities  via SPDR Select Sector   Utilities  NYSE XLU   and Telecom  via iShares US Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ    is starting to falter 

 The BoAML Fund Manager Survey shows another point of US equity market vulnerability  Institutions are overweight high beta sectors and underweight defensive low beta sectors  Should the environment change from risk on to risk off  the adjustment could be violent and disorderly 
 

When I put it all together  the weight of the evidence suggests that equities are poised for a pullback of unknown duration and magnitude  However  bulls can be consoled by the fact that there is no recession in sight and therefore the risk of a major bear market is minimal 
Prepare for a pullback
Last week  I wrote that my Trend Model was turning tactically bearish  see   but equities rallied on global news  However  it was an event laden week and traders had to be nimble  On Tuesday  I  that given the SPX was approaching a short term oversold condition  it may be time to  call an audible  and flatten short positions  follow me on Twitter at  humblestudent for real time updates  

As the market rallied on the FOMC and Scottish Referendum results  I turned more bearish with this  after the close on Thursday 

So where does that leave us 
My inner trader is bearishly positioned and believes that the market is poised for a pullback of unknown proportions  If recent history is any guide  the pullback is likely to be a mild hiccup of about 5   If equity market weakness materializes  my inner trader is watching how growth expectations evolve and how short term sentiment indicators develop  How serious will the downgrades be  Will the markets panic as they did recently  see sentiment comments in    which would be contrarian bullish  or will complacency set in  which would be bearish  My inner investor is not worried about minor market blips and he remains bullish as the long term US outlook remains positive  see Gene Epstein s column in  for a good summary   He is  however  watching carefully how growth expectations evolve  If they were to decline significantly  it would be a sign to de risk his portfolio Disclosure  Long SPXU  TZA

191962,413478,NKE,Nike Stock Poised To Impress Long Term Investors,opinion,"If there s been a rotation into safer  more reasonably priced stocks  the trend can also reverse itself when the market is ready 
Biotechnology stocks  initial public offerings  IPOs   and hyper priced technology issues were ripe for a sell off after such tremendous capital gains  A rotation isn t a breakdown in the longer term stock market trend  it s just a trade  and big investors wanted to book some profits 
Now some very good companies are more attractively priced  and there could very well be some decent buys if the broader stock market s current fundamentals aren t hit by some external shock 
The action in this market is choppy  and it s the lull between earnings seasons  The lack of corporate reporting often makes for tough trading in stocks 
One company that I like for long term investors  however  has come off its high by about 10   The stock I m talking about is NIKE  Inc   NYSE NKE   
NIKE has a long track record of relatively consistent wealth creation for shareholders  and the company pays a dividend  Its current yield is approximately 1 3  
According to history  this position has proven to be a good buy when it s down  According to management  its business prospects for the rest of the year are solid  The company s long term stock chart is featured below 

Chart courtesy of 
Wall Street firms have been increasing their earnings estimates for NIKE going into 2015 
The company s most recent quarter  ended February 28  2014  was a good one  Total sales grew 13  to  6 97 billion  while diluted earnings per share from continuing operations grew four percent to  0 76 
Global footwear sales provided the biggest quarterly gain  jumping 15  above the same quarter in 2013  This was followed by a 10  gain in apparel   Converse  branded footwear sales grew 16  during the quarter to  420 million 
NIKE has always reported what it refers to as  futures orders   This isn t a firm prediction from the company on what sales will turn out to be  but it is a guide 
The company reported that futures orders for branded footwear and apparel  which are to be delivered from March 2014 through July 2014  should come to  10 9 billion  which represents a 12  gain over the prior year period 
And excluding the impact of currencies  futures orders are up 14  in a combination of stronger unit orders and higher average selling prices 
In January  the company began paying out a higher quarterly dividend of  0 24 per share  up from the previous quarterly payout of  0 21 per share  The company needs another dividend increase in its new fiscal year and can certainly afford it  as its cash position is strong 
NIKE is a mature enterprise  but it s still able to generate double digit growth  and with the position down from its high  it may be coming into the  buy  zone for long term investors  
Stocks  along with sentiment  continue to be trendless in a market still trying to digest last year s capital gains 
The current environment is a great time to be researching new quality investment positions  I view NIKE as one of them  The company should finish off its current fiscal year with a very good quarter

191963,413479,NKE,Will World Cup Fever Fuel Nike Earnings ,opinion,"Nike Inc   NYSE NKE  is set to report FQ4 2014 earnings after the market closes on Thursday  June 26th  Nike is one of the most iconic sports gear and athletic wear brands on the planet  The famous sports wear brand may not be an official sponsor of the World Cup  but Nike is still hoping the buzz in Brazil will drive higher sales  One of Nike s main competitors  Adidas  spent an estimated  100 million to use the official World Cup logo in its commercials  
Nike may not be using the official FIFA World Cup emblem in its ads  but that s not stopping the company from advertising its soccer products heavily through commercials featuring some of the most popular players on the planet including Neymar and Cristiano Ronaldo  This quarter Wall Street expects Nike s earnings to remain flat compared to last year while sales increase by nearly 10  on a year over year basis  However investors are expecting Nike to outperform Wall Street s expectations on Thursday afternoon 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Nike to report 76c EPS and  7 346B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 41 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 78c EPS and  7 411B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Nike to beat the Wall Street consensus on the top and bottom line by a moderate margin 
Over the previous 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting Nike s EPS and revenue 5 times and once respectively  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time 
More importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  Here we are seeing a moderate to large differential between the two groups  expectations compared to previous quarters 

The distribution of earnings estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 68c to 85c per share and from  7 266B to  7 600B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a relatively wide range of estimates on Nike s EPS compared to previous quarters 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wide range of earnings estimates signals less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings 

Over the past 3 months the Wall Street consensus fell from  1 03 to 95c while the Estimize consensus declined from 98c to 95c  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue forecast sank from  7 521B to  7 346B while the Estimize sales consensus dropped from  7 528B to  7 411B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and the directionality of analyst revisions at the end of the quarter are often a leading indicator  In this case we see marginally increasing revenue estimates going into the report 

Among 46 analysts with at least 2 estimates scored on Nike  anmikyoso has been the most accurate with an average of 14 25 points per estimate  Points are scored by analysts for making estimates that are more accurate than the Wall Street consensus  anmikyoso is a student who is ranked 38th overall among over 4 550 contributing analysts  This season anmikyoso has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 82  and 55  of the time respectively throughout 11 estimates 

Last quarter Nike posted great results beating the Wall Street earnings consensus by 3c per share and  154 million in sales  This period the Estimize community is expecting another healthy report from Nike and predicting the sports gear and athletic wear company will beat the Wall Street forecast by a comfortable margin  
In calendar 2013 Nike reported  1 9 billion in soccer related sales  that number is expected to be boosted this year by World Cup hype especially between FQ4 14 and FQ1 15  While higher sales are predicted  advertising costs are expected to rise too as a result of the push to promote Nike products during the World Cup  On Thursday the bottom line will be the number to watch  but it s reasonable to expect that advertising costs will continue to pay off with elevated soccer sales into the next quarter as the world continues to watch the tournament in Brazil

191964,413480,NKE,How To Trade Nike After Today s Earnings,opinion,"Fourth quarter earnings of USD 0 75 per share likely
Revenue USD 7 34 billion
Stock consolidating multi year rally

The sports footwear and clothing company Nike  NYSE NKE  is set to report its fourth quarter earnings today after the close of trading  The stock also currently happens to sit at an interesting technical juncture on the charts  which could allow traders to take advantage of a post earnings move on Friday  Anytime a big name company s stock is in a technically sound position as earnings approach  i e  the news flow either matches up with or comes up against a technically sound picture of a stock  I sit up and take notice as it often spells opportunity 
Analysts  estimates are for Nike to post fourth quarter earnings per share of USD 0 75 on revenue of USD 7 34 billion Over the past week  as the earnings report approached  several analysts came out with updates on their views of Nike  On Monday  an analyst at Morgan Stanley reiterated his Overweight rating on Nike  with a USD 85 00 price target  It s also important to keep in mind that both the broader stock market as well as the consumer discretionary sector  to which Nike belongs  are still constructively positioned and defiant  This does not mean that should Nike report weak earnings a viable trade may not set up on the short side  it simply signifies that the path of least resistance remains higher  From a multi year perspective on the weekly chart  below  Nike stock has had a great run off its early 2009 lows  However  at the end of 2013  it began to run out of steam  The going thus far this year has been choppy for the stock  although the more nimble traders and investors had a couple of opportunities to play the stock both long and short  However  in the big picture  the stock is consolidating the multi year rally and is likely to need a better catalyst to move out of the blue box on the chart  below  That catalyst has the potential to be the earnings report that s on tap later today  Source  esignalOn the daily chart  note how the stock has narrowed its trading range in recent weeks and through a multi monthy lens  it is now at the tightest part of this range  just as earnings are set to be unveiled later today  One easy way to see how tight the stock s range has been is to look at how closely together the various daily moving averages are trading  Presently the 50  100 and 200 day simple moving averages  yellow  blue and red lines respectively  are very close together  which is the result of the 12 month consolidation zone that I drew in on the weekly chart above Game planWhatever the outcome of the earnings report  I am looking to hop on Nike stock for any follow through buying selling after the initial reaction I am looking to buy the stock on a push past USD 76 90 for a move into the USD 79   80 area  Alternatively  if the stock drops below USD 74 25  I would look to short the stock for a move into the low 70s   Source  esignalSerge Berger  an active trader since 1998  is a leading specialist in Trend Following

191965,413481,NKE,Nike  Potential Growth And Income,opinion,"There are some companies mature businesses with well known brands that continue to execute in a manner worthy of the finest growth stories 
While the stock market does its thing every day  I find that there are actually very few investment quality stocks that deliver respectable returns consistently over time 
The business cycle exists  and so does the enthusiasm that institutional investors have for particular companies 
One company that I continue to like for long term investors is NIKE  Inc   NYSE NKE   Here s the thing about this well known athletic footwear and apparel manufacturer the company just keeps on growing 
The fact of the matter is that the running shoe business is a good one  and solid management execution has allowed this company to deliver continued double digit comparable growth in a world where mature economies are barely growing at all 
NIKE is worthy of long term portfolios  The company pays a dividend with a current yield that is approximately 1 3  
The stock has been in consolidation for a good seven months  but it s performed incredibly well over the last 10 years and should continue to do so 
Once again  NIKE beat Wall Street consensus and the stock jumped after it reported great 2014 fiscal fourth quarter and year end financial results 
Fourth quarter sales from continuing operations grew 11  to  7 4 billion  Currency neutral  the gain was more like 13  
NIKE owns the  Converse  brand  and its sales grew in the double digits to  410 million  NIKE branded products experienced gains in all geographic regions except Japan  where sales were flat on a comparable basis 
The company s gross margin expanded due to higher average selling prices and more direct to consumer sales 
Bottom line earnings grew only one percent to  698 million  but three percent on a diluted basis to  0 78 a share 
During its fiscal fourth quarter  the company bought back 12 3 million of its own common shares  worth approximately  912 million 
Management initiated an  8 0 billion share repurchase program in September of 2012 and has so far spent  3 4 billion cancelling shares  According to the company  its average cost for these repurchases to date is  65 83 per share  The stock recently traded right around  80 00 and split two for one in December of 2012 
I like a large cap company that s a solid global brand and is still growing 
NIKE is experiencing top line growth  it pays a dividend  and it s buying back its own shares 
There are several other businesses that fall into the same kind of investment class of quality stocks like NIKE 
All equity securities are risky and the current environment actually is not the most opportune time to be a buyer for the simple reason that the good ones have already gone up 
But when great businesses like NIKE retreat on the stock market  I think they are attractive names for conservative equity investors who want growth  quality  capital preservation  and some income

191979,413495,NKE, The Morgans Hotel Group Fight  Part One ,opinion,Activist investors  or anyone invested in a fund  especially of the PE or VC variety  that follows an activist investing strategy  will want to review an April 2013 decision of the Delaware Chancery Court  one that seems to strengthen your position  The opinion begins from a common situation  an investment fund has decided that Corporation XYZ has promising assets  but is employing them in a strategically ineffective manner  Thus  the investment group manages to get one but only one director on the Board of XYZ who espouses its own alternative strategy   dissident director  in the usual parlance The holding in Kalisman v  Friedman says that there are limits to what the majority of the board can do to keep its dissident isolated and in the dark The SpecificsIn this case  the activist investor was OTK Associates LLC  Jason Kalisman  one of the founding members of OTK  was the dissident director on the board of Morgans Hotel Group  The other members of that board  including Robert Friedman  were the defendants in this action In December 2011  the board of Morgans created a special committee to evaluate strategic alternatives  Both Friedman and Kalisman were on that committee  Kalisman says that the special committee developed options for Morgans  but that by November 2012 the process had stalled In March 18  2013  OTK in effect decided to jumpstart that review by announcing that it would nominate candidates for election to the board at the May annual meeting  Its slate would include six candidates in addition to Kalisman  whom OTK supported for re election After that  the other members of the board began to work on a strategic alternative of their own  keeping Kalisman in the dark  The other directors were working out a recap deal with the Yucaipa Companies LLC  the L A  based holding company founded by Ronald Burkle On March 29  Kalisman received an email from the company counsel informing him that a special meeting of the board was to take place the following day to review and approve the recapitalization The meeting took place  and Kalisman objected to the adequacy of notice  The board voted in favor of the Yucaipa deal  with only the one negative vote  On April 1  it announced the recapitalization to the world  along with a postponement of the annual meeting  The meeting  previously scheduled for May 15th  was pushed back to July 10th  with a record date of May 29 Kalisman filed his complaint that same day  April 1  He challenged the postponement of the annual meeting as well as the completion of the capitalization Court s RulingOn April 17  the court ruled on a motion by plaintiff Kalisman asking to compel discovery of a lot of information  including communications between the other board members and company lawyers during the critical period when those other directors were making their deal with Yucaipa The court granted his motion  There were some caveats  but in essence it gave him what he wanted and lectured his colleagues on the board on how neither attorney client privilege nor the work product rule should keep him from those documents The defendants had argued that they couldn t give the information to Kalisman  because he would share it with OTK to the detriment of the corporation  The court responded to this line of argument in several ways  First  there was no evidence that Kalisman would use privileged information improperly  and the court would not presume that he would Second  the court said that it isn t necessarily clear that giving it to OTK  the owner of a substantial block of shares after all  would be improper   When a director serves as the designee of a stockholder on the board  and when it is understood that the director acts as the stockholder s representative  then the stockholder is generally entitled to the same information as the director  Third  though  argument about the consequences of giving information to OTK is  not yet ripe  because Kalisman has undertaken not to share privileged information with OTK  and has even proposed a three tiered confidentiality order that would allow for discovery of certain  Kalisman only  information The Bottom LineThe bottom line for the court is that a director s right to information is  essentially unfettered in nature   Nobody gets to pick and choose which directors are given which data The bottom line for activist investors is that a foot in the door is a very good thing  There is a vast difference between between having one friendly director and having none Those lessons will remain valid whatever else happens in the ongoing tug of war between Yucaipa and OTK over Morgans  Much more has happened since this mid April decision  and I hope to describe the later twists and turns shortly ,2013-07-11,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-morgans-hotel-group-fight:-part-one-175064,175064
191980,413496,NKE,The Morgans Hotel Group Fight  Part Two ,opinion,We recently discussed an important decision by the Delaware Chancery Court arising out of a proxy fight over the future of the Morgans Hotel Group  NASDAQ  MHGC   an international hospitality concern headquartered in New York and incorporated in Delaware  One of MHGC s core properties is the Delano South Beach  in Miami  Florida  portrayed To review  that decision  in mid April of this year  allowed a plaintiff dissident director to proceed with sweeping discovery  on the grounds that a director s access to information is  essentially unfettered  Although that finding is itself important  it was only part of an ongoing dispute between two alpha seekers  Yucaipa and OTK Associate over the future of the hotel group  OTK Associates  an investment vehicle for the Olshan and Taubman real estate families  owns nearly 14  of Morgans  Yucaipa owns all of Morgans  preferred stock  over half of its convertible notes and has warrants for 12 5 million shares of common stock  Its principal  Ron Burkle  also has  common  stockholdings in Morgans personally  So this is a struggle between the largest financial  stakeholder  in an expanded sense   and the largest stockholder The Story ContinuesIn May  the court gave OTK another victory  Vice Chancellor J  Travis Lasker granted an injunction that accepted the plaintiffs  assertions that the deliberative process had been skewed in Yucaipa s favor  Lasker prohibited Morgans from proceeding with a deal it had made with Burkle until it underwent the approval process once more  doing things right the second time  properly noticed meeting  due deliberations  etc  In effect  though  the injunction punted a final decision of the restructuring until after the outcome of the next shareholder meeting In mid June  OTK   which is headquartered in Bloomfield Hills  Michigan   won the proxy fight which culminated with that meeting  and installed six new board nominees of its choice  and re elected that formerly solitary dissident   OTK had publicly taken a position opposed to the transactions contemplated in a March 30  2013 exchange agreement between Morgans and Yucaipa  so it is unsurprising that Yucaipa immediately sent MHGC a letter asking whether it still planned to consummate the transactions to which it had said it was committed back in March  when all the other directors were keeping lonely Kalisman in the dark There was no immediate response  and on June 27  the Yucaipa parties sent another letter saying the deal was cancelled and it would pursue remedies On that same day  June 27  came the lawsuit in New York state court  in which Yucaipa demands a  9 million termination fee  and another  1 million or related costs  Four days later came the suit  with Burkle himself as named plaintiff  in the U S  district court for the southern district of New York Here s the TwistThis federal lawsuit accuses OTK of deceiving the shareholders by misrepresenting the recommendations of two shareholder advisory services  Why is that extraordinary  Because it takes aim at such a ubiquitous target  The two firms involved  ISS and Glass Lewis  seem to be cited in all proxy fights above a certain threshold of visibility  Further  their opinions often have an element of ambiguity to them  and each side in the proxy fight issues a statement playing up the elements of the ISS Glass Lewis report that suits them  None of this is new The spin doctoring arose from an ambivalent stance  Both agencies advocated a somewhat qualified support for OTK by the other stockholders  neither had expected or advocated the sweeping victory that OTK in fact received The true facts of the matter were widely reported  Indeed  OTK s own press release and SEC filing states the facts accurately  There was also some peripheral spinning in its language  but it is difficult to believe that it affected the outcome of the vote ISS and Glass Lewis each backed three of the seven OTK nominees  Both backed Jason Kalisman for re election to the board  Both also backed Mahmood Khimji  ISS backed Jonathan Langer  although here they parted ways  Glass Lewis didn t support Langer  The third OTK nominee to receive its endorsement was John Dougherty Anyway  the two agencies did give a boost to the OTK campaign  they were hardly a vote of confidence in the not Kalisman incumbents Burkle s legal argument is surprising  unless one takes it in the spirit of  throw it against a wall and hope it sticks  ,2013-07-14,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-morgans-hotel-group-fight:-part-two-175345,175345

At 12 47ET  16 47GMT   the Dow Jones gained 113 points  or 0 63   while the S P 500 rose 11 points  or 0 50   and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite traded up 39 points  or 0 81  
U S  consumer confidence hit more than a nine year high in September  buoying optimism in the health of the American economy and driving equities to intraday highs 
In a report  the Conference Board  a market research group  said its index of consumer confidence unexpectedly increased to 104 1 this month from a reading of 101 8 in August  whose figure was revised from a previously reported 101 1 
That was its highest level since August 2007 and surprised analysts who were expecting the index to dip 99 0 in September 
In other positive economic data  activity in the U S  services sector rose more than expected in September  according to preliminary data from market research group Markit 
However  Markit chief economist Chris Williamson warned that reading still reflected subdued growth and pointed to an increase of just 1  in gross domestic product for the third quarter 
On the downside  the S P CaseShiller house price index rose just below expectations in July while data from the Richmond Fed showed that manufacturing activity in the 5th Fed district remained soft while its employment index hit a 36 month low 
Ahead of Federal Reserve  Fed  chair Janet Yellen s testimony to the House of Representatives on Wednesday  the U S  central bank s vice chairman Stanley Fischer delivered a speech to would be economists at Howard University but steered clear of any mention of monetary policy 
Markets were still placing bets for the Fed to return to policy normalization in December  according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool 
Meanwhile  oil was taking a beating on Tuesday  plunging more than 3  as both Saudi Arabia and Iran assured markets that there were no hopes of a deal to freeze output at the following day s widely anticipated meeting 
Adding to the bearish sentiment  the International Energy Agency  IEA  underlined concern about the global supply glut  saying that it doesn t expect an oil market rebalancing until  late 2017  
That was slightly more bearish than a previous call that saw output outpacing demand  at least through the first half of next year

191995,413511,NKE,Gold Bear Market Or Physical Gold Discount Sale  ,opinion,Back in 1980  just as the Gold Price blasted upwards past  800 oz  buyers reportedly lined up in droves at various bullion dealers to participate in the rally    Investment analyst Jay Taylor writes   I remember 1980  there was panic buying of gold by people in the streets of New York City  They were lined up around the block to buy gold and Krugerrands at that time   That flurry of buying ended up representing a classic top  As gold failed to move higher  the speculative frenzy soon reversed into a despondency that dragged gold into a twenty year bear cycle  For those investors who bought at the top  it was a hard lesson learned   Fast forward to today  and in the days that have followed this past Friday s  and Monday s  incredible gold price smash  the strangest thing has happened  physical buyers have come out in droves  but this time they re buying immediately following an unprecedented  200 price decline   Consider the following   The U S  Mint reported selling 63 500 ounces  2 tonnes  of gold on April 17 alone  which brought total April month to date sales up to 147 000 ounces   more than the previous two months of gold sales combined  The U S  Mint s year to date sales are now up 79  from the same period in 2012   Coin dealers in Tokyo and Dubai reported an immediate spike in sales following the gold smash this past Friday  Reuters writes   A week ago  as the yen denominated price neared a new peak  jewelry stores and gold merchants across Japan saw long lines of mostly older Japanese looking to cash in on unwanted jewelry and other items that they had held for years  But on Tuesday  buyers outnumbered sellers by a wide margin  At Ginza Tanaka  the headquarters shop of Tanaka Holdings  gold buyers waited for as long as three hours for a chance to complete a transaction    In Dubai  jewelry outlets reported they are now temporarily out of gold coins and all sizes of gold gram  biscuits    In India  retailers also saw an immediate surge in demand following the price decline  prompting some retailers to predict up to a 50 percent spike in sales volume in the upcoming wedding season The Wall Street Journal quoted a jewelry salesman in Mumbai s Zaveri Bazar  who stated   We have not seen such strong demand in many years  Our order books are already 30  40  more than last year s festival day  we don t have enough staff to keep up with this kind of mad demand    We have also seen the same reports coming from the Perth Mint in Australia and even here in Toronto  where the line up at Scotia Mocatta s bullion desk numbered more than one hundred long on Wednesday  A colleague confirmed that virtually all participants where there to buy more bullion  rather than to sell   This phenomenon clearly appears to be happening globally  A friend of the firm had this to report from Hong Kong   Went to Hang Seng bullion counter yesterday  The line was out the door  It took an hour wait to see a teller  When I asked if people were buying in the dip or selling in panic  she told me that they haven t had once ounce of gold sold back to them all day  She told me they have sold more gold in 24 hours than they normally do in three months  Yes  there was a lot of extra security  The guy in front of me bought over  1 million USD in gold  He paid in cash and walked out of the door with the bullion in a Nike bag  Amazing    This kind of buying frenzy defies the traditional rules of investor psychology  After two days of what looked like outright panic selling from precious metals futures participants and ETF holders  we wouldn t expect to see such a massive surge in physical bullion demand from individuals across the world  When gold fell precipitously in 2008  there was no such reaction   All we can conclude is this  There is definitely a striking psychological disconnect growing between the buyers of physical gold and silver  and the financial community that trades precious metals through ETF s and futures contracts  Certainly we wouldn t expect individuals to be buying these metals if they believed the price was going to drop further  or perhaps they don t care either way and simply want to own something tangible  Nonetheless  it is a wholly peculiar phenomenon  and it is definitely not the same investment behavior we have seen before   We still don t know what entity chose to crush the gold price with a 400 tonne sell order last Friday  Certainly no rational group would dump that much paper gold on the market without a pre established desire to torpedo the gold price  Their efforts clearly worked in the short term  but the reaction from physical buyers strongly indicates an official bifurcation between physical metals investors  and the exchange oriented investors who trade gold through financial products  The days to come will prove if this surge in physical Gold demand is an aberration  or the beginning of a new chapter for the physical gold market   If it represents the latter  precious metals investors may be wise to ignore the  paper  price of gold altogether  The line ups in 1980 represented the top

192006,413522,NKE,U S  stock futures higher after debate night  OPEC and Nike in focus,news,"Investing com   Wall Street futures pointed to a flat to higher open on Tuesday as investors digested the presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump  kept an eye on developments in oil ahead of Wednesday s meeting and waited for Nike s earning report 
The blue chip Dow futures gained 44 points  or 0 24   by 7 05AM ET  11 05AM GMT   the S P 500 futures rose 6 points  or 0 29   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 14 points  or 0 28  
Although the U S  stock futures turned higher at the conclusion of the event  the rally began to ebb throughout Tuesday  with the Dow futures off highs seen immediately following the televised event 
Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton appeared to have edged out her Republican opponent Donald Trump in the first presidential debate  based on analysts  take on the market reaction 
Online betting companies shortened the odds on a Clinton win in the wake of the Monday night debate  leaving her as the clear favorite among bettors 
Several analysts pointed to the 2  surge in the Mexican peso as evidence of the fact that markets seemed to interpret a victory for the Democratic nominee 
The peso is considered a market barometer of the U S  presidential election due to its close trade ties with the U S  and the fact that Trump has indicated a willingness to cut ties with its neighbor  threatening Mexico s exports to the U S   its single biggest market 
Other experts pointed to the fact that U S  stock futures turned higher after the debate and suggested that Clinton was seen as keeping the status quo  while markets were concerned about the uncertainty surrounding how Trump would deal with foreign trade 
Recent polls have shown a tightening race with just around six weeks to go until the November 8 election  The next presidential debate is scheduled for October 9  with the third and final clash set for October 19 
Also in focus  oil prices were under pressure early Tuesday after Saudi Arabia appeared to play down expectations for any supply policy decision during Wednesday s meeting 
Saudi Arabia s Energy Minister Khalid al Falih said on Tuesday that talks among OPEC and non OPEC oil producers in Algiers this week are consultative  casting doubt on the chances of any policy decision during the meeting  His comments follow similar remarks from Iran s oil minister on Monday 
Though several major oil producers had recently talked up the possibility of reaching at least an initial agreement on Wednesday  experts were skeptical that concrete steps would be taken to curb production in the short term 
Along the same lines  the International Energy Agency  IEA  underlined concern about the global supply glut  saying that it doesn t expect an oil market rebalancing until  late 2017  
That was slightly more bearish than a previous call that saw output outpacing demand  at least through the first half of next year  
U S  crude futures tumbled 1 52  to  45 23 by 7 07AM ET  11 07AM GMT   while Brent oil slumped 1 67  to  47 12

192012,413528,NKE,Sponsors missing from action in war on doping  whistleblower,news,"By Mitch Phillips RIO DE JANEIRO  Reuters    Doping in athletics could be slashed overnight if sponsors showed any will to eradicate it  according to Steve Magness  the coach who blew the whistle on an elite Nike sponsored athletics program but now feels like a pariah in the sport as a result  Doping scandals have torn athletics asunder over the last two years  and are souring the mood at the Rio Games where some competitors have been loudly booed  but Magness says there is an easy way to make an immediate sea change   I guarantee that if the sponsors said  hey  we want to clean up the sport   you could get rid of 70 80 percent of the problem right there   he told Reuters in a telephone interview   If sponsors said  we are never going to support anyone who tests positive  never supporting coaches who have or have had athletes who take drugs  never supporting agents who have supported drugged athletes     They could snap their fingers and that would eliminate a huge part of the problem   Magness says  Nike   NYSE NKE  in particular can make a big impact as the dominant sponsor of U S  athletics  by refusing to support athletes who have ever tested positive  He criticized its backing of 2004 Olympic 100 meters champion Justin Gatlin  who has twice been banned for doping and will line up at Rio  Nike declined to comment for this article  The company has shown some sensitivity to doping among those it sponsors  It initially suspended its deal with Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova in March after she tested positive for meldonium  which she said she used to treat diabetes  Tennis authorities banned her for two years in June  though it ruled the doping was accidental  Nike has resumed her sponsorship  Nike is also not alone in sponsoring athletes who have had positive doping tests  depending on the circumstances  The company has a unique role in U S  athletics that goes well beyond regular sports marketing  It funds the nation s most elite training center  in Portland  Oregon  under a  460 million 26 year sponsorship deal with US Track and Field  FEELING LIKE A PARIAH Magness was a leading coach and sports science expert for the Nike Oregon Project  NOP   a camp designed primarily to develop U S  endurance athletes  The group boasts American Olympic silver medalist Galen Rupp and Britain s multiple world and Olympic champion Mo Farah among its members  Magness said he left the role in 2012 by mutual consent  In June 2015  he accused NOP s lead coach and former multi marathon champion  Alberto Salazar  of violating anti doping rules and encouraging the use of legal medications for the treatment of asthma and thyroid conditions to gain a performance advantage  Salazar presented an 11 700 word response  addressing many of the issues and questioning Magness s motives  Rupp and Farah have denied taking performance enhancing drugs   I will never permit doping  Oregon Project athletes must fully comply with the WADA Code and IAAF Rules   Salazar wrote  referring to the World Anti Doping Agency and the International Association of Athletics Federations  The U S  Anti Doping Agency has been investigating the allegations against Salazar but has yet to release a finding  Last year  when approached about the issue  Nike issued a statement saying   We take the allegations very seriously as Nike does not condone the use of performance enhancing drugs in any manner  Both Alberto and Galen have made their perspectives clear and fully refute the allegations made against them   Magness said he had become an outcast from U S  athletics since speaking out  once receiving abuse from fans on a visit to Eugene  Oregon  the self styled  TrackTown  that was awarded hosting rights for the 2021 athletics world championships   I ve kind of become a pariah for speaking out   he said   The first time I went to Eugene after the piece came out  numerous fans came up saying things like  why are you lying     why are you trying to ruin the sport    etc     I will never be able to coach any athlete who gets a Nike sponsorship and any athlete I coach will probably never get a Nike sponsorship   he said  Nike did not respond when asked to for comment on these allegations  Adidas  the other major sponsor in track and field  ended its sponsorship of American Tyson Gay  in Rio for the sprint relay  and Briton Dwain Chambers after their positive tests    Each of the agreements with our athletes include a clear clause which states that the agreement shall be terminated if the athlete is found guilty of the possession or use of drugs   an Adidas  DE ADSGN  spokesman said  Asked about media reports that it planned to pull its long term multi million dollar sponsorship deal with the IAAF due to doping concerns  Adidas said it was monitoring the situation  IAAF President Sebastian Coe  speaking in Rio ahead of the start of the athletics program on Friday  said he understood those concerns but was confident they had been addressed

think there is a lot of opportunity and the best is yet to come    BIG WORLD OUT THERE  The NBA first cast an eye beyond U S  borders in 1978 when the now defunct Washington Bullets went to Israel to play Maccabi Tel Aviv  NBA teams have since played a combined 161 games in 45 cities and 20 countries all over the world  Long before India s name is added to that growing list of countries to host an NBA game   and there are currently no concrete plans   the league will have laid a solid foundation for its arrival on the subcontinent  What was once a labor intensive promotional effort has been overtaken by a viral volcano of tweets  videos and chatrooms with the NBA boasting that it has surpassed 1 billion followers on social media   The U S  together with Canada is roughly five percent of the global population  So there s a big world out there and they all seem to be following us on social media   said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver   Social media is the perfect example of the kind of following we can quickly generate in markets where we ve never played games   So I m sure India is a market that we re going to be spending increasing amounts of time on developing our game   While the NBA has established a solid social media presence the footwear companies have provided the boots on ground with  Nike   NYSE NKE   Adidas  DE ADSGN   Reebok and Under Armour leading the charge in into vast new markets  Kobe Bryant  LeBron James and Stephen Curry have provided the marketing muscle for the footwear giants on which the NBA has piggybacked   Nike  Under Armour and Adidas had huge businesses in China and have done a great job in bringing players over there and exposing them in ways that frankly we would not be able to do   said LaRocca   Kobe  Bryant  has been there  China  many times with Nike  Steph Curry has been there many times with Under Armour so our partnerships  our relationships with those footwear companies they really amplify our on the ground efforts to grow the sport   UNEARTH HIDDEN GEM Today the hoop dreams of kid growing up in Shanghai are no different to a kid in Compton    to play in the NBA  The search for talent is worldwide  Basketball Without Borders brought 52 high school aged players from 27 countries across Africa  the Americas  Asia and Europe to the NBA All Star Game to give them exposure to scouts  Toronto Raptors general manager Masai Ujiri has his own initiative called  Giants of Africa  to help children through sport and perhaps unearth a hidden gem  This season  opening night rosters in the NBA featured 100 international players from 37 countries and territories  All 30 teams feature at least one international player  None were from India or China  but that is expected to change  Yao Ming  who retired in 2011  was a transcendent star who cemented the NBA s place on the Chinese sporting landscape  Now India is looking for its Yao  The NBA has an Indian owner in Sacramento Kings Vivek Ranadive  who was born in Mumbai  but the player to galvanize a fan base has yet to arrive  Last year Satnam Singh Bhamara  the son of a farmer  became the first Indian to be drafted into the NBA when the Dallas Mavericks used the 52nd pick on the 7 foot 2 inch center  
 In our experience the most direct way that we can grow fan bases around the world is if there is a player that fan base can attach itself to   said LaRocca   We have seen that in Spain with the Gasol brothers  in France with Tony Parker and Germany with Dirk  Nowitzki   ",2016-03-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/nba-sets-sights-squarely-on-india-as-its-new-frontier-390545,390545

Sharapova on Tuesday  the latest sponsor after  Nike  and Porsche to distance itself from the world s highest paid female athlete following her failed drug test  The swift response on the heels of Sharapova s announcement on Monday signaled a change in attitude among high profile corporate backers following a series of doping and corruption scandals in world sports   We re now entering a zero tolerance era for sponsors   said Rupert Pratt  co founder of sports sponsorship agency Generate   It is now seen as not acceptable to  stand by your man  because of the amount of scrutiny corporates are now under   Sharapova s failed drug test at January s Australian Open  one of four annual Grand Slam events  will likely lead to a ban for the 28 year old Russian  The International Tennis Federation s anti doping program calls for a four year suspension for a positive test  That ban can be reduced in various circumstances  such as if the player shows no significant fault or negligence  Loss of sponsor income would be costly for Sharapova  a five time Grand Slam winner who earned  29 7 million last year  according to Forbes magazine  most of it from endorsements  appearances and royalties rather than victories on court   Sharapova  who lit up women s tennis when she won Wimbledon in 2004 as a 17 year old  is still ranked among the top players  She was the world s highest paid female athlete last year for the 11th consecutive year  and Forbes put her off court career earnings at more than  200 million  Fellow athletes had mixed reactions to Sharapova s announcement that she had tested positive for meldonium  a drug she said she had been taking for a decade to treat diabetes and low magnesium   The substance  recently banned by the World Anti Doping Agency  WADA   boosts blood flow and can enhance athletic performance  Sharapova  who lives in the United States  is at least the seventh athlete in a month to test positive for meldonium  It is widely available in Eastern Europe but not approved for use in the United States   She s ready to take full responsibility and I think that showed a lot of courage and a lot of heart   Serena Williams  the top ranked player in women s tennis  told reporters at a briefing ahead of a game in New York on Tuesday  Others were not so sympathetic   I m extremely angry and disappointed  I had to lose my career and never opted to cheat no matter what   tweeted former world No  1 Jennifer Capriati  in a long series of posts attacking Sharapova   Aries Merritt  a U S  hurdler  said there was no excuse for Sharapova to be unaware that WADA added meldonium to its latest list of banned drugs effective Jan  1  which it circulated to competitors   As an athlete it is your responsibility to always know what s being placed on the banned list  Period   said Merritt at the U S  Olympic Committee summit in Los Angeles  Former U S  Olympic swimmer Aaron Peirsol told Reuters there was some confusion over meldonium   It wasn t even anything that was illegal until the beginning of this year   he said   You have a bunch of people taking stuff that the athletes probably don t even know  is illegal     it becomes gray   Sharapova said she had not read an email informing her that meldonium was banned for use in sport  She will be provisionally suspended from playing tennis from March 12 and could be prevented from competing for Russia at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics this year  SOME SPONSORS ON THE FENCE  Sharapova s deal with Tag Heuer  owned by French luxury goods group LVMH  PA LVMH   expired at the end of 2015  and the company said on Tuesday it had dropped renewal talks in view of her announcement  Nike Inc  N NKE   the world s biggest sportswear brand  and German luxury car maker Porsche  a unit of Volkswagen AG

encouraged that none of the sponsors so far have said they were terminating contracts with the player  although they had the right to do so    Suspension means to put on hold   the source said  requesting anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the situation   Under the circumstances we re very pleased that everybody is willing to stand by and see what facts come out instead of terminating    Danone  SA  PA DANO   the maker of Evian water  a longtime Sharapova sponsor  said on Tuesday it would monitor developments   Avon Products  Inc  N AVP   another sponsor  declined to comment on its endorsements  Brian Socolow  an expert in sports law and a partner at Loeb   Loeb LLP  said Nike s quick suspension was no surprise after its long support for now disgraced U S  cyclist Lance Armstrong  But he said Sharapova may yet win back sponsors   She has the chance  like other athletes  to redeem herself and regain her leadership position as an endorser   said Socolow   She will have to demonstrate that it was an honest mistake and there are no other improper reasons she took the drug   There was some scepticism about the sponsors  motives from tennis fans on social

192098,413614,NKE,China s supply side slogan means different things to different people,news,By Sue Lin Wong BEIJING  Reuters    To some it means upgrading China s ubiquitous hole in the wall noodle shops  to others it is manufacturing high tech toilet seats   Supply side reform  is the buzz phrase at China s annual parliament in Beijing  picking up on an expression introduced by President Xi Jinping in speeches late last year  Analysts say it refers to the scaling back of the role of government in business to allow market forces greater room to flourish  such as through the restructuring of state owned companies  But its exact meaning has been left vague  giving room for the thousands of delegates at parliament to come up with their own interpretations  raising the risk of wasteful spending by provincial governments and underlining the difficult task Beijing has in clearly communicating its policies to local governments across the country   I think that s always been an issue in China  It s such a big country with so many layers of government   it s a challenge to push the message forward to a local level and make sure implementation is done properly   said Julian Evans Pritchard  China economist at Capital Economics in Singapore  So called supply side reform in the impoverished province of Gansu in northwestern China means officials are pushing hole in the wall vendors of the province s famous Lanzhou beef noodles to invest more in interior design and  connect to the internet  so they can charge more  the official news agency Xinhua reported last week  The noodle shops can become  like KFC and other western fast foods   Xinhua said  Many officials at soporific delegate meetings said one version of supply side reform should be getting Chinese manufacturers to reproduce the popular high tech toilets that Chinese consumers are snapping up in Japan  Yet others say it as a license for companies to go on an overseas acquisition spree   What is supply side reform  Currently the global economy is struggling  lots of European brands are struggling  why don t we buy them   Yang Haiyang  an economics professor at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics  said at an alumni event in the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing in January   If Chinese people buy these brands  they turn into Chinese brands  Chanel  LV  Adidas  DE ADSGN    Nike   NYSE NKE    let s buy them all   Similarly  Lei Jun  chief executive of Xiaomi  China s second biggest smartphone vendor  told reporters on the sidelines of the opening of China s parliament last Saturday that supply side reform meant getting Chinese companies to make products that can compete with imported goods  Others have interpreted the term   which originated from an English phrase pioneered by former U S  President Ronald Reagan to refer to deregulation and tax cuts   as approval for price controls  Li Li  the head of the Health and Family Planning Commission of Jiangxi province  said controlling how quickly medical fees rise was a classic example of  supply side reform    That s not really the sort of supply side reforms the central leadership are talking about in the key reports they ve put out   said Evans Pritchard  noting Beijing is more focused on cutting back the role of government in business and greasing the wheels of capitalism  GOOD INTENTIONS Every year around 3 000 delegates from across China  representing more than 30 provinces  municipalities and autonomous regions  meet in Beijing for the National People s Congress  which lasts around 12 days  It is the one time of the year that the central government has all members of parliament together  so it is an important time for leaders to get their messages out  This would not be the first time a central government initiative intended to reform and upgrade the Chinese economy turned into over investment by local officials   China has been battling a glut in solar panels and wind turbines ever since businesses rushed in to take advantage of government subsidies and cheap bank loans after Beijing decided it wanted to be the global leader in renewable energy  China s government has said it will eliminate entrenched industrial overcapacity  make sure new industries get the capital they need and give freer rein to market forces  But the government has also said it will prevent mass layoffs  have a controlling hand in state owned enterprises and continue its accommodative monetary policy  The country aims to lay off 5 6 million state workers over the next two to three years as part of efforts to curb industrial overcapacity and pollution  sources have told Reuters  Nobody at the annual parliament meeting however  used  supply side reform  to refer to the need to lay off millions of workers in sunset industries  The breadth and vagueness of the term may also be seen by delegates  who are chosen for their loyalty to the party and their willingness to publicly praise government policy at the rubber stamp parliament  as a chance for them to showcase their own plans  To be sure  who is to say that local government interpretation of the phrase is wrong  said economist Dong Tao   Nobody has defined it   said Tao  who works for  Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  in Hong Kong   If we don t know exactly what  supply side economics  is  how can you say that local governments  definitions are wrong  ,2016-03-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/china's-supply-side-slogan-means-different-things-to-different-people-389656,389656

192125,413641,NKE,Exclusive  Hawkins and Sawiris forge investment partnership  with Adidas in sights,news,"By Sinead Cruise and Emma Thomasson LONDON BERLIN  Reuters    Egyptian tycoon Nassef Sawiris has formed a partnership with U S  investor Mason Hawkins and his colleagues at Southeastern Asset Management to drive change at companies they invest in   and they have sportswear firm Adidas  DE ADSGn  in their sights  The long term venture between Sawiris and fellow billionaire Hawkins  founder of the employee owned global investment firm  combines their personal wealth as well as cash from third party investors  according to a source familiar with the matter   The new entity   Southeastern Concentrated Value  SCV    plans to build stakes in up to 10 European companies it deems to be underperforming   to spur boardroom revamps and influence strategy  the source said  It could set its sights on Germany s Adidas  which has struggled to keep pace with bigger rival  Nike   N NKE  in recent years and is currently looking for a successor to veteran CEO Herbert Hainer  Sawiris is already independently invested in Adidas via NNS Holding  which owned 1 74 percent of the share capital as of October 30  according to Thomson Reuters data  and around 6 percent of voting rights via a number of options  Southeastern has publicly filed as holding over 3 percent of the company  The stakes were built up this year  A spokeswoman for Southeastern confirmed the existence of a partnership comprising Hawkins  Sawiris and some of its senior staff  but declined to comment further  Sawiris declined to comment  Sawiris  and Southeastern s interest in Adidas comes at a critical juncture for the Bavaria based company  The German dominated board is seeking a new boss who can help restore its fortunes in the U S  market  where sportswear trends are born   Many fund firms have demanded a greater say in how companies are run since the financial crisis  after clients accused them of charging high fees but failing to hold board members to account for weak strategy  poor profits or excessive pay   But investor led campaigns for change can be stymied by the varying requirements of their clients  in terms of how soon they expect to see returns  Fund firms must often sell shares to return capital to clients before long term change is fully implemented   SCV  which will be advised by Southeastern s London office  is expected to focus on six to 10 companies at any one time and its partners hope their long term collaborative approach will maximize shareholder influence  the source said   TEAMING UP Sawiris  the youngest scion of one of Egypt s richest families and Southeastern  the investment firm set up by Hawkins 40 years ago  have already cooperated as independent shareholders to significant effect at several large firms   These include U S  construction supplies firm Texas Industries and cement and aggregates firm LafargeHolcim  VX LHN    During the protracted merger of  Holcim  and  Lafarge   PA LAFP   Sawiris  with the support of major shareholders  including Southeastern  was instrumental in pushing for Lafarge management to retain positions of influence in the combined merger   The appointment of Lafarge veteran Eric Olsen  a dual French and American national as CEO  was welcomed by Southeastern  partly because it believed he had the necessary skills and cultural sensitivity to unite factions in both the Holcim and Lafarge camps   SCV s largest holding is in Swiss chemicals company Sika  VX SIK   the source said  without disclosing the actual size of the partnership s stake   According to public filings  Southeastern owns just under 4 percent of the company  and is supporting Sika s management and board in their opposition to the sale of the Burkhard family s 16 percent stake to France s Saint Gobain  PA SGOB  at an 80 percent premium without a concurrent offer to other shareholders   SCV is primarily focused on making sure the companies it backs have the best management and boards in place to deliver on operational strategy and intelligently allocate capital over the long term  the source said   This  the source added  sets it apart from activist investors  who often try to dictate company business or demand asset sales and mergers and acquisitions in the short term   ADIDAS CAMPAIGN  Both Sawiris and Southeastern have declined to comment on their objectives for Adidas  apart from saying that they are in  constructive  dialogue with management   Adidas declined to comment on Friday  but pointed to comments made by CEO Hainer last month when he said the company was open to listening to shareholders   Hainer s rule has been reined in by the arrival of new investors who the board cannot ignore   said Ingo Speich  fund manager at Union Investment  which owns a 0 75 percent stake  The firm already seems to be responding  Adidas said in August it was considering the possible sale of its golf brands  as demanded by some investors  It recently raised its full year outlook for sales and profits and said it should be able to repeat the performance next year   After underperforming Nike for the last two years  Adidas shares have soared in recent weeks and are up 57 percent this year  compared with a 34 percent rise for Nike   But they still trade at a 17 percent discount to the U S  firm  seen by analysts as justified given consistently lower profitability and growth   Adidas expects its sales to rise by almost half to above 22 billion euros by 2020  Nike said last month its sales to rise 63 percent to  50 billion by then  The Adidas board said in February it was looking for a successor to Hainer  who has been in office since 2001 and is the longest serving boss of a major listed German company  But it seems to be in little rush to end the uncertainty at the top  particularly as Hainer s contract runs until 2017  Global brand chief Eric Liedtke is seen as the top internal candidate  although some industry experts say the board is still looking seriously at external candidates  Henkel  DE HNKG p  boss Kasper Rorsted and Amer Sports chief Heikki Takala have been touted as possible candidates in media reports   We believe it should be an external candidate to break the Hainer system   said Speich  who has long been an outspoken critic of Hainer  Some investors want the new boss to focus on the Adidas brand  push ahead with a sale of the golf business and also consider a disposal of long struggling fitness label Reebok  acquired in 2005

CIUDAD DEL ESTE  Paraguay   A 28 year old vendor named Ever is slouched against his rack of shrink wrapped Adidas  DE ADSGN  and  Nike   N NKE  sneakers  Sales are abysmal  he says  standing under a tented corridor  one of many shopping venues in this sprawling border town  Other vendors sit idly at makeshift booths of T shirts  toys  perfume bottles and smartphone accessories  At indoor kiosks and nearby department stores  statues of Santa Claus and glittering elves greet a tiny trickle of customers 
In better years  droves of Brazilians streamed across the Paran  River into Ciudad del Este to purchase billions of dollars  worth of electronics and consumer goods  Paraguay s relatively low import tariffs and weak enforcement of customs duties    not to mention a flourishing black market    make the border zone an attractive stop for Brazilian business owners  bulk buyers and average families 
But with Brazil s economy slipping further into recession  fewer Brazilians are making the trek this year  Ever  who declined to give his full name because of the informal nature of his business  says 2015 was his worst in 10 years of selling shoes and apparel on the street   I m hoping things will pick up in December for Christmas   he says 

Brazil s economy shrank 1 7 percent in the July to September quarter    the third consecutive period of economic contraction for Latin America s largest economy  the national statistics institute reported Dec  1  Rising unemployment  double digit inflation and higher household debt are together draining consumer confidence and curbing family spending  Economists say they expect Brazil to shrink by 3 to 4 percent in the fourth quarter  landing the country in its worst recession since 1990 
 Brazil has been in a state of complete paralysis  Nothing is happening in the economy  everything is tanking   says Monica de Bolle  a Brazilian economist and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington  D C 
Brazil s fiscal fracas is compounded by the widespread corruption scandal unfurling in Brasilia  the capital city  An investigation into a multimillion dollar kickback scheme at the state run oil company Petrobras has ensnared dozens of business executives and politicians    including members of President Dilma Rousseff s Workers  Party    leaving the capital in political gridlock  On Dec  2  the speaker of Brazil s lower house of Congress launched a bid to impeach Rousseff  who was chairwoman of Petrobras during many of the years the alleged corruption took place 
Brazil s GDP Growth   FindTheData
 The government hasn t been able to advance any of the broader fiscal measures it needs   says Felipe Monteiro  an assistant professor of strategy at French business school Insead who is from Brazil   The perfect storm on the economic front is being aggravated by the political situation  
Amid all this chaos  Brazil s currency has plummeted against the U S  dollar  The real in September sank to as low as 4 0665 per dollar    its lowest intraday trading level since the currency was introduced in 1994    after Standard   Poor s cut Brazil s credit rating to junk status earlier that month  Bloomberg reported  The real has since recovered slightly  to 3 75 reais per dollar in early December 
For the vendors in Ciudad del Este  the troubles across the border are squeezing their sales in multiple ways 

Formal and informal markets here peg their products to the U S  dollar   A shopper can purchase goods with greenbacks  Brazilians reais  Paraguayan guaranies  or pesos from Argentina  which also shares a border with Paraguay   As the real slips and the dollar strengthens  buying a bootleg television or a pair of designer jeans is becoming prohibitively expensive for Brazilians 
Many visitors to Ciudad del Este also come to buy products to sell back in Brazil  in what s known as the reexport trade  Merchants in Paraguay import cigarettes  electronics  apparel and other consumer goods at low rates from the United States  Europe and China  then sell the items in bulk to Brazilian merchants  who would otherwise pay steep tariffs to import the goods in Brazil  The resellers either legally haul or illegally smuggle billions of dollars in goods across Brazil to urban centers like Rio de Janeiro or S o Paulo  But with household spending down and consumer confidence sinking  there s less demand for these reexported products  and thus little incentive to shop large in Ciudad del Este 
 All those factors are compounding   Monteiro says  Ciudad del Este s slumping sales  are a reflection of all those things going on at the same time  
 Vendors like Ever aren t the only Paraguayans feeling the pinch of Brazil s recession  Motorcycle taxi drivers say they too are whiling away the hours in Ciudad del Este  waiting for Brazilian shoppers to return  The motorcycles are a common way to cross the Brazil Paraguay border  the drivers often aren t stopped at the immigration or customs checks  especially if their passengers carry only a handful of purchases 
Two drivers  Marco  49  and Teodoro  35  say they used to spend all day zipping back and forth across the border  Wearing black vests with green reflective strips  they lean on the seats of their yellow two wheelers  Teodoro gestures toward the other drivers lounging under a taxi stand to illustrate how business is going   Look how it is  Nobody s coming to buy anything   he says 
 Business is about 50 percent lower than what it was   Marco adds   Two years ago  it was much better  
With little optimism on the horizon for Brazil  economists say they expect the crunch could persist into the next Christmas season   Household consumption has been falling consistently  in Brazil    de Bolle says   and I expect that to continue into 2016  ",2015-12-06,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/brazil's-recession-hits-neighbors-374691,374691

192189,413705,NKE,Exclusive  SEC launches civil probe into FIFA bribery case   source,news,"By Sarah N  Lynch WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  securities regulators are examining the behavior of several companies with links to FIFA or other soccer bodies caught up in a major corruption scandal to see if there were possible violations of U S  federal bribery laws  a person with knowledge of the matter said  The civil probe  which is in its early stages and may not lead to any findings of wrongdoing or enforcement action  is being conducted by the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission   It opens a new front in a wide ranging investigation by the U S  and Swiss authorities into bribery involving soccer officials  marketing executives and various companies  In late May  the U S  indicted nine soccer officials   most of whom held positions at FIFA   and five executives for a range of offences related to more than  150 million of alleged bribes and kickbacks  The SEC probe centers on publicly traded companies who have been involved in soccer contracts  such as athletic shoes and sportswear company  Nike  Inc  NYSE NKE   said the source  who asked not to be named because of the non public nature of the investigation  The exact scope of the probe and the names of other companies being scrutinized could not be learned  An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment  Although Nike has not been specifically named or charged with any wrongdoing  the company was swept into the scandal when U S  prosecutors in the indictment described bribes and kickbacks in connection with a landmark 1996 Nike deal in Brazil  The description of the  160 million  10 year deal signed by  Sportswear Company A  matched exactly the details of Nike s agreement to become the footwear and apparel supplier and sponsor of the Brazilian national team  which at that time was the most successful in the world  In a statement on Friday  a Nike spokesman said that the company  is committed to cooperating with any government investigation into the FIFA matter   In late May  Nike said that the government had not alleged that it violated the law or knowingly took part in a kickback scheme  DISGORGEMENT Securities experts say the SEC could potentially have a hook in the case through the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act  FCPA   an anti bribery law  The SEC and the U S  Department of Justice both have power to bring FCPA cases  with the SEC s jurisdiction centering on violations by public companies  The law s core anti bribery provisions only apply to payments to governments or government officials  The Brazilian Football Confederation  CBF   which signed the 1996 deal with Nike  is a private organization  But the law contains a corporate books and record keeping requirement that applies to other kinds of illicit payments   such as commercial bribery   that may not be related to government corruption   A provision of the FCPA prohibits companies from falsely recording bribe payments as legitimate business expenses        For example  if companies misrepresented bribes paid to soccer officials as marketing or other kinds of expenses in their books  it could be considered a violation of the law  lawyers said    Violations of this so called books and records provision can lead to fines and disgorgement of ill gotten gains  For SEC cases  it is not enough of a defense for a company to say it did know that any of its overseas units were involved in paying bribes    Nobody at the parent has to know that the transaction was a bribe and was misreported  only someone at the subsidiary has to know   said one attorney specializing in the FCPA  The attorney is not directly involved in the case but asked to remain anonymous to protect client relationships   With a bribe  you have to prove that the parent knew  With books and records  you just have to have a bad entry for the parent to be responsible   Nike is the only U S  public company to be referenced in the U S  indictment of the officials and executives  Major publicly traded companies in the U S  who are FIFA sponsors include McDonald s Corp   Visa Inc   NYSE V  and Coca Cola Co  On Friday  Coca Cola and McDonald s both added pressure on FIFA for reforms only days before its executive committee meets on Monday  The SEC has invoked the FCPA s books and records provision before to charge public companies for violations in connection with commercial bribery  Earlier this year  the agency brought civil FCPA charges against Goodyear Tire   Rubber Co  whose Kenya subsidiaries were accused of paying bribes to employees of government owned entities  as well as private companies  Goodyear agreed to pay more than  16 million to settle the charges without admitting or denying wrongdoing   In another case in 2013  the SEC and the Justice Department both filed parallel civil and criminal FCPA cases against ATM maker Diebold  a publicly traded company accused of bribing government officials in China and Indonesia   The U S  government not only cited official bribes  it also accused the company of books and records violations in connection with payments to private Russian bank employees   The company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department  and paid penalties and disgorgement to settle the matter  
 Even if bribes are made only on a commercial basis  if they are misreported as promotional or other expenses  they can be the basis for FCPA liability   Sidley Austin attorneys wrote in a client memo earlier this year ",2015-07-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/exclusive:-sec-launches-civil-probe-into-fifa-bribery-case---source-351835,351835

192201,413717,NKE,Sponsors catch on to booming womens  sport,news,"By Emma Thomasson BERLIN  Reuters    The popularity of the women s soccer World Cup is the latest sign of a virtuous cycle in female sport as increasing advertising revenue boosts professionalism and viewers  Television audiences for the early women s World Cup matches in Canada are up strongly in many countries compared with the last competition in 2011  doubling or tripling in major markets like the United States and China  Fox Sports  which is airing all 52 games live  is expected to raise ad revenue of more than  30 million  a person familiar with the matter told Reuters  That dwarfs the  6 million that consumer data group Kantar Media reported broadcaster ESPN getting in 2011  but is still a tiny fraction of the  525 million in U S  ad revenue generated by the men s World Cup in 2014    Women s sport is at a tipping point from a media point of view  from a commercial point of view and from a participation point of view   said John Postlethwaite  who set up sponsorship agency Female Sports Group in February to seize the opportunity he sees in women s and mixed gender sport  Tennis has long been the only sport in which women had the chance to earn big prize money and endorsements   in a Forbes magazine ranking of the best paid female athletes  seven of the top 10 play tennis  Of those  Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams are the only women in Forbes  overall top 100 best paid athletes  although each still made less than half that of the highest earning male tennis star   Roger Federer on  67 million  TEAM SPORTS HAVE BROADER APPEAL Mixed gender tournaments and the establishment in 1973 of a single professional tour  the Women s Tennis Association  have helped broaden television exposure for female tennis players  Joint competitions have also helped lift the profile of women in sports like athletics  while team games like soccer and rugby have been held back by separate tournaments from men  However  sponsor interest in women s team sports is growing fast  as grass roots participation rises and more professional leagues are established  with rights being sold separately from men s games in some countries  allowing more targeted marketing   The upsurge in team sports broadens the appeal rather than relying on individuals  It is more flexible because you can target events and teams whereas using an individual depends on how they perform   said Nigel Currie  a marketing consultant and the former chair of the European Sponsorship Association    Nike   NYSE NKE  was quick to recognize the potential of women s soccer in the United States  it made the first ever signing of a female player in 1993 with the record goal scoring Mia Hamm  who helped her side to two Olympic golds and two World Cups  Nike is sponsoring 11 teams at the 2015 World Cup  more than any other company  It made an ad on the U S  side featuring the song  American Woman  by Canada s The Guess Who and produced replicas of the side s jerseys in male sizes for the first time  German rivals Adidas  XETRA ADSGN  and Puma are also now investing heavily in the female market  Puma is kitting out Brazil s Marta Vieira da Silva  the all time top goalscorer in the Women s World Cup  while Adidas has deals with Japan s Homare Sawa and German goalkeeper Nadine Angerer  REACHING FEMALE CONSUMERS Corporate interest extends far beyond sportswear firms as companies seek new ways to reach female consumers as well as demonstrating support for diversity and healthy lifestyles   Sponsors are looking for opportunities to showcase themselves within an environment which is not crowded and which fits with their values of diversity   said Nathalie Zimmerman Nenon  head of global sport at Kantar Media  Energy firm SSE  LONDON SSE  struck a  seven figure  deal earlier this month to sponsor the women s English soccer FA Cup and will also create a country wide program of girls only soccer  Sally Horrox  a consultant with the English Football Association  FA  who last month set up women s sports consultancy Y Sport  said the deal was made possible by offering separate rights to the women s competition from the men s game   As a result  we ve seen significant new investment come into women s soccer and sponsors with a clear strategy and intent align their brand and investment with girls  women and their families   Horrox wrote in a blog   A similarly groundbreaking standalone deal came in women s cricket in 2014 when South Korean carmaker Kia agreed to sponsor the newly professional English team  Postlethwaite of the Female Sport Group says traditionally male sectors like financial services  utilities  car makers and consumer electronics are all ripe for deals as companies recognize the growing buying power of women  adding his new agency is already in talks with six major multinationals  Tire brand Continentalbecame the lead partner of the FA Women s Super League in 2011  saying it allows the company  to reach a broad and growing demographic  with participation levels increasing all the time   A desire to reach a U S  female executive audience was behind last year s decision by Japan s All Nippon Airways to partner with the Ladies Professional Golf Association  LPGA   according to Andy Sutherden  a sports marketing consultant at Hill Knowlton Strategies  Growing financial support   both in terms of endorsements and prize money   means more female athletes can afford to go professional  helping to raise quality across the board   The more sponsors  the better the funds  the more professional support  the greater number of role models   said Sutherden  Postlethwaite notes about 40 percent of women who play sport in Britain play games like badminton  netball and gymnastics  making them potentially more attractive for family viewing   There is real commercial opportunity in this space because you can take a position in these sports very cost effectively   he said   From a hospitality point of view  it can be a family event rather than men leaving family at home   But Zimmerman Nenon is more cautious   I wouldn t gamble beyond usual suspects in team sports

192210,413726,NKE,Alibaba s latest gambit in fighting fakes  foster local brands ,news,"By John Ruwitch PUTIAN  China  Reuters    Criticized and even sued by luxury brand Gucci and others for facilitating the counterfeit goods trade  Chinese e commerce giant  Alibaba   NYSE BABA  Group Holding Ltd has been quietly piloting a scheme to try to curb fakes at source  In the coastal city of Putian  in Fujian province  Alibaba is working with 17 shoe manufacturers to cultivate home grown brands online  revitalize a flagging industry and offer would be counterfeiters an alternative source of livelihood  Critics say the scheme is misguided and Alibaba should instead focus on scrubbing its online marketplaces of widespread listings of fakes  But the  Made in China  plan speaks to what proponents say is one of the reasons why there s been only limited progress in the battle against fake goods in China  a lack of attractive alternatives for those making and hawking goods that infringe on others  intellectual property rights   You can crack down forever and never see an end to it   said Song Zonghu  who once peddled counterfeit name brand sneakers and now runs Shuangwei Sporting Goods Co Ltd  one of the firms in the Alibaba program   Creating new opportunities while cracking down is the way to go  Everybody has to eat   Ni Liang  Alibaba s senior director of Internet security  says the scheme is a key anti counterfeit initiative this year  The group plans to expand it to household electronics  toys  bags and other industries  hoping that by building local brands  small manufacturers will turn away from fakes and serve a legitimate sector  LOGISTICS HUB Putian is the epicenter of China s high quality fake sneaker business  a byproduct of a legitimate footwear industry that employs a tenth of the city s 3 million people  Copies of  Nike   NYSE NKE   Adidas  XETRA ADSGN   New Balance and other brand name shoes made here are hard to distinguish from the real deal  but sell for a fraction of the price  The municipal government has cracked down on fakes  arresting 156 people and confiscating about 2 million pairs of counterfeit footwear since 2014  said Wu Haiduan  director of the Putian e commerce office  He declined to give an estimate of the overall size of the industry  but a grid of Putian s sleepy daytime streets near government offices comes alive at night  offering hints as to the scale of the issue  Hundreds of scooters ferry shoes as runners duck in and out of off brand storefronts or apartment blocks to fetch more boxes  Sellers check each shoe for blemishes  wielding scissors or cigarette lighters to eliminate stray threads and pencil erasers to clean the foam midsoles  Fake certificates and phony credit card receipts are tucked in with the shoes  Dozens of curbside courier services then wrap and stack the boxes ready to be trucked out by daybreak  SALES BUMP Alibaba has trained the shoe manufacturers in online business  helped on quality control and marketing  and run sales promotions  In one 3 day campaign  the shoe brands sold over 4 million pairs   or two every three seconds   worth 480 million yuan   77 5 million   said Alibaba spokeswoman Crystal Liu  Sneakers are just the start    We ve received more than 60 requests from other industries   said Jeff Zhang  head of Alibaba s domestic retail marketplaces  which include the Taobao and Tmall shopping sites   For most  the hope is that Alibaba can help re tool local industry in the face of rising costs and shrinking overseas orders   They re all looking for a model that can help them upgrade their local manufacturing   said Zhang  Song  the businessman  sees the Alibaba scheme as an economic lifeline  and says the future of his Siweiqi brand canvas shoes  which resemble Converse All Stars  depends on continued support with sales promotions and exposure   What we ve seen so far is just a signal   he said  A sales bump is one thing  but building a successful brand is quite another  said Shaun Rein  managing director at marketing firm CMR China   It s kind of unlikely to be successful because it s not so easy just to create a brand out of nowhere   he said   For Alibaba  the key is to make a show that they re trying to crack down on fakes   he added  noting the company takes a cut on all sales   fake or legitimate  The American Apparel   Footwear Association  which has lobbied the U S  government to put pressure on Alibaba  says the company should focus on making it easier for brands to get listings of fake products taken off Alibaba websites   The programs that are going to be the most effective for us are going to be those that really address removing these products from the site   said AAFA Executive Vice President Steve Lamar  adding that progress has been very slow  Alibaba removed 12 million product listings last year following complaints from brands  Ni said  He defended the takedown procedures  which critics say are cumbersome  saying that about 40 percent of suspected listings in brand complaints turned out to be genuine or impossible to confirm as fake  Standing by a motorcycle laden with Nike and Adidas boxes in Putian  Xiao Zhen says business ebbs and flows with the cycle of crackdowns  but won t dry up any time soon   even if Alibaba can help boost a few successful home grown brands   If everyone could afford famous shoe brands there wouldn t be anyone making fakes   she said

192211,413727,NKE,Visa threatens to ditch FIFA as sponsor dismay mounts,news,"By Anjali Athavaley and Emma Thomasson NEW YORK BERLIN  Reuters     Visa Inc   NYSE V  has told FIFA it could end its sponsorship if soccer s governing body does not act fast to restore the reputation of the game after senior officials were arrested on corruption charges  The statement from Visa was the strongest so far as sponsors lined up to express concern about the scandal engulfing the world s most popular sport and their customers took to social media to threaten a boycott of brands associated with FIFA  Sponsors are trying to balance the growing sensitivity of consumers to corruption  human rights abuses and environmental issues against their relationship with the organization that holds the keys to a billion soccer fans worldwide   Our disappointment and concern with FIFA in light of today s developments is profound  As a sponsor  we expect FIFA to take swift and immediate steps to address these issues within its organization   Visa said    This starts with rebuilding a culture with strong ethical practices   it said   Should FIFA fail to do so  we have informed them that we will reassess our sponsorship   U S  prosecutors issued an indictment on Wednesday accusing nine officials from soccer s world governing body and five sports media and promotions executives of bribes involving more than  150 million over 24 years  Airline Emirates  EMIRA UL  and Japanese electronics maker Sony Corp announced in November they would not renew deals with FIFA  although rivals Qatar Airways and Samsung  KS 005930  are reportedly in talks to replace them  Emirates and Sony were among FIFA s six main partners who together paid a total of  177 million in 2014 for the right to advertise in World Cup stadiums and use the FIFA trademark  A source familiar with the Sony decision said suspected corruption was one factor behind Sony s withdrawal although the main reason was the high cost of the sponsorship deal  Sponsors have long faced risks to their brands from sports scandals ranging from doping to match fixing to misbehavior of top players on and off the pitch  Sponsors including  Nike  Inc  NYSE NKE  dropped American cyclist Lance Armstrong in 2012 after he was banned for doping  but Germany s Adidas  XETRA ADSGN  decided last year to stick with Uruguay s Luis Suarez after FIFA banned him for nine matches for biting an Italy defender   Brands have to take a longer term view  Any sport is littered with controversy on and off the field   said Paul Smith  founder of sports marketing research group Repucom    What fans care about most of all is the game itself rather than the business of the game    Being a sponsor of FIFA implies you are a sponsor of the game  not of the organization   CLOSE TIES FIFA s longest standing partners are Adidas and Coca Cola Co  Adidas has been the provider of the World Cup match ball since 1970 and has a partnership lasting until 2030  while the current deal for Coca Cola  which has had a formal association since 1974 and has advertised in every World Cup stadium since 1950  lasts until 2022  That perhaps explains why they stopped short of threatening to cut ties like Visa  the world s largest credit and debit card company  which only became a FIFA partner in 2007 and recently extended the relationship until 2022    This lengthy controversy has tarnished the mission and ideals of the FIFA World Cup and we have repeatedly expressed our concerns about these serious allegations   Coca Cola said  Adidas  which is the world s biggest manufacturer of soccer balls  boots and shirts  side stepped outright criticism  calling instead for FIFA  to continue to establish and follow transparent compliance standards   Its shares fell 1 5 percent on Thursday  Meanwhile  Nike  which is not a FIFA partner but is challenging Adidas  dominance in soccer by sponsoring many of the world s top players and teams  said it was cooperating with authorities after it was indirectly identified in the U S  indictment in relation to a 1996 deal with the Brazil team  U S  Attorney General Loretta Lynch declined to comment on whether there was any liability for companies that had won marketing rights and if they were being investigated  But she said  the investigation is continuing and covers all aspects   She declined to comment when asked if one of the companies was Nike  Nike later said in a statement it was  concerned by the very serious allegations  adding   Nike believes in ethical and fair play in both business and sport and strongly opposes any form of manipulation or bribery   OTHER SPONSORS BRISTLE FIFA s main sponsors were already getting uneasy even before the latest revelations   Adidas  Visa and Coca Cola all made statements last week pushing FIFA to take seriously the issue of rights for migrant workers in Qatar  responding to reports of abuses at the 2022 World Cup construction sites  That came after campaigners designed spoof ads for major FIFA sponsors subverting their brand images  including a Coca Cola can dripping with oil and the iconic three stripes of Adidas tweaked to look like a line of gravestones  The pressure only mounted after Wednesday s news  with social media full of appeals for brands to cut ties with FIFA    Adidas  Visa  Coca Cola  McDonald s  Budweiser  Hyundai

192212,413728,NKE,Nike seen avoiding charges in soccer bribery probe  lawyers,news,"By David Ingram NEW YORK  Reuters     Nike  Inc  NYSE NKE  may be able to avoid U S  charges over any involvement in bribery payments to win soccer sponsorships  but could face penalties if U S  prosecutors decide to clamp down on the global sportswear giant  lawyers with expertise in the subject said  Although Nike has not been named or charged with any wrongdoing  the company was swept into the corruption scandal that engulfed soccer s governing body FIFA when a U S  indictment released on Wednesday described apparent kickback payments linked to a landmark 1996 Nike deal in Brazil  In a statement on Thursday  Nike said that the charges did not allege that it engaged in criminal conduct or that any Nike employee was aware of or took part in a bribery scheme  On Wednesday  in another statement  it did not confirm or deny that it was the company in the indictment  but said it was cooperating with authorities  The description of the  160 million  10 year deal signed by  Sportswear Company A  matched exactly the details of Nike s agreement to become the footwear and apparel supplier and sponsor of the world s most successful national soccer team  Still  the U S  Justice Department is likely to take a tougher stance against those who solicited bribes than those who paid them  especially if a company did not have a long history of paying bribes  said former U S  federal prosecutor Michael Volkov   Where the case is going  it s not focusing as much on the people who were shaken down as it is on the people doing the shaking   Volkov said  While the 14 defendants in the indictment are being charged with crimes such as money laundering and wire fraud  the United States has normally prosecuted U S  businesses for foreign bribery under the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act  FCPA   That law s anti bribery provisions apply to dealings with governments and government officials and may not be of much use in the soccer world because soccer associations are typically not government agencies  The Brazilian Football Confederation  CBF   which signed the 1996 deal with Nike  is a private organization    The FCPA does not prohibit private bribery   said Homer Moyer  who specializes in FCPA cases at the law firm Miller   Chevalier in Washington  If Nike is thought to have paid bribes by transferring funds from a U S  based account  the Justice Department might consider charging the company with  international promotional money laundering   said a former official with the Justice Department s money laundering section   While seldom used in the past  prosecutors have made increased used of this charge in recent years  said the source  who spoke on condition of anonymity due to his private sector work  Prosecutors could employ a provision of the FCPA that requires companies to keep accurate accounting records  If the sportswear company in the Brazil deal disguised or hid wrongdoing in its books  it may have violated the law  lawyers said   MASSIVE SETTLEMENTS The indictment came less than three weeks after U S  President Barack Obama co opted Nike s  just do it  slogan in a speech promoting a Pacific free trade deal at the company s headquarters in Beaverton  Oregon  The charge sheet said that  Sportswear Company A  agreed to pay an additional  40 million in

S  charges over any involvement in bribery payments to win soccer sponsorships  but could face penalties if U S  prosecutors decide to clamp down on the global sportswear giant  lawyers with expertise in the subject said  Although Nike has not been named or charged with any wrongdoing  the company was swept into the corruption scandal that engulfed soccer s governing body FIFA when a U S  indictment released on Wednesday described apparent kickback payments linked to a landmark 1996 Nike deal in Brazil  In a statement on Thursday  Nike said that the charges did not allege that it engaged in criminal conduct or that any Nike employee was aware of or took part in a bribery scheme  On Wednesday  in another statement  it did not confirm or deny that it was the company in the indictment  but said it was cooperating with authorities  The description of the  160 million  10 year deal signed by  Sportswear Company A  matched exactly the details of Nike s agreement to become the footwear and apparel supplier and sponsor of the world s most successful national soccer team  Still  the U S  Justice Department is likely to take a tougher stance against those who solicited bribes than those who paid them  especially if a company did not have a long history of paying bribes  said former U S  federal prosecutor Michael Volkov   Where the case is going  it s not focusing as much on the people who were shaken down as it is on the people doing the shaking   Volkov said  While the 14 defendants in the indictment are being charged with crimes such as money laundering and wire fraud  the United States has normally prosecuted U S  businesses for foreign bribery under the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act  FCPA   That law s anti bribery provisions apply to dealings with governments and government officials and may not be of much use in the soccer world because soccer associations are typically not government agencies  The Brazilian Football Confederation  CBF   which signed the 1996 deal with Nike  is a private organization    The FCPA does not prohibit private bribery   said Homer Moyer  who specializes in FCPA cases at the law firm Miller   Chevalier in Washington  If Nike is thought to have paid bribes by transferring funds from a U S  based account  the Justice Department might consider charging the company with  international promotional money laundering   said a former official with the Justice Department s money laundering section   While seldom used in the past  prosecutors have made increased used of this charge in recent years  said the source  who spoke on condition of anonymity due to his private sector work  Prosecutors could employ a provision of the FCPA that requires companies to keep accurate accounting records  If the sportswear company in the Brazil deal disguised or hid wrongdoing in its books  it may have violated the law  lawyers said   MASSIVE SETTLEMENTS The indictment came less than three weeks after U S  President Barack Obama co opted Nike s  just do it  slogan in a speech promoting a Pacific free trade deal at the company s headquarters in Beaverton  Oregon  The charge sheet said that  Sportswear Company A  agreed to pay an additional  40 million in  marketing fees  that were not in the initial contract to the Swiss bank account of an affiliate of Brazilian sports marketing firm Traffic

192214,413730,NKE,Brazil soccer probe to put harsh glare on Nike  other sponsors,news,"By Brad Haynes and Anthony Boadle SAO PAULO BRASILIA  Reuters     Nike  Inc  NYSE NKE  and some other big international companies face a grilling over their powerful role in Brazilian soccer as a former star player turned senator vows to expose what he describes as suspect marketing contracts and their links to corrupt payments  Romario  a revered striker who led Brazil to victory at the 1994 World Cup wearing the U S  sportswear giant s boots  is leading a new congressional probe into sponsorship deals in the wake of U S  graft charges that have shaken the soccer world  Three Brazilians were among those named and charged in the U S  indictment  including a former head of the Brazilian Football Confederation  CBF   Neither Romario nor Brazilian prosecutors have alleged that Nike did anything illegal  despite the company s  160 million deal in 1996 to sponsor Brazil s team being linked to kickback payments in the U S  indictment released last week  Nike was not named in the indictment but there was only one company that fit the prosecutors  description  In a statement last week  Nike noted that the charges did not allege it engaged in criminal conduct or that its employees were involved in or aware of bribery  Romario  Brazil s leading voice for soccer reform whose playing fame boosts his influence  says he wants to investigate such sponsorship deals to see if they were used to funnel money to officials and exert undue influence on the sport  The commission  which will start next week  will have the power to subpoena witnesses  bank records and private contracts  but cannot issue search or arrest warrants   Among companies whose sponsorship deals with the Brazil team have come under scrutiny in recent years are airline TAM  the Brazilian arm of regional giant Latam Airlines Group  and Ambev SA  now a subsidiary of Budweiser maker Anheuser Busch InBev   These brands are going to be front and center in the investigation     They won t be able to remain silent   said Fernando Ferreira  head of sports marketing firm Pluri  citing the heavy focus on sponsors in a similar probe 15 years ago    People are fed up and they want to know what sponsors are doing with the power of their checkbooks to demand changes in the sport       Sponsors in Brazil have been hesitant to publicly address corruption concerns  emphasizing their support for the national team rather than the CBF  The use of intermediaries is common in contracts in Brazil and sponsors may not have any direct knowledge of wrongdoing  Previous investigations have revealed deals for broadcast and marketing rights that involve intermediary firms funneling sponsorship money to close associates of CBF officials  opening the door to kickbacks and bribery  Romario met with Brazil s top federal prosecutor on Monday and said they were cooperating on the investigation  Federal police have investigated former CBF officials for money laundering and tax evasion  but federal prosecutors have not confirmed any formal charges  One lawyer with expertise on corruption cases and corporate compliance said that the CBF s status as a private entity meant that a company could not be charged with giving it bribes   At worst  the problem will be damage to its  the company s  image   said the lawyer  who asked not to be identified  Prosecutors would have to go after intermediaries on other charges  like money laundering and tax fraud  he said   A VERY DIFFERENT MOMENT  The U S  indictment said that in the 1996 deal  Sportswear Company A    apparently Nike   agreed to pay  40 million in  marketing fees  that were not in its initial contract with the CBF to the Swiss bank account of an affiliate of Brazilian sports marketing firm Traffic  Jose Hawilla  the founder of Traffic who was named by the indictment as convicted on graft charges  agreed to pay half of everything he made from the deal to an unidentified senior member of the CBF  according to the U S  Department of Justice  That amounted to  millions of dollars  as a bribe and kickback   the indictment said     The new Brazilian Senate inquiry reprises a congressional probe 15 years ago  The probe was consumed by political infighting and did not result in formal charges   But it brought to light previously secret aspects of the Nike deal that gave the firm remarkable influence over the team that has won the World Cup an unmatched five times  It revealed that the deal gave Nike the right to arrange five friendly matches for the team per year  picking opponents and players included in so called  Nike games   Lawmakers also grilled a Nike executive and coaches over one of the world s greatest soccer conspiracy theories   that pressure from the sponsorship deal led to the selection of star striker and Nike poster boy Ronaldo in the 1998 World Cup final even though he was sick  Brazil lost the game  Nike and Ronaldo denied the allegations  Despite the controversy  Nike s Brazil business has thrived The country contributes around a billion dollars of Nike s annual revenue  about 5 percent of its global business  compared to just half a billion in revenue from all of Latin America and other non core markets in 1996   Romario s new investigation quickly gathered the support of fellow senators and President Dilma Rousseff s government  He says Brazilians will not tolerate the impunity that followed the last probe   I think it s a very different moment  The soccer kingpins are weak  The whole world is watching  This isn t just about soccer in Brazil   he told Reuters by email   What I can promise you is that I will do everything possible to put the crooks behind bars   Those who investigated the deals of the 1990s say business practices around the sport have changed little   In recent years  the soccer deals have grown much bigger  but they re still based on the same model  with intermediaries and shell companies to launder money   lawmaker Silvio Torres  who authored a report on the 2000 commission  told Reuters   Several of the sponsorships he investigated remain in place  Romario has flagged sponsorships as an avenue for graft in the CBF  citing one deal with TAM  TAM stopped sponsoring the national team in 2012 after a newspaper Folha de S Paulo reported that its contract paid  7 million per year to companies owned by a close associate of former CBF President Ricardo Teixeira  A TAM representative said it was ready to clarify the details of its 2007 2012 sponsorship to authorities  A Senate investigation uncovered details of a 2001 Ambev sponsorship deal in which at least  9 million went to an intermediary company owned by a close associate of Teixeira  Ambev and Inbev declined to comment on the matter  Teixeira left the CBF in 2012 amid a police investigation into reports that he had taken millions of dollars in bribes from a sports marketing firm  He denied the allegations and was not charged for any wrongdoing  Efforts to reach Teixeira were unsuccessful  Current CBF President Marco Polo Del Nero says he knew nothing about alleged bribery schemes involving the federation and is cooperating with official investigations

When U S  President Barack Obama visits  Nike  Inc  NYSE NKE   s world headquarters in Beaverton  Oregon  on Friday  he ll be promoting the benefits of the Trans Pacific Partnership to an American public that is divided on the pros and cons of free trade agreements  The TPP  he ll say  is a  21st century  deal that will connect a dozen Pacific Rim nations under a unified set of regulatory  investment and trade rules  To hear the president describe it  the TPP is a win for all 12 Pacific Rim countries involved  Proponents say it will improve labor rights and environmental protections in countries like Vietnam and Malaysia while giving U S  companies better access to Asian markets  especially Japan  creating 650 000 American jobs over the next decade  Critics aren t convinced   His decision to visit Nike headquarters has got to be either the result of poor staffing  or just an indication he doesn t realize his free trade policies are misguided   said Kevin Kearns  president of the United States Business and Industry Council  a Washington lobby representing small businesses   Instead of favoring companies that employ the American middle class  these policies favor companies that outsource and employ tens of thousands of workers overseas   The U S  Chamber of Commerce  which represents major multinational business interests  says free trade deals like the TPP are largely beneficial because they promote U S  made products overseas  Even so  the deals haven t helped mitigate the country s persistent trade deficit  The U S  buys more goods from other countries  especially those with free trade deals  than it makes and sends abroad  Nike and Oregon s big exporters would largely benefit from the TPP  Dave Weiner  retail analyst at  Deutsche Bank   XETRA DBKGn   said in a research note this week that Nike s gross margins could increase 4 percentage points if TPP member Vietnam  a major source of Nike goods  were able to export to the U S  without paying import tariffs  Nike earned  2 69 billion on profit on  27 8 billion in revenue last year  The president travels Thursday to Oregon to attend a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in Portland before heading to nearby Beaverton on Friday  to discuss how workers will benefit from progressive  high standards trade agreements that would open up new markets and support high quality jobs both for Oregon small businesses and large companies like Nike   said a White House statement  Obama is pursuing  fast track  trade promotion authority  which would limit Congress to a quick up or down vote on the trade treaty  whose details are currently classified to all but a handful of key lawmakers  Those who have seen the full details of the treaty are prohibited from disclosing anything to the public  Polls  including a recent one from Public Citizen  indicate strong bipartisan opposition to current U S  free trade agreement models  Pew Research polls suggest the public is considerably divided on the topic of free trade treaties  especially their effects on job creation growth  Oregon Sen  Ron Wyden  a Democrat  is facing pressure from labor groups to back out of his support for the president s fast track authority  but he continues to support the bill because he thinks it s good for his state   People want to buy our wheat  they want to buy our computers  our wine   Wyden said in an interview with Oregon Live in March   The Oregon brand is just on fire all over the world  and we ought to be able to get our exports  particularly  into Asia   Jeff Reimer  associate professor of applied economics at Oregon State University  says U S  trade deals face less resistance in the Pacific Northwest because the region exports higher value timber and agricultural products  such as soft winter wheat  which is almost completely an export product   Our comparative advantage and exports are somewhat unique  owing to our climate and geographical location   Reimer said by email   The Pacific Northwest developed much later than most other parts of the United States  and has traditionally been oriented towards natural resource usage  especially timber  marine and agricultural products   And more recently Oregon has developed a major technology hub known today as Silicon Forest  This cluster of computer and electronic products manufacturers make up the largest share of what Oregon makes and sends overseas   Our computer and electronics sector has thrived on the back on international trade  and so too has the athletic apparel sector   says Tim Duy  senior director of the Oregon Economic Forum at the University of Oregon   Nike employs almost 9 000 FTEs  full time employees  at its world headquarters  revealing that Oregon can benefit by exporting the knowledge product of the industry    the design and innovation    even while importing much of the final product   Last year   8 16 billion worth of tech products were exported from the state  worth as much as the agricultural products  machinery  transportation equipment and chemicals combined  Oregon exported  20 9 billion worth of goods to world markets last year  according to the U S  Department of Commerce s International Trade Administration  China  which is not a party to the TPP  was Oregon s largest export market last year  making up  4 27 billion  or 20 percent  of the state s global exports  Canada  Malaysia  Japan and South Korea are the state s other primary export markets  Japan and Malaysia are two of the 12 TPP member states  which means Oregon exporters stand to benefit from a deal that would lower barriers  especially to Japan  But critics of free trade agreements point out that the net gain in U S  jobs over the years doesn t reflect the promises made by proponents of past free trade agreements  The country s mounting trade deficit is a significant indicator that manufacturing jobs are leaving the country  Meanwhile  many local companies are competing with imported goods often made  or harvested  under poor or even deplorable working conditions that allow many exporters to the U S  to undercut prices of locally made goods   Millions of manufacturing jobs are gone  and there s no evidence free trade agreements create an increase in jobs on net   said Kearns   Exports obviously create jobs  and imports displace jobs  Exports can create jobs in one part of the country  but imports can cost jobs in another part of the country   Net  is the key word here  ",2015-05-07,International Business

192224,413740,NKE,Obama to Democrats on Asia trade pact  like Nike   just do it ,news,"By Jeff Mason
BEAVERTON  Oregon  Reuters    President Barack Obama  co opting  Nike  Inc  NYSE NKE  s famous slogan  told Democrats on Friday to  just do it  and support a trade deal with Asian countries that the shoe company said would help it create up to 10 000 U S  jobs over 10 years 
The setting   Nike s headquarters in Beaverton  Oregon   was an unusual one for a presidential trade pitch 
Nike has long faced criticism for using Asian sweat shops to produce its pricey footwear  But the company has worked to improve conditions overseas and said on Friday it would also boost investment in U S  manufacturing if the 12 nation Trans Pacific Partnership  TPP  pact is approved 
Obama used that promise of new jobs to try to convince skeptical lawmakers from his own party to support TPP and join Republicans in granting him  fast track  authority to finalize the deal 
Many Democrats are concerned the proposed pact would help companies move operations to cheaper offshore facilities 
 On trade  I actually think some of my dearest friends are wrong  They re just wrong   Obama said at Nike headquarters   If we don t write the rules for trade around the world  guess what  China will  
He added   Just do it  everybody  
SHOES FROM VIETNAM
Before the trip  White House aides had been coy about why Obama chose such a controversial backdrop for his speech  An administration official said Nike had approached the White House about the trade deal and that led to Obama s appearance there 
Labor and environmental groups protested Obama s appearance at Nike and said the company s job creating claims were vague 
 We have heard similar promises from companies before  and very few have panned out   said Eric Hauser  a spokesman for the AFL CIO  the nation s largest labor coalition 
Nike has 26 000 U S  employees  but it counts on more than 1 million workers in contract factories worldwide to make its shoes  some of which sell for hundreds of dollars  A third of those factories are in Vietnam  a TPP participant 
Almost all footwear sold in the United States is made overseas and is subject to import tariffs that average 25 percent to 35 percent  according to the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America  a shoe dealer s group 
For shoes imported from TPP countries  notably Vietnam  U S  firms paid  400 million in tariffs in 2014  the group said 
Nike said relief from  antiquated  footwear tariffs in the TPP deal would allow it to invest more money at home  In addition to 10 000 U S  manufacturing and engineering jobs  it promised as many as 40 000 additional jobs would pop up in its domestic supply chain if an agreement were reached 
 Free trade opens doors  It removes barriers  It creates jobs   Nike Chief Executive Mark Parker told the crowd ahead of Obama s speech in Beaverton  seven miles from Portland 
When asked  Nike offered few details on  for instance  whether it would build new plants  how soon new jobs could come on line  how much money workers might be paid  or what kind of shoes could be produced in the United States 
A Nike spokesman said in an email that it was  too early for us to say specifically where we will invest  but it will be a significant investment over the next decade  
The White House declined to provide additional details  referring questions to Nike 
MORE LOBBYING EXPENSE
In the past two years  Nike has ramped up its lobbying efforts as debate over the trade treaty has intensified 
The company nearly tripled its lobbying spending to more than  1 1 million in 2014 from  400 000 in 2012  according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics  a Washington campaign finance and lobbying research group 
Nike multibillionaire co founder Philip Knight is Oregon s richest person and leans Republican  though he has donated money over the years to both parties  including more than  85 000 to Republican congressional committees in 2013 and 2014  according to federal records analyzed by the center 
Knight has also given money to Democratic Senator Ron Wyden  a key supporter along with Republicans of giving Obama  fast track  authority to negotiate the TPP deal 
Under the deal s terms  Obama said Vietnam is one country that would be forced to improve its labor standards  set a minimum wage  and protect workers  rights to unionize 
 It would be good for the workers in Vietnam even as it helps make sure that they re not undercutting competition here in the United States   he said 
The TPP would also help more companies move advanced manufacturing to the United States  Obama added 
But despite anecdotal evidence that some companies are shifting production back to the U S   economic data suggest America s production lines rely more than ever on suppliers from low wage countries 
 The data clearly show no sign of reshoring   said University of Munich economist Dalia Marin  in a detailed analysis published in November 
Lori Wallach of Public Citizen  a government watchdog group  said labor standards in the TPP were too weak  pointing to a U S  Government Accountability Office study that found similar standards in trade deals with Peru  Colombia  Panama and Korea had failed to improve labor conditions in those countries ",2015-05-08,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nike-backs-obama-on-trade-with-pledge-to-create-10,000-u.s.-jobs-340913",340913

192251,413767,NKE,Can Nike s Earnings Withstand Russia s Ruble Crisis  ,news,"By   
Nike  Nike Inc   the world s largest sportswear maker  is scheduled to release its fiscal second quarter results Thursday after the closing bell   title    Nike  Nike Inc   the world s largest sportswear maker  is scheduled to release its fiscal second quarter results Thursday after the closing bell   rel  external image  
Nike Inc   the world s largest sportswear maker  is scheduled to release its latest quarterly results Thursday  with analysts keeping a close eye on holiday sales projections  and possible affects of Russia s currency crisis 
Nike warned in September it expected sales to remain flat because of foreign exchange rates  and following the ruble s massive decline earlier this week  investors will be watching for how Nike plans to hedge foreign currency issues in the coming months  More than half of Nike s sales are derived outside North America 
However  Russia s currency crisis might not mean much to Nike in the big picture because much of its strength is in other regions  according to Sam Poser  senior research analyst at Sterne Agee  Nike recorded a profit of  27 8 billion for fiscal 2014  with just under 5 percent coming from Western Europe and  1 4 billion coming from Central Europe  That compares with  12 3 billion in the U S   You re going to face headwinds with currencies  but structurally they re running as good of a business as anyone else out there   Poser said 
While Western Europe is facing a difficulties  Citigroup still expects a double digit growth in the region for Nike based on strong brand momentum in wholesale  as well as continued market share gains at the expense of rival Adidas  Citi is forecasting 13 percent growth compared with 23 percent during the same period last year  Kate McShane  analyst at Citigroup said in a research note  Central and Eastern Europe have continued to show double digit growth of 14 percent last year  and Citigroup is expecting another strong mid teens futures number  excluding Russia  for the region this quarter on broad based market growth 
Russia s currency crisis could mean bigger trouble for Adidas  The Russia Eastern Europe region represents around 13 percent of sales  the company doesn t disclose Russia s total percentage  But according to Paul Swinand  equity analyst at Morningstar Investment Services Inc   Adidas s could be looking at a  100 million profit hit  especially since they rent stores in dollars   Swinand said 
 I think the market should like Adidas in the long term because if the dollar keeps strengthening over time and the euro weakens  that would help Adidas  whereas the headwind for Nike is more on Europe   Swinand said 
While Nike has been outperforming rival Adidas on its home turf in Europe  Adidas  acquisition of Reebok could create a stronger competitor  according to McShane 
Investors will also be keeping an eye on Nike s holiday sales  The company typically releases its marquee products around the holidays that are fairly limited supplies  including its release of the company s 12th LeBron James signature shoe on Black Friday this year  Analysts at Citigroup expect Nike to maintain its outlook for the current quarter with revs expected to grow despite 1 to 2 percent headwinds from foreign exchange markets  Wall Street also expects Nike s earnings per share of 70 will come in line with Wall Street s consensus estimates  driven by over 10 percent revenue growth  including foreign exchange markets  driven by the U S   Europe  Emerging Markets and China 
Following the earnings announcement after the closing bell Thursday  Nike will host a conference call with shareholders at 5 p m  EST to discuss the company s second quarter results  Nike  which has a market cap of  81 7 billion  has seen its stock price gain 21 53 percent this year  Ahead of the earnings announcement  shares of Nike rose 1 21 percent Thursday to  95 64 in midday trading ",2014-12-18,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/can-nike's-earnings-withstand-russia's-ruble-crisis -320832,320832

The company added that it is in a strong position as of now with future orders for Nike Brand athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from September 2014 through January 2015 rising 11 percent compared to the same period last year 
 Fiscal year 2015 is off to a strong start  Our connection to consumers and ability to innovate  combined with our powerful global portfolio  is a complete offense   said Mark Parker  President and CEO of Nike  Inc 
 Nike has never been better positioned to realize our tremendous growth potential  

During the latest Football World Cup hosted by Brazil  the company spent heavily on advertising  and sponsored more national teams than rival Adidas  It also sponsored popular players such as Brazil s Neymar da Silva Santos J nior and Portugal s Cristiano Ronaldo 
Nike said its demand creation expense rose 23 percent to  897m during the quarter  reflecting higher spending on marketing during the World Cup 
The company s shares rose more than 7 percent in after hours trading following the results ",2014-09-26,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nike-sees-profits-surge-post-world-cup-310904,310904
192276,413792,NKE,China s Li Ning stumbles from gold medal position to no man s land,news,"By Donny Kwok HONG KONG  Reuters    In 2010  former Chinese gymnast Li Ning led a surging  4 billion sportswear business  a gold medal pinnacle echoing his victories at the 1984 Olympic Games 
Now  the Li Ning  HK 2331  business is more reminiscent of the ex sportsman s exit from the 1988 Olympics without a podium finish  As customers have turned to aspirational global brands like Nike Inc  N NKE  or cheaper local firms  Li Ning has racked up heavy losses  losing four fifths of its market value 
The company has long pinned a turnaround plan on targeting trendy  fast growing areas of sport in China  like basketball  hoping to attract younger consumers with a mid range pricing strategy  But company watchers fear what Li Ning sees as the middle ground could turn out to be a no man s land  while still loyal older customers may be turned off by the focus on youth goods 
 They tried to go younger  but in the course of doing that they lost a lot of those aged over 30 who were traditionally a more loyal customer base   said James Roy  senior analyst at China Market Research Group in Shanghai 
Equally  many younger customers have yet to buy into the strategy 
 It seems like  Li Ning  products are targeted mostly at students aged 13 or 14   Ding Jianan  a 22 year old student  told Reuters in China s commercial capital Shanghai   I can afford higher priced items from Western brands  which offer better quality  In college  people like to compare each other s outfits so the peer pressure will push us to buy Nike or Adidas  DE ADSGn   
Li Ning  backed by private equity powerhouse TPG Capital  TPG UL  and Singapore wealth fund GIC  GIC UL   last month reported a first half net loss of nearly  100 million  more than three times that of the corresponding period a year earlier 
It said at the time its recovery could take up to two more years as it invests hundreds of millions of dollars in promotion and advertising  The company declined to comment for this article 
 It s hard to say if their direction  of transformation  is right or not when the loss is getting bigger and bigger   said Steve Chow  analyst at Sunwah Kingsway Group Research 
ADVERTISING BLITZ
Li Ning s efforts to recapture its glory days by appealing to a younger generation have been evident in its product design and high profile marketing campaigns using Western sports stars 
Bright colours  including hot pink basketball shoes that retail for  289 a pair and loud green polka dot trainers  have increasingly replaced the classic red and white look favoured by Li Ning himself that resonated with the company s traditional market in its heyday  Li Ning  who is now executive chairman  declined to comment 
In that price range  Li Ning is positioning itself above local competitors such as ANTA Sports  HK 2020  and Peak Sport  HK 1968   but slightly below foreign rivals Nike and Adidas 
It s a strategy that has yet to bear fruit  The company s declining fortunes provide a stark contrast to the positive results from home grown rivals as China s sportswear industry shows solid signs of recovery following an expansion blitz after the 2008 Beijing Olympics led to bloated inventories 
Li Ning s push to revive the brand has seen a multi million dollar marketing drive that included signing up NBA basketball superstar Dwayne Wade 
The company s promotion and advertising expenses accounted for 19 4 percent of its 3 14 billion yuan   511 million  revenue in the first half of 2014  compared with 10 8 percent at ANTA 
Even as Li Ning invests to try to build the brand  the company still faces inventory issues that can effect its reputation  said James Button  a director at Shanghai based consultancy SmithStreet 
 They re trying to say they re a high quality brand and are at the same level as foreign players  but at the same time it is very visible that they re dumping inventory at very low prices   he said 
The company has said it is prepared to take the time it needs to achieve its goal of making Li Ning the only brand that represents the  Chinese Dream    the ideal of individual success in the country s society   across all categories of sportswear 

 I think Li Ning is so tied in with the Chinese Dream     it s more a part of national positioning than it is sports positioning   Button said

192291,413807,NKE,Automation Threatens Jobs Of Even World s Lowest Paid Workers,news,"By    As the 106 000 contract workers who lost their Nike jobs in the past year can attest  apparel manufacturers have decided that it s cheaper to invest in technology than to hire even the world s lowest paid workers 
The relentless move toward industrial automation is undercutting vulnerable workers around the globe 
For years  China and India offered manufacturers a low wage workforce  Production recently expanded around Asia to countries like Cambodia  Bangladesh and Vietnam as well 
But now  automation is allowing manufacturing to stop chasing cheap labor altogether  Automated production machines cut costs and immunize manufacturers from the dangers of a labor shortage 
 I think this is going to accelerate   said Erik Brynjolfsson  professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management   What we have is a situation where robots and automation do more and more tasks that are being done by low wage labor in Asia and elsewhere in the world  People involved in repetitive work are very vulnerable to what s happening  
Even smaller firms in the manufacturing chain can afford to modernize  The robots and computers that now run the plants would have been out of their reach just a few years ago 
 There are some tasks that humans will be cheaper for and some that robots will be cheaper for  but the boundary between the two is narrowing   said Brynjolfsson  co author of  The Second Machine Age  Work  Progress and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies  
What started at more sophisticated operations is working its way into more mundane tasks 

Hon Hai Precision Industry  the Taiwanese owner of Foxconn Technology Group that assembles consumer electronics for global brands like Apple  has been working quietly since 2011 installing robots at its facilities in mainland China 
Foxconn met with Android executive Andy Rubin earlier this year to discuss its strategy for installing robot technology at its factories in China  according to the Wall Street Journal 
In addition to cutting contracts for more than 100 000 workers  Nike Inc  NYSE NKE   the world s largest sportswear maker  weeded out 125 less efficient factories  And the company increased profits by 16 percent in the last fiscal year 
Affordable technology may be hurting vulnerable workers now  but could be a source of future economic growth    in theory  Open online courses could make education widely accessible 
For example  Battushig Myanganbayat  a 15 year old Mongolian boy  was one of 350 youths to ace MIT s open online circuits and electronics course and has been brought on to consult with the institution on how to make their MOOCs  massive open online courses  more accessible to young people in developing countries 
But for every 15 year old genius in the developing world there are countless people who will struggle as the factory jobs they ve depended on become more scarce ",2014-05-20,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/automation-threatens-jobs-of-even-world’s-lowest-paid-workers-285470,285470
