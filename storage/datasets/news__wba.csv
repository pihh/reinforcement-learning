178591,400107,WBA,Can Walgreens Continue to Grow in 2020 ,news,"Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  released fiscal 2020 first quarter results at the beginning of January  Missing both revenue and earnings per share estimates  the company disappointed investors  decreasing the share price by 7   
The company continues to predict flat growth for 2020 even after the soft quarter  which is due to three factors that have been weighing the company down over the past year and will continue to plague the company in 2020  

Competitive pressures
Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  and CVS Health  NYSE CVS   in addition to local pharmacies  are turning up the pressure on Walgreens    specifically surrounding the U S  and international retail pharmacy business segments  which make up 84 6  of Walgreens  revenue  
Amazon s 2018 acquisition of PillPack for  753 million is an industry disrupter  The company focuses on convenience by providing an at home prescription delivery  eliminating the need to wait in line for prescriptions and refills  This free service the massive 100 million Amazon Prime customers aside from the co payment is a threat to every pharmacy  
Walgreens has partnered with Microsoft for seven years to integrate the cloud and provide customers with instant access to healthcare records  offering convenience and increasing efficiency at each location  This cloud adoption will allow healthcare providers  insurers  and pharmacies to access a customer s data  putting Walgreens closer to PillPack s business model and serving 88 million active Walgreens Balance Rewards members  
Providing next day prescription delivery for  4 99 by partnering with FedEx  Walgreens is slowly heading in the right direction  However  the IT infrastructure  customer adoption  and competition from a behemoth company like Amazon will put pressure on Walgreens in 2020  
Lower reimbursement rates from insurers
The pressure is increasing for the Walgreens pharmacy segment as the company is receiving lower payments from insurers for drugs sold in U S  based pharmacies  Reimbursement rates from generic drugs have been historically high  enabling Walgreens to benefit from the spread between the cost of the drugs and the price charged to insurers  This has been changing  though  as insurers have been putting increased costs on pharmacy chains    increasing reimbursement pressure and lowering revenue for Walgreens  
Political changes have increased pressure on drug prices as well  The Trump administration has made a priority of reducing the red tape in drug pricing  increasing generic offerings  and eliminating the rebate policy that allowed drug companies and benefit managers to charge higher prices on drugs  In addition  Democrats have added proposals that will allow the government to negotiate drug prices for all Medicare related prescriptions  
Increased pressure on the U S  healthcare system is directly affecting Walgreens and will continue to do so under the current administration  The fall in generic drug prices has slowed  however  the lower prices on branded drugs in addition to the government oversight on insurers will continue to plague pharmacies  profitability in the coming months    hampering growth and increasing risk for shareholders 
Increasing the buying age of tobacco
In September  Walgreens announced that the company will require customers to be 21 years old to purchase tobacco products  This decision was based on the Food and Drug Administration s  FDA  increased oversight on Walgreens and other retailers that sell tobacco products to adults under age 18  
Walgreens was one of the heaviest violators among the several the FDA investigated  According to the FDA  22  of the Walgreens locations that were inspected were found to be illegally selling products to minors 
Pressure from the FDA and Congress forced Walgreens to increase the selling age of tobacco to 21  Walgreens enacted a  Card All  policy in 2019  This decision has put a damper on tobacco sales  decreasing retail sales during the recent quarter by 2 2  year over year  attributing a 0 5  decrease in comparable sales to the  continued de emphasis of tobacco   
A decent dividend with a shaky future
Given the increased competition and rising political influence within the healthcare industry  Walgreens  growth is stalled in the near term  Walgreens  management during the recent quarter pointed to a  1 8 billion cost savings by 2022 from a combination of store closures  inventory optimization  and the adoption of information technology within business operations  However  these are the only levers Walgreens management has to pull at the moment  
Overall  Walgreens  forward dividend yield of 3 38  is a saving grace for income investors in combination with a 31 23  payout ratio  leaving plenty of room to continue the 6 58  five year dividend compound annual growth rate  As revenue continues to flatline  investors will be looking at the costs of doing business  paying close attention to the  1 8 billion cost cutting initiative and the gross profit margin    which is at 21 61  per the recent quarter 
Purchasing shares of Walgreens at the current valuation isn t outlandish as Walgreens  forward price to earnings of 9 25 leaves shares at a discount in comparison to CVS s 10 25  But investors need to be careful as increased political pressure on the healthcare industry may provide enough systemic risk to affect the financial performance of the entire industry    leaving shareholders a nice dividend but a substandard stock price performance for 2020 ",2020-01-18,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pjomv,2062597
178592,400108,WBA,Where Will Walgreens Boots Alliance Be in 5 Years ,news,"Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  has been around in some form or another for 119 years  growing to become the second largest pharmacy chain in the country  There s little doubt it will be around for another five    and beyond  Even so  the retailer is grappling with dramatic shifts in the retail and healthcare sectors and will have to continue to evolve to remain healthy  So what will Walgreens look like in five years  and will it be a good investment 

Present struggles
Walgreens endured a difficult 2019  The stock was down 13 7  last year  marking the fourth straight year of negative annual returns  It was the one of the worst performers among Dow Jones stocks  And it s beginning 2020 in much the same way  down almost 10  year to date through Jan  23  In contrast  Walgreens  larger rival  CVS Health  was up 13 4  last year and is currently down less than 1  in 2020  
There are several reasons why Walgreens has struggled  particularly competition from Amazon com and Walmart  lower prices for generic drugs  declining store traffic  and a steady decline in reimbursement rates  
The company recently missed first quarter 2020 earnings estimates as earnings per share dropped 19 8  year over year to  0 95  Sales were up 1 6  to  34 3 billion  but net operating income dropped 27 6  to  1 billion 
Future plans
Despite the rough quarter  CEO Stefano Pessina maintains a flat growth outlook for 2020  The company is undergoing a turnaround plan that starts with cutting expenses by  1 8 billion by 2022  including the closure of about 200 stores  
In the first quarter earnings report  Pessina said 

We are maintaining our outlook for the year despite a soft first quarter  We are confident our strategic plans are the right ones to drive long term sustainable growth going forward  In addition  during the quarter we were very satisfied with the progress made in our Transformational Cost Management Program and with the strong cash flow we delivered  

Operating cash flow was  1 1 billion in the quarter  up  601 million year over year  Free cash flow    net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures    was  674 million  up  684 million  This strong cash flow created by the cost management plan will fund several new initiatives designed to drive growth  One is a partnership with German healthcare company McKesson to create a joint venture for the European market  Walgreens also partnered with supermarket chain Kroger to form a group purchasing organization to save costs  The company also has a plan to co locate Jenny Craig weight loss centers at various Walgreens stores and create VillageMD primary care clinics in some stores  It s part of an effort to give customers experiences and services they can t get online to drive more traffic 
While it seeks to increase offerings for in store customers  Walgreens is also trying to emulate Amazon and other online retailers by boosting its delivery capabilities  The company is testing a drone delivery service  becoming the first retailer in the country to do so  Given that an estimated 7  of the population lives within five miles of a Walgreens  this would significantly speed up delivery times  It s still testing and may be a few years off  but it shows where they are headed  
The outlook
So where will the company be in five years  It s probably safe to say that a Walgreens will still be there on the corner in your community like it has been for the past 119 years  But will it be good for investors  That s complicated  The first question is  Will it still be a public company  In November  Bloomberg reported that KKR  a private equity investor  had approached Walgreens about taking it private in a leveraged buyout deal  Then in December  The Wall Street Journal reported the deal fell through  Walgreens has not commented on any of the reports  but it s a potential development that investors should be aware of  
On the plus side  the stock price is near a six year low and has a price to earnings ratio that s less than 14 times earnings  Also  it has a very low debt ratio   These factors make it a stock to consider  But given the uncertainties  investors may want to take and wait and see approach before jumping in  While investors may not see positive results this year  the cost cutting measures and strategic initiatives put in place over the next few years should begin to bear fruit for investors inside five years ",2020-01-23,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pm3hq,2066613
178600,400116,WBA,Walgreens Boots Alliance Is Near Its 52 Week Low  Is Now the Time to Buy ,news,"Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  isn t off to a good start in 2020  Although last year wasn t great  with the stock down 14  and coming nowhere near the S P 500 s gains of 30   the stock has continued to fall this year and it s now getting close to its low for the past 12 months  At around  53 a share  the stock is near its 52 week low of  49 03  The last time the stock dipped like this was back in August 
That said  it s a good time for investors to evaluate whether Walgreens is a good buy or if it s likely to continue falling lower  Let s take a closer look 
Earnings are dragging down the company s performance thus far
The reason the company s been off to a poor start this year is that its first quarter 2020 report wasn t as impressive as investors were hoping for    with sales of  34 34 billion narrowly missing analyst expectations of  34 6 billion  It should be even less concerning given that a key part of the reason for the decline is that the company has been de emphasizing tobacco products  Otherwise  the pharmacy retailer may have easily surpassed estimates 
Although it s a narrow miss that s easily explainable  the stock has struggled to post gains since then as investors have been quick to push the sell button on the stock  Part of the reason is likely due to the company s results last year when Walgreens underwhelmed investors as well  When the bears are out and looking for a reason to sell shares of a company  it doesn t take much to sink a stock 

Why there s reason for optimism
Despite the bearishness  it s not all doom and gloom for Walgreens as the company can turn things around  For one thing  the company is making significant changes at its locations  including offering more services in store that give customers a reason to visit the store themselves and buy products there  as opposed to buying online from a competitor  The company is also looking at launching a drone delivery service that could make it very competitive with those very same online retailers 
These are just a couple of the ways that Walgreens can inject some life into its quarterly numbers  And a small boost may be all the company needs  The good news is that Walgreens didn t miss estimates by a lot in Q1  meaning that there may not be a lot for the company to do to bridge that gap and get investors excited about the stock again 
Is the stock too cheap to ignore 
One of the benefits of a stock that s dipped in value is that shares become cheap and it s an excellent opportunity to buy low and potentially sell higher later on when it recovers  At just 13 times earnings and two times its book value  Walgreens  stock is trading at a very attractive valuation  making it an appealing option for value investors to consider  Even growth investors may see a bargain given the stock s forward price to earnings ratio  which is less than nine 
As an added bonus  the stock also pays a dividend  which now  as a result of the decline  is yielding 3 6  per year  That s well above the S P 500 average of 1 85  and it can be a great way to pad the stock s returns  or at the very least  offset its losses should it continue to fall 
Overall  Walgreens is a top healthcare stock for investors to own that is not very volatile  pays a great dividend  still has many growth opportunities and is also not an expensive buy  It may only be a matter of time before the stock rallies  Investors may want to buy Walgreens before that happens ",2020-02-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pssi1,2079855
178611,400127,WBA,CVS  Walgreens  And Rite Aid Sue Doctors In Latest Move In Federal Opioid Case,news,"The opioid epidemic in the United States is a massive mess  Over 200 000 people have died from overdoses of prescription narcotics over the last 20 years  according to The Washington Post  Federal  state  and local governments have spent a lot of money dealing with opioid addiction  All these governments    and private plaintiffs    are now suing various pharmaceutical companies and drugstores for large sums of money 
But today  it was reported that drugstores including CVS Health  NYSE CVS  Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA   Rite Aid  NYSE RAD   and Walmart  NYSE WMT  are attempting to shift the culpability to the doctors who prescribed the pain killers that the drug stores filled 

In October  several companies agreed to pay two counties in Ohio  260 million in federal court opioid litigation  The companies involved included opioid distributors McKesson  NYSE MCK   AmerisourceBergen  NYSE ABC  and Cardinal Health  NYSE CAH   and opioid manufacturer Teva Pharmaceuticals  NYSE TEVA    Johnson   Johnson refused to settle  Last August  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  was ordered to pay  572 million to the state of Oklahoma in an opioid lawsuit  The company is appealing the ruling   
By admitting liability to the two counties in Ohio  the four above companies are in a weak position to negotiate in the multitude of lawsuits against them in other cities  counties  and states across the land  Plaintiff s attorneys are claiming the companies have admitted culpability  
A bipartisan group of state attorney generals attempted to negotiate a nationwide settlement with the above five companies  The five companies all agreed to pay out  48 billion dollars over a period of 18 years  That settlement was instantly rejected by other litigants   
Drugstores are also being sued in a separate opioid litigation  This October  a federal lawsuit begins against CVS  Walgreens Boots Alliance  and Rite Aid and other major pharmacy chains  This litigation is in the same two counties in Ohio  Summit and Cuyahoga  
What s news
On Monday  the drugstores turned around and filed suit against physicians across northeast Ohio  The claim is that the doctors who made the opioid prescriptions are just as much  perhaps more  to blame for the opioid crisis as the drugstores who fulfilled the prescriptions  
Of course  drugstores have much deeper pockets than individual doctors  many of whom would be bankrupted by a verdict against them in this litigation  The threat to put Ohio s doctors out of business shows just how high the stakes are  What is taking place in these two counties can and likely will be repeated in multiple lawsuits nationwide  The pressure is on for a nationwide settlement    and  48 billion is probably just a drop in the bucket ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfi8u,2055183

hand you over to Stefano Stefano Pessina    Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Gerald and hello everyone  As you will see from our figures  it has been a slow start to the financial year with a competitive US pharmacy environment and soft trading conditions in the UK  That said  as you will hear  there are a number of items affecting the year on year comparisons and given the initiatives that we have under way  we are maintaining our full year guidance In the quarter  we continued to make progress against all four of our core strategic priorities  We are making progress in moving our data resources to a new and more flexible cloud based infrastructure with a significant benefits that brings  We have also made a good progress with the development of new services to build on this new infrastructure to announce our customer experiences  make our teams more efficient and effective and open new opportunities for our businesses  Clearly  this work on the digitalization of our company must and are closely tie in with our work to modernize our retail offering and the shape and structure of our retail footprint  At the same time  we are working with partners to redefine the delivery of healthcare in the community and the important role of pharmacy in the immediate and longer term future  And all of these is of course supported and fueled by our Transformational Cost Management Program  which have made substantive progress during the quarter Finally  we have also continued to make progress on a number of significant partnerships  both established a new to enhance our offering and efficiency and toward the value growth in our businesses  In the quarter  we entered into a procurement joint venture with Kroger  building on the already strong relationship that has been formed between Kroger and Walgreens  And we announced a joint venture with McKesson to bring together our two businesses in Germany  improving our reach and scale with a focus on enhancing the efficiency and performance of whole  Phonetic  combined wholesale operation in the significant German pharmaceutical wholesale market I will come back to make a few comments on the future at the end of our presentation  But now  I will ask James and Alex to take us through the results in a little more detail  James James Kehoe    Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Stefano and good morning  Adjusted EPS was  1 37  5 7  lower than prior year on a constant currency basis  The year on year comparison was impacted by around 5 percentage points of adverse items including the year on year bonus impact  In Retail Pharmacy USA  strong cost management and improved retail comp sales were offset by lower gross margin  Retail Pharmacy International continued to be negatively impacted by a challenging UK market and we saw continued strong performance from Pharmaceutical Wholesale  Our Transformational Cost Management Program is very much on track and we expect to achieve annual cost savings in excess of  1 8 billion by 2022  Cash generation was very strong in the quarter with free cash flow of  674 million   684 million better than prior year And finally  we are maintaining our guidance for fiscal year  20 of flat adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis with a range of plus or minus 3   Looking forward  we see improved core business trends with however some noise in the second quarter as we cycle through the timing of reimbursement payments and year on year bonus impacts  In total  these result in an expected EPS headwind of around 13   but both of these items were budgeted in fiscal year  20 and have no impact on full year guidance Let s now look in more detail on the results  First quarter sales were up 1 6  including a currency headwind of 0 7   On a constant currency basis  sales were up 2 3   Adjusted operating income declined 15 4  on a constant currency basis  reflecting lower gross margin in the US and a difficult UK market  Adjusted EPS was  1 37  a constant currency decline of 5 7   Our share repurchase program contributed 4 percentage points of growth and an additional 5 7 percentage points came from a favorable tax rate as we benefited from a number of discrete items  The result included adverse items of over 5 percentage points  including the year on year bonus impact  mark to market adjustments and lapping prior year supplier funding  GAAP EPS declined 19 8  to  0 95 and also reflected costs relating to the Rite Aid transaction and the implementation of the Transformational Cost Management Program Now let s move to Retail Pharmacy USA  Sales increased 1 6  in the quarter with 2 9  growth in pharmacy  partially offset by lower retail sales  Note that the sales growth includes a negative impact of 50 basis points due to our store optimization programs  Adjusted gross profit declined 4 9  due to lower pharmacy and retail gross profit  Adjusted SG A spend decreased 1 6  in the quarter and was 17 6  of sales  an improvement of 0 6 percentage points versus prior year  The decline in SG A clearly shows our strong execution against our Transformational Cost Management Program with savings more than offsetting incremental investments  the impact of inflation and the year on year bonus impact  Adjusted operating income declined 16 2  as the SG A savings were not enough to offset the decline in gross profit and the adverse items I mentioned earlier  In total  these adverse items accounted for over 6 percentage points of the decline in operating income Now let s look in more detail at Pharmacy  Total Pharmacy sales increased 2 9  versus prior year  reflecting continued brand inflation and script volume growth  Central specialty sales continue to grow nicely  up 9 3  versus prior year  Comp pharmacy sales were up 2 5  and comp scripts grew 2 8   While this was weaker than expected  we have seen improved growth in recent weeks  Market share for the quarter was 20 9   down 55 basis points versus prior year including the impact from our store optimization program  Adjusted gross profit decreased mid single digit  as the impact of procurement savings and script growth was more than offset by reimbursement pressure Turning next to our US Retail business  Total Retail sales declined 2 2  in the quarter  impacted by store optimization  Comp retail sales declined 0 5  and continued to show an improving trend  Excluding tobacco and e cigarettes  comp sales were up 0 8   As you know  we are exiting the sale of e cigarettes  While this did not have a significant impact on comps this quarter  it will have a bigger impact from the next quarter onwards and we continue to anticipate a full year EPS impact of around  0 06  We saw a solid comp growth in our core categories with health and wellness up 3 3  and beauty up 2 5   We estimate a tailwind of around 80 basis points from cough  cold  flu  Retail adjusted gross profit declined low single digits due to lower sales including the impact of store optimization programs  higher shrink and the timing of prior year supplier funding  Adjusted gross margin declined slightly  however  excluding the higher shrink and supplier funding timing underlying category margins were in line with prior year Turning next to Retail Pharmacy International  And as usual  I will talk to constant currency numbers  Sales decreased 2 7   mainly due to the UK and Chile  Boots UK comp pharmacy sales increased 0 9  in the quarter  reflecting relatively higher NHS reimbursement levels and increased sales from services  partly offset by lower script volume  Boots UK comp retail sales declined 2 9   as the UK High Street continued to be very challenging  However  overall  we held market share  Adjusted operating income was down 39 1   mainly due to lower UK retail sales volume and margin  The results include an adverse impact of 13 percentage points from the year on year bonus impact and higher technology investments Turning now to the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division  which I ll also discuss in constant currency  The Pharmaceutical Wholesale division delivered another strong quarter with sales up 8 3   led by emerging markets and the UK  The change in the customer contract  which I ve mentioned before  helped our UK performance contributing 1 4  to the overall sales growth  We have now lapped the impact of this contract change  Adjusted operating income increased 4 9   reflecting strong revenue performance and a higher contribution from AmerisourceBergen  This strategic joint venture with McKesson aims to drive sustainable profitable growth in the largest pharmaceutical drug market in Europe by leveraging scale and improving efficiency  Mid term  we expect the JV to be EPS accretive and to accelerate our Pharmaceutical Wholesale profit growth Turning next to cash flow  Operating cash flow was  1 1 billion  up  601 million versus prior year  Free cash flow was strong at  674 million  up  684 million on prior year  Our key working capital initiatives are on track  We are removing excess inventory from the system and we have started to extend payment terms to industry leading levels and we have a strong pipeline of initiatives to fuel our cash flow generation over a multiyear period Let s turn now to our Transformational Cost Management Program  In October  we raised our annual cost savings target to in excess of  1 8 billion by fiscal 2022  We now have a very robust pipeline and our savings initiatives are gaining momentum  This gives us a much higher level of confidence that we can exceed  1 8 billion target  Importantly  these savings will allow us to fund the investments needed to create new and innovative business models Let me now give you some detail on our activities in the quarter  On smart spend  we are accelerating our energy management efficiency program and we see opportunities to ramp up our procurement activities in goods not for resale  The Energy Management Program is interesting  ULED lighting saves money  is environmentally friendly and improves the store experience for consumers  This is a perfect example of save to invest to grow  On smart organization  we re undertaking an end to end process review in Boots UK  covering all major business processes with the aim of transforming how we operate  ultimately leading to a lean and effective operating model  We are now actively planning the implementation of global business services and we have implemented the second wave of headquarter cost reductions in Mexico  Chile  and Thailand On divisional optimization  we have completed 114 of the 200 Walgreens store closures and 28 of the 200 Boots UK closures  We continue to test new store formats in the US and we re now operating 23 small stores with encouraging results  On IT  we have started implementation of a new operating model and our vendor optimization work is progressing well  For example  we recently selected Tata Consulting Services as our new partner to accelerate the work on our critical pharmacy operating system  On digitalization  we have prioritized investments in mass personalization and reinventing the pharmacy prescription journey Now  I ll hand over to Alex Alex Gourlay    Co Chief Operating OfficerThank you  James  I ll now update you in some of the actions we ve taken in the US during the quarter  starting with a retail offering  Our strategic partnership with Kroger is progressing well  The initial Kroger Express pilot in Northern Kentucky has been running for just over one year and the pilot in Knoxville  Tennessee for five months  We ve seen very positive results so far with a strong sales list  Phonetic   Building on the success of these pilots  we formed the group procurement office  retail procurement alliance with Kroger in December to purchase both of our private label goods  We expect this joint venture to deliver cost savings  encourage sourcing innovation and generate efficiencies across the supply chain  Our strategy of focusing on the higher margin health and wellness and beauty categories is delivering benefits and both delivered solid performances in the quarter  Our flagship No7 beauty brand performed well with sales up in the mid teens  reflecting nationwide advertising campaign in our new e commerce site and we have introduced an enhanced skincare offering in over 900 stores  which we expect to drive future performance Moving on to healthcare  We have opened the second of five VillageMD primary care locations in Houston  Our wellness partnership with Jenny Craig is progressing well and we are on track to open approximately 100 locations by the end of January  We re also in the process of converting our optical pilots to the  Indecipherable  brand  which offers improved insurance coverage and stronger consumer brands In specialty  I m delighted to see that all 300 community based specialty pharmacies have received URAC accreditation and we continue to believe that our strong community based presence alongside our central fill capability provides the best access for these important medications to our patients in the marketplace  In partnership with UnitedHealthcare  we continue to create new opportunities for growth in Medicare Advantage  We are very pleased with customer adoption of the new core branded Medicare Advantage product  we started selling from October 15th 2019  And finally  we are also opening 14 UnitedHealthcare patient resource centers  designed to help our customers navigate their insurance and healthcare needs within Walgreens stores Turning next to digitalization  Our Find Care platform now has 32 healthcare service providers  spanning over 46 services  We continue to develop our patient medication adherence programs to deliver better clinical outcomes  Our Save A Trip Refills program now has 3 million patients signed up  an increase of over 25  since last quarter  Our consumers continue to demand the convenient omni channel retail shopping experience  I m pleased to say we had record breaking sales on walgreens com on the Black Friday weekend  up over 45  versus the prior year and particularly strong performance in retail products  Indecipherable   Overall  our omnichannel business continues to grow  Our Walgreens app has now been downloaded 60 million times  up 12  since last year  Around 33  of Walgreens retail refill scripts eligible for digital refill were entered via digital channels in the quarter  up almost 18  since last year  And we have increased our Balance Rewards members to 89 9 million  Finally  Walgreens digitally initiated sales reached over  3 7 billion in the quarter  up around 9  year over year Next I will update you on initiatives we ve undertaken in Retail Pharmacy International  starting with the retail  In Boots UK  as you know  we ve introduced our beauty reinvention program to 26 of our flagship beauty hauls in the second half of last year  I m pleased to report that we ve seen an improved performance in these stores in line with our expectations  Building on this  we rebalanced the retail space in 200 of our largest stores and have introduced 20 new beauty brands  Since the quarter end  we have signed an exclusive UK franchise agreement with Mothercare  a British retailer and brand  specializing in products for mothers  babies  and children  We will be selling Mothercare branded goods across the UK and online Moving on to healthcare  Our purpose built pharmacy operating system has been rolled out to over 1 400 Boots to UK stores  allowing our pharmacists to provide a greater level of customer service  even more efficiency and over time a wider range of new pharmacy offerings  And we continue to develop new healthcare services with diagnostics where our pharmacists now have the ability to write prescriptions for certain conditions  I mentioned last quarter that we are developing new initiatives in digital healthcare with plans for expanding pharmacy services  to improve the customer journey and broaden access to healthcare  We launched our online pharmacy in May 2019  which has made solid progress in the markets  We have made further good progress on digitalization  Our online business  boots com delivered strong growth with sales up 12  versus prior year in the quarter  We also saw a record breaking Black Friday weekend with result in online sales  up around 25   And finally  we have agreed an exclusive partnership to offer omnichannel photo and personalized gifting services in the UK and Ireland I ll now hand you back to Stefano for his closing comments Stefano Pessina    Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Alex  As you have heard  this year has opened with a number of challenges  The main changes that are impacting the global healthcare sector are generating some difficult conditions for our businesses  As said  change always brings opportunity  We must act to meet the challenges and ensure we make the most of the opportunities we see  Seeing these opportunities and mindful of the challenges side  we are maintaining our full year guidance for the year  We continuously review our Group to ensure we have the right mix of businesses  to maximize our performance in a dynamic sector  Pursuing our strategic priorities is having a real impact in driving our businesses  The changes in our markets are obscuring some of the positive impacts we are having  but these will not be the case forever I have said before and I will say again  I strongly believe in an expanded role for pharmacy and in our company s ability to play a significant part in shaping how healthcare is delivered in the community going forward  I believe these as much today as I ever have  I believe we have true financial strength as a business  As we have demonstrated this quarter  we have an extraordinary ability to generate strong and sustainable cash flow and we have many opportunities to deploy this cash flow to create real value  I remain convinced that we have in our company through our partnership an extraordinary foundation on which to build  The work that we are doing today is creating a strong and flexible engine of our growth in our businesses for many years to come Thank you  Now we will take your questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs  Your line is open Robert Jones    Goldman Sachs   Co     AnalystGreat  thanks  Thanks for taking the question  I know there s a lot of moving pieces and it s only the first quarter  but if I just take a step back  clear EPS was down around 6  in the quarter  below the full fiscal year guidance  it sounds like  James  if I m hearing you correctly next quarter given some of the moving pieces  it could see an even steeper decline in EPS  I guess if we think about the back half  could you maybe just give us the building blocks or the things that you guys have visibility into that gives you confidence that the back half can get you into that flat plus or minus 3  EPS for the year James Kehoe    Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial OfficerYeah  That s an expected question  obviously  Let me just give you a little bit of context on the first quarter  However  first  I think the only real surprise we had in the first quarter was on the script volume  it did come in weaker than we expected  We were thinking of a number of around 4  and we come in at 2 8   that s the piece that    and I want to be clear  Our internal budget was  1 37 and we came in over budget  What we had was a favorability on tax  offsetting script growth in Q1  So that was the one thing we were disappointed on We had a lot of stuff we re very happy about  so free cash flow was off the charts  we beat our internal budget by hundreds of millions  largely driven by programs we re implementing in the US  As Stefano said in his comments  Transformational cost management program and that s key to the answer to your question is  I will classify it right now is well ahead of track  particularly due to actions in the US and the U K  Another items I d highlight that shouldn t be lost on you  we finally we have nailed one of the first steps in the Kroger relationship  We think it s extremely positive that we have started up a GPO  And I think it will lead to many good things in the future  And then finally a strategic deal in a problematic German wholesale market  which we think will drive tremendous value longer term  So we think there was a lot of good things that happened and script growth was the one that was more challenging Let me give you a prospect of looking forward is    and actually we re a little bit surprised as well  We re seeing quite a strong momentum in the current month of December  So we believe when we call out 5 percentage points of items in the first quarter  we re probably under calling that  that were clear shifts between call at the Thanksgiving period  Christmas periods and I don t want to give the precise number  but our script growth is in solid mid single digit growth in the month of December  So we re clearly feeling that we re not really reading why the shifts are happening that well  We know cough  cold  flu is driving some of the buoyancy in December  So we are seeing signals  but we are counting on to hit our full year guidance  We do need or script growth to be in the 3 5  to 4  kind of  maybe 4 5  depending on the quarter  But right now in December  we re seeing numbers in excess of that  So script growth is the key one  The other key one is that will drive increasing performance as we exit the year  Obviously  as you take out costs  the cost take out is over the course of the year  So the savings roughly in the first quarter are around 15   So of the total goal of    we haven t given the numbers  a large number were less than 15  in Q1  As we exit the year  we will be up double the run rate of savings  So overheads will become a much more significant driver in the second half  And I do want to point out for that  for a company of our size with the amount of overheads we have  the total overheads were down 1 6  in the quarter  In the context    and I think it s important to have the context  we did say that the combination of inflation and volume impacts is about  400 million  you have the bonus year on year that s in the region of  350 million   400 million and we have incremental investments of  100 million to  150 million  So it will give you some indication of the size of the cost management initiatives  And I think we ll come back next quarter with probably more visibility on the potential further opportunity on the cost program  but I just finished answering your question  I think if you were to do your model again for the full year  we will probably have a slight favorability in taxes  So call it somewhat 0 6   0 7  on the full year and we will have more coming from overheads and probably slightly less coming from gross profit because we had a miss in the first quarter on scripts  So that s why we feel it s basically the overheads and some tax opportunity that we feel we can offset the call of the script under delivery in Q1 Does that cover what you were looking for Robert Jones    Goldman Sachs   Co     AnalystThat s tremendously helpful  And I guess just one other probably anticipated question again  Just around the prime relationship in the wake of the Prime Express Cigna announcement  Just wanted to get any update on how you guys are viewing the Prime relationship  any impact of the Alliance or ex JV just as we think about how that relationship played out for you this past year relative to your expectations or how it would contribute in 2020 would be helpful  Thank you Alex Gourlay    Co Chief Operating OfficerHi Bob  it s Alex here  Yeah  We have recontacted with Prime in a direct relationship  So Prime is now working with Express Scripts as a PBM working with us in a direct relationship  so we anticipate to hold our market share with Prime and potentially grow as a Prime model will be more competitive in a marketplace  So our relationship with Prime continues to be a very strong one and we continue to walk you very well with independent blues  Phonetic   So we are happy with the situation  In terms of the impact  obviously we ve readjusted the margin of debts  but it really was in forecast in budget  So we had expected this impact and had planned for it On AllianceRx side  AllianceRx actually is doing OK at the moment  But again  we have a great relationship with Prime  We are speaking to them  how do we adopt to an ever changing specialty marketplace  which is becoming even more important for both of us  We expect to have conversations next year along these lines to improve that model further  So all is good from our point of view and we wish Prime success with their new model and in that work we feel very confident that we will benefit from that relationship in the future Robert Jones    Goldman Sachs   Co     AnalystThank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Eric Percher from Nephron Research  Your line is open Eric Percher    Nephron Research LLC    AnalystThank you and thanks for the commentary on the cadence with respect to volume and cost  Maybe to hit on one other item  reimbursement and the impact on 1 1 20  I know you gave us a 13  number  I think was reimbursement and bonus  but can you provide a little bit more context on what the outlook is as we move from Q1 into Q2 on 1 1 20 James Kehoe    Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial OfficerYeah  The 13  reference was to Q2 and we re specifically highlighting two things in the quarter  And I would say it s like 7  due to reimbursement timing and the other  Phonetic  is 6  is due to bonus year on year  And the reason we called out the Q2 reimbursement is  it really is a timing item  it s a true up of prior year contracts that occurs typically in the April  May  June timeline of the year  And as it happened in the prior year  there was no true up  So it s not really a reimbursement impact year on year in terms of increase in contract prices  it s a contractual true up of the contract for prior year and it s quite a large number because it impacts 7 percentage points  We didn t actually call out anything on Q1  What we said about Q1 is reimbursement was actually broadly in line with the plans we ve put together  because if you recall when we gave guidance  we said at the time that    I think 58  or 60  of all of our contracts were already defined when we gave guidance  so we had fairly decent line of sight to the full year reimbursement  And we came within  20 million of the reimbursement estimate for the first quarter  So we were actually quite pleased with that because it s quite difficult to forecast reimbursement  And you know we have looked back on some of our prior guidance on the quarters and the reason for giving something on Q2 just to highlight this exceptional reimbursement of timing true up  Right now as we sit  we have no reason to call any different outlook on reimbursement for the full year  We should presume that means plus or minus  50 million  So it s    we were pleasantly surprised with the Q1 on that side  And I reiterate our issue on pharmacy in Q1  nothing to do with procurement  nothing to do with reimbursement  they were actually net  probably slightly positive  it was probably  it was all script volume  So it was just lighter than we would have planned it to be Eric Percher    Nephron Research LLC    AnalystThat s really helpful  And reimbursement in the UK  it sounds like NHS funding did improve  but we didn t see it in the revenue line  Was this simply the new contract or have you seen any makeover for the debt and the lack of payment last year Alex Gourlay    Co Chief Operating OfficerSo again there is really two stories here  Hi  it s Alex here  One is  as you say there has been a stabilization of payment  which is in the marketplace can be seen on the NHS site  And secondly  we have taken some actions to reduce loss making services that we have in the UK and to make them more profitable  As a result of that we ve lost some volume  not as much volume as we had expected to be honest  but some volume  And we re quite pleased that with the retention of customers with these actions and that s what s caused a slight further decrease in terms of our revenue in the UK  it s not reimbursement  it s actions we ve taken to reduce loss making services that we were offering Eric Percher    Nephron Research LLC    AnalystThank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore  Your line is open Elizabeth Anderson    Evercore ISI    AnalystHi  good morning guys  A couple of times you mentioned or should have alluded to potentially a little bit of a change in competitive environment in the US Pharmacy or perhaps some pressure on or versus your expectations in the quarter in terms of script growth  Could you comment more broadly on sort of what you re seeing there and sort of your thoughts on how that s progressing Alex Gourlay    Co Chief Operating OfficerHi Elizabeth  it s Alex here  I think as the consolidation in the market has really accelerated both vertically and horizontally  and as for example  the Prime Express deal is a good example of this  The PBMs are working more closely together  That s clearly putting more pressure on the marketplace for better pricing and that s really what we are alluding to  So we are working hard as James has said  as we always have done to mitigate that pressure through cost programs and through driving volume  As James is going to say very clearly  we were disappointed with the volume growth in Q1  Part of that was timing as James has said and part of that is because the fact that we lost some access to some particular  some Medicaid networks during the summer  that is rolling into this year  And  as we spoke to    I think it was the last quarter  we re working    investigating obviously with Advanced Rx  Indecipherable  the opportunity for us to to become more efficient together and offer a new model in the Medicaid business  We recognize that we are under share there and we have to operate differently in that marketplace In Medicare  we continue to do very well with UnitedHealthcare  We re really pleased with the relationship and the new MA plan as we ve spoke to in the prepared comments has done well and we expect that will come through in the changes in January 1  Obviously  we are doing less  well  with the other a strong performer  which is Aetna Insurance  We have done really well and we are doing less  well  with them for maybe obvious reasons  But in the whole  we feel we are going to be there or thereabouts in Medicare Then in commercial  already said and replied previously  they will be very pleased to have renewed the contract with Prime  which again is a very important book of business for us in the commercial network  So I think that s the picture from my point of view  And I don t know if  Indecipherable  question Elizabeth that s how we see it and all underpins the 3 5  to 4  volume growth that we expect to see in the full year Elizabeth Anderson    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  perfect  That s very helpful  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan  Your line is open Lisa Gill    JP Morgan    AnalystThanks very much  Good morning  I wanted to start with just some thoughts around branded inflation as well as generic procurement in the current market  As we think about the gross margins and how this will impact it  I m just wondering  James  first  can you just talk about what s in your current expectation and guidance James Kehoe    Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial OfficerWhat we saw in    I ll tell you what we ve seen in Q1  We saw branded inflation of around 4  and we    most of the market read seem to be the inflation and this is on a constant mix basis  so like for like SKUs  deflation of around 4   We would say that internally    on generics  sorry  And maybe I ll ask Alex to weigh in  And then two is we would be outperforming versus that 4  will probably be in mid to high single digit and we generally are projecting that kind of number going forward  somewhere in the mid to high single digit deflation mix adjustment  which is    it s probably quarters will change versus market  but generally that s what we re seeing in the market and we re delivering slightly better in terms of cost reduction in the P L I don t know Alex  if you want to add Alex Gourlay    Co Chief Operating OfficerYeah  I think the  Indecipherable  and we continue to feel very good about our global operation and we via attack  Phonetic  delivering just slightly beyond  Indecipherable  reductions in COGS  cost of goods  So that s exactly what we are seeing James Kehoe    Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial OfficerYeah Alex Gourlay    Co Chief Operating OfficerYeah Lisa Gill    JP Morgan    AnalystAnd then Alex  you talked about a number of healthcare initiatives and updates  a few of that you didn t touched on today would be LabCorp  and Humana  One  on the LabCorp side  can you just talk about where you are today  are you on track  On the Humana side  any plans to expand  Can you talk about United on the Medicare Advantage side  I m curious what you re doing with Humana  And then just more broadly speaking  the strategic priority for expanding the role of pharmacy  as you know I m a big believer in that as well  But with the reimbursement pressure  do you ever see that subsiding in any way where you can actually get ahead of that where you can start to change the paradigm and I know I ve asked this for multiple years  but do you finally think that you can start to see that on the horizon as you start to have bigger and bigger relationships like north of 100 million lives now in the combination of Prime and Express  you think about large relationships like United Alex Gourlay    Co Chief Operating OfficerSo I think maybe start with the Humana questions  So we ve opened up preferred partners in primary care  It looks very good and is operating really well and the relationship between the pharmacist and doctors is really close  So we continue to feel really good about that  very small  but important test joint venture and of course  we ve opened up two also with the clinical VillageMD which I m sure you know  down in Houston will be five in total by the end of February  And again  we are very  very pleased with how that s operating already  We ve taken a small stake in that company  VillageMD as well  which we re pleased to do and we see that partnership of the doctor and the pharmacist been fundamental to the future of community healthcare delivery going forward in core to our model on the lending lots about how we can do two things  take cost out the system together and get customers to understand and do the medications better and change the lifestyles  And so it s really interesting walk and it points to maybe your last question  So that s on the Humana On LabCorp  we re bang on track in terms of number of service centers opened  I think we ll have well over 100 in the ground by the end of this quarter  I think that s really bang on track and they are performing well  We are seeing NPS scores and the usage of the centers all in or above our expectations  so we are very pleased with our program and we expect 600 and maybe more  we don t know yet in the ground within the four years as we promised  And role of pharmacist  we are working really hard to get our new system in  As James spoke to in prepared remarks  we re going to be accelerating that system from the current pace  That will be fundamental to be in the cloud  the date will be in the cloud  it will be fundamental to taking the work code out and freeing up our pharmacists to really drive that in future We re seeing increased payments from certain insurers and PBMs  particularly in Medicare D  We really like working with United because they are stretching to this in terms of getting the payment  but the very clear on the goalposts that we have to hit to get the payment and we ve been successful in achieving that  I do believe other insurance companies will follow their leads and the government eventually will also make sure that we have clear KPIs going forward as well  So  yeah  it s a longer play for sure  but we are really committed to and we re making more progress and appears right now than our numbers on and we continue to keep on pushing this to fundamental to pharmacy and fundamental we believe to a more efficient healthcare system in the US Lisa Gill    JP Morgan    AnalystAnd then just for understanding that none of that is in your expectation for 2020  So I heard you say longer term a couple of times in this conversation  so should we anticipate that this could potentially impact fiscal 2021 or 2022  How do we just think about it from a timing perspective Alex Gourlay    Co Chief Operating OfficerYeah  We are already earning some money back  as you know the famous  Indecipherable  well  So we are earning more money back than we did previously and the amount of money available to us is growing and our ability to get that money grows as we get our systems in and of course  we re also deploying pharmacy specific of pharmacists  I think we have about 150 Internet work who are specifically working to achieve these performance outcomes  So I think this will start to affect  21 and  22  It s already given us some relief in  20 as well  There is improved money in our forecast for performance networks Lisa Gill    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you for the comments OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Soo Romanoff from Morningstar  Your line is open Soo Romanoff    Morningstar    AnalystThank you for taking the question  The background you ve given on a lot of initiatives have been great  perhaps maybe specialties become such a big component of your business  I mean is that  is that mix also impacting the margins as well James Kehoe    Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial OfficerYeah  We called that out in the quarter  It impact by about 50 basis points because it s growing at high single digit versus the pharmacy scripts of 2 8   so it s driving adverse mix of 50 basis points Soo Romanoff    Morningstar    AnalystAnd I guess that makes sense  I mean  do the initiatives that you re kind of putting in place help expand those margins or also provide kind of that long term wellness and part of the healthcare transformation Alex Gourlay    Co Chief Operating OfficerYeah  Absolutely  Soo  I mean  we strongly believe in having a community presence and as you know  we have two models  We have one  which of course to the doctors who are practicing and specialty for example in oncology and then we have pharmacies inside of their hospitals and sort of healthcare systems  We have 300 plus of these and we ve now got URAC accreditation for them all  So every single pharmacy that we run in the community  which is very unusual I believe will be fast to achieve this has got that accreditation  That means more attractive to the manufacturers  because they know that we will take full care of the patient and more and more patients are living longer with diseases in communities  So we believe the local model that will become important to the future of healthcare delivery and always be a central fill model  I m sure  but we believe the local model will become more and more important Also  we announced our relationship with Shields  Shields as a variance  I think platform that s working with healthcare systems and we have a lot of relationships with healthcare systems as you know to make sure as patients leave hospitals  they maintain themselves on the drugs  being dispensed primarily by the hospital pharmacy  So again  we are investing both in technology with Shields and also  Indecipherable  as well in terms of data and tracking customers and low community pharmacies to make sure pharmacist can actually take care of these customers as it lifts and more often a home and we re also of course working closely with Prime as we said already to make sure that we have a really efficient and effective central model And most importantly of all we have  outstanding relationships with the manufacturers  it s really driven  both through our relationship with AmerisourceBergen and also the Ornella with her team at global level to make sure that we have the very best relationships  So while these manufacturers are bringing these new and unique products to the markets and we feel as a global partner we can apply our capabilities for them in the US market through our relationship OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell from Baird  Your line is open Eric Coldwell    Robert W  Baird   Co     AnalystThank you very much  I know it s difficult to parse this out with the store closings in the UK as well as the shift to more services from volume perhaps  but could you give us a clear sense on the impact of the NHS reimbursement scheme change either quarter over quarter or year over year  And then how did that really stack up compared to your expectations  It sounds OK  but I d like to get a little more detail on that in terms of not only the quarter over quarter  but also how that progresses through the next few quarters  Thank you Alex Gourlay    Co Chief Operating OfficerSure  Yeah  I know  It s Alex here  No  it was exactly as we expected  So the quarter for pharmacy both in volume as I said already were slightly below or on the market in terms of underlying business  but we gave up some scripts because of some unprofitable services  In terms of margin  exactly as we had expected  This tracking too as we expected  So it s relatively easy to track this because the government resigned the five year contract with the industry through what s called the PSNC  which represents all pharmacies in the UK as a one contract  So we can track this quite carefully  It does vary sometimes from from quarter to quarter  but it s trued up in a way which is transparent  So we feel very confident that we ve got a good line of sight to this  We feel very confident that we are working operationally very well in the UK and we have additional piece of work there  which is called pharmacy of the future  an idea really is to transform the operating model for pharmacy in the UK  This will take some time of course  We ve already marked that investment  we are investing strongly in a new farm system  we ve rolled out 1 400 which is well over half of the  Indecipherable  state and it s now present all the home countries including Scotland most recently  So again we are feeling pretty good about the visibility  We re not feeling as good about the profitability of pharmacy  We believe that that needs to improved further  so that we can reinvest back in community pharmacy properly in the years ahead  But we are very committed to getting that operating model understood and changed over time James Kehoe    Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial OfficerYeah  If you want to characterize the euro of prior year  it was a tough year for pharmacy where there were a lot of untime impacts coming from NHS funding  and there will be a general euro recovery from that  It was surprising  We were within  500 000 of the gross profit targets for pharmacy in the UK  it was bang on target  We are looking at a fairly sizable improvement in gross profit in the business this year  So as Alex mentioned earlier in his comments  we have some marginal profitability businesses on the sidelines and we re aggressively driving the improvement of those  So don t be surprised if you see script volumes and market share going down slightly  We re addressing the profitability of sub categories that we don t think are strategic to the company and we definitely don t want to be in marginal profitability positions  So a bit of a shift in the orientation in the business  slightly more to profitability  So as your modeling is out  don t get fixated by script declines because the core business is actually quite solid and solid in the quarter Eric Coldwell    Robert W  Baird   Co     AnalystYeah  Got it  Thank you very much James Kehoe    Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial OfficerAnd just one point on the UK though as we go through it  We did have a rough quarter in retail and it really does come down to the market and our share of the    whole share overall quite interestingly though we ve seen in the last couple of weeks and it s maybe a little bit important as you think through your modeling  We had a rough quarter  not 40  decline  now there was a lot of one time items in there  probably half of that was one time adverse items just generally  but as you think through this  we saw a very  very strong Christmas period  There are huge phasing on  mainly of our primary markets  The whole December month started out extremely slow  The second last week of the month was extremely strong with high single digit revenue growth  And in the last week of the year  we again have mid to high single digit growth across our key categories and we re still getting in on bisecting just what happened  but December performance is quite a bit more positive than the quarter we just came out of  And the double surprise was it was achieved with higher margins than the prior year  So we re rebalancing the commercial approach in the UK and we re not chasing volume at any cost and surprisingly we re seeing better volumes and we re seeing better margins  Now it s only two weeks  so it s too early to churn success  but we ve seen a better performance across December across the entire the main two markets  actually both businesses have done quite well in the Christmas period  very well actually OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo from UBS  Your line is open Kevin Caliendo    UBS Investment Bank    AnalystHi  thanks for taking my call  You mentioned you had 60  of your PBM contract set when you gave guidance and now you ve renewed Prime  What remains outstanding and how much variance is there really at this point  Could there be an reimbursements as we look out over the rest of the year Alex Gourlay    Co Chief Operating OfficerHi Kevin  it s Alex here  Firstly  I mean there ll be some small net works which can change mid year for sure  but the vast majority now is contracted  the vast majority  I can t give a precise number  but I will always give you an estimate  it will over 90  because the consolidation market is very clear  And yeah  so that s where we are  But so we feel we have good line of state in this fiscal year and again we will start negotiating the majority of the Med D contracts as we move through the summer months  but that will be before starting January 1st 2021 Kevin Caliendo    UBS Investment Bank    AnalystAnd the renewal Prime that takes you through  is it more than a one year contract  meaning like the Express relationship won t have any impact on that at all going forward Alex Gourlay    Co Chief Operating OfficerThat s right  I mean  we don t disclose the length of the contracts  but this is a multi year deal  typical of a longish commercial contract Kevin Caliendo    UBS Investment Bank    AnalystGot it  And one last one  Have you guys looked at the OECD proposals around multinational corporation tax rules  They are obviously still just proposals  but wondering if they were implemented  but will it any way impact Walgreens or WBAD or anything like that Stefano Pessina    Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe have I would say quite expert tax group and they are extremely active  they are all over this think you have to wait till dust settles on these things  but we would obviously realign the corporate structure according to new legislation as it comes along  We think that we    that s in a    it s in the right location  It delivers attractive tax positions  but it s all vetted and approved by all jurisdictions globally and it s in line with current policy  As policies change globally  we will adapt to the policies  but we have an attractive tax rate compared to our peer set by quite a number of percentage points and we ll try and maintain that as much as possible  but you can be sure the team is all over this and we don t see any short term risks Kevin Caliendo    UBS Investment Bank    AnalystGreat  Thanks so much  That s really helpful OperatorOur last question comes from Michael Cherny from Bank of America  Your line is open Michael Cherny    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThanks for squeezing me in here  So I want to tie back I guess a big picture question  At the beginning you talked about the broader strategy you re taking  I know you mentioned the role of pharmacy going forward  you ve highlighted a number of the various different partnerships  I guess as you think about the next call or rest of this fiscal year two  three years  what are some of the checkpoints you re looking for relative to the partnership model  relative to the strategy  relative to the EBIT contribution from all of these to essentially declare success or if some of them are going to kind of cut bait  And how does that play into the broader on thought process around the organization and the role and where you sit in the market on a go forward basis given as well but you re also going through a pretty broad restructuring about the cost base and the store footprint Alex Gourlay    Co Chief Operating OfficerThanks  Michael  Yeah  It s Alex here  So I think if we start with our key  Phonetic  priorities and they know that they start with managing of the drug store and new retail offerings  But probably more advanced with the Kroger relationship and the reason why that s quite important is because it allows us to do two things  allows us to walk with them on the convenience model  which is really important to drive footfall into our physical stores and also really important from a consumer point of view  the definition of convenience is such a big change in the marketplace  So we are feeling really good about that  I said in my prepared remarks  we are seeing substantial sales growth both in the box itself and also in the categories that we are supporting  We ve also launched our own products  I think we ve got    we re going to have them in the  Indecipherable  just over 15  16  17 Kroger stores so that for this gives us an opportunity to put our health and beauty composition and private label on brands into their customers views as well And then lastly  when you put together the two customer sets  we serve together around about 20 million customers a day between us  So we have a strong  strong presence in American households and our ability therefore to work with them being the the genuine  Indecipherable  part of America and those being very  very competent  we believe in pharmacy health and to some extent beauty category as it relates to healthcare and wellness  We believe that s going to be a strong opportunity  The procurement structure allows us to earn money in the short to medium term  And of course we will be working together on other issues in the supply chain and also in other issues on procurement we believe as well in the future  So that s one area where I think we have made good progress both tactically and strategically With healthcare  we are well into testing quality brands and quality offers in partnership with others  sort of the acceleration of our lessons learned and optical is one example of it  We are working with GrandVision who are renowned as a quality optical retailer with access to insurance and the very best brands  We really are delighted to get more opportunities to be doctors into our stores alongside pharmacists and we believe that  well  that will be a longer term model  We know from experience in Europe that that model can be really effective in delivering end to end primary care in communities And last but not least into the Find Care platform that we have built very quietly with an internal team has really grown and we believe that will be a digital marketplace that will become very important to us into the market in the future  but will take time to grow  So that s really where we are in terms of that measure  So we expect some contribution over time in the retail side faster than the contribution maybe in the healthcare side but the healthcare side will come through the hill  Phonetic  of scripts over time and the access to more James Kehoe    Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial OfficerAnd maybe one we didn t get this question  but progress on digitalization in the quarter  We ve just launched two major initiatives launched and funded  I want to kind of go back to the previous guidance we gave  We ve got  500 million of capital expenditures behind digital and development plus about  100 million to  150 million of expense this year and we launched two big initiatives in the last account  One is on mass personalization  And that s how do you use your marketing dollars more effectively to target a better connection with the consumer  We believe we will significantly underpin particularly the retail revenue profile for a multi year period  And these are not small investments  they are in the  50 million to  100 million range  And the second one is the  the prescription journey and I use that one very generically  but again it s a similar size of investment and it s on a two speed  we re not waiting for the core systems to be upgraded  it s on a parallel process and this is a 2 ish journey and what s it going to do what s going to connect the consumer much more closely with the prescription  how they want to deliver  how they want to pay for it  the transparency of the cost of it and the options we give consumers and getting closer to consumers  And the second thing it will do it will take friction out of the system  which means it will reduce the cost to fill a prescription  So we re working on initiatives that don t just boost    take out costs  but they actually boost revenue and the connectivity to patients and consumers longer term and some of that will be lost  these investments are large and they re multi year and they will also drive long term revenue and sustainable growth Michael Cherny    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystAnd I guess just quickly  how do you balance all of those investments in long term initiatives against some of the quarterly volatility and reimbursement risks and the moving pieces on the transformational cost program that you see Stefano Pessina    Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt s tough Alex Gourlay    Co Chief Operating OfficerIt s not easy  But we have our program management approach  We have got a lot of cable people but it s not easy in every    but we are paying a lot of attention to the future and to today as you can tell by the comments that James have made James Kehoe    Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial OfficerA lot of these funds go through the Transformational Cost Management Program and Alex  myself and Ornella and Head of HR sit on it  We are the four people on it  So it s a small team  takes decisions quickly and frankly some of these are tough trade offs and in some quarters you theoretically can t afford it  but you have to do it or otherwise you re going to damage the long term future of the company Stefano Pessina    Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd this is the problem  It s Stefano  Yes  Every strategy    our strategy is as it has always been a medium long term strategy  And we believe in the pharmacy  We believe in the hold that the pharmacies will have in future  Of course  the pharmacy will have to be able to satisfy the needs of the patients and the needs of the customers and we are working in that direction  Not all the pharmacies will provide in future  not all the pharmacies will be important in the local economy of the city or the villages  We try to be in pharmacy that can have a whole and of course we have to invest  We had to invest now for the future  If we work just for the next quarter maybe we will have a little better results  but at the end  we will probably create a problem over the long survival of our stores of our pharmacies  And now you have to take a decision  Either you believe in the strategy  which is focused on the long term or you just try to look at the next quarters and maybe you try to do deals just to let s say make easier over less evidence the problems that you have  We have decided to work for the long term  And I hope that at the end  we would be right OperatorThere are no further

178616,400132,WBA,Why Walgreens Boots Alliance Isn t the Value Stock You re Looking For   Yet,news,"With a horrid 14  negative return in 2019  Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  earned itself a spot on the Dogs of the Dow list  The global retail pharmacist has been struggling with shifting consumer trends toward e commerce  a competitive pharmacy industry  and consolidating insurance companies that are paying out less for prescriptions  leading to flat revenue and falling profits the last couple of years    even as healthcare and wellness spending overall continues to rise  
In response  Walgreens has been investing in digital operations and cutting costs  There isn t a ton to be excited about here  except that shares are beginning to look cheap  The stock fell again    more than 5  the day it reported on results from its fiscal 2020 first quarter 
A quick recap of Q1
After putting up a 4  increase in sales but a 0 5  decrease in adjusted earnings per share  Walgreens started the new year sluggishly  missing average Wall Street sales expectations and seeing its adjusted earnings fall 6   Management had issued adjusted earnings guidance for 2020 to be flat with last year  so the quick fall left many investors feeling glum    although that guidance for a flat bottom line remained unchanged after the report  

Pp   percentage point  Data source  Walgreens Boots Alliance   
Walgreens credited the top line growth to rising drug prices and sales volume  but that obviously didn t help the all important bottom line  And that s been the problem for a while now at the retail pharmacist  Management did say it s making progress on its cost savings plan by updating its computing systems to cloud based ones and introducing a new drug procurement joint venture with grocery retailer Kroger  NYSE KR   It also started another joint venture with healthcare and pharmacy company McKesson  NYSE MCK  to handle operations in Germany  All told  savings are now expected to be in excess of  1 8 billion a year by 2022  

One cheap dividend stock 
However  paltry growth that leads to contracting profits doesn t exactly make for a high conviction stock purchase  Nevertheless  buying well established names on weakness  like what was exhibited in 2019 and so far in 2020  can be a winning strategy  And while there are obvious flaws with Walgreens  business  at some point the stock will be too cheap to ignore  Shares trade for just 13 1 times last years  free cash flow  what s left after operating and capital expenses  and only nine times one year forward expected earnings  The dividend is currently a respectable 3 1  yield as well  
However  with Walgreens continuing to forecast another flat year for the bottom line and little headway being made to differentiate itself from the other retail healthcare options out there  this stock is cheap for a reason  After a weaker than expected Q1 2020  shares could continue to tumble for the next few weeks  I m not quite ready to say the time is right to make a purchase  but I do think it s getting close  If shares continue to fall and deepen the discount post report  I ll be ready to pick up a few shares ",2020-01-11,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pgu91,2057451

For the quarter ending Nov  30  2019  the company s adjusted earnings per share  EPS  of  1 37 fell short of the  1 41 analysts expected  Sales of  34 34 billion rose 1 6  from last year but were also just shy of expectations of  34 6 billion  Retail sales were down 2 2  from a year ago but the company notes that was mainly a result of tobacco products  which Walgreens has de emphasized  Comparable retail sales excluding tobacco products and e cigarettes were up 0 8   
The company did have a strong performance over the Black Friday weekend with online sales in its U S  retail division seeing 45  growth from the prior year while revenue in its international segment rose by 25  
Although it wasn t a strong quarter for Walgreens  the company left its guidance unchanged for fiscal 2020 as it still expects to see flat growth and these latest results don t change that 

Still on the right track
The company s Executive Vice Chairman and CEO Stefano Pessina believes the company is still on the right path despite the less than stellar results   We are confident our strategic plans are the right ones to drive long term sustainable growth going forward   The company is optimistic about its Transformational Cost Management Program as it continues to make progress with Walgreens still expecting to achieve annual cost savings of at least  1 8 billion by fiscal 2022

178634,400150,WBA,Why Walgreens Boots Alliance Shares Are Sinking Today,news,"What happened
Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  were sinking 6  lower as of 11 27 a m  EST on Wednesday  The decline came after the pharmacy retailer and wholesaler announced disappointing fiscal year 2020 first quarter results before the market opened 
Walgreens reported Q1 revenue of  34 3 billion  up 1 6  year over year  The consensus analysts  estimate projected that the company would generate revenue of  34 6 billion  Adjusted earnings per share were  1 37  down 6  year over year and below the average analysts  estimate of  1 41 

So what
One disappointing quarter isn t all that important in the big scheme of things  But Walgreens  Q1 performance underscores the continued challenges for the company 
It especially faces headwinds with its international retail pharmacy business  Sales fell for its Boots UK business  Unrest in Chile also weighed on Q1 results  The company s biggest segment  retail pharmacy USA  continues to experience the negative financial impact of Walgreens  decision to de emphasize sales of tobacco products 
But its U S  retail business is growing overall  as is its pharmaceutical wholesale business  And while CEO Stefano Pessina acknowledged that it was  a soft first quarter   he said that the company remains  confident our strategic plans are the right ones to drive long term sustainable growth going forward  
Now what
Despite the weaker than expected Q1 results  Walgreens didn t lower its full year fiscal 2020 outlook  The company still expects roughly flat growth in adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis 
Investors will want to watch how two new partnerships for Walgreens unfold  The company is forming a wholesale joint venture in Germany with McKesson  and it has created a group purchasing organization with Kroger  
Even with these initiatives  Walgreens doesn t appear on track to deliver much growth in the foreseeable future  It remains a reasonably solid dividend stock  though  with a yield of 3 1  and a track record of 44 consecutive years of dividend increases ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfi92,2055186

actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 23  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Walgreens Boots s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 16 64 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 28 86  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Walgreens Boots has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 04  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Walgreens Boots stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Walgreens Boots has a P S ratio of about 0 39  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Walgreens Boots currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Walgreens Boots a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too  What About the Stock Overall Though Walgreens Boots might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of D  This gives WBA a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  The consensus estimate in the current year did not witness any changes in the past two months  while the next year estimate has inched higher by 0 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Walgreens Boots Alliance  Inc  Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term  Bottom LineWalgreens Boots is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 12  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  However  over the past two years  the Zacks Retail   Pharmacies And Drug Stores industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All Last year  it generated  24 billion

178699,400215,WBA,Tesco shares jump on possible sale of Asian business,news,"By James Davey
LONDON  Reuters    Shares in  Tesco   L TSCO  rose more than 5  on Monday after Britain s biggest retailer said it might sell its Asian businesses  in Thailand and Malaysia  which analysts valued at up to  9 billion 
Tesco said on Sunday it had begun a review of its Asian operations after receiving approaches for the businesses 
It said the review was at an early stage and gave no details of the interest received in the businesses  which generate about 8  of the supermarket group s total annual revenue and 10  of its profit 
Pulling out of Asia would mark a further retreat toward Tesco s core domestic market and a shift in strategy as the group had identified Thailand  where it is the market leader  as a key growth area at its Capital Markets Day in June 
 Hence  to us  for any approach to be accepted by the Tesco board for Thailand then it needs to be highly attractive if not a knock out price   said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black 
Shares in Tesco were up 5 5  at 1122 GMT  valuing the retailer at 24 billion pounds   31 billion   as analysts said rival retailers and private equity investors could be interested 
If Tesco does exit Asia the decision could be made by its new CEO  Ken Murphy  rather than incumbent Dave Lewis who is stepping down next year 
Analysts at Bernstein valued the Asian business at 6 5 billion pounds to 7 2 billion pounds   8 3 billion to  9 2 billion  
Tesco trades from 1 967 stores in Thailand and 74 in Malaysia  In the six months to Aug  24 the businesses generated sales of 2 56 billion pounds  up 1  at constant exchange rates from a year earlier  and operating profit of 171 million pounds  up 42 3  
Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne said Tesco s Thai operation was a  high quality business   with 50  of its earnings coming from a mall rental business and 50  from a food retail market that is much less competitive than the UK  He said the Thai business still had significant growth opportunities 
In 2016 France s Casino sold its majority stake in Thai hypermarket operator Big C Supercenter  Tesco s main competitor in Thailand  to TCC Group for 3 1 billion euros  Rival  Carrefour   PA CARR  quit Thailand in 2010 
Monteyne noted the Big C deal was at 16 times enterprise value earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   while Tesco itself trades at 6 8 times 
 That leaves the Thai business hugely undervalued as part of the group  That in itself provides ample justification to consider a disposal  especially if there is unsolicited interest   he said 
GROWTH AVENUE
While selling Thailand could mean a material distribution to Tesco s shareholders it would remove a growth avenue from the group  which said in June that it saw an opportunity for 750 new convenience stores in Thailand over the  medium term  
Celebrating its 100th anniversary  Tesco is five years into a UK focused recovery plan launched by Lewis after an accounting scandal capped a dramatic downturn in trading  In October Lewis declared Tesco s turnaround complete and said he would step down next summer  Murphy  a former executive at healthcare group Walgreens Boots Alliance  O WBA   has not yet confirmed his start date 
In 2015 Tesco sold its South Korean arm to a group led by private equity firm MBK Partners for  6 1 billion  A year later it sold its Kipa business in Turkey to Migros  the country s largest supermarket chain 
Under its previous management Tesco made costly exits from Japan  the United States and China  starting a retreat from its once lofty global ambitions 
If Tesco does quit Thailand and Malaysia  it will inevitably raise questions over the future of its remaining overseas operations   its central European division  consisting of stores in Czech Republic  Hungary  Poland and Slovakia ",2019-12-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tesco-shares-jump-on-possible-sale-of-asian-business-2036847,2036847

178713,400229,WBA,Walgreens  Did The Market Foresee The KKR Offer ,opinion,"Anyone who s been in Elliott Wave analysis long enough has noticed how often some external factor  makes the price move  in the direction the analysis had identified much earlier  We ve seen it happening in crypto  we ve seen in happening in stock indices  Now  it happened with Walgreens stock 

Walgreens  NASDAQ WBA  jumped on November 5th after CNBC reported the company was exploring a go private deal  The rumor turned out to be true on November 11th  when the drug store chain was officially approached by private equity firm KKR  NYSE KKR  




Walgreens was down to a multi year low of  49 03 in late August but spiked to  64 50 after the rumor first came out  What is more interesting is the fact that there was a bullish Elliott Wave setup in place two months earlier  Take a look at it below 
This chart was published on September 5th in an article titled  Walgreens Stock Can Add Roughly 30    It revealed that the decline between  86 and  49 was a complete five wave impulse pattern  To every Elliott Wave analyst this meant that a move in the opposite direction can be expected 
Elliott Wave Analysis ahead of the Walgreens Buyout Rumor
The anticipated rally had to be of respectable size in relation to the preceding impulse  So  we thought  we can expect a notable recovery to roughly  65 a share for a total gain of nearly 30    In addition  there was a strong bullish MACD divergence supporting the positive outlook 




The next chart shows Walgreens stock as it is today  over two months after the September 5th analysis 
One  KKR takes Walgreens private at a price not much higher than the current market price  And two  the companies fail to reach a deal and Walgreens remains a public entity  That second possibility is probably keeping arbitrageurs up at night 
If a deal is not reached  WBA stock will be at the mercy of pure market forces again  The problem is that with a complete bearish 5 3 wave cycle already in place  another selloff is going to be very likely  In other words  if KKR fails to pull off the largest leveraged buyout in history  Walgreens stock may revisit the sub  50 area once more ",2019-11-12,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/walgreens-did-the-market-foresee-the-kkr-offer-200484440,200484440
178714,400230,WBA,Walgreens Could Go Private  What Does This Say About The Market ,opinion,"Technically Speaking For November 12
Summary
Early indications are that corporate investment will be weak again in 4Q19 Walgreens may be going private The markets are probably consolidating gains from the last two weeks 
It looks like corporate investment will continue to be weak  A story in the Financial Times indicates corporate investment will grow a paltry 1 8  in 4Q19  One of the reasons given is continued uncertainty due to the lack of trade policy clarity  which has also weakened corporate sentiment  This is in line with recent data 




The equipment investment component of the GDP report has been stable for the last three quarters  left chart  while declining on a Y Y basis  right chart  




New orders for nondefense goods ex aircraft have been stable for the last year  left chart  and are now declining on a Y Y basis  right chart   This poses potential problems for GDP growth  Last quarter  consumer spending was the primary driver of top line growth  With a weak reading for investment probable  weak fourth quarter growth is likely 

Is  Walgreens going private  News reports indicate the company is at least thinking about it  emphasis added  

Shares of Walgreens  NASDAQ WBA  gained as much as 7 7  in early trading Monday  that KKR  a private equity firm  formally approached the drugstore about a deal that could be the largest ever leveraged buyout 

A spokesperson for Walgreens declined to comment 

KKR has been working on a proposal to take Walgreens private  and is one of a group of private equity firms that s had    
This is big news for a number of reasons  First  it would be the largest buy out in history  Second  it would remove a dividend aristocrat from the pool  WBA has increased its dividend for 43 consecutive years   Third  it would continue the trend of   emphasis added  

The American stock market has been shrinking  It s been happening in slow motion   so slow you may not even have noticed  But by now the change is unmistakable  The market is half the size of its mid 1990s peak  and 25 percent smaller than it was in 1976 
Going public    with its increased reporting requirements  short term orientation  and increased public scrutiny    is simply not as attractive as it once was 
Industrial production is weaker across the globe 




From the Dallas Fed
Over at Econbrowser    who will pick up the industrial production slack during this slowdown  In 2016  a drop in oil prices slowed the US energy sector  which then slowed US industrial production  But then  the rest of the world s production remained sufficiently strong to sustain global economic momentum  Now  everybody is dropping 

Let s turn to the performance tables 





Yesterday was an odd day for the markets  The long end of the Treasury market led the way higher  gaining 0 46   That was followed by micro caps and the QQQs  The 10 20 year section of the curve followed in fourth place  Other equity indexes were up modestly  On the downside are the transports and mid caps  Overall  this table is inconclusive 




The sector performance is mixed as well  The top four spots are split between conservative and aggressive sectors  the rest of the table is mixed as well 
Let s turn to some charts  starting with the TLTs 




I ve stripped out the price bars  leaving only the EMAs to allow us to look at the underlying trends  The shorter EMAs are still above the 200 day EMA  But the shorter averages are all moving lower with the shorter EMAs below the longer ones    a bearish alignment  This also shows that the weight of the short term movement is down  




The 30 day SPY chart shows a clear uptrend in place  as does    




    the 30 day IWM chart 
But there s still weakness in the small cap indexes 




Mid caps broke through the lower 198 area  which was the main area of resistance over the last six months  But the chart has stalled  It s possible to argue prices are consolidating gains  But the lack of meaningful follow through    especially when the larger cap indexes are rallying    is modestly concerning  




Although the IWMs are in a 30 day uptrend  see above   prices are still caught in the 6 month highs 
It could simply be that the markets are cooling off a bit  This would make sense  given the strength of the last two weeks  But  we could also be seeing the lack of participation from the smaller caps  which was pronounced during the Spring rally    which also signaled the underlying problems with the broader market ",2019-11-13,Hale Stewart,https://www.investing.com/analysis/walgreens-could-go-private-what-does-this-say-about-the-market-200484820,200484820

178786,400302,WBA,Walgreens  WBA  Becomes Latest Retailer To Suspend Zantac Sales ,opinion,"Walgreens   NASDAQ WBA   announced today that they would be suspending the sales of Sanofi s   NASDAQ SNY   heartburn medication Zantac  Zantac  which is sold generically under the name ranitidine  is currently under investigation by the US Food and Drug Administration after they found that it contained a carcinogen known as NDMA which can lead to cancer  The FDA started an investigation after Valisure  an online pharmacy company  alerted the FDA earlier this month that Zantac includes an impurity that could cause cancer  Walgreens  decision to suspend the drug while the FDA continues its investigation comes after CVS   NYSE CVS   announced on Saturday that they were discontinuing their sales of Zantac 
CVS stated that they were taking action out of an  abundance of caution  and that there is no current recall of the product  but customers who purchased these products can bring them into their stores for a refund  Ranitidine  which was originally thought of as an ulcer drug  is approved for treatment and prevention of stomach and intestine ulcers and heartburn  Ranitidine is considered an H2 blocker  which reduces stomach acid by blocking acids that produce it  CVS announced that it would continue to sell its other over the counter H2 blocker products such as Pepcid and Tagamet 
Sanofi  PA SASY  has said that Zantac has been around for over a decade and meets all the specified safety requirements for use  The large cap pharmaceutical company also went on to comment that they  are working closely with the FDA and are conducting their own robust investigations to ensure they continue to meet the highest quality standards  
The FDA has said that NDMA can cause harm in large doses  but their preliminary tests have found that NDMA levels in Zantac barely exceed what might be found in common foods  NDMA is part of a class of compounds called nitrosamines that are found in water and foods like dairy  meats  and vegetables  The federal administration is investigating whether exposure to small amounts of the carcinogen can potentially pose serious health risks to patients and that it would reveal their conclusions publicly as soon as possible 
Moving Forward
Many generic drugs for high blood pressure have already been found to contain low levels of NDMA and other related carcinogenic chemicals  The FDA has grappled with the NDMA issue for more than a year  and Zantac is the latest drug that they have brought into question

178823,400339,WBA,Tesco CEO Dave Lewis to step down in 2020,news,"By James Davey
LONDON  Reuters     Tesco   L TSCO  boss Dave Lewis will step down next summer after completing the turnaround of Britain s biggest retailer and hand the baton to Ken Murphy  a former executive at Walgreens Boots Alliance  O WBA  
Celebrating its 100th anniversary  Tesco  which has a 27 4  share of Britain s grocery market  is in the final stages of a recovery plan that Lewis instigated after a 2014 accounting scandal capped a dramatic downturn in its fortunes 
 With the turnaround complete and as we begin to implement the next steps of our sustainable growth strategy  now is the right time to plan a smooth and orderly succession   Lewis  who joined Tesco from  Unilever   LON ULVR  in 2014  said on Wednesday 
 As such  I will step down as group CEO next summer and pass the baton to Ken Murphy  
The group has met the majority of its turnaround goals  including a key margin target of earning between 3 5 pence and 4 pence of operating profit for every pound customers spend 
Lewis has overhauled Tesco s relationship with suppliers  lowered prices versus competitors  simplified product ranges and improved store standards since taking charge  Jobs have also been cut  including 4 500 announced in August 
The 54 year old has also pursued growth by buying wholesaler Booker  forming a global purchasing alliance with  Carrefour   PA CARR  and launching a new discount format called Jack s 
The announcement of Lewis s departure came as Tesco reported a better than expected first half operating profit before one of items of 1 41 billion pounds  a rise of 25 4  
The retailer said it had a  strong start  to the year and was well positioned to be highly competitive in a challenging market 
Lewis s successor Murphy was joint chief operating officer at Boots UK   Ireland before rising to executive vice president  chief commercial officer and president global brands at Walgreens Boots Alliance 




He left his executive position at the U S  retailer at the end of 2018 but retained a consultancy role  Tesco said ",2019-10-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tesco-ceo-dave-lewis-to-step-down-in-2020-1990630,1990630
178824,400340,WBA,StockBeat   Tesco Savior Dave Lewis Bows Out   With Perfect Timing,news,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing com    The man who saved   Tesco    LON TSCO  is leaving 
Dave Lewis said Wednesday he ll step down in summer next year  nearly six years after taking over as chief executive when the U K  s largest food retailer was reeling from a false accounting scandal 
He called the decision  a personal one   in a statement accompanying the supermarket chain s latest earnings which   true to form   revealed a 3 7  increase in currency adjusted profits in the first half of its fiscal year  along with a sharp dividend hike  a doubling of cash flow from retail activities and a further reduction in net debt 
Lewis took over with Tesco s share price languishing at the lowest in decades  its foreign operations a hot mess and its U K  market share under pressure from pushy German discounters and online startups such as Ocado  LON OCDO  
He never quite stopped the bleeding   Tesco s market share of 26 9  in the 12 weeks through Sept  8 is still down a couple of points from when he took over  and there is no sign of Aldi and Lidl going ex growth yet  But there is no exaggeration in his statement Wednesday that    Our turnaround is complete  we have delivered all the metrics we set for ourselves   The leadership team is very strong  our strategy is clear and it is delivering  The  Tesco   LON TSCO  brand is stronger and customer satisfaction is the highest it has been for many years  
While the 31  increase in the share price during his reign may not seem extreme  the wonder is that it happened it all  given the competitive environment and the relentless squeeze on U K  consumer finances from Brexit  which has caused the U K  to go from the top of the G7 growth league in 2015 to the bottom in 2018   No wonder that chairman John Allen said in the same statement that he accepted the resignation  with regret  
Another aspect of the departure is the relatively smooth succession planning  Lewis is staying around until summer 2020  giving his designated successor Ken Murphy  a veteran of Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA   plenty of time to acclimatize 
That  along with the results and the dividend hike  helps to explain the stock s 1 8  rise on a day when the FTSE 100 is down 1 5  and the rest of Europe is also in the red  The Stoxx 600 was down 1 2  and the German DAX down 1 1  by 5 AM ET  0900 GMT  
It also means that Lewis will still be at the helm over what is set to be a tumultuous few months for  Tesco   LON TSCO   given the risk of a disorderly  No Deal Brexit  at the end of the month or  perhaps  a couple of months later after a General Election   The erection of new border checks at U K  ports is set to cause acute disruption to supplies of fresh food in particular  according to the British Retail Consortium  which said last month that government claims to the contrary are  categorically untrue  
 Retailers will be preparing for Christmas  stretching already limited warehousing capacity  and the U K  will be importing the majority of its fresh food from the EU  magnifying the impact of border delays   the BRC said at the time  The Food and Drink Federation also predicts  significant and adverse changes to product availability  and random shortages  after a No Deal Brexit 
 I will give the job everything I have until my very last day   Lewis said  and  Tesco   LON TSCO  shareholders can be thankful for that  For Lewis  there s the consolation that  whatever chaos Brexit brings  it will all be someone else s problem before too long ",2019-10-02,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat--tesco-savior-dave-lewis-bows-out--with-perfect-timing-1990693,1990693
178825,400341,WBA,In turbulent times  Tesco s new boss has something to build on,news,"By James Davey
LONDON  Reuters    When the little known Ken Murphy takes over next year as CEO of  Tesco   L TSCO   Britain s biggest retailer  he will inherit something current boss Dave Lewis did not have the luxury of when he joined in 2014   a strategy and a stable business 
But the 52 year old veteran of healthcare retailing will still have to work hard for his  1 7 million a year salary  with Britain facing a potentially disruptive exit from the European Union and German discounters Aldi and Lidl grabbing market share from the country s top supermarket chains 
When former  Unilever   LON ULVR  executive Lewis became CEO of Tesco on Sept  1  2014  the supermarket group was already reeling from a dramatic downturn in trading  Three weeks later  an accounting scandal plunged it into the biggest crisis in its history 
Fast forward five years and Lewis  54  has declared Tesco s turnaround complete  He will hand over to Murphy  a former executive at healthcare group Walgreens Boots Alliance  O WBA   next summer 
 I don t think we had a strategy in September 2014   Lewis told reporters when reflecting on his arrival at Tesco 
Jason Tarry  now Tesco s UK and Ireland CEO  said the strategy then was  survival  
Lewis said Murphy  an Irish national  would be in a much better place because he would inherit a  super clear strategy  that he could evolve 
Lewis  strategy has focused on differentiating the Tesco brand from competitors  reducing costs and generating cash  improving profit margins  maximizing value from property and driving innovation 
He has also pursued growth by buying wholesaler Booker  forming a global purchasing alliance with  Carrefour   PA CARR  and launching discount format Jack s 
 The good thing is   all the heavy lifting of the turnaround and getting us back financially secure and stable again has been done and so now it s much more in terms of investment choices that he ll have to make   said Lewis 
CHOICES
Analysts say those choices revolve around taking the fight on prices to Aldi and Lidl who have been gobbling up market share  as well as investment in technology  online grocery capacity  convenience stores  Booker and overseas ventures 
Murphy  a qualified accountant who has studied at Harvard  will also have to decide if excess cash should be returned to shareholders 
Alasdair McKinnon  lead fund manager of Tesco shareholder  the Scottish Investment Trust  said Murphy was  potentially well placed to deliver the next stage of Tesco s transformation  
HSBC analyst Andrew Porteous said Murphy was  a strong choice  whose key challenge was to drive sales growth 
But Murphy s appointment has left others puzzled 
 Walgreens Boots has material strategic challenges in the U S  and the UK  What is it about Ken s track record there that impressed the board   asked Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne 
Murphy led the turnaround of drugs wholesale and retail group Alliance UniChem in Italy  then shared the top operations job at health and beauty business Boots UK   Ireland before becoming executive vice president  chief commercial officer and president of global brands at Walgreens Boots Alliance 
His appointment came in a big week for UK grocery sector moves  On Tuesday  John Rogers  the boss of Sainsbury s  L SBRY  Argos business who was seen as the favorite to succeed Mike Coupe as Sainsbury s CEO  quit to become finance chief of advertising group WPP  LON WPP   while Waitrose  JLPLC UL  boss Rob Collins said he would step down next year 
Lewis has no doubt Murphy  who began his retail career helping in his father s shop at the age of 15  will succeed  dismissing his lack of major UK grocery retailing experience as an irrelevance 
 What Ken needs to have and I do know him and I do believe he has it is   have you got a strategic perspective  Do you understand brand  do you understand the customer  Have you got the interpersonal skills to engage with 450 000 people  
His advice to Murphy    use his ears more than his mouth  ",2019-10-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/in-turbulent-times-tescos-new-boss-has-something-to-build-on-1991534,1991534
178844,400360,WBA,Analysts Estimate Walgreens Boots Alliance  WBA  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended May 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on June 27  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This largest U S  drugstore chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 43 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 5  
Revenues are expected to be  34 53 billion  up 0 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Walgreens 
For Walgreens  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 40  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Walgreens will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Walgreens would post earnings of  1 70 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 64  delivering a surprise of  3 53  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Walgreens doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-06-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-walgreens-boots-alliance-wba-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200433312,200433312

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3 52   A quarter ago  it was expected that this largest U S  drugstore chain would post earnings of  1 70 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 64  delivering a surprise of  3 53

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Walgreens shares have lost about 23 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 16 2  
What s Next for Walgreens 
While Walgreens has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions

178847,400363,WBA,U S  consumer watchdog hires new enforcement chief  fills other vacancies,news,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Wednesday announced new hires at the agency  including a former state regulator to serve as new permanent chief of its enforcement office 
Bryan Schneider  former head of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation  will serve as the associate director of the agency s Division of Supervision  Enforcement and Fair Lending 
According to his LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  profile  Schneider has also previously been employed at pharmaceutical giant  the Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  Inc  for nearly 15 years in various roles  including as vice president 
The consumer watchdog began looking to fill vacant roles in August  after a two year hiring freeze and budget cuts by the administration of U S  President Donald Trump left the agency with several openings in senior positions 
Created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to crack down on predatory lenders  the CFPB is charged with protecting consumers and policing financial products 
Current CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger succeeded interim director and current White House chief of staff  Mick Mulvaney  who instituted the freeze and budget reductions  Kraninger was sworn in in December 
Republicans  who long argued the agency was too powerful  set about overhauling it after gaining control in November 2017  including rolling back rules and reducing enforcement actions 
Democratic lawmakers have accused the administration of bowing to industry lobbyists and warned efforts to shrink the agency could lead to a lack of industry oversight 
Overall  CFPB enforcement actions have fallen by around half under the Trump administration  a Reuters analysis found last month 
On Wednesday  other key roles  including the assistant director of research  the chief data officer and a deputy chief of staff were also named ",2019-09-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/us-consumer-watchdog-hires-new-enforcement-chief-fills-other-vacancies-1986153,1986153

178901,400417,WBA,Walgreens Longer Term Outlook Remains Bearish,opinion,"Whilst many US stocks have mirrored the price action on the primary indices over the last few months  falling and then recovering  this has not been the case for Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  which has continued lower under the weight of a bearish technical picture and poor earnings  with a big miss in April adding to an already bearish picture  This fundamental driver is clearly in evidence on the weekly chart for the stock with the widespread down candle on ultra high volume injecting further downside momentum in April  that has continued to weigh heavily as the stock sinks further  and with no signs yet of any market maker buying  the longer term outlook remains very bearish 
What is interesting about the chart is the appearance of the volatility indicator which is unusual on a slow timeframe such as this  and yet as always reveals what to expect following its appearance  The volatility indicator is triggered when price action moves outside the average true range and the expectation is for price action to either consolidate or reverse as a result  The reason for this is simple  Volatility and insider participation go hand in hand and as such  fast moves in any market provide the ideal opportunity to trap trade investors and traders into weak positions on the reversal  And on the weekly chart  we have two examples  the first signalling a reversal  the second consolidation before there is a continuation of the primary bearish trend 

The pattern for this stock now seems to be set  with minor rallies higher punctuating the move lower  and until we see major accumulation  a move through  50 now seems likely  Indeed the monthly chart is interesting here  with rising volumes and falling prices confirming this sentiment  and with the trend monitor now in transitional phase  and with a low volume node ahead   45 now seems to be the next possible pause point  Thereafter a return to the volume point of control at  35 longer term may be achieved ",2019-05-01,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/walgreens-boots-are-red-200413540,200413540

178920,400436,WBA,Oil Nears Tipping Point As OPEC Tightens Market  U S  Squeezes Iran,opinion,"Crude Oil is flirting with the 200 day moving average as OPEC tightens the market and the U S  squeezes Iran  The U S  ADP employment report  and ISM non manufacturing index are both due up next  All currencies are up against the U S  dollar except for the yen  AUD leads the way  Our long US crude oil Premium trade entered at 51 54 remains in progress 

Year to date  U S  crude oil is the 2nd highest performing commodity up 38   behind gasoline s 46   Crude is now flirting with several key technical levels that will be pivotal in the days ahead  The main one is the 200 day moving average  It was broken in WTI on Tuesday but sits just above the Brent high of  69 57  Next is psychological resistance at  70 00 and just behind that is the August 2018 low  now resistance  at  70 30  If those break  watch the 61 8  retracement of the Q4 plunge at  72 68 
It s increasingly clear that Saudi Arabia is determined to tighten global supplies  They ve nearly halted exports to the U S  and OPEC is pumping at four year lows  Saudi officials were frustrated in September when the U S  granted sanctions waivers to Iran s biggest customers but news on that front may also be bullish with the U S  s envoy to Iran saying Tuesday that with crude prices still relatively low  they were on the  fast track  to curbing exports to zero 
Investment in oil is low this year and speculators remain deeply skeptical of crude  Even with the jump so far this year  there is little enthusiasm in the market  A rise to Brent  at  70 will likely trigger some producers to hedge but that may just stretch out a rally towards later in the year 
Another spot we have been watching closely is Bitcoin  Ashraf has been touting longs for weeks  see below  and the 15  rally added to the upside  What s unclear is what was behind the rip in cryptocurrencies  There has been non stop speculation but the only coherent thing we ve seen is talk of a  100m order but that still doesn t explain why someone would flood the market with bids

Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Walgreens shares have lost about 7 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 14 4  
What s Next for Walgreens 
While Walgreens has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Walgreens was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

178956,400472,WBA,While Dividend Seems Safe  Walgreens Faces Big Challenges,news,"By Charley Blaine
Investing com   The best you can say about Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  now is that the dividend of  1 76 a year is safe 
Everything else is uncertain  especially after Walgreens  earnings on Tuesday  which even CEO Stefano Pissena called  very disappointing  during the company s analyst call  The prospects are ugly enough that the company cut its fiscal 2019 guidance for 7  to 12  earnings growth on a constant currency basis to flat 
The stock fell 13  on Tuesday and fell below  55 on Wednesday for the first time since 2013  It is the worst performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year  down more than 19   and off more than 35  from its 52 week high reached last fall 
After the call  a number of analysts cut price targets on the stock into the low  60s  Technical indicators on Investing com rate the stock a strong sell 
Sales are getting pressured just about everywhere  but the biggest issue is the U S  pharmacy business  Insurance companies and government agencies are driving down reimbursement levels  So  while Walgreens is filling more prescriptions  and will be as the population ages   its profit from each sale is shrinking 
Business in the front of its pharmacies is getting hurt  too  in part because old reliables aren t so reliable  This year s flu season wasn t nearly as bad as 2018  cutting into sales of cough  flu and cold medicine  Plus  tobacco sales are lower  in part because Walgreens is getting out of the business 
Its Boots business  which operates pharmacies across of much of Europe  is showing poor results  at least in dollars  as the dollar rises and the pound and euro slip  Plus  European economies aren t doing all that well 
Competitors are doing wild and crazy things  CVS Health  NYSE CVS  went out and bought health insurance company Aetna  NYSE AET  for  68 billion 
The analyst call was more notable for what wasn t really addressed 
First  no analyst raised the issue of whether Medicare for all might actually happen  CFO James Kehoe noted that the company is implementing  1 5 billion in annual cost cuts and a massive move into digitizing everything  Then  he said   Over the long term  we are comfortable that our growth model can deliver mid  to high single digit adjusted EPS growth in constant currencies  
So  for Walgreens the issue is dealing with what appear to be incremental issues posed by any changes to healthcare laws 
This second issue is larger 
Walgreens Boots Alliance  formed in 2014 when Walgreens bought the 45  of Alliance Boots it didn t own  is now a sprawling operation  It has a presence in more than 25 countries  either wholly or through investments or franchises  and counts more than 415 000 employees  While the U S  is the largest piece portion of that business  it s still hard to juggle when things don t match up country to country 
At least the dividend is not really pressuring operations  It represents about 28  of cash flow  And there s enough cash flowing through the business that the company expects to buy back  1 7 billion in shares each year over the next three  which helps boost reported earnings per share 
Its consistency suggests that the company has the financial strength to fix the business  at least for now ",2019-04-03,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/while-dividend-seems-safe-walgreens-faces-big-challenges-1826639,1826639
178971,400487,WBA,Earnings Preview  Walgreens Boots Alliance  WBA  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended February 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 2  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This largest U S  drugstore chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 70 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 7  
Revenues are expected to be  34 87 billion  up 5 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3 09  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Walgreens 
For Walgreens  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 35  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Walgreens will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Walgreens would post earnings of  1 43 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 46  delivering a surprise of  2 10  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Walgreens doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-03-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-walgreens-boots-alliance-wba-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200401067,200401067

179004,400520,WBA,Loose money era leaves trail of U S  corporate debt junkies,news,"By Jessica DiNapoli  Kate Duguid and Joshua Franklin NEW YORK  Reuters    Many U S  companies that gorged on cheap debt with forgiving terms over the last decade now find themselves shackled by it  spending much of their earnings paying off lenders rather than investing in their businesses or hiring  As small firms  which together account for half of U S  employment  begin to feel the squeeze  this could have a chilling effect on hiring  wages and consumption  adding to headwinds from wobbly financial markets and ebbing global growth  economists and corporate finance professionals say  The number of companies struggling with their debt obligations is hovering near record highs  Some 17 percent of publicly traded U S  companies had trouble making debt interest payments at the end of last year  up from less than 10 percent in 2010 and off from a high of over 20 percent in 2016  according to the Institute of International Finance Inc  a trade group for financial institutions  In value terms  such firms account for a fraction of companies the IIF monitors  But they exemplify the struggles of a bigger universe of private firms which have loaded up on so called leveraged debt  typically variable rate loans offered on generous terms by banks and non bank lenders  With Federal Reserve rate increases pushing up interest expenses and the U S  economy facing a slowdown as it nears a cyclical downturn  more and more of those borrowers may scramble just to stay afloat   It could reduce capital expenditures  capital deployment and lock up the economy  because companies could be so focused on making debt payments that they may not be hiring   said Christopher Zook  chief investment officer of family office CAZ Investments LLC  Take CPI Card Group Inc  which makes credit and debit cards for banks and retailers  The card maker was among firms that tapped the leveraged loan market  when it borrowed  435 million for general purposes before it went public in 2015   CPI repaid some of the loan with proceeds from its public offering  but as its profits have deteriorated  the company has nearly lost its ability to service the remaining debt  Its earnings for 2018 roughly matched its debt expenses  according to Moody s Investors Service  down from nearly five times the size in 2014  The company cut its headcount by 13 percent between 2015 and 2017 to 1 200 workers  Last year  it shut a plant in Littleton  Colorado  where it is headquartered  according to the state s Department of Labor and Employment  As Americans complete the shift to chip enabled credit cards  CPI forecasts revenue will rise in 2019  But the forces that have held it back will persist  the credit card maker is losing market share to competitors  and high inventories help big banks keep prices low  says Stephen Morrison  analyst at Moody s  CPI Card declined to comment  EASY CREDIT Investors  hunt for higher returns in an era of record low interest rates has given debt laden companies access to cheap  easy credit  encouraging them to take on more debt than would be possible in less forgiving conditions  As a result  the median debt levels of non financial companies relative to their earnings already exceed levels before the last financial crisis  according to Standard   Poor s rating agency   Graphic     While U S  policymakers assure that credit conditions remain broadly healthy  the volume of leveraged loans  which are rated as junk or near junk  has doubled to a record  1 4 trillion over the last five years    The leveraged loan market can be considered a canary in the coal mine for the U S  economy   said Jeremy Swan  managing principal for financial sponsors at accounting firm CohnReznick LLP  Drug store chain Rite Aid Corp is another example of how initial relief offered by such loans turned  over time  into a burden  The Pennsylvania based company borrowed over  1 billion on loose terms in 2013 to refinance old debt  according to Refinitiv data  Credit ratings agencies welcomed the financing at the time because it would help the chain  though still heavily indebted and facing uneven sales  lower its interest costs   Yet the debt burden proved too much in the years to come    They couldn t grow because they had so much debt   said Mickey Chadha  a senior credit officer at Moody s Investors Service   They didn t have the cash flow and the capital to invest in their stores    Last year  the retailer  after two failed attempts to sell itself  sold about 1 900 stores to competitor Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  Inc to reduce its leverage at a time when the rise of e commerce has challenged its business   The number of associates Rite Aid employed slowly declined to 87 000 from 89 000 as it worked toward paying off the debt  according to the company s annual reports  Its store count fell to 4 536 from 4 623  After the sale to Walgreens Boot Alliance  Rite Aid had 2 550 stores and 59 000 employees  Its shares are trading below  1  though it recently announced plans for a reverse stock split   Rite Aid has made significant progress in reducing the company s debt and simplifying and strengthening its capital structure over the last several years   the retailer said in a statement  The company said it recently refinanced  pushing out maturities until 2023 and winning improved interest rates  It also has about  1 9 billion in liquidity   providing strong flexibility to operate and invest in  its  business   Economists say generous lending terms allow highly leveraged companies that otherwise might be pushed into bankruptcy to carry on  but the firms  pullback from investment and hiring can exacerbate an anticipated slowdown and hurt thinly capitalized non bank lenders

179066,400582,WBA,Walgreens Boots Alliance  WBA  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  reports results for the quarter ended November 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 20  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This largest U S  drugstore chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 43 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 7  
Revenues are expected to be  33 58 billion  up 9 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 17  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Walgreens 
For Walgreens  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 50  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Walgreens will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Walgreens would post earnings of  1 44 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 48  delivering a surprise of  2 78  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Walgreens doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-12-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/walgreens-boots-alliance-wba-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200367842,200367842

What s Next for Walgreens 
While Walgreens has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Walgreens was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

Overall  Retail Pharmacy USA division witnessed comparable prescription growth and benefited from a strong retail prescription market  Within this segment  Walgreens Boots has been making good progress on account of increasing prescription volume  Meanwhile  tough market conditions  particularly in retail  have been leading to sluggishness in Retail Pharmacy International division

Over the past three months  Walgreens Boots has been outperforming its   The stock has gained 24 8  in comparison to the industry s 13 9  rise 
In the last reported quarter  Retail Pharmacy USA division witnessed comparable prescription growth and benefited from a strong retail prescription market  Within this segment  Walgreens Boots has been making good progress on account of increasing prescription volume  Solid pharmacy sales growth encourages us  reflecting synergies from Rite Aid store addition and organic growth 
The company has been gaining on account of strategic tie ups  We are looking forward to Walgreens Boots  alliance with Express Scripts  NASDAQ ESRX  and Kroger  NYSE KR   aimed at expanding its existing group purchasing efforts and product offerings  respectively 

 
Per the company s partnership with Kroger  a pilot program will be launched at selected 13 Walgreens outlets in Northern Kentucky  According to the deal  customers ordering Kroger grocery items online can pick them up at Walgreens  outlets 
Walgreens Boots  tie up with Express Scripts is expected to expand its existing group purchasing efforts  Since biosimilars have the potential to lower production costs  the move is considered to be a prudent and timely one 
This apart  the Rite Aid deal seems to benefit Walgreens Boots in more ways than one  Accordingly  the collaboration allowed Rite Aid to buy generic drugs sourced through a Walgreens Boots  affiliate at a cost equivalent to the company s for about 10 years  which raises optimism 
We are also hopeful about Walgreen Boots  global footprint expansion with its decision to acquire a 40  stake in Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores  a subsidiary of China National Accord Medicines Corporation Ltd 
However  Walgreens Boots faces headwinds in the form of fierce competition and tough industry conditions  Even though the company continues to reap benefits from its growth initiatives  major business tycoons are already advancing in pharmacy businesses  flaunting a fair market share 
Notably  a slowdown in generic introduction over the last few years has been affecting Walgreens Boots  margins  Also  an escalated reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation have been denting Walgreens Boots  margins significantly

179118,400634,WBA,Walgreens Boots Alliance  WBA  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Walgreens Boots Alliance currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period

Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if WBA is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this largest U S  drugstore chain holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For WBA  shares are up 4 03  over the past week while the Zacks Retail   Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry is up 4 34  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 9 57  compares favorably with the industry s 5 05  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance have risen 17 39   and are up 18 67  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved  2 87  and 8 29   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to WBA s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  WBA is currently averaging 7 898 199 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with WBA 
Over the past two months  8 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost WBA s consensus estimate  increasing from  6 45 to  6 54 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that WBA is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Walgreens Boots Alliance on your short list ",2018-11-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/walgreens-boots-alliance-wba-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200356146,200356146

179122,400638,WBA,Walgreens  WBA  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 6  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  83 53 in the previous session  Walgreens Boots Alliance has gained 15  since the start of the year compared to the 4 8  move for the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector and the 14 5  return for the Zacks Retail   Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on October 11  2018  Walgreens reported EPS of  1 48 versus consensus estimate of  1 44 
For the current fiscal year  Walgreens is expected to post earnings of  6 54 per share on  137 49 billion in revenues  This represents an 8 64  change in EPS on a 4 52  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  7 04 per share on  141 73 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 7 71  and 3 09   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Walgreens may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Walgreens has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and F  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 12 8X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 10 7X versus its peer group s average of 8 3X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 3  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Walgreens currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Walgreens passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Walgreens shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come ",2018-11-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/walgreens-wba-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200363120,200363120
179149,400665,WBA,Here s How To Invest In A Stock Market That s Due For A Hard Landing,opinion,"I simply don t trust the fundamentals of the global economy right now  The system is built on quicksand 
Debt is growing globally and governments are running huge deficits while interest rates are still incredibly low  Looking at almost any metric  stock markets have been more expensive once in the last 100 years   just before the dot com bubble burst  There is also another risk in a category of its own  China 
A recent Bloomberg report on Chinese real estate noted that from June 2015 through the end of last year  the 100 City Price Index  published by SouFun Holdings Ltd   rose 31  to almost  202 per square foot  That s 38  higher than the median price per square foot in the U S   where per capita income is more than 700  greater than in China 
This China story gets more interesting  Most of these apartments are sitting empty because they are purchased as investments  Rental yields in China are 1 5   while the cost of borrowing  mortgage cost  is around 5  6   Chinese consumer debt to GDP is much greater than it was in the U S  during the 2008 09 financial crisis 
Since household real estate lending is 22  of Chinese banks  assets  if you are the almighty Chinese government  you have a decision to make  Do you let real estate prices normalize  decline  and then suddenly discover that your financial institutions are bankrupt  or do you allow  and actually support  the inflation of housing prices 
Predictably  as the Bloomberg report relates  China is ramping up development  and rather than curtail leverage  banks are jumping into the speculative real estate bubble  mortgage growth is now at 20  
Which brings me to one of my all time favorite books   Margin of Safety   by investing legend Seth Klarman  who writes 

 There is the old story about the market craze in sardine trading when the sardines disappeared from their traditional waters in Monterey  California  The commodity traders bid them up and the price of a can of sardines soared  One day a buyer decided to treat himself to an expensive meal and actually opened a can and started eating  He immediately became ill and told the seller the sardines were no good  The seller said   You don t understand  These are not eating sardines  they are trading sardines  

Applying this to China  when an apartment becomes an unoccupied asset whose sole purpose to be used as a investment or speculation  it turns into a trading sardine  Its price will rise until   nobody knows  but at some point someone will metaphorically open that trading can and Chinese real estate prices will collapse  bringing the banking system and the nation s economy down with them  Simply put  things that cannot go on forever don t   it just feels like they ll go on forever while you re waiting for them to stop 
Today s global investment environment is a game of musical chairs  Investors are up and marching along because the music is playing  hoping they ll be able to grab a chair when the music stops  few will do so   Accordingly  I am investing as if the music might stop any second 
Over the past 10 years it has not paid to be cautious  Low interest rates drove prices of almost all assets higher  Pricier assets made people feel wealthier and thus magically created economic growth  Low interest rates also pushed people into riskier assets  thus creating a mismatch between the assets people hold and their true risk affordability and appetite 
So far  none of this has mattered   the more risk you took  the more money you made  It will matter when risk gets ugly  because investor reaction to it will be more irrational than usual  This is why my firm hedges our portfolios through put options 
The problem with an economy being propped up by artificially appreciated assets is that this pendulum swings both ways  At some point  prices will decline  No one knows what will cause the decline   maybe higher interest rates  maybe a presidential tweet  maybe the implosion of the Chinese economy  or maybe just because stock markets and real estate prices don t grow to the sky  Or it could be triggered by something completely unseen today 
What is clear is that since interest rates are low and global economies are highly leveraged  central banks and governments will not have as much power to help 
This is one reason why my firm s portfolio holds a lot of healthcare stocks  including Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA   Healthcare companies have great balance sheets  their business is not cyclical  the demand for its products doesn t fluctuate with the whims of the global economy   and there is a huge tailwind behind their backs in the form of the aging global population  Moreover  many of these stocks trade at highly attractive valuations

179171,400687,WBA,Special Report  Starting in Arkansas  Trump era Medicaid rules alter healthcare landscape,news,By Yasmeen Abutaleb EARLE  Arkansas  Reuters    Gregory Tyrone Bryant left his last stable job at a meatpacking factory to fight a cocaine addiction eight years ago  When he returned to the workforce a year later  his options were limited  mostly temporary jobs without healthcare benefits  Since 2014  he s relied on medical coverage offered under Arkansas  expanded Medicaid program for low income households  It proved essential last June when he needed surgery to replace his right knee  and covers costly prescriptions for acid reflux and high blood pressure medicines  Bryant  48  had been out of work again for more than a year until late last month  when he got hired as a janitor in his local school district  On a 90 day probation period  he hopes the job will turn into full time work  He had been living off a monthly short term disability check from his last job assembling rear axles for Toyota cars  There s not much on offer near his home in Earle  Arkansas  population 2 000  If his job doesn t pan out  his unemployment will pose a new threat to his healthcare coverage  In June  Arkansas became the first U S  state to require that many able bodied Medicaid recipients do some combination of work  volunteer  job training or schooling a minimum of 80 hours each month to keep their benefits  a sweeping shift in healthcare rules that will soon be followed by Indiana and New Hampshire  Another eight states await approval from the Trump administration for similar work requirements that will fundamentally refigure the 50 year old program  Republican governors and lawmakers say the work requirements are vital to help manage their ballooning Medicaid costs  particularly in states like Arkansas that expanded the program under former President Barack Obama s Affordable Care Act  The goal  they say  is to encourage healthier residents to return to the employment track  or seek better jobs that could eventually bring benefits   It s an element of individual responsibility that if you re able bodied   you should be contributing in some fashion   Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson said in an interview   You always want people to move up to make more wages and have a higher income so they don t even have to qualify for Medicaid   Yet the new measures have triggered fears that thousands could lose their Medicaid benefits  putting already vulnerable laborers deeper into the hole  The changes are also forcing insurers to hustle to help clients navigate the maze of paperwork they must complete to keep benefits intact  And Kentucky s plan  poised to become the second to take effect  hit an abrupt halt last month when a federal judge blocked the law   deeming the Trump administration s approval  arbitrary and capricious   The U S  Department of Health and Human Services never fully considered whether Kentucky s plan will provide medical assistance to residents  U S  District Judge James Boasberg ruled  The state said it will amend its proposal in hopes of clearing the legal hurdle  In Kentucky alone  nearly 100 000 more people could be eliminated from Medicaid within five years than without the new measures  state estimates say  Kentuckians who do not work 80 hours in any one month or fail to pay new premiums will be locked out for six months  beneficiaries could take a health or financial literacy course to reactivate coverage  In Arkansas  those who fail to meet the work requirements for any three months will be locked out of health insurance for the remainder of the year  In meetings with state legislators  the Arkansas Hospital Association has expressed concern that many affected by the rules will either not be able to find work  or won t be able to meet online filing requirements because they live in rural areas without reliable Internet access   We re worried about people losing coverage who should not be losing their coverage   said Bo Ryall  the group s president  As he visited a local health clinic for severe back pain  Bryant pondered that question   I thought the insurance was to help us  even if you re working  even if you re not working   he said   It was supposed to help us  not pull us down   MEDICAID GIVE AND TAKE The Republican controlled Congress tried several times last year to repeal Obamacare  formally known as the Affordable Care Act  and replace it with new legislation that would have overhauled Medicaid by giving states block grants to run their own Medicaid programs in lieu of the existing federal state partnership  Their proposals would have cut federal spending on the government s health insurance program for the poor and disabled by nearly  800 billion over 10 years  When those efforts failed  the Trump administration put a conservative stamp on health policy  including approving state requests to implement work requirements  Most states that have submitted proposals will require adult beneficiaries who are not disabled  pregnant or elderly to engage in some combination of work  volunteer  job training or school opportunities for at least 80 hours a month   or lose their benefits  Such requirements create new hurdles to healthcare businesses in states that adopt them  Those businesses  including health insurers  hospitals and community clinics  say they re moving to minimize the number of people who could lose their insurance  WellCare  N WCG   one of Kentucky s five Medicaid providers  said it will help connect members with job opportunities and training courses  It will staff a call center for beneficiaries to navigate requirements and services such as child care or access to food  The insurer has been meeting for more than a year with state officials gearing up for the program rollout  said Bill Jones  WellCare s state president in Kentucky  The company  which administers Medicaid plans in 12 states  has grown its business considerably since the Medicaid expansion took effect in 2014  Its stock price has more than tripled in that time   There s always a concern there s going to be business impact  I just want to make sure we re not losing the wrong members   Jones said  referring to beneficiaries who meet the requirements but don t properly log their hours  The insurer could lose members who transition to employer provided coverage  Jones added  calling that the  right reason   Hospital and insurer lobbyists have begun pushing state government and health officials to allow for flexibility in exemptions from work  such as for those who live in areas with high unemployment  and to allow for a grace period before someone is locked out  They also want states to weigh worries that Medicaid members may not have transportation to work   Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield has staffers in its stores to help residents log their hours  The insurer will contact members not complying with work requirements   by  among other steps  tracking whether patients have picked up a pharmacy prescription  The pharmacist would then ensure customers understand the new rules  Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield said it was working with Walmart  N WMT   Walgreens  O WBA   CVS  N CVS   local pharmacies and others  In Arkansas  the work requirements apply to the Medicaid expansion population  which totals about 300 000 people  But many will be exempt from the new rules thanks to exceptions  including for illness  disability  pregnancy or their role as a caregiver  Still  state officials estimate that up to 30 000 40 000 people in the first phase will have to find work to maintain their benefits  in which able bodied adults 30 49 who earn less than  680 a month must submit documents each month showing they have worked or volunteered  In 2019  the program extends to adults 19 29  Ennis Barnes  40  fears he won t make the cut  The new rules coincide with similar requirements for Arkansas food stamp recipients  and Barnes has already received notice his food benefits will be reduced  Barnes lives in rural Lepanto  Arkansas  For several years  he s worked with temp agencies to connect with manufacturing jobs  He worries companies won t hire him permanently because of a drug charge dating back more than a decade  He works as a barber in his house a couple days a week   work that will not count toward his required hours since he doesn t get a pay stub   I ve got a family to take care of  grandbabies and everything   Barnes said   I just don t understand   Kentucky planned to introduce its  community engagement  requirements this month for able bodied adults 19 64 who are not pregnant  medically frail  a single parent  chronically homeless  in substance abuse treatment  enrolled in food stamps or a full time student  The state is phasing in beneficiaries by region  The requirements also impose premium payments based on income  some who fail to make the payment will have to take a financial literacy course  That plan hit a roadblock in federal court  Sixteen Medicaid recipients in Kentucky won a federal lawsuit asking a judge to overturn the state s work requirements  contending the federal HHS went beyond its authority by approving Kentucky s waiver  The lawsuit said the plaintiffs are at risk of losing health benefits because of new eligibility criteria  the highest ever premiums allowed in Medicaid and lockouts for those not meeting the requirements  Kentucky said the judge blocked the program on the  narrow basis  that HHS had not considered the plan s impact on Medicaid coverage  and said it would work with the agency to address the issue  Days after the ruling  Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin cut dental and vision benefits for some 460 000 state Medicaid recipients  saying the benefits were dependent on implementation of the community engagement requirements  Without the new rules   immediate benefit reductions would be required to compensate for the increasing costs of expanded Medicaid   said Doug Hogan  spokesman for the state s Cabinet for Health and Family Services  Some legal experts say the ruling could thwart the Trump administration s Medicaid blueprint  should residents in other states bring similar lawsuits   It points to the failure of the administration to provide a legitimate record to justify the approval   said Allison Hoffman  a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School   It s unlikely that they re going to come up with the kind of evidence they need to show that the requirements here actually make poor people healthier   BIG EMPLOYERS  PART TIME WORKERS Major corporations with large numbers of part time workers  such as Walmart  headquartered in Bentonville  Arkansas  are one focal point of concern  The world s largest retailer has shifted to more part time workers over the last decade  according to a May report from the Organization United for Respect  formerly called OUR Walmart  The labor group says it is a network of more than 150 000 people working in low wage retail jobs  An estimated 50 percent of Walmart s U S  workforce in 2018 is part time  compared to 20 percent in 2005  the report said  Daniel Schlademan  OUR s co director of organization  said that means more Walmart workers rely on state Medicaid programs for their healthcare  but did not provide figures   All this is going to do is make more people have less coverage   he said   Walmart said its health plan covers more than one million people in the U S   including spouses and dependents  and has seen the number of associates eligible for health coverage grow as its full time workforce expanded  Its part time employees are eligible for medical benefits if they average 30 hours per week over a 12 month period  the company said  Walmart did not say how many of its employees receive health benefits  and it declined to provide a breakdown of part time and full time workers  The company disputed the OUR report  saying it converts about 150 000 employees a year from part  to full time   We are proud to be one of the few retailers with a majority full time hourly workforce   said Walmart spokesman Justin Rushing   We have more full time jobs than any private business in America and we have seen that percentage go up over the last few years   Part time and temporary workers could be particularly vulnerable with the new changes  Part timers comprised nearly 16 percent of Arkansas  workforce in 2017  or 208 000 people  federal data show  Walmart and poultry producer  Tyson Foods   N TSN   another large Arkansas employer  declined to discuss how the Medicaid measures would affect their workforces  Other large state employers  including propane supplier Ferrellgas  N FGP   chicken producer OK Foods  Cooper Tire   Rubber Co  N CTB  and department store chain Dillards  declined comment  Supporters of the new law say it will push more residents to find full time work  Arkansas  for one  is short on registered nurses  certified nurse assistants  technical health field workers  truck drivers  construction workers and manufacturing laborers  said Arkansas Chamber of Commerce President Randy Zook   It s going to persuade some people to take another look and likely they ll find better opportunities than they thought were available   Zook said  Some Arkansans noted  though  that the new rules could be a challenge for people in rural pockets where full time job openings have historically been thin  Tina Lotts  46  is one case study  She works 40 hours a week as a security guard at a consumer goods and technology warehouse  Yet Lotts is not considered a full time employee and doesn t qualify for healthcare coverage from her employer  A diabetic  Lotts relies on Medicaid for her doctor visits and the four medications needed to control her blood sugar levels and hypertension   I have 11 bills and it s hard to pay them all   Lotts said  Since he lost his short term disability payments  Bryant is applying for long term disability in the hope of receiving an exemption from Arkansas  requirements so that he is not at risk of losing his insurance  His wife  Felicia  has already applied for long term disability due to vertigo  sciatic nerve pain and other issues  Ideally  Bryant said  his new job will turn into full time work and he won t need an exemption   I m trying to find work every day   Indeed  labor advocates challenge the notion that able bodied Americans haven t pushed to find jobs  an underlying tenet of the new rules  The number of Americans actively engaged in the labor force who are looking  but haven t found jobs  has declined to an 18 year low of 3 8 percent  and is considered near or at full employment   These are people who want to work full time but can t get full time work   said William Spriggs  chief economist of the AFL CIO union  To Spriggs  the work requirements are  extremely na ve to assume that simply looking for a job gets someone a job    or  at worst   mean spirited   Hutchinson  governor of the new law s first test case  disagrees   It s not punitive   he said   It s simply that we respect work and we know the people of Arkansas want to work

Each week I break down events into good and bad  For our purposes   good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
Feel free to add items that I have missed  Please keep in mind that we are looking for current news  especially from the last week or so  WTWA is not about long term concerns like debt  These are important  of course  but not our weekly subject unless there has been some major change 
The Good

Personal income just met expectations  but the gain of 0 4  is solid 
Initial jobless claims declined to 215K  much better than expectations of 230K and a new cycle low  It is the lowest week since January of 1973  I like  because it shows both a longer term trend as well as a focus on recent results 




Q4 GDP revised higher to an annualized real rate of 2 9   better than the last estimate of 2 5  and expectations for improvement 
Pending home sales increased 3 1   beating expectations and bouncing back from the January results  revised even lower   The index is still down 4 1  year over year    
Bearish sentiment increased  a contrarian indicator    


The Bad

Chicago PMI declined from 61 9 to 57 4  missing expectations for a slight increase  This is often an indication of the ISM index to be released on Monday 
Consumer confidence softened  although the market is not really treating the near record levels as  bad  

Conference Board 127 7 with 130 prior and forecast 
Michigan sentiment 101 4 with 102 preliminary and consensus  Despite missing expectations  this final reading is the highest since 2004    


Home prices still lag historical growth patterns and measured in real terms  remain 11 1  below the bubble peak   the importance of this approach instead of the typical comparison of nominal prices 

The Ugly
Managerial responses  I am struggling to find the right adjective for the delayed Facebook  NASDAQ FB  apology and policy changes  Large organizations are clumsy when there is no plan in place for a particular event  Facebook s personal link to users contributed to setting the bar higher 
Michigan State University continues to struggle with the consequences of an institutional failure to protect its students  Just when it seemed like the Nassar story had played out  we learn of  against former MSU dean William Strampel  These relate not only to his supervision of Nassar  but allegations about his own acts of sexual harassment and assault  How is management handling the problem  Among other steps they  to a consulting firm to monitor social media  including the accounts of victims 
Mrs  OldProf  when consulted on this question  rattled off some better ideas for a university to spend that amount  along with sympathy for the many innocent students and faculty with ties to the university 
We always hope that our institutions will improve on past mistakes  but this is not encouraging 
The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react 
The Calendar
We have a big economic calendar  featuring the employment report for March  the ISM manufacturing and service indexes  both   and auto sales 
There is a bit of FedSpeak  Congress is in recess  Despite this  the Washington circus may well dominate the news   once again 
 has a good U S  economic calendar for the week  and many other good features which I monitor each day   Here are the main U S  releases 

Next Week s Theme
The economic calendar is more important than usual  with key reports on employment  the ISM surveys  and data on auto sales  While there have been some soft spots  the economic story has remained strong and corporate earnings growth has been excellent  Meanwhile  stocks have given up the gains from early in 2018 
As fund managers  investment committees  investors   and of course the punditry   pause to review the quarter  they will see a mixed picture  Brian Gilmartin sets the table for this week  Earnings estimate revisions are strong  but Q1 stock performance was negative  What is the explanation 
Why the divergence between stock prices and the earnings outlook 
This question lies at the heart of investment plans  Here are the popular alternatives  beginning with those that question the fundamental strength to those that dismiss the current market  message  

At last  The market is finally starting to see the wisdom of my valuation measures  You can see AMZN plummet as people finally calculate its Q ratio  And those pesky forward earnings increases will come down rapidly when this  half cycle  is over and CAPE is king again 
Early year gains were built on false optimism  Reality has set in 
The YTD results are quite normal if one looks at history  See the Jill Mislinski drawdown chart below 
Welcome to normal   David Templeton   
The Trump tax rally has met the Trump trade decline  This is the result   the distortions from mixing political viewpoints with investments  He observes how fear has become extreme despite slender evidence 




Earnings prospects remain strong  despite challenges from the trade controversy  This remains true if one focuses on revenue  avoiding the typical arguments about measuring earnings    



Markets eventually reflect reality   but perhaps not right away     

As usual  I ll save my own conclusions for today s Final Thought

Risk Analysis
I have a rule for my investment clients  Think first about your risk  Only then should you consider possible rewards  I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update 
The Indicator Snapshot

Short term trading conditions worsened this week  In mildly bearish conditions our trading approaches can still be profitable  but that might not be true for everyone  We continue to monitor the technical health measures on a daily basis  If this indicator goes to fullish bearish  we liquidate trading positions  This is not a forecast that the market will decline  It indicates increased difficulty in trading profitably 
The long term fundamentals and outlook are little changed  The FOMC decision flattened the yield curve a bit  and that is one component of the C Score  Based upon historical data for this indicator  I have increased the 9 month recession probability to the 18  range  I am monitoring  but not yet especially worried  Please see James Picerno below 
The Featured Sources 
  Business cycle analysis via the  C Score 
  Strong quantitative indicators for both economic and market analysis 
  All things earnings  for the overall market as well as many individual companies 
  Business cycle indicator and market timing tools  None of Georg s indicators signal recession 
  Regular updating of an array of indicators  Great charts and analysis  With more new reports  it is time for an update of the    indicators  Results  while still solid  are a touch weaker in Q1 than at the end of the year 

Guests 
James Picerno cites another Fed official  Loretta Mester  expressing skepticism about the value of the yield curve as a signal for economic weakness  Last week James noted a comment from the new Fed Chair  Jerome Powell  questioning the usefulness of yield curve inversion as an indicator of the economy  That is something to watch 
 an indicator based upon an aggregate of regional Fed surveys  I am not a fan of the individual components  so I like this idea  Just to provide a taste  he is a combination of the Capex element   especially important for continuing growth 

Insight for Traders
Our discussion of trading ideas has moved to the weekly Stock Exchange post  The coverage is bigger and better than ever  We combine links to trading articles  topical themes  and ideas from our trading models  Each week we explore a topic of current interest  drawing upon trading experts    Do you keep a shopping list ready   We discussed some stock ideas and updated the ratings lists for Felix and Oscar  this week featuring the S P 500   has taken the lead role on this post  using information both from me and from the models  He is doing a great job  presenting a wealth of new ideas and information each week 
While my intent is to focus on traders  long term investors may also benefit  That was especially true in this week s post 
Insight for Investors
Investors should have a long term horizon  They can often exploit trading volatility  I remind investors of this each week  but now is the time to pay attention 
Best of the Week
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be Morgan Housel s honest and insightful observation about the investment sales process   Using powerful illustrative analogies  he explains how the process should be client focused  not dependent upon the advisor s own ideas  As he so often does  Morgan has put this well 

Claiming your investment product is entertaining is usually the refuge of those who can t point to performance  But it s crazy to assume that many people don t find investing incredibly entertaining   so much so that they rationally do nutty stuff regardless of what it does to their returns 


Everyone giving investing advice   or even just sharing investing opinions   should keep top of mind how emotional money is and how different people are  If the appropriate path of cancer treatments isn t universal  man  don t pretend like your bond strategy is appropriate for everyone  even when it aligns with their time horizon and net worth 


The best way to talk to people about money is keeping the phrases   What do you want to do   or  Whatever works for you   loaded and ready to fire  You can explain to other people the history of what works and what hasn t while acknowledging their preference to sleep well at night over your definition of  winning

Strategy   Value Investing
Davidson  via Todd Sullivan  offers insights on   and a couple of   I especially like posts with an educational them and clear illustrations  These meet those tests 
Charlie Bilello    explains that any investment factor  including the value approach  will have periods of significant under performance  Most active managers are quick to dump something that has not  worked  for a year or two 


The problem    3 year underperformance is far from atypical for any smart beta strategy  To the contrary  large cap value has actually underperformed large caps in 51  of rolling 3 year periods going back to 1981  
 Jeff  Strategies that work well in the long run usually have lagging periods  The drive for short term performance leaves many active managers chasing what worked last year  Individual investors can choose better 
Watch out for
Pot stocks  according to a   Bill Alpert analyzes the Canadian stocks  comparing valuations to other markets like gold and alcohol  He writes 

As they often do  investors have celebrated this emerging business early by embracing Canadian companies that claim a cannabis connection  Traveling in Canada  cabbies  bankers  and even border guards will tell you their favorites in a bubble that has floated Canadian cannabis stocks to a collective stock market value above  30 billion  That s already about half the market capitalization of Canada s gold mining industry 



But a Canada weed glut is a real risk  At current valuations  marijuana stocks are already too high for an investor tempted to join the party 

Indexed annuities   reports that annual sales were the lowest since the late  90s  apparently because of the fiduciary rule which went into effect in June  If you do not understand what this means  you should get a second opinion before buying an annuity

Final Thoughts
What is normal  Analyzing the market depends on what to expect  Intelligent people who follow financial news will see an  explanation  for everything  even when the market moves are below the typical noise level  No one on financial TV discusses signal to noise 
If your experience is limited to recent years  you will face some surprises  The market is returning to normal  It seems unusual only in the perspective of recent experience  Let s take a closer look 
Market efficiency  Markets are efficient eventually  but often not in short time frames  I wrote a  to alert readers to the current action about how to exploit market inefficiencies  I hope you gained from the ideas  which worked well  but opportunity still abounds   that returns are  lumpy  
Risk  An important part of my interview with a potential client is aligning expectations with their personal needs and concerns  The multiple choice tests for risk tolerance may be OK for satisfying regulators  but they do not really reveal much about the investor  An honest balance of needs and risk requires work  That starts with a realistic idea about risk 
Stock programs typically offer the highest potential return  We take several steps  documented regularly in WTWA  to limit the biggest risks  That said  15 20  drawdowns go with the territory  There is usually not a clear cut reason  although speculation abounds  After a period of extremely small drawdowns and hardly any volatility  even a partial return to normal can be upsetting  Volatility also seems greater because the moves reflect near daily surprises out of Washington  The  provides perspective 

Volatility is normal  Despite the breathless TV commentary  daily stock average moves of 1  are normal  Your own holdings  if both attractive and aggressive  may have larger moves   how volatility  as we have been documenting weekly  is gradually returning to normal levels  The point moves seem large with the averages close to all time highs  but the percentage changes are routine 


Long term investment prospects are solid  The three key elements are all in place 

Expected earnings
Low inflation expectations  and therefore bond yields 
Low inflation risk

Since many confuse headlines with fundamental valuation measures  the market remains inefficient  There are many cheap stocks that are even more attractive than the averages  You just need to know how to look for them 
Investment Conclusion
Early last year  there were many skeptical investors  When the tax cuts passed  many stocks celebrated the repatriation of assets and lower future rates  Investors who were out of the market often felt that they had missed a great opportunity   If only     was a popular refrain 
What about a second chance  a reset  Since I stick to the numbers  I see a chance for investors to re establish a basic stock position  You need not  and should not  go all in  You need a plan  Unless you expect to remain forever on the sideline 
Many investors wait for a dip and then are talked out of their plan it when it comes 
I m more worried about 

The investigation spiral  Is there a threat that the various allegations  lawsuits  and investigations will rise beyond the irritation level  I have no good answer  but my concern has increased in recent weeks 
Leadership turnover  While it is not obvious to some  government agencies benefit from stable and experienced leadership  It is important to have loyal  honest  and dependable nominees at the head of agencies  They should also have an able and experience supporting staff  There is a recurring pattern of deviation from long held and valuable historical norms 

I m less worried about 

Finding stock opportunities  Whatever your analysis of the Trump Administration policies  there is a winners list 
Trade issues  There was  apparently and maybe  some progress this week  Certainly with S  Korea  and maybe on other fronts  There seems to be some progress in the Trump deal making strategy

Corporation   NYSE DG   and Walgreens Boots Alliance  Inc    NASDAQ WBA   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Stocks with Impressive Interest Coverage Ratio to Buy NowWe often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers  These  however  may not be enough  Sometimes  a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter  This will definitely be a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on  But if you seek long term returns  investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results A critical analysis of a company s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision  Here  coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role  The higher the ratio  the better it is  The focus of this article is on  Interest Coverage   which is one such ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to

179258,400774,WBA,Can Strategic Efforts Aid Fred s To Achieve A Turnaround ,opinion,With underperforming stores  cancellation of dividends and continued bottom line loses  Fred s  Inc  s   NASDAQ FRED   troubles have been aggravating and denting its business for a while  However  to cater to consumers  rapidly changing preferences and sustain market competition  the company has been focusing on pharmacy organization for driving scripts into its stores   Additionally  it has been putting much effort to reduce operating expenses Let s take a look into the factors that have been bruising this discount retailer and discuss the growth plans it has put into place for achieving recovery Factors Denting the StockFred s comps have long been ailing from store closures  thanks to receding store traffic   To top it  comps have also been bearing the brunt of continued increase in generic dispensing rate and sale of low productive discontinued inventory  Persistent challenges in the front store business and competitive consumable categories have also affected overall sales figures  Due to these downsides  comps dipped 1 2   0 3  and 0 8  during the first  second and third quarters  respectively  In addition to dismal comps  increased promotional activity to drive store traffic has been denting business  Incidentally  the company has been reporting bottom line losses for six straight quarters Moreover  the company s business expansion plans were eclipsed by the cancelled Walgreens Boots Alliance   NASDAQ WBA   and Rite Aid Corporation   NYSE RAD   merger in June 2017  If the deal were to materialize  it would have positioned Fred s as the third largest drugstore chain in the nation after Walgreens and CVS Health Corporation   NYSE CVS    However  obstacles such as antitrust concerns cancelled the deal and kept Fred s far behind industry leaders To make matters worse  management announced the cancellation of dividend alongside a dismal third quarter results  In combination  all such factors have gravely affected the company s price performance  The stock has lost 80  in the past year  against the  s rally of 15  Can Efforts Revive Performance Fred s strives to improve store traffic and has accordingly shifted focus to pharmacy organization  This is likely to drive scripts into its stores and improve services for patients  Fred s Retail Pharmacy business seems to be stable  benefiting from the company s shift to profitable generic prescriptions  In order to improve retail pharmacy business  the company has been expanding flu shots capacity along with aggressive inventory management and marketing initiatives Further  management continues to build momentum in the Specialty Pharmacy business through investing in sales team  therapy diversification and technology  Owing to such efforts  the company expects its specialty business to gain access to 5 million new patients across different markets in the forthcoming periods  Additionally  such efforts position the company for new drug introductions  improve data flow and thereby increase efficiency in patient care Fred s also initiated several measures for reducing excess inventory and improving technology to better manage product life cycle  During the third quarter  the company witnessed a turnaround in its tobacco business as well as improved sales of its beer and cosmetics businesses  Further  the company expects improved trends in these categories in the forthcoming periods Along with strengthening pharmacy operations  expense reduction is also listed amongst Fred s efforts to achieve profitability  During the third quarter  management successfully reduced selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses by 7  to  133 4 million  Further  management expects lower SG A costs to help augment free cash flows  The company expects to pass the gains from the reduced cost structure to its customers and drive store traffic  Moreover  management plans to allocate funds derived from the cancelled dividend toward curtailing debt load  buyback shares and undertake other corporate initiatives With such prospective endeavors in place  all is not gloomy for this Zacks Rank   3  Hold  stock and we can still hope for its revival from the shambles  We hope that such dedicated efforts will help the company to uplift investors  confidence in the stock in the long

179306,400822,WBA,3 Earnings Reports to Watch Today  MON  WBA  SONC,opinion,"Later today we get three big earnings reports to start the New Year and the fourth quarter reporting season  which roughly reflects company performance from October   December 2017  varies by company  
1  Monsanto  NYSE MON  
Materials   Chemicals   Reports January 4  before the open 
The Estimize consensus on  calls for EPS of  0 42  four cents higher than the Wall Street consensus  and is suggesting YoY growth of 81   Revenues are also expected to beat  with the Estimize community looking for  2 88B vs  the Street s  2 72B  
What to Watch  Solid growth expectations appear to be back for Monsanto after a hiccup in FQ3 2017  Analysts on Estimize increased their EPS estimates for the quarter reporting today by 75  in the last 3 months   from  0 24 on October 4  to the current expectation of  0 42  Demand for crop yield enhancing products such as Roundup Ready Xtend Crop System and specialized herbicides like XtendiMax has remained strong  Last quarter s growth was lead by the Seeds and Genomics segment due to the adoption of newer soybean and cotton technologies  While the company pointed out adoption for their latest corn hybrids was picking up  sales of corn seed and traits were a weak spot in 2017  The  66B buyout from Bayer  DE BAYGN  should close early on this year 
2  Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA 
Consumer Staples   Food   Staples Retailing   Reports January 4  before the open 
The Estimize consensus on  calls for EPS of  1 30  three cents higher than the Wall Street consensus  with revenues nearly in line at  30 3B 

What to Watch  All eyes will be on sales at Walgreens Retail Pharmacy USA division today  Last quarter pharmacy sales increased nearly 13  YoY due to higher prescription volumes  Despite the fact that comparable pharmacy sales increased 5 6   they were negatively impacted by reimbursement pressure and generics which will likely resurface again in this report  While the Rite Aid  NYSE RAD  deal announced in September will have no impact on this quarter s results  investors will be looking for an update on Walgreen s agreement to purchase 1 932 Rite Aid stores over the next 3 years  an arrangement that should be beneficial to both company s bottom lines 
3  Sonic Corp   NASDAQ SONC 
Consumer Discretionary   Hotels  Restaurants   Leisure   Reports January 4  after the close 
The Estimize consensus calls on   NASDAQ SONC  is for EPS of  0 26  one cent higher than the Wall Street consensus  with revenues nearly in line at  106M 

What to Watch  Sonic s expectations have come down considerably in the last quarter  with EPS estimates retreating 10   and revenues decreasing by 3  over that time  likely due to poor results reported for FQ4 2017  During that quarter same store sales slipped 3 3   the fifth consecutive quarterly decline  due to weak customer traffic which fell by over 3  due to an increasingly competitive environment where McDonald s  NYSE MCD  saw traffic increase by 2 1   Unfavorable weather and ill received menu additions and summer promotions also played a large role  The company s 2018 guidance calls for same store sales in the range of 0    2   which could mean a slight improvement in today s numbers ",2018-01-04,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-earnings-reports-to-watch-tomorrow-mon-wba-sonc-200277449,200277449

It s the latest twist in the ongoing saga between the two companies  which drew scrutiny from US antitrust regulators earlier this year after announcing a merger valued at  17 2 billion back in October 2015  The deal would ve seen Walgreens acquire all outstanding shares of Rite Aid  The new deal will replace the original merger agreement

The asset sale will reposition Rite Aid as an independent  multiregional drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager  according to a press release from the company  Rite Aid will also have the option to buy generic drugs from an affiliate of Walgreens 
Further  Rite Aid is expected to use the proceeds from the deal to  significantly  reduce debt and strengthen its balance sheet  the release said 
 While we believe that pursuing the merger with WBA was the right thing to do for our investors and customers  this new agreement provides a clear path forward   Rite Aid chairman and CEO John Standley said in a statement   The transaction offers clear solutions to assist us in addressing our pharmacy margin challenges and allows us to significantly reduce debt

179379,400895,WBA,Tobacco Stocks In Focus As Cigarette Prices Rise In New York,opinion,"It seems that the leaders of New York City have been striving hard to make the city smoke free  In fact  the Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York has reportedly issued a series of laws in April to reduce the number of smokers in the city over the next three years 
Per the Aug 28 bill  the minimum price for a pack of cigarettes will now be  13 in New York  Notably  a packet of cigarettes currently costs  10 50  The latest price hike has made New York the most expensive city in the U S  for cigarettes  as declared by some officials in the Health Department stated in sources  In the past too  the mayor has resorted to price hike as a tool to restrict smokers  Smoking rate in the city has declined from 21 5  in 2002 to about 14 3  in 2015  The rate is expected to decline to 12  by 2020 due to this price hike  as anticipated by some city health officials 
The law was introduced in anticipation of making almost 900 000 smokers quit smoking as well as to reduce the number of retailers licensed to sell tobacco products in the city  Currently  about 8 300 retailers have a license to sell cigarettes 
The mayor is also seeking to ban the sale of all tobacco products in pharmacies  as a result of which pharmacy chains like Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc  s   NASDAQ WBA   Duane Reade and CVS Health Corporation   NYSE CVS   will have to take cigarettes off their shelves  The new legislation also requires licensing of e cigarette retailers and will force all residential buildings to have smoking policies  including banning cigarettes in common areas like hallways 
We note that these measures will severely dent businesses of tobacco majors including Philip Morris International Inc    NYSE PM    Altria Group Inc    NYSE MO    British American Tobacco  LON BATS  p l c    NYSE BTI   and Vector Group Ltd    NYSE VGR    which are already plagued by ongoing government restrictions related to selling and packaging 
If we look into the share price performance of these tobacco stocks in comparison with the   we note that except Philip Morris  all the other stocks have underperformed the industry that declined 5 6  in the past six months  While Philip Morris gained 5 5  and British American declined 4 3   Vector Group and Altria declined 7 8  and 15 4   respectively  in the same time frame 


Recently  the state government in India s capital directed Philip Morris and other tobacco companies to remove all advertisements in the city  warning them of legal action if they do not comply  Last month  the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  proposed to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes  as it is responsible for a number of health issues 
Governments around the world are imposing restrictions on tobacco companies which  in turn  are lowering cigarette consumption  The FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking  The European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act  Per the act  menthol has an adverse effect on health and thus should not be used in any product 
Amid increasing government restrictions and declining smoking rates  the tobacco giants have introduced e cigarettes and Reduced Risk Products to mitigate losses  Altria is expanding presence in the e cigarette market steadily with its MarkTen and Green Smoke brands 
On the other hand  Philip Morris has been gaining from its iQOS smokeless cigarettes since its launch in November 2014  The marketing and technology sharing agreement between Philip Morris and its peer Altria Group is also boosting the business of both the companies amid declining tobacco volumes 
However  the FDA also imposed several restrictions on e cigarettes  The FDA made it mandatory for all tobacco makers to seek marketing authorization for any tobacco product introduced after Feb 15  2007  The law was extended to include e cigarettes  pipe tobacco  cigars and hookah  The FDA has currently deferred its reviews for products like cigars and hookah tobacco until 2021 and e cigarettes until 2022 
Bottom Line
While price hike and lower availability of cigarettes do help smokers to quit smoking  as seen in the past  the ban also creates a serious black market for these products  which can be detrimental to all tobacco companies

179380,400896,WBA,Why Did Rite Aid  RAD  Stock Crash Today ,opinion,"Shares of Rite Aid   NYSE RAD   fell more than 10  on Tuesday after Walgreens Boots   NASDAQ WBA   received government approval to buy fewer Rite Aid stores than had initially been proposed 
In order to clear a regulatory hurdle presented by the Federal Trade Commission  Walgreens Boots said it would only buy 1 932 stores from Rite Aid  The deal is still worth a whopping  4 38 billion  but that total is a full 254 fewer stores than the companies agreed to in June 
Walgreens Boots also said that it intends to acquire three Rite Aid distribution centers located in Connecticut  Pennsylvania  and South Carolina  The exchange and transition of these distribution centers will not begin for at least another year  however 
Today s approval looks to be the final chapter in what has been a lengthy saga involving Walgreens and Rite Aid  Earlier this year  Walgreens said it was calling off its nearly two year operation to acquire its rival pharmacy company after numerous antitrust cases halted the deal 
Instead  Walgreens would settle for acquiring just under half of Rite Aid s domestic stores a figure that has obviously since been reduced  Still  the store purchase plan should help widen Walgreens Boots  foothold in the U S   where it also competes with the likes of CVS Health Corp    NYSE CVS   
 With this process taking close to two years to come to a conclusion  we think the final outcome and the structure of the transaction were well anticipated   an analyst at Pivotal Research Group told    However  with each recent iteration of the transaction  the economics appear to be shifting more and more in Walgreens  favor  
The store purchases will begin in October and will be completed in spring 2018  Walgreens said  The company also noted that the acquisitions will not have a significant impact on the company s earnings for the fiscal year ending Aug  31  2018  although it expects annual synergies to reach  300 million eventually 
 We are confident in the path ahead and look forward to working together to shape the future of health care and deliver on the full potential these stores bring to our network   Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina said in a press release

179416,400932,WBA,Walgreens  Rite Aid Ditch Long Suffering Drugstore Merger,opinion,"On Thursday  Walgreens Boots Alliance   NASDAQ WBA    that it has abandoned efforts to merge with fellow drugstore chain Rite Aid   NYSE RAD    Instead  Walgreens will purchase almost half if its rivals stores after the deal passes U S  regulatory scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission 
In premarket trading  shares of Walgreens were up about 3 7   though it has settled a bit  and is currently down 0 60  in late morning trading  Rite Aid shares were down over 4  in premarket trading  and have now plunged over 26  in light of the news 
Under the terms of the new deal  Walgreens will acquire 2 186 Rite Aid stores and related assets for  5 175 billion  Rite Aid will remain a  multi regional  drugstore chain  and the store locations being acquired are primarily in the Northeast  Mid Atlantic  and Southeastern regions of the U S 
 It will allow us to expand and optimize our retail pharmacy network in key markets in the U S   including the Northeast  and provide customers and patients with greater access to convenient  affordable care   Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina said   We believe this new transaction addresses competitive concerns previously raised with respect to the prior transaction  
For Walgreens  the new transaction will be significantly less expensive  The original deal between the drugstore giant and its smaller competitor came in at about  9 4 billion  though the price range was lowered between  6 8 billion to  7 4 billion in January  The new deal stays  true to our original strategic aim   Pessina said   Overall I view this deal as being more attractive than the transaction it replaces  
For Rite Aid  the company said it will use the proceeds to pay down debt  and the bonds gained on that news   that the company s  6 75 percent unsecured notes due in 2021 rose as much as 4 cents on the dollar to 102 875   while the 7 7 percent notes due in 2027 were trading as high as 102 75 Thursday morning in New York  
 While we believe that pursuing the merger with WBA was the right thing to do for our investors and customers  this new agreement provides a clear path forward and positions Rite Aid as a strong  independent  multi regional drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager with a compelling footprint in key markets   Rite Aid CEO John Standley said in a statement 
This new deal also means that pharmacy chain Fred s Inc    NASDAQ FRED   will no longer be a buyer of Rite Aid stores  Last December  the company announced it would purchase 865 stores for  950 million in cash  Shares of Fred s are down about 19  in late morning trading  The pharmacy operates stores in 16 Southeastern states
Walgreens said it will begin taking over the Rite Aid stores over a period of about six months  and intends to covert the stores to the Walgreens name brand over time

179417,400933,WBA,Fred s Stock Falls  Walgreens   Rite Aid Merger Deal Revised,opinion,"Fred s  Inc    NASDAQ FRED   or Fred s Pharmacy lost over 20  yesterday after Walgreens Boots Alliance  Inc    NASDAQ WBA   decided not to proceed with its planned takeover of the rival drugstore Rite Aid Corporation   NYSE RAD   due to various antitrust issues  as per Bloomberg  The cancelled merger significantly hurt Rite Aid s stock too  which fell 26 46  yesterday amid Federal Trade Commission  FTC  pushback 
What Led to the Revision of the Deal 
Walgreen Boots Alliance had agreed to acquire Rite Aid in Oct 2015 for about  9 4 billion  In order to obtain FTC s approval for the transaction  Fred s inked a deal in Dec 2016 with Rite Aid and Walgreens to buy 865 stores located in the eastern and western U S   along with certain assets for a total cash outlay of  950 million Fred s also announced plans to buy additional assets  including up to 1 200 Rite Aid stores  Notably  Fred s could also forge ahead with the deal only after the proposed merger of Rite Aid and Walgreens received clearance from FTC 
FTC was slated to announce its decision on the Walgreens Rite Aid merger on Jul 7  Though the deal was anticipated to hurt competition  there were indications earlier this week that the  
However  Walgreens was unlikely to get a FTC clearance and thus considered a revision of the previously announced merger deal 
Revised Deal   A Boon for Rite Aid  A Curse for Fred s
Under the terms of the revised deal  Walgreens  the pharmacy giant  agreed to acquire 2 186 stores and related assets from Rite Aid for  5 175 billion  Walgreens  shares closed 1 66  higher yesterday after the announcement of the new deal 
This new downsized deal  if it gets FTC nod  would offer enough cash to Rite Aid to pay down its huge debt  It will transform Rite Aid into a smaller but a strong  independent  multi regional drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager with a compelling footprint in key markets 
However  it did not do any good to Fred s  as this new deal means that the company will no longer be a buyer of Rite Aid stores  Fred s was left disappointed after the cancelled merger  which would have given the company greater negotiating power and as many as 1 200 stores beyond small rural towns  It would have also improved the company s healthcare growth strategy and benefit customers  patients  payors  supplier partners  team members and shareholders 
The busted Walgreens Rite Aid pact was very crucial for Fred s as it would have positioned this regional pharmacy chain as the third largest drugstore chain in the U S  after Walgreens and CVS Health Corporation   NYSE CVS   
We note that Fred s has been disappointing investors of late  Fred s posted weaker than expected sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2017  wherein losses were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Adjusted quarterly loss of 6 cents per share was also unfavorable compared with the year ago quarter figure 3 cents  Decline in sales along with lower comps and gross margin contraction led to the decline  First quarter sales slipped 3 1  year over year to  532 2 million  while comparable store sales dipped 1 2   as a result of the sale of low productive discontinued inventory  The company is also facing headwinds in the competitive consumable categories Fred s  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Price Performance
If we look into the past six months performance of Fred s  we note that the Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock has significantly underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry 
The stock lost around 48 8  in the past six months  as compared to the industry s decline of 8 6  over the same time frame  You can see

Comparable store sales dipped 3 6   narrower than a 3 8  decline recorded in the preceding quarter  However  results compared unfavorably with 1 7  gain reported a year ago 
Gross profits slumped 2 5  year over year to  129 6 million  while gross margins increased 50 basis points  bps  to 24 5   driven by the successful and profitable sale of discontinued inventory  We note that this gross margin increase was significantly better than the 480 bps decline in gross margins in the preceding quarter  which was due to soft sales and continued reimbursement pressure in the pharmacy category 
In the fourth quarter  Fred s incurred an operating loss of  22 2 million  compared to a loss of  5 1 million incurred a year ago  Losses increased due to higher selling  general and administrative expenses 
Selling  general and administrative expenses  including depreciation and amortization  expanded 380 bps to 28 7  of sales mainly due to higher professional  legal  banking and integration planning fees incurred in connection with the

179474,400990,WBA,Here s Why I Like CVS Health Corporation,opinion,"Introduction
Investing in great companies sits at the core of my investment philosophy  In this regard  I reject the idea that I invest in the stock market  To me  the stock market is simply the store I shop in to purchase interests in fine businesses  In the final analysis  my investment objective is to become a long term shareholder partner in a business that I believe can make me money over time 
On the other hand  no matter how great I think the business is  I am also very focused on only investing in it at a fair price  When looking for great businesses  this can at times be a problem  Great businesses attract investors  and since stocks are liquid instruments  the forces of supply and demand can have a significant impact on valuation over the short run  In other words  the demand for great businesses is typically high 
Nevertheless  time is the equalizer where in the long run a company s stock price will be driven by its business success  When dealing with stocks  the common measuring sticks are earnings  cash flows and dividends   if a company pays one  Consequently  because of the supply demand dynamics over the short run  a company s valuation can be temporarily out of sync with its business success 
Therefore  to my way of thinking  the trick to long term investment success is to identify a great business and then invest in it only when the market offers it at a fair or attractive valuation  You can overpay for even the greatest company  and if you re diligent you can also find times when it is fairly valued or even undervalued  I am content to buy a great business at fair value  and I get quite excited when given the opportunity to invest at a low valuation  I have recently become interested in CVS Health Corporation  NYSE CVS  because I believe the market has recently provided an opportunity to invest in it at a fair price 
CVS Health Corporation a Great Business at a Fair Price
Before I delve into CVS Health Corporation s valuation  I would like to establish why I consider it a great business from a shareholder s perspective  For starters  I really admire the consistency of operating results that the company has generated  The following F A S T  Graph plots the company s earnings and dividends since 2000 through 2015  Note that I chose this timeframe because it includes both of our most recent recessions  It is very rare to find a company that has so consistently grown its earnings and dividends over time  Moreover  in addition to consistent growth  CVS s growth rate has also been significantly above average 
CVS has grown earnings at the compound annual rate of 12 5  since 2000 versus the S P 500 which has only grown earnings at the rate of 5 4   As I will later illustrate  CVS s stronger earnings and dividend growth has led to significantly higher returns than the market over this timeframe  Importantly  both capital appreciation and cumulative total dividend income have been superior with CVS  This illustrates my basic definition of a great business  A great business is one that has proven itself to grow faster and more consistently than the average company  CVS represents a quintessential example of that standard  as illustrated by the following earnings and dividend graph 

To further clarify this distinction  I also offer a similar graph on the S P 500 plotting earnings and dividends over the time frame 2000 2015  Not only have the S P 500 s earnings grown at less than half the rate of CVS s earnings  the overall market s earnings has also been significantly more cyclical  The market s dividend record is a little better  but dividends were cut in 2009  When stacked up against the average company  I consider CVS a great business 

As I indicated in the introduction  in addition to identifying a great business  I also want to see it at an attractive price  On these next two graphs I bring in monthly closing stock prices for both CVS and the S P 500  It s important that the reader recognizes that both CVS and the S P 500 were overvalued in 2000  For those that recall  calendar year 2000 represented the coming to the end of what was dubbed the  irrational exuberant period  in the stock market  Consequently  I would ve had no interest in investing in either at this time 
Furthermore  the reader should also note that both of these entities were also overvalued at the end of calendar year 2015  Consequently  I had no interest in investing in either of these entities during calendar year 2015  CVS continued to perform strongly on an operating basis  but stock price was so disconnected from fair value  the orange line on the graph  that I had no interest in spite of its impeccable operating record 


The following performance report compares CVS versus the S P 500 over this time frame  What I found interesting is how both CVS and the S P 500 produced capital appreciation returns that were lower than their respective earnings growth achievements  This is the effect that overvaluation had on both 
On the other hand  the great business CVS was still able to produce very attractive double digit total returns thanks for the most part to its high and consistent growth  In contrast  the S P 500 produced positive results but they pale in comparison to CVS  The simple lesson here is that valuation matters  and it matters a lot 

Now let s fast forward to current time and evaluate what CVS looks like today from a valuation perspective  Since the summer of 2015  and for most of 2016  CVS s stock price has been in a free fall  The net result is an approximately 23  drop off from its 2015 summer high  Investors hate it when a stock s price drops  and as a result it typically conjures up a lot of negativity 
In doing my research on CVS I have come across several recent articles on the company  most of them positive  However  some of the comments made in these articles illustrate my previous point about negative investor sentiment  Reasonable questions start to be asked such as   if the stock is so good  why does it keep dropping  But more importantly  answers to those questions are also offered  Some of those answers are relevant  some are rationalizations   and some even cynical laments with political overtones 
I support the proposition that everyone is entitled to their own opinions and views  However  to me  the answer to the question of why is the stock dropping seems quite obvious  It is quite clear to me that starting in the fall of 2014 the company s stock price began separating from its fundamental value and support  In my experience  when valuation gets extreme  a company s stock price becomes highly vulnerable to even a whiff of bad news  Furthermore  the more overvalued a stock is  the more vulnerable 
For example  in the case of retail pharmacy chain and pharmacy benefit management businesses such as CVS Health Corporation and Walgreens Boots Alliance  Inc   NASDAQ WBA  the threat of rising pressure to reduce reimbursement fees for generic drugs is seen as a potential threat to future profitability  Additionally  stiff competition is also a challenge that must be met  Nevertheless  demographics suggest a bright future for well managed companies within this sector  Consequently  expectations for continued growth remain strong 
With all that said  I contend that the biggest headwind that CVS has faced in recent years has been significant overvaluation  A quick glance at the following graph makes it clear to me that the biggest reason that the stock price has dropped is because it was ridiculously overvalued  And as the title of this article suggested  the fact that it has now moved down to a fair valuation level is precisely why I have become interested in it at this time 

CVS Health Corporation  Attractive Dividend Growth and Total Return Opportunity
Since CVS has recently moved into fair valuation territory  I have become interested in conducting a comprehensive research and due diligence process  That is not the same as saying I am recommending it as a strong buy  On the other hand  I am reasonably confident that a purchase made today would generate attractive long term future returns  It is possible that the stock could drop further based on negative investor sentiment  But  it is also possible that the price has bottomed out 
As investors  we must accept the reality that finding perfect tops or bottoms is rarely possible notwithstanding luck  But more importantly  you don t have to find the perfect bottom in order to make attractive long term returns  Potential short term pain can easily lead to exceptional long term gain as long as your original purchase is made at a sound valuation  Personally  I believe that CVS s stock price is currently at a sound level 
As a result  I have started a comprehensive research and due diligence process and so far I like what I see  With the remainder of this article  I will share much of what I found thus far  but also caution that this is still a work in progress  However  before I attempt to dig too deep into the workings of the company  I like to review important financial metrics such as the balance sheet  cash flow statement  profitability  and income statement 
The Balance Sheet
I believe that CVS s balance sheet is strong and healthy  Assets per share  atps  and book value or common equity per share  ceps  are both steadily increasing  Long term debt per share  dltps  and total debt per share  dtps  are at reasonable levels  Furthermore  the company s increase in debt in 2015 is primarily attributable to their acquisitions of Omnicare and Target s pharmacy and clinical businesses  Both of these acquisitions hold the promise to expand CVS s customer base and retail channels going forward 

Cash Flow Statement
Since dividends represent an important component of the allure for investing in CVS  I was gratified to see that cash flow per share  cflps  more than adequately covers their dividends 

Profitability
The retail pharmacy chain and pharmacy benefit management businesses do not produce exceptionally high gross profit margins  gpm  or net profit margins  npm   However  the consistency and predictability of these businesses still allows for high rates of bottom line growth  Gross profit margins for CVS have weakened slightly in recent years  but net profit margins have remained consistent  Moreover  I consider these reasonable margins a plausible defense against political onslaught considering the important nature of the business 

On the other hand  return on equity  roe  and return on invested capital  roi  have been improving in recent years 

The Income Statement
From the income statement perspective  I have previously covered CVS s consistent and high earnings growth  Additionally  cost of goods sold  cogsps  has also been rising  but revenue growth  revps  has been following suit 

Shareholder Friendly Management
Generally speaking  I consider the CVS management team as very shareholder friendly  Since fiscal year 2000  the company s dividend has grown at an average rate of 17 8  translating to a compound annual growth rate of 16 9   However  the dividend was frozen from fiscal year 2000 through 2003    which included the recession of 2001  On the other hand  the company did raise their dividend throughout the Great Recession at double digit rates 
In addition to increasing their dividend  the company has also been buying back their shares since 2007  On this count I would give them a B  grade because I do not consider share buybacks in 2014  2015 and 2016 as an especially good use of shareholder capital  On the other hand  now that the stock is reasonably valued I would favor a continuation of share buybacks 

CVS Health Corporation  The Businesses
The following short business description provided courtesy of S P Capital IQ 
 CVS Health Corporation  together with its subsidiaries  provides integrated pharmacy health care services  It operates through Pharmacy Services and Retail LTC segments 
The Pharmacy Services segment offers pharmacy benefit management solutions  such as plan design and administration  formulary management  Medicare Part D services  mail order and specialty pharmacy services  retail pharmacy network management services  prescription management systems  clinical services  disease management programs  and medical pharmacy management services  This segment serves employers  insurance companies  unions  government employee groups  health plans  managed Medicaid plans and plans offered on public and private exchanges  other sponsors of health benefit plans  and individuals under the CVS Caremark Pharmacy Services  Caremark  CVS Caremark  CarePlus CVS Pharmacy  CVS Specialty  Accordant  SilverScript  NovoLogix  Coram  Navarro Health Services  and Advanced Care Scripts names 
As of December 31  2015  it operated 24 retail specialty pharmacy stores  11 specialty mail order pharmacies and 5 mail order dispensing pharmacies  and 83 branches for infusion and enteral services 
The Retail LTC segment sells prescription drugs  over the counter drugs  beauty products and cosmetics  personal care products  convenience foods  seasonal merchandise  and greeting cards  as well as provides photo finishing services 
It operates 9 655 retail stores in 49 states  the District of Columbia  Puerto Rico  and Brazil primarily under the CVS Pharmacy  CVS  Longs Drugs  Navarro Discount Pharmacy  and Drogaria Onofre names  online retail pharmacy Websites  and 32 onsite pharmacy stores  long term care pharmacy operations  and retail health care clinics 
The company was formerly known as CVS Caremark Corporation and changed its name to CVS Health Corporation in September 2014  CVS Health Corporation was founded in 1892 and is headquartered in Woonsocket  Rhode Island  
CVS Health Corporation  Thesis for Growth
The consensus of 25 analysts reporting to S P Capital IQ expect CVS to grow earnings by 13 57  for this fiscal year end followed by an 11 77  for fiscal year ending December 31  2017  and 18 analysts expect earnings to grow 10 84  for fiscal year end December 31  2018  If these analysts are correct  that would suggest double digit rates of return over the next couple of years  Additionally  these analysts  earnings estimates are consistent with CVS management s guidance range for adjusted earnings of  5 81 to  5 89 for this fiscal year end 

I have a reasonably high level of confidence in those forecasts based on the excellent historical track record of analyst estimates when made one year and two years forward as evidenced by the following Analyst Scorecard 


Additionally  Morningstar believes that CVS possesses a wide economic moat and that their large claim volume affords them the opportunity to take advantage of two key industry drivers   supplier pricing leverage and centralized cost scale  
The following excerpt from their analyst report speaks to CVS s strong returns on invested capital and their long term growth opportunity 
 CVS Health has pursued a vertically integrated strategy to try and capture as much value as possible from the retail pharmacy industry  The firm has established itself as a top tier pharmacy benefit manager and one of the largest U S  pharmacy retailers  Its stalwart competitive advantages have churned out outstanding returns on invested capital and have given it a wide economic moat  We anticipate robust growth for the pharmaceutical industry over the long term  which should provide CVS with a solid platform for continued success  
In the most recent report provided by Zacks they highlight the recent Omnicare acquisition and suggest that it will contribute to future growth opportunities  They also believe that the recent Target Pharmacy purchase represents a strategic fit  and reports a positive view that the PBM business is gaining traction  Zacks also considers CVS s specialty pharmacy business to be a high growth driver  And they cite the opportunity regarding domestic demographic trends as a result of our aging population 
On the other hand  Zacks also points out CVS s vulnerability to federal and state reimbursement laws due to their high dependence on Medicare  Medicaid and other government sponsored health programs  They also address the potential competitive threat from the Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid pending merger  However  that merger is currently facing FTC scrutiny  Personally  I believe that there is room for both powerhouses to flourish in the future  Moreover  although I consider both WBA and CVS to be excellent businesses  I currently favor CVS based on a more attractive current valuation  For perspective  here is the earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graph on WBA 

Summary and Conclusions
I suggest that CVS Health Corporation currently provides the opportunity for above average long term total returns over the next several years  I base my position on the company s exceptional historical operating results  its growing dividend  and most importantly its current attractive valuation  In my opinion  the company s recent stock price weakness is primarily attributed to the past overvaluation  Consequently  now that the company s price has returned to fair value  I have become interested in learning more about this great business  Moreover  I would consider any further price weakness an opportunity to invest in a great business at a very attractive valuation

This guidance assumes 5 to 12 cents of accretion from the impending Rite Aid Corporation  RAD  acquisition and is also based on the expected store divestitures and timing of closing of the acquisition  
Progress on Rite Aid Acquisition
In a separate press release  Walgreens Boots announced that the closing date of the impending acquisition of Rite Aid has been extended from Oct 27  2016 to Jan 27  2017

Our Take
Walgreens Boots reported a mixed fourth quarter fiscal 2016 with earnings comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and sales missing the mark  We note that the reported results are reflective of the trend exhibited by the company in the preceding five quarters  On a brighter note  the company has a strong cash position as is evident from the rise in cash flow reserve in the reported quarter  However  the company s postponement of the Rite Aid buyout adds to our concerns

The Institute for Supply Management  ISM  non Manufacturing Index    showed growth  a reading above 50  accelerated more than expected  rising to 56 5 in June the highest since November 2015 from 52 9 in May  and compared to the Bloomberg forecast of a gain to 53 3  New orders and business activity both showed solid growth  while employment moved back into expansion territory  The ISM said the report reflects a strong rebound from the cooling off of the previous month for the non manufacturing sector  Non manufacturing activity dwarfs manufacturing in terms of U S  economic output  driven by the consumer  that the U S  economy is hanging in there  with the all important U S  consumer being bolstered by higher wages due to the apparent tightening of the labor market  However  should the impact from the British vote become harsher than currently expected  we may be forced to downgrade our longer term view of both the U S  economy and equities 
The final Markit U S  Services PMI Index was revised to 51 4 in June from the preliminary level of 51 3  which matched May s figure and was expected to remain  The release is independent and differs from ISM s report  as it has less historic value and Markit weights its index components differently

Europe extends selloff  Asia mostly lower  European equities were decisively lower for a third straight session  with the U K  Brexit fallout persisting and fueling continued risk aversion and global growth concerns  Also  uneasiness toward the Italian banking sector festered to exacerbate the selloff in the region  Moreover  the British pound remained under pressure  touching a 31 year low versus the U S  dollar  The economic front likely did not help sentiment in the region  as German factory orders for May came in flat m m  versus projections of a 1 0  gain  and following the favorably revised 1 9  drop in April  The euro was little changed versus the U S  dollar  while bond yields in the region finished mixed 
Stocks in Asia finished mostly to the downside  with the global markets remaining hamstrung by the festering U K  Brexit vote fallout  which exacerbated global growth sentiment  The ensuing flight to safety is amplifying the pressure on global bond yields and is boosting the yen  which continued to gain ground to foster a drop for Japanese equities  Also  securities trading in Australia  Hong Kong  and South Korea fell  However  mainland Chinese listings rose  buoyed by growing expectations of further stimulus measures from the nation s central bank  Finally  markets in India were closed for a holiday

179523,401039,WBA,Walgreens Boots Tops Q3 Earnings  Rite Aid Deal On Track,opinion,"Walgreens Boots Alliance  Inc   NASDAQ WBA   reported adjusted earnings per share  EPS  of  1 18 in the third quarter of fiscal 2016  up 15 7  from the year ago adjusted number  Adjusted EPS also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 5  
A single digit growth observed in the company s top line number primarily drove the improvement in adjusted earnings 
On a reported basis  net earnings came in at  1 1 billion or  1 01 per share  reflecting a decline of 15 3  or 14 4  respectively  from the year ago quarter 
Total Sales
Walgreens Boots recorded total sales of  29 5 billion in the fiscal third quarter  up 2 4  year over year or 3 3  at constant exchange rate  CER   However  the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  29 9 billion 
Segments in Detail
Walgreens Boots currently reports under three operating segments  Retail Pharmacy USA  Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale 
The Retail Pharmacy USA division delivered sales of  21 2 billion in the reported quarter  reflecting an increase of 3 7  on a year over year basis  Within this segment  total sales in comparable drugstores increased 3 9   while prescriptions filled in comparable stores grew 4 5  on account of continued growth in Medicare Part D volume  On the other hand  comparable retail stores grew 0 1   driven by higher sales in the health and wellness and photo categories 
Pharmacy sales  which accounted for 67 4  of the division s sales in the quarter  increased 5 8  from the year ago quarter  while pharmacy sales in comparable stores climbed 6  
Revenues from the Retail Pharmacy International division dropped 2 3  on a year over year basis  up 3 4  at CER  to  3 2 billion  on account of currency fluctuations  At CER  comparable store sales in the third quarter increased 0 2  year over year  while comparable pharmacy sales dropped 0 7    partly driven by expected reduction in the U K  s pharmacy funding and the loss of certain institutional sales contracts in Chile 
The Pharmaceutical Wholesale division recorded quarterly sales of  5 7 billion  up 0 7  At CER  excluding acquisitions and dispositions  comparable store sales improved 6 3 
Margins
Gross profit improved 0 2  year over year to  7 5 billion and adjusted gross profit improved 0 5  to  7 6 billion  However  reported gross margin dropped 60 basis points  bps   while adjusted gross margin declined 50 bps in the fiscal third quarter 
Adjusted selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses dropped 0 3  to  5 8 billion  Consequently  adjusted operating income increased 3 3  to  1 8 billion owing to higher gross profit and lower operating expense  However  adjusted operating margin remained approximately flat at 6 1  
Financial Condition
Walgreens Boots exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  3 3 billion  compared to  3 6 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2016  Long term debt was  13 2 billion  compared with  13 billion in the prior quarter 
Moreover  the company generated operating cash flow of  5 2 billion in the reported quarter compared with  4 2 billion a year ago  The resultant free cash flow was  1 9 billion 
Guidance
Walgreens Boots has once again raised the lower end of its EPS guidance for fiscal 2016  The company currently expects adjusted EPS in the  4 45  4 55 range for the full fiscal  as against the earlier guided  4 35  4 55  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2016 earnings is  4 49  within the company s guidance range 
This guidance assumes no impact from the proposed acquisition of Rite Aid and related financing and assumes current exchange rates for the rest of fiscal 2016 
Progress on Rite Aid Acquisition
In Oct 2015  Walgreens Boots announced that it has agreed to acquire U S  based retail pharmacy chain   Rite Aid Corporation  RAD   for a total enterprise value of  17 2 billion  including acquired net debt  Management continues to expect the transaction to close in the second half of calendar year 2016 
Currently  this acquisition is progressing as per Walgreen Boots  plans  following Rite Aid s shareholders approving the transaction on Feb 4  2016  However  the transaction is still subject to the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976  as amended  and other customary closing conditions 
On Jun 1  2016  in order to partially fund this deal  Walgreens Boots completed a public offering of  6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured  unsubordinated notes with varying maturities and interest rates  Management expects this transaction to be accretive to its adjusted EPS in its first full year after completion 
Our Take
Walgreens Boots reported a mixed third quarter fiscal 2016 with earnings comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  while the top line closely missed the mark  We note that the reported results echo the trend exhibited by the company in the preceding four quarters as well  On a brighter note  the company continues to hold a strong cash balance position as is evident from its increased cash flow reserve in the reported quarter  while its proposed on track buyout of Rite Aid is expected to expand its business realm in the U S  over the long term 
However  the recently completed public offering of notes  in order to fund the Rite Aid deal  will increase the company s long term liabilities 
Nevertheless  Walgreens Boots was successful in achieving its earlier set target of achieving combined net synergies of at least  1 billion  on account of the legacy Walgreens  merger with Alliance Boots  in June 2016

179533,401049,WBA,Walgreen CFO s departure due to  1 billion forecasting error   WSJ,news," Reuters    Drugstore retailer Walgreen Co s  N WAG  Chief Financial Officer  Wade Miquelon  and another top executive lost their jobs after a  1 billion forecasting error in the company s Medicare related business  the Wall Street Journal reported 
Walgreen named Kraft Foods Group Inc s  O KRFT  former CFO  Timothy McLevish  to replace Miquelon   its CFO of six years   on Aug  4 
Miquelon last month cut by  1 1 billion a forecast of  8 5 billion in pharmacy unit earnings for the year ending August 2016 that he had made at an April board meeting  the journal said    
Miquelon s departure was due to his transitioning to newer opportunities  Walgreen told Reuters in an email 
The company had earlier said Miquelon would continue as advisor to assist it with a strategic partnership with Alliance Boots Holding Ltd  ABN UL  
The newspaper report said the forecast error also led to the departure of Kermit Crawford  Walgreen s president of pharmacy  health and wellness 
Crawford announced his retirement last month after 31 years with the company 
He will continue as an advisor  and moves forward to pursue new opportunities outside  Walgreen said 
The forecasting error was based partly on contracts to sell drugs under Medicare  WSJ said 
Walgreen  which gets 25 30 percent of its prescriptions from Medicare Part D plans  had not factored in a spike in the price of some generic drugs that it sells as part of annual contracts  the paper said 
The company said it did not break down its pharmacy business revenue by segment 
Medicare Part D subsidizes the cost of prescription drugs and prescription drug insurance premiums for Medicare benefits in the United States 
Walgreen would pay Miquelon severance of  3 2 million and a performance bonus of about  1 2 million  and pay  3 3 million to Crawford as severance and consultation fees  the company said in a regulatory filing this month 
Miquelon  49  joined Walgreen in June 2008 as senior vice president and CFO  In 2012  he was promoted as executive vice president  CFO and president  international  and joined the board of Alliance Boots 
Miquelon is also credited with playing a central role in launching the Walgreens Alliance Boots deal 

Walgreen said earlier this month it would buy the 55 percent it does not already own of Alliance Boots for 3 13 billion pounds   5 3 billion  in cash and 144 3 million shares  giving a total deal of about  15 billion

Acquisitions of Omnicare and Target Pharmacy reflects CVS s commitment to the fast growing specialty care market
Despite robust earnings growth   stock has been relatively flat and typically doesn t move around earnings season
Retailer and health care services company  CVS  is scheduled to report first quarter earnings Tuesday  before the market opens  The last two years were favorable for CVS as both revenue and earnings per share steadily increased  Last quarter featured double digit gains on both the top and bottom line with this quarter expected to be just as good  The Estimize consensus is calling for  1 17 on  43 02 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  50 million higher on sales  Compared to a year earlier  profits are expected to increase 3  while revenue could rise as much as 18   Despite CVS s recent gain  the stock has been relatively flat and typically doesn t change during earnings season 

Lately a majority of CVS s growth has come from strength in its specialty and retail pharmacy segments  Last quarter  revenue in pharmacy services increased 11 1  primarily driven by growth in specialty pharmacy  The company s  12 7 billion acquisition of Omnicare reflects the company s focus on the fast growing specialty care market  Meanwhile  CVS also plans to expands its retail pharmacy to Target stores nationwide  In a  1 9 billion deal  the buyout will expand CVS Health s customer base and add a new retail channel for its products  Topping it all off  CVS maintains a strong balance sheet which allows them to issue generous capital return programs

179549,401065,WBA,In A Struggling Economy Are Hold N Hope  Portfolios Valid ,opinion,"Some analysts may dismiss 115 years of economic data  I do not  In particular  if one averages the results of four respected stock valuation methodologies  one finds that stocks are wildly expensive  Greater irrationality in stock price exuberance only existed during conditions prior to the Great Depression circa 1929 and the tech wreck of 2000 
Consider the chart below  Based on the analysis by Doug Short  the widely cited Vice President of Research at Advisor Perspectives  the U S  stock market is overvalued by 76   It is worth noting that on all three occasions when the aggregate average approached two standard deviations above a geometric mean   1929  1999  2007   U S  stocks collapsed by 50  or more  In addition  current valuation extremes surpass those reached in 2007 

Investors should be mindful of the fact that Mr  Short does not typically offer  bearish  or  bullish  commentary  He usually provides investment and economic research  allowing others to draw their own conclusions  That said  he has served up bullet points on the high probability that market returns will be low over the next 7 10 years  Mr  Short has also mentioned that  will be more important in the coming decade  as holding the S P 500 for the next 7 10 years is likely to be  disappointing  
Keep in mind  elevated valuations in and of themselves may not provide much insight with respect to reducing risk in one s portfolio  Years of valuation extremes can persist when other factors are at play   Think central bank interest rate and balance sheet shenanigans   Nevertheless  an economy that shows signs of stagnation coupled with signs of  risk off  positioning can break the back of a stock market bull  particularly when interest rate manipulating  balance sheet expanding central banks are only running on fumes 
I mentioned that the economy is stagnating and that signs of  risk off  positioning are evident  Let me first address the economy  Corporations are not increasing their profits  as corporate earnings per share have declined for four consecutive quarters  Business revenue is even more abysmal  Companies have fallen back to 2012 levels with respect to revenue generation  and that does not even adjust for inflation 

Traditional retailers are struggling and some are disappearing  e g   Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   J C  Penney  NYSE JCP   Sears  NASDAQ SHLD   Macy s  NYSE M   Office Depot  NASDAQ ODP   Walgreens  NASDAQ WBA   Sports Authority  Sports Chalet  which announced in April that it was closing all its stores  Aeropostale  NYSE ARO   etc    
Oil and gas companies  Yikes  According to reports on a Deloitte study  one third of oil corporations may go belly up in 2016  The study focused on some 175 plus companies with more than  150 billion in debt 
What about gross domestic product  GDP   At a pace of 1  over the last six months  it is hardly expanding at all  Even the bright spot of job growth is deteriorating  Consider the Federal Reserve s own Labor Market Condition s Index  LMCI  which evaluates 19 unique indicators of labor market health  The LMCI peaked in April of 2014  its intermediate moving average  6 months  peaked in August of 2014   Note  S P 500 earnings per share hit its all time top in September of 2014  representing Q3 on 9 30 2014  

The 6 month moving average on the LMCI has not rolled into negative territory since the Great Recession  2007 2009   Before that  you d need to look at the NASDAQ s tech wreck and 2001 recession  2000 2002  for significant troubles in the well being of the labor market 
Does this mean that a recession is imminent  No  But it sure as heck means that labor market conditions are weakening  With  job growth  having been the one supposed saving grace in a slow growing economy that required near 0  interest policy for seven plus years  it seems optimism for a turnaround prior to a sell off in risky assets would be misplaced 
Of course  there are those that are keeping the faith with respect to stocks rallying well into the end of 2016 without a correction or bear  The thinking  As long as the economy muddles through  the Federal Reserve won t be able to raise rates  and the dollar will move lower in the absence of tightening  and the lower dollar will help businesses increase their overseas sales and profitability  In other words  bad news will be good news for never say die hold n hopers 
Unfortunately  there are a number of problems with the muddle through scenario  Problemo numero uno  Household debt exceeds disposable personal income  Granted  Americans have been spending more than their take home pay after taxes since 2001  Yet the modest deleveraging that occurred after the Great Recession has passed us by  Sooner or later  as families continue to accumulate increasing amounts of debt to spend more than they clear via disposable personal income  a retrenchment period comes to pass  Either households will be challenged in accessing credit  involuntary deleveraging  or they themselves will choose to borrow less in spite of ultra low rates  voluntary deleveraging  

Economic data on consumption shows that the consumer has been softening  Bring disposable personal income into the picture  and the consumer is likely to weaken even more 
The second problem for the muddle through economy dream is the reality that  risk off  investing has been outperforming the U S  market for 18 months already  18 months  Consider the fact that three of the best performing assets in the 2008 systemic financial meltdown were the yen  the dollar and long maturity Treasury bonds  You could have invested in each via CurencyShares Yen Trust  NYSE FXY   PowerShares Dollar Bullish  NYSE UUP  and iShares 20  Treasury Bond  NYSE TLT   Over the last year and a half  all three of these  risk off  assets have beaten the SPDR S P 500 Trust  NYSE SPY  

In sum  stock valuations are exorbitant  business sales are soft  consumption is strained  the labor market is weakening and  risk off  assets are outperforming  Add it all up  There is limited upside reward for the risk one takes by remaining overexposed to equities and higher yielding vehicles 
If you normally leave 65  70  in a diversified basket of stock  e g   large cap  mid cap  small cap  foreign  emerging  etc    downshift to 45  50  high quality larger caps only  If you typically allot 30  35  to diversified income  e g   investment grade  cross over corporate  high yield  convertible  foreign  etc    dial it back to 20  25  investment grade only  The 25  30  35  that you raise in cash or cash equivalents by selling riskier assets at relatively higher prices will minimize portfolio volatility  More importantly  it will be the  dry powder  you require to buy  risk on  assets at more attractive prices in the future

 NEW YORK  Sept 27  Reuters    U S  stocks rose for a third
day on Tuesday on efforts by euro zone officials to solidify
the region s rescue fund and alleviate a sovereign debt crisis 
boosting optimism 
 Nevertheless  equities ended off their highs for the day
after a report suggested cracks were emerging in a previously
agreed deal to tackle the crisis 
 A successful solution to Europe s sovereign debt crisis
would take the pressure off banks worried about funding and
remove a threat to economic growth  Rising hopes for an
agreement have helped push the S P 500  up more
than 4 percent since Thursday s close 
 That s the biggest three day percentage gain by the S P 500
 since mid August  So far this week  the CBOE volatility index
 is down more than 10 percent 
  It s great to see some steps toward resolution  Shoring up
banks and dealing with the region s fiscal issues is a real
positive for equities   said Malcolm Polley  president and
chief investment officer of Stewart Capital Advisors in
Indiana  Pennsylvania 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  finished up 146 83
points  or 1 33 percent  at 11 190 69  The Standard   Poor s
500 Index  was up 12 44 points  or 1 07 percent  at
1 175 39  The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 30 14
points  or 1 20 percent  at 2 546 83 
 The S P materials index  was up 2 1 percent and an
S P index of energy stocks  added 1 5 percent as
commodity prices rallied on hopes of a solution in Europe 
Mining and energy shares were the top performers among
large cap stocks 
 While European officials have considered various approaches
to maximize the bailout fund and to recapitalize banks 
substantial political hurdles to sealing the deal remain  For

 The Financial Times reported a split was developing in the
euro zone over the terms of the next bailout for Greece 
However  this had been reported earlier in the day 
 German and French government economic advisers urged in a
joint article on Tuesday that Greece be allowed to write off
around 50 percent of its debt and called for support for banks
with large Greek holdings   nL5E7KR0JX 
 Market volatility could remain high as traders react to
headlines and attempt to gauge the commitment of governments
and institutions as they work to prevent a Greek default  U S 
equities have been highly sensitive to Europe s debt issues in
recent weeks 
  If there was no resolution  that would create a capital
hole which would put more pressure on the global financial
system and make things worse here   Polley said 
 The S P has gained 3 4 percent so far this week  after
losing 6 5 percent on European led fears the previous week 
That week was also the Dow s worst since October 2008 during
the thick of the financial crisis 
 Stocks also got a boost as investors rebalanced their
portfolios in the last days of the quarter  The wide gap in
performance between equities and bonds  favoring government
debt so far this quarter  may partly reverse   ID nS1E78P1Q8 
  All these end of quarter issues are amplifying the moves
that we ve been seeing in stocks   said Paul Simon  chief
investment officer at Tactical Allocation Group in Birmingham 
Michigan   I don t have a lot of faith in the moves we ve been
seeing

179566,401082,WBA,Based On Great Equities October  4th Quarter Off To Great Start,opinion,"As the end of fall inches closer and closer  the lovely mornings more frequently get replaced by a cold chill  When you go outside to start the car  now you have to wipe a bit of ice off the windshields  The little changes of your daily routine become more complicated by the additional variable of a less friendly working environment  Just as the weather changes  so does the business cycle  Over the course of the last week  we learned third quarter GDP growth came in at a meandering 1 5   and personal consumption was  1  for September  below the  2  expected level   In case you were more concerned with making arrangements for tonight s Halloween party or deciding what candy to put out for trick or treaters  let me remind you the third quarter is when summer takes place  It is when people generally  as they say in California  chill out  A lower GDP number should be expected  or to put it more formally  factored into your model  You could make a different argument about personal consumption as you would expect it to increase  but reality is often different than theory  Deal with it 
When the Federal Reserve Board released their monthly policy statement this past Wednesday  interest rates were not changed  and the same objectives of employment and inflation levels were reiterated  Market participants expectations about when lift off will take place is pretty much 50 50 for a rate hike in December or moved back to January  You can get some indication by looking at Fed Funds futures  At some point  in any endeavor  following through on your intentions is required for credibility  It does not matter whether it is warning a child  or preparing the markets  credibility is earned depending on action  The bottom line is  I suspect December is when rates rise  provided global markets don t fall out of bed in the meantime 
Based on what took place in October  the best month for equities in nearly four years  the fourth quarter is off to a fabulous start  Early in the week  Walgreen s  O WBA  announced its intention to purchase Rite Aid  N RAD  for  17 2 billion  Later on  it was confirmed Pfizer  N PFE  is communicating with Allergan  N AGN pa  about a combination of the two huge pharmaceutical companies  Big oil reported drastically reduced profits this week and the largest integrated oil groups all pretty much had the same kinds of results  A tough environment in upstream was balanced by strong refining and trading numbers in downstream  Nearly all said to expect the same for 2016 with oil prices gradually moving up throughout the year  The big concern is the sustainability of their big dividend payouts  but all are reducing capital expenditures based on their operating results  Chevron  N CVX  announced a further cut of 7 000 jobs as well  Been through this before  thank you 
In technology  LinkedIn  N LNKD  posted a blowout number  and Twitter  N TWTR  as well  but disappointed on guidance and monthly active users  Mr  Dorsey is the founder and showed how motivated he is to change the perception of tweety bird  He is doling out  200 million of his own stock  1  of the company  to help incentivize the employees left at the company after announcing an 8  workforce reduction  Many in the market see an interesting comparison between Facebook  O FB  and Twitter in terms of a potential comeback  Not out of the realm  but certainly not a layup either  Don t you just love the intrigue of markets 
A couple of other pastings in the market included GoPro  O GPRO  and Buffalo Wild Wings  O BWLD   Both have long been market darlings  as who doesn t love a good chicken wing and a self video of skydiving or surfing  or gosh knows what else   Apparently  not investors  as each got beat up this week  In fact  GoPro is now down over 50  for the year  Wall Street is not for the faint of heart  as you well know 
As for the little debate the other night  it was not nearly as watched as the first two  but what transpired may have been far more significant regarding the future  Republican National Committee chairman Royce Priebus described it as a  crap sandwich   delivered by the CNBC moderators  regarding the tone and kind of questions asked during a wild affair  The RNC subsequently suspended an upcoming February debate on NBC  I suspect things will get worked out  but clearly  the recurring issue of the quality of the moderators and the substance and neutrality of the questions means the whole design and structure of these events has to be reconsidered 
In terms of the outcome  like the rolling in of a new season  we may have seen a changing of the guard regarding who the Republican establishment will back for it s leading candidate  After three very poor debate efforts  Jeb Bush  even with his  100 million war chest  is not gaining traction among voters  His fellow Floridian  Marco Rubio  undressed him pretty severely and has now received the support of Paul Singer  a billionaire  and major Republican rainmaker on many different levels  primarily fund raising  Ted Cruz and Chris Christie also had strong showings  Rubio downplayed his prospects after the debate  noting it is a long process  Agreed  Still  change is always healthy  especially when you go younger and positive  as Willie so eloquently illustrated

179569,401085,WBA,U S  chains  sales seen down but not dead in March,news,"  U S  March same store sales expected to fall 0 7 pct	
   Late Easter  inflation likely trimmed sales	
 
 CHICAGO  April 7  Reuters    March is not looking to be as
bad as expected for U S  retailers  at least as far as initial
sales reports show 	
 U S  retailers are likely to show a drop in March same store
sales  hurt by Easter falling three weeks later than last year 
which delays some spring clothing purchases  	
 Chilly weather and rising inflation were also expected to
hurt discretionary purchases 	
 But retailers that report their monthly sales earlier than
most  including drugstore operator Walgreen Co and teen
apparel retailers Hot Topic Inc and Zumiez Inc
   reported better than expected sales for the month 
 ID nL3E7F634W  	
 Sales at stores open at least a year  or same store sales 
are expected to fall 0 7 percent when tallying results from 25
retailers  according to Thomson Reuters 	
 
 
 
 With Easter falling on April 24 this year  20 days later
than in 2010  the bulk of sales of spring clothing  candy and
other goods are expected to be delayed until April 
 ID nN05116416 	
 At the same time  shoppers have already started to pay more
for groceries and gasoline  reducing the amount left for
discretionary purchases  	
 Craig Johnson  president of Customer Growth Partners  said
visits to stores showed the  first major impact of inflation on
retail spending  particularly discretionary spend  in many
years  	
 While unemployment remains high  it has edged down in recent
months 	
  This March I spent more than last March because I was
searching for a job last March   said Jane Marcinkiewicz  a
37 year old mother of two from New York s Harlem neighborhood 
who works part time at a department store 	
 Figures being released by companies this week will not paint
the full picture of the consumer economy as the retailers that
still issue monthly sales figures account for only 10 percent of
total U S  retail sales  Johnson noted 	
 Major retailers such as Wal Mart Stores Inc   Home
Depot Inc and large grocers do not issue monthly sales
reports and several apparel chains recently abandoned the
practice as well 	
 Walgreen Co  one of the largest companies that still issues
monthly sales reports  said on Tuesday that its March same store
sales rose 3 percent  with sales of general merchandise beating
expectations

179585,401101,WBA,Retail Sector In The Spotlight,opinion,"The only remaining point of interest in the Q1 earnings season is the Retail sector  which is the only one that has any meaningful number of reports still awaited  Beyond Retail  the Q1 earnings season has actually ended for 10 of the 16 sectors in the S P 500 index and effectively ended for the others 
The Retail sector had a good run this earnings season  with growth rates and surprises not only coming in better other recent periods  but also better than most of the other sectors  But the Macy s Inc  NYSE M  report indicates that the going will be tougher for department stores and others whose reports are still to come  The retail environment is no doubt difficult  with consumers hesitant to spend their energy savings  The government s April Retail Sales report showed  headline  sales flat or down in three of the last four months 
 Including today s Retail sector earnings reports  we now have Q1 results from 23 of the 41 retailers in the S P 500 index  Total earnings for these retailers are  6 9  on  11 2  higher revenues  with 87 0  beating EPS estimates and 52 2  coming ahead of revenue estimates   Please note that the sector s earnings beat ratio is the highest in the S P 500 index  while the revenue beat ratio is the third highest in the index  The side by side comparison charts below show how the sector s results are tracking notably better relative to other recent periods 
 The sector s strong results notwithstanding  the double digit revenue growth rate is a bit misleading as it reflects easy comparisons at Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc  NASDAQ WBA  and the outsized gains at Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Take these two companies out of the results thus far and the sector s revenue growth rate drops to  6 3    still reasonably good  We will see in the coming days if this momentum can be maintained or not  but Macy s report likely shows that we should temper our expectations  particularly from the department stores Q1 Scorecard  as of May 13th  2015  Total earnings for the 458 S P 500 members that have reported results already are up  2 4  on  3 8  revenues  with 65 4  beating EPS estimates and only 43 7  coming ahead of top line expectations  As we have stated repeatedly in this space since the start of this reporting cycle  this is weak performance compared to what we have seen from the same group of 458 S P 500 members in other recent periods   Please note that we provide the scorecard for the Russell 2000 index on page 16 of the detailed report   The two side by side charts below give a historical context to the results thus far   by comparing the Q1 earnings   revenue growth rates  left hand side chart  and earnings   revenue beat ratios  right hand side chart  with what these same companies achieved in the preceding quarter as well as the 4 quarter average 

Three things stand out as we look at the results thus far
First  the revenue weakness is very notable  We knew that growth will be problematic in Q1  so the weak revenue growth rate of  3 8  compared to other recent periods isn t that surprising  But the very low proportion of companies beating revenue estimates is surprising and likely indicative that the growth backdrop has been even weaker than what was reflected in consensus estimates Second  the earnings growth rate   2 4   is also weak relative to what we saw from the same group of companies in 2014 Q4 and the 4 quarter average  While the Finance sector has been a positive growth contributor  the Energy sector s impact has been in the opposite direction  Excluding contribution of these two sectors  the Q1 growth picture still compares to unfavorably other recent periods  as the right hand side chart below shows 
Third  as has been the norm in recent quarters  management teams continue to guide lower for the current and following quarters  As a result  estimates for the current quarter  which had fallen quite a bit already in solidarity with the Q1 estimate cuts  have started coming down even more  The chart below shows how earnings growth estimates for Q2 have evolved since the beginning of the year 

The dollar issue has added to the Energy sector s woes and some concerns about the U S  economic picture in bringing down this year s estimates  Current consensus estimates show earnings growth for the S P 500 to be in the negative for the first three quarters of the year  with the growth rate for the full year now modestly in the negative  The expectation is that the growth picture starts improving in the last quarter of the year  with the growth pace ramping up to double digit rates in 2016 ",2015-05-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/retail-sector-in-the-spotlight-251694,251694
179586,401102,WBA,5 Monthly Dividend Stocks To Help Pay Your Bills,opinion,"Part of my job as an advisor is helping my clients sort out their finances  But even though I do this professionally  I sometimes have a hard time sorting out my own finances because my expenses are out of sync with my income  My regular expenses tend to be monthly  whereas my income is mostly paid quarterly 
That s always been a major source of frustration to me  and it is no doubt a major source of frustration to millions of retirees living off of their investments  Bonds generally pay interest just twice per year  and most companies pay dividends quarterly  But our home mortgages  car loans  and credit card bills are due monthly 
Well  I have a solution to this problem  monthly dividend stocks  Today  I m going to share five monthly paying dividend stocks that you can bank on to pay your monthly bills 
We should never buy a stock purely because its dividend is paid monthly  Dividend safety and growth are far more important considerations  and the following list has plenty of both 
LTC Properties Inc
I ll start with LTC Properties Inc  NYSE LTC   one of my favorite plays on the aging of the Baby Boomers 
If you want to know what LTC does  just look at its name   LTC  is short for  long term care   something that millions of Baby Boomers will be needing in the years ahead   turn 65 years old with every passing day  making this one of the most powerful trends in the world today 
LTC Properties invests in properties for providers or skilled nursing  assisted living  independent living and memory care  It also invests in mortgages secured by long term care properties 
Roughly four fifths of LTC s portfolio is invested in properties  with the remainder in mortgages 
LTC currently yields 4 9  in dividends  which is very competitive among medical REITs  And importantly  if you want to make sure your monthly income continues to match your monthly expenses  LTC is a serial dividend raiser  LTC has hiked its dividend at a 5 5  annual clip over the past five years 
A monthly dividend payer with a track record of raising its dividends that also happens to be invested in one of the most powerful macro trends in the world  If you can think of a better stock to include in a retirement portfolio  let me know  I d love to hear it 
Realty Income 
No list of monthly dividend stocks can be complete without the company that calls itself  the monthly dividend company    Blue chip retail REIT Realty Income  NYSE O 
I write about Realty Income quite regularly  and there is a reason for that  I consider it one of the very best dividend stocks a retiree can own  It s about as stable and conservative as a stock can be  while still offering regular dividend growth  Realty Income has paid 538 consecutive monthly dividends  and has raised its dividend for 70 consecutive quarters  Not every dividend hike is a large one  but the stock has managed 5  compound annualized dividend growth for 20 years and running  That s well ahead of inflation 
How can I be so confident in Realty Income s stability 
To start  Realty Income isn t really a  company   It s a mostly passive landlord with a portfolio of more than 4 300 properties  most of which are high quality  high traffic retail sites  A Walgreens  NYSE WBA  or CVS  NYSE CVS  pharmacy is a  typical  property for Realty Income 
Furthermore  Realty Income s properties are leased on a triple net basis  meaning that the tenants are responsible for paying all maintenance  taxes and insurance 
Realty Income s stock price has taken a beating in 2015  down nearly 20  from its recent fears due to investor concerns about rising bond yields  Use this as a buying opportunity in one of America s finest divided payers 
American Realty Capital Properties Preferred Stock
Next up is actually not a common stock but a preferred stock  I m recommending American Realty Capital Properties 6 7  Cumulative Preferred Shares  NASDAQ ARCPP  
This might take a little explaining   Preferred stock  is actually more similar to a bond that to common stock  Shareholders have no voting rights and buy these primarily for income  And while dividend payments are not guaranteed in the sense that bond interest is  it takes priority over common stock dividends  Furthermore  some preferred stock including this one have provisions that make them cumulative  In other words  if the company skips a preferred dividend for any reason  they have to play  catch up  and pay the preferred stockholders their cumulative past dividends before they can offer a dividend to common shareholders 
So  why am I recommending the preferred shares of American Realty Capital and not its regular common stock 
There are a couple reasons  To start  American Realty Capital Properties common stock  NASDAQ ARCP  does not currently pay a dividend  It was suspended last year due to an accounting snafu  I expect that the dividend will be reinstated this year  but as of this writing ARCP does not pay a dividend 
Meanwhile  ARCPP pays a massive 6 7  coupon  At current prices  that amounts to a yield of almost 7  
Will you get dividend growth here  No  you won t  That coupon payment won t change  But with a yield of almost 7   I m OK with that 
Prospect Capital
I may get hate mail for the next recommendation  but here me out  For a slightly riskier monthly payer  I recommend you consider shares of Prospect Capital  NASDAQ PSEC  
Earlier this week  I wrote that Prospect Capital is  the most hated stock on Wall Street   As a value investor  that should get your blood pumping  but as a conservative income investor that might cause you to take a step back  Let me explain 
Prospect Capital is a business development company   BDC   that primarily makes loans to small and medium sized businesses  It essentially does what banks used to do back when banks actually lent money  Prospect lowered its risk profile last year  not wanting to  reach for yield   so to speak  But less risk also meant less return  so Prospect had to cut its dividend 
I m normally reluctant to recommend a company that has recently cut its dividend because  like cock roaches  there is never just one  But in Prospect s case  the dividend cut made sense to me  and our risk is mitigated in my view by two things  Firstly  the stock is insanely cheap  trading at just 70  of book value  And secondly  Prospect Capital s executives have been buying the stock on the open market hand over fist  see insider trading table at the bottom of the article link  above  for the full list  
At current prices  Prospect yields nearly 14   Yes  this is a riskier play that  say  Realty Income  But I also expect it to be a fantastic performer over the next 6 12 months 
Main Street Capital
And finally  I d like to recommend Main Street Capital  NYSE MAIN   Like Prospect Capital  Main Street is a business development company  Main Street provides debt and equity financing to small and medium sized businesses  Think of it as a publically traded private equity company 
Main Street pays a modest monthly dividend of  0 175 per month  but twice per year it also generally pays a larger dividend based on its operating results  This allows Main Street to keep its base dividend stable  which is exactly what you want with a stock you re using to fund your monthly expenses  Based on its regular dividend  Main Street yields about 6 6  at current prices  But including the irregular dividends gets you to a yield of about 8 4   Not too shabby

 NEW YORK  June 22  Reuters    U S  stocks suffered their
worst one day loss in two months  dropping the S P 500 back
into negative territory for the year on Monday in a
broad based sell off  as investors reconsidered the health of
the economy 
 Shares of economically sensitive sectors such as
financials  energy and materials led the S P 500 s decline  A
sharp drop in U S  crude oil futures and other commodities hit
shares of companies sensitive to those prices  including Exxon
Mobil Corp  which lost 3 1 percent to  68 84 
 Analysts said investors were keen to sell shares that led
the market up in its rally since early March  Major averages
have largely been trading sideways in recent weeks and many
investors have speculated that more obstacles were in store
for stocks 
  The recovery is likely to be anemic by post war
standards  said Hugh Johnson  chief investment officer of
Johnson Illington Advisors  in Albany  New York   The recovery
in the economy and earnings is unlikely to be as strong as the
rise in stock prices since early March has implied  
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 200 72 points  or
2 35 percent  to end at 8 339 01  The Standard   Poor s 500
Index was down 28 19 points  or 3 06 percent  at 893 04  The
Nasdaq Composite Index was down 61 28 points  or 3 35 percent 
at 1 766 19 
 The S P financial index fell 6 2 percent  while the energy
sector dropped 4 6 percent  The financial sector had the
biggest gains since the S P 500 hit a 12 year closing low in
early March

play out and may be taking some profits   said John O Brien

little changed on Tuesday following solid gains in the previous

healthy  suggesting consumers are worried about more economic
woes ahead  The data is due at 10 a m   1400 GMT

of the deal announcements  investors are now asking  is M A
activity a precursor to a good market or does it follow an
already buoyant one   said Peter Boockvar  equity strategist at
Miller Tabak   Co in New York 
 U S  stocks rallied on Monday  snapping a three day losing
streak  as a spurt of corporate takeovers in the technology and
health care sectors fueled optimism about share values  The Dow
Jones industrial average marked its biggest one day point and
percent gain since August 21  and its 4th highest close this
year 
 The S P Case Shiller U S  home price indexes for July are
due at 9 a m   1300 GMT   Economists look for prices in the
20 city index to rise 0 5 percent in July from a 1 4 percent
increase in the previous month 
 S P 500 futures  fell 2 3 points and were below fair
value  a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates  dividends and time to expiration on the
contract  Dow Jones industrial average futures  lost 5
points and Nasdaq 100 futures  fell 6 25 points 
 Energy shares are likely to come under pressure  following
a drop in crude oil futures  A weak demand outlook expected to

179612,401128,WBA,Standout Sectors Of Q1 Earnings Season,opinion,"It isn t news anymore that the earnings picture emerging from the Q1 earnings season has been very bad   there is not much growth  with revenue gains particularly hard to come by and many companies unable to meet even the lowered top line estimates  The outlook is no better for the current period either  with Q2 estimates following the by now familiar downtrend that we have been seeing for the last many quarters 
 While there is no question about the overall soft earnings landscape  but is the underperformance widespread and present in all sectors or do some pockets of strength exist  The answer to that is yes  some sectors have done better  But the better performance is relative   relative to pre season expectations and relative to the very weak performance of other sectors this earnings season  I will spotlight three sectors here that have done reasonably better this earnings season   Retail  Medical and Energy  The reference to the Energy sector will likely surprise many given how much of a drag the sector has been on the aggregate growth picture  But the Energy sector s results have nevertheless been better than expected  with a bigger proportion of companies beating estimates and the growth rates aren t as bad as initially feared Is the Retail Turnaround for Real  One could dispute putting the Energy sector results in a favorable light  but it s hard to characterize the Retail sector s performance thus far as anything but very good  Not only is a bigger proportion of retailers beating estimates compared to other sectors  but the sector s Q1 growth rates also represent an improvement over other recent reporting cycles  We should keep in mind  however  that while the Q1 earnings season is winding down for most of the other sectors  we are only about half way through for the retailers  For the 22 retailers in the S P 500 index that have reported Q1 results  out of a total 44   total earnings are up  7 5  on  11 7  higher revenues  with 90 9  beating EPS estimates and 50  coming ahead of revenue estimates   Please note that the sector s earnings beat ratio is the highest in the S P 500 index  while the revenue beat ratio is the fourth highest  The side by side comparison charts below show how the sector s results are tracking notably better relative to other recent periods 
 The sector s strong results notwithstanding  the double digit revenue growth rate is a bit misleading as it reflects easy comparisons at Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc  NASDAQ WBA  and the outsized gains at Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Take these two companies out of the results thus far and the sector s revenue growth rate drops to  6 7    still reasonably good  but no longer the best in the S P 500  No doubt  the retail sector stock prices have risen the most of all the sectors in the index in response to earnings releases  The Retail sector s positive momentum in the Q1 earnings season could change in the coming days as more companies report results  But at this stage in the reporting cycle  it remains a standout performer  Results have been fairly strong in the Medical sector as well  with total earnings for the 88 5  of the sector s companies that have reported results up  17 6  on  8 8  higher revenues  with 80 4  beating EPS estimates and 56 5  coming ahead of top line expectations  Strong growth at Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD    Gilead s earnings are up  2 1 billion from the same period last year on  2 6 billion higher revenues   are a big contributor to the Medical sector s growth numbers  But the sector s earnings would still be up double digits without Gilead  Q1 Scorecard  as of May 7th  2015  We now have Q1 results from 436 S P 500 members that combined account for 90 3  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these 436 companies are up  2 0  on  4 1  revenues  with 66 7  beating EPS estimates and only 42 7  coming ahead of top line expectations  This is weak performance compared to what we have seen from the same group of 436 S P 500 members in other recent periods   Please note that we provide the scorecard for the Russell 2000 index on page 16 of the detailed report  The two side by side charts below give a historical context to the results thus far   by comparing the Q1 earnings   revenue growth rates  left hand side chart  and earnings   revenue beat ratios  right hand side chart  with what these same companies achieved in the preceding quarter as well as the 4 quarter average 
 Three things stand out as we look at the results thus farFirst  the revenue weakness is very notable  We knew that growth will be problematic in Q1  so the weak revenue growth rate of  4 1  compared to other recent periods isn t that surprising  But the very low proportion of companies beating revenue estimates is surprising and likely indicative that the growth backdrop has been even weaker than what was reflected in consensus estimates Second  the earnings growth rate   2 0   is also weak relative to what we saw from the same group of companies in 2014 Q4 and the 4 quarter average  While the Finance sector has been a positive growth contributor  the Energy sector s impact has been in the opposite direction  Excluding contribution of these two sectors  the Q1 earnings growth still compares to unfavorably other recent periods  as the right hand side chart below shows 
Third  as has been the norm in recent quarters  management teams continue to guide lower for the current and following quarters  As a result  estimates for the current quarter  which had fallen quite a bit already in solidarity with the Q1 estimate cuts  have started coming down even more  The chart below shows how earnings growth estimates for Q2 have evolved since the beginning of the year

 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK  Dec 21  Reuters    Investors could do their
holiday shopping on Wall Street this week as bargain basement
prices for stocks and optimism over efforts to fight the
year long recession may prompt a year end rally 
 But not even a Santa Claus rally to end the year can rescue
2008 from going into the books as the worst for stocks since
the Great Depression  thanks to the body blow delivered by the
housing market slump  credit crisis and  finally  recession 
 With just seven trading days left  the benchmark S P 500
index is down 39 5 percent for the year  on pace perhaps to
match Wall Street s second worst year ever  1937  when the S P
also plummeted nearly 39 percent  Should no rally develop next
week  2008 could well challenge 1931    when the S P crashed 46
percent    for the mantle of Wall Street s worst ever year 
 That said  the slump in stocks has left them relatively
cheap  And analysts are now more optimistic that unconventional
recession fighting efforts such as the Federal Reserve s big
interest rate cuts may soon gain traction 
  You re getting a lot of people picking through the
wreckage of this year and doing some selective buying   said 
Paul Nolte  director of investments at Hinsdale Associates  in
Hinsdale  Illinois 
  There are some good bargains out there and there is a fair
amount of buying in the marketplace  
 This week  market watchers will look at fresh data on the
housing market for any sign that the sector is getting closer
to a bottom 
 HUNTING FOR HOLIDAY BARGAINS
 Volume is expected to be light in a week shortened by the
Christmas holiday and an early close on Christmas Eve 
 The buying spirit tends to visit Wall Street nearly every
year   bringing a short  sweet  respectable rally within the
last five days of the year and the first two in January  
according to the Stock Trader s Almanac 
 Santa s appearance on Wall Street has been good for an
average 1 5 percent gain since 1969  according to the Almanac 
while the absence of such a rally tends to precede times when
stocks can be bought at much lower prices 
 As of Friday s close  the broad S P 500 was off about 40
percent from where it started the year  and was down about 44
percent from the all time high it reached in October 2007 
 But the S P has recovered about 20 percent since hitting an
11 year intraday low in late November  prompting some to
speculate that the worst may be over 
  A lot of people are wondering whether they ll get a Santa
Claus rally   said Michael Sheldon  chief market strategist at
RDM Financial in Westport  Connecticut 
  Clearly  this is not a normal year  but just the fact that
you have history on your side around the New Year s holidays
can only be called a positive  
 Analysts said sentiment over the outlook for the battered
U S  economy has shifted to a more positive tone as investors
were cheered by the Fed s move last week to cut the benchmark
fed funds rate to as low as zero and pledge further measures to
shore up credit markets 
 Optimism over President elect Barack Obama s proposed
stimulus plan has added to the more positive tone  helping the
market rally in the face of an onslaught of dire economic and
corporate outlooks 
  No one is very good at dealing with economic Armageddon 
but we have dealt with recessions in the past   Sheldon said 
 He noted that more investors are coming around to  the
opinion the economy is going through a severe recession  but
we ve been here before  and we ll get through this at some
point  We re starting to see a little more positive
sentiment  
 WATCHING HOME SALES AND CASH REGISTERS
 Among economic indicators due this week are new home sales
and existing home sales for November  the final look at gross
domestic product for the third quarter  and the final December
reading on consumer sentiment from the Reuters University of
Michigan Surveys of Consumers 
 The home sales figures are not likely to bring much relief 
with current forecasts pointing to an 18 year low for new home
sales and a nearly 10 year low for sales of existing houses 
Meanwhile  the GDP data should confirm the economy  which has
been in recession since December 2007  contracted at an annual
rate of 0 5 percent in the third quarter 
 Weekly jobless claims will come out a day early on
Wednesday because of Thursday s Christmas holiday 
 Analysts also will look for anecdotal signs of how
retailers fare over the last shopping weekend before the
holidays 
 Over the weekend  retailers made a last ditch effort to
lure cash strapped consumers to spend  But Friday s big
snowstorm that has blanketed much of the northern half of the
country threatened to hold down shopper traffic 
 Quarterly results are light  Pharmacy chain Walgreen Co and
memory chip manufacturer Micron Technology Inc are among those
expected to report

 NEW YORK  June 22  Reuters    Wall Street was poised for a
lower open on Monday as investors assessed the potential
strength of an economic recovery  while energy shares could be
pressured by lower oil prices

traders increasingly questioned if stocks are due for a
correction  Worries the economic recovery could be tepid have
dented optimism that drove the S P 500 up by as much as 40
percent from March s 12 year low

179630,401146,WBA,Will Walgreen Benefit As CVS Drops Cigarettes ,opinion,"Walgreen Co   NYSE WAG  is set to report FQ3 2014 earnings before the market opens on Tuesday  June 24th  Walgreen is the largest pharmacy chain in the United States  In February Walgreen s biggest competitor CVS Corporation  NYSE CVS  announced that it will become the first major pharmacy chain in the US to voluntarily give up cigarette and tobacco sales  Despite mounting pressure from many state attorney generals  Walgreen s has refused to fold on tobacco and could stand to add billions in sales from cigarette shoppers after CVS stops selling tobacco products in October  For now  Wall Street expects continued modest growth from Walgreens  This quarter sales are expected to increase about 5  compared to the same quarter of last year while earnings increase by 9c per share  Here s what investors are expecting from Walgreen on Tuesday 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Walgreens to report 94c EPS and  19 341B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 15 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 95c EPS and  19 275B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Walgreens to beat the Wall Street earnings consensus by 1c per share while coming up short on revenue 
By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time 
More importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  Here we are seeing an average sized differential between the two groups  expectations  

The distribution of earnings estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 86c to 99c per share and from  19 100B to  19 476B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a moderate range of estimates on Walgreens earnings 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wide range of earnings estimates signals less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings 

Over the past 3 months the Wall Street consensus bounced around but both started and ended the period at 94c while the Estimize consensus edged higher from 94c to 95c  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue forecast spiked from  19 194B to  19 341B while the Estimize sales consensus shot up from  19 137B to  19 275B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and upward analyst revisions going into an earnings are often a bullish indicator 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is turbinecity who projects 96c EPS and  19 217B in revenue  turbinecity was our Winter 2014 season winner and is  overall among over 4 500 contributing analysts  This season turbinecity has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 60  and 51  of the time respectively throughout a massive 1169 estimates 
Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case turbinecity is expecting Walgreens to report slightly higher earnings than the Wall Street consensus  but less revenue 
This quarter the Estimize community is expecting Walgreen s to edge past the Wall Street consensus by 1c per share while missing revenue estimates by  66 million  Walgreens may have a growth opportunity later this year if a significant portion of CVS shoppers switch over to Walgreens to satisfy their cigarette buying habits  For now more modest gains are expected  Over the previous 4 quarters Walgreens has increased revenue on a year over year basis between 3  and 6  each period and contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform are expecting another quarter of 5  sales growth on Tuesday ",2014-06-23,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-walgreen-benefit-as-cvs-drops-cigarettes-217061,217061
179631,401147,WBA,Realty Income  Another BORING And Solid Quarter,opinion,"It was another  for Realty Income Corporation  NYSE O    one of my very favorite long term dividend machines 
Revenues jumped 22 6  on the back of new property investments and a 1 4  increase in same store rents   During the quarter  Realty Income raised  528 million in a secondary share offering and ploughed  405 million of it into new properties and development projects while managing to modestly increase its occupancy rate from 98 2  to 98 3    The new properties have a weighted average lease maturity of 10 6 years and a lease yield of 7 3   meaning that these should be nice income generators for a long time to come 
Funds from operations  FFO    the most common metric of profitability for REITs   increased 21 1  and 6 7  per share   For the uninitiated   FFO is a measure of net income that adds back non cash charges like depreciation and backs out gains on the sale of properties   The idea is to give a more accurate measure of real operating performance and of the cold  hard cash being generated for the payment of dividends 
And speaking of dividends  Realty Income increased its monthly dividend in June for the 76th time in its history and for the 67th consecutive quarter  see  5 Monthly Dividend Stocks     Since going public in 1994  Realty Income has churned out 527 dividend checks  making it one of the most dependable income payers to ever be traded publically 
This gets to the crux of why I love Realty Income and why I consider it far better than a bond for your retirement income needs   Right now  Realty Income pays an annualized dividend of  2 19   Ten years ago  it paid an annualized dividend of  1 22   So  if you had retired in 2004  using your Realty Income dividends to pay your bills  you would have seen your income rise by fully 80   far outpacing inflation   And this says nothing at all about capital gains  which were substantial 
Had you instead purchased a 10 year bond  your income would not have changed  the coupon payment you received in 2014 would be the same as the first one you received in 2004   And looking at current bond yields  your income would actually fall significantly if you were to reinvest the proceeds in today s market 
Rather than think of Realty Income as a stock  I prefer to think of it as a perpetual bond with a rising  inflation beating payout   Yes  it is  riskier  than your average corporate bond in that its stock price is more prone to fluctuation than that of a bond   As a case in point  O stock lost a third of its value during last year s  taper tantrum  
But if you re buying it as an income generator  price fluctuations really don t matter   so long as the business remains strong and the dividend remains intact   And on that count  Realty Income passes the test with flying colors  Its portfolio is full of high quality  recession resistant properties  its  typical  property is a pharmacy run by Walgreen Co   NYSE WAG  or CVS Corporation  NYSE CVS  
Realty Income continued to pay and raise its dividend throughout the crisis years   and in my book  that qualifies O stock as a viable income substitute for bonds 
The question simply becomes one of price   Realty Income currently yields 4 9    In a world in which the 10 year Treasury yields 2 5   that s attractive   I would consider Realty Income a buy at a yield of 4 5  or higher 
If you are still years away from retirement  consider instructing your broker to automatically reinvest the monthly dividends   I personally own shares  and that is exactly what I do   I hope to leave these shares to my children decades from now  and if they are smart they will hold on to them and pass them on to their own children

179632,401148,WBA,A Graphic Look At The  Inversion  Boom,opinion,"Walgreen s  NYSE WAG  decision to go ahead an buy the 55  of Alliance Boosts that it does not own  but not move their headquarters may mark the beginning of the end of the so called inversion boom   Inversion is simply when a US businesses buys a foreign company in a lower tax country and moves its headquarters there 

 
As this Great Graphic  from Goldman Sachs and published on Business Insider by Joe Wesienthal  illustrates there has been an explosion in such deals this year   The latest legislation was in 2004 that seemed to prevent or deter inter company inversions  requiring actual transactions to accomplish this   There is a push for new legislation to close this loophole and there is some idea that the legislation could be retroactive  
 
While there is genuine concern  perhaps it is not too cynical to suggest that it also makes good copy for some candidates ahead of the November elections   The counter argument is two fold   First  that addressing the perverse incentive structure should be part of the a larger tax reform effort   Second  in some quarters the tax avoidance strategy is condoned as part of a criticism of the double taxation on corporate profits  
 
One of the big arguments is that the 35  top US federal corporate tax rate is among the highest in the world   It is little wonder then that corporations seek to minimize their tax burden  with inversions being simply one of the ways   Yet  we think the debate is all too often based on tax scheduled rates and not actual rates   What is the average rate that the large US multinational companies  who are doing these inversions to reduce their taxes  actually paying 
 

 
Large companies operating in other countries have to file special tax forms  M 3    According to the Government Accounting Office the effective tax rate that is actually being paid is 22 7  in 2013     If only profitable companies are included  the effective tax rate is 17  
 
This helps explain why corporate tax collection is relatively low   It is low on two counts   First  it is low relative to what the federal government has historically collected    This Great Graphic  posted by Danielle Kurtzleben on Vox depicts the falling share of Federal corporate tax revenues compared with size of the economy and other taxes and revenues 
 
In 1952  corporate taxes revenue accounted for nearly a third of the federal revenue   By 2013  it had fallen below 10   
 

 
Second  the taxes actually collected a relatively low as a percentage of GDP compared with what other OECD countries  This final chart   was also posted on Vox by Kurtzleben  It shows that  on average  OECD countries collected 3  of GDP in corporate taxes   The US stood at 2 3  in 2011   Several countries  like Ireland and Luxembourg that are tax havens  corporate tax revenues are larger as a percentage of GDP than in the US   
 
We remarked recently that several major central banks  including the Federal Reserve  the Bundesbank  the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England all want to see an increase in wages   Higher wages are seen as either a signal that their economies have recovered sufficiently to normalize monetary policy  US and UK  or to ensure the economic recovery is not derailed  Japan and Germany    
 
If the problem is understood as insufficient aggregate demand  then boosting taxes on consumption  demand  as Japan did on April was is counter productive   Businesses  on the other hand  in the US  Europe and Japan are flush with cash and savings   Yet  despite low interest rates  net new capital investment  net of depreciation  remains meager at best   Besides  it has been several business cycles since investment led a recovery    Recent earnings data confirm that  generally speaking  profit margins remain fat    Cutting corporate taxes  as Japan plans and other countries consider  also seems counter productive 
 
While some observers have attributed the financial crisis to global imbalances  perhaps there is an other imbalance that contributed   Retained earnings that are not reinvested in plant and equipment have to be invested into something   If not real assets  the money is invested in paper assets   In addition to the large pools of capital by reserve managers  central banks and sovereign wealth funds  and large asset managers  pension funds  life insurers and mutual funds unit trusts   corporate balance sheets should be included when analyzing why interest rates remain low   
 
Conventional wisdom holds that core bonds yields are low because of QE in both the US and Japan   That is the low long term interest rates are artificial and a function of manipulation by central banks   One implication of the analysis here is that perhaps what is happening is a return of the Greenspan Conundrum   
 
The Greenspan Conundrum refers to the question the former Federal Reserve Chairman asked in early 2000s   Why were long terms rates falling even though the Fed was raising short term interest rates    Summer s resurrection of the secular stagnation hypothesis is a similar but different answer than Bernanke s answer to the conundrum      
 
Bernanke argued that the key was that after the Asian financial crisis  many countries in the region shifted from current account deficits to surpluses  yet did not have the capacity to absorb the new savings   They chose to export it and often bought US bonds   Bernanke also attributed a role to oil exporters as well  and recognized s role for demographics   The vast retained earnings of corporations in the high income countries maybe should be added to such surplus savings ",2014-08-06,Doug Short,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-graphic-look-at-the-'inversion'-boom-221868,221868
179633,401149,WBA,5 Dividend Raising REITs,opinion,"Over the course of his hockey career  Wayne Gretzky repeated several variations of a truly fantastic quote   I skate where the puck is going to be  not where it has been  
Gretzky attributed the quote to his father  and he credits the advice with making him the hockey legend we remember today 
Not all of us can have Gretzky s instincts or athletic prowess  of course   But the same insights apply to the more mundane world of dividend investing   In you want to fund your retirement with a steady stream of dividends that will keep pace with inflation  you have to look beyond the current dividend yield to what the payout will be in 5 or 10 years  time 
Inflation    even the modest variety we have today    is death to long term bond returns   Your semiannual coupon payments do not change in dollar terms over the life of the bond  even as the value of those dollars declines every year   At the Fed s target 2  inflation rate  your income would effectively shrink by nearly 22  after 10 years due to the compounding effects of inflation 
The same holds true of other income paying securities  such as dividend paying stocks  REITs  and Master Limited Partnerships   Current dividend income is an important part of your total return  but the rate at which the company boosts the payout over time will be what determines the sort of lifestyle you ll be able to afford in retirement 
Today  we re going to take a look at five safe  reliable REITs with a long history of raising their dividends 
Realty Income
I ll start with a REIT that I own personally and that in the interests of full disclosure    I intend never to sell in my personal account   If my children take my advice  they will gift my shares to their own children someday   Realty Income Corporation  NYSE O  is a  triple net  retail REIT  meaning that its tenants are responsible for paying all taxes  insurance and maintenance  Realty Income only responsibility is to collect the rent    and to acquire new properties  of course 

Realty Income is known as the Monthly Dividend Company  and for good reason  At current prices  it yields an attractive 5 3   It has paid 530 uninterrupted monthly dividends and has raised its dividend 77 times since 1994   It s grown its dividend at a  over the past three years  and its 10 year  yield on cost    i e  the current payout divided by a hypothetical purchase price ten years ago  is a whopping 8 6  
Realty Income s track record has proven it to be a reliable payer with a long history of keeping pace with inflation  The fact that the REIT pays its dividend monthly rather than quarterly is a nice bonus as well  as most of our living expenses in retirement will come on a monthly schedule 
National Retail Properties
Next on the list of retirement REITs is a close competitor of Realty Income  National Retail Properties  NYSE NNN   Like Realty Income  National Retail is a triple net retail REIT  hence its ticker symbol   NNN  represents  triple net  

Also like Realty Income  NNN has been a serial dividend raiser over the years  The REIT has raised its dividend for 24 consecutive years and counting    the 4th longest run among public REITs  NNN sports a current dividend yield of 4 7   and its payout is plenty safe   Its five year annualized dividend growth rate is modest  at 1 6    But remember  that time period includes the aftermath of the 2008 2009 meltdown  a period in which a lot of REITs actually cut their dividends 
National Retail Properties and Realty Income invest in the same basic types of properties  Your local Walgreen  NYSE WAG  pharmacy is a perfect example  a free standing building in a high traffic area rented under a long term lease by a high quality tenant  These are properties that you can safely bet your retirement on 
LTC Properties
Next up  LTC Properties Inc  NYSE LTC   a REIT I highlighted in Retirement REITs Poised To Profit From The Graying Of America  is a real estate investment trust that invests primarily in the long term care sector of the health care industry  including long term care provider properties  skilled nursing properties  assisted living properties  independent living properties and memory care properties  LTC also invests in first lien mortgages secured by long term care properties 

LTC s monthly dividend works out to a current yield of 5 4   making it competitive with other medical REITs  LTC is also a relatively small REIT with a market cap of just  1 34 billion  I like that because smaller REITs can generally grow their portfolios    and their dividends    at a faster rate than their lumbering  large cap cohorts 
LTC has raised its dividend at an annualized 9 3  clip over the past five years  and its five year  
Retail Opportunity Investments
Another young REIT showing excellent dividend growth is Retail Opportunity Investments  NASDAQ ROIC  

ROIC has a simple enough business model  The company buys neighborhood shopping centers  generally anchored by a  necessity based  retailer such as a major grocery store  The REIT currently owns and operates fifty nine shopping centers encompassing approximately 6 9 million square feet 
ROIC has been a dividend raising monster over its short life   Since initiating a  0 06 quarterly dividend in 2010  ROIC has raised its dividend eight times to  0 16   Its three year annualized dividend growth rate is an incredible 49 4   and  is an almost too good to be true 14 0  
Digital Realty Trust
Finally  we come to datacenter REIT Digital Realty Trust  NYSE DLR   If you don t know what a  datacenter REIT  is  here is a nice  concise explanation  They charge rent to companies to house their servers   The popularity of smartphones and tablets and the rise of  the cloud  for data storage and processing will continue to boost demand for server resources  I am reluctant to recommend a long term position in Facebook  NASDAQ FB  or Twitter  NYSE TWTR  because social networking is changing quickly and it s impossible to know in advance who the ultimate winners will be  But with an investment in a datacenter REIT like Digital Realty  it doesn t matter  You stand to profit from the underlying trend    the increased need for remote computing power in the age of hyperconnectivity 

Digital Realty yields an attractive 5 2  and has been growing its payout at an annualized 20 6  clip over the past five years   Your yield on cost here would be 13 3  over the past five years and a mind blowing 61 9  over the past 10

179651,401167,WBA,Will Walgreen Kick Its Smoking Habit Tuesday ,opinion,"Walgreen  Corp   NYSE WAG  is set to report FQ2 2014 earnings before the market opens on Tuesday  March 25th  Walgreen is the largest pharmacy chain in the United States  This quarter  Wall Street projects WAG s earnings per share to drop by 3  compared to FQ2 last year  Despite reduced profit  bolstered in store services such as screenings and vaccinations are expected to grow revenue by 5  on a year over year basis  In February rival CVS Caremark  CVS Corporation  NYSE CVS  announced it will stop selling cigarettes and tobacco products by October 1st  Larry J  Merlo  president and CEO of CVS announced   Ending the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products at CVS pharmacy is the right thing for us to do for our customers and our company to help people on their path to better health    CVS expects to lose over  2 billion in annual sales by kicking the habit  Going into Tuesday s earnings report there is mounting pressure on Walgreen to follow CVS and end its tobacco sales  Here is what investors are expecting from Walgreen 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 
The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Walgreen  to report 93c EPS and  19 557B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 16 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 92c EPS and  19 587B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Walgreen to miss the Wall Street consensus by 1c EPS and beat the Street s forecast on revenue by  30 million 
By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are only seeing a small difference between the 2 groups  expectations 

The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 85c to 98c EPS and from  19 400B to  20 112B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a wide distribution of estimates on Walgreen  
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wider distribution of estimates signaling less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings 
 
Over the past 4 months the Wall Street EPS consensus fell from  1 01 to 93c while the Estimize consensus also decreased from 99c to 92c  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue forecast remained relatively flat slipping from  19 561B to  19 557B while the Estimize forecast advanced steadily from  19 471B to  19 587B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and upward analyst revisions towards the end of the quarter are often a bullish indicator 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is TheEmulator23 who projects 94c EPS and  19 576B in revenue  In the Winter 2014 season TheEmulator23 is rated as the 12th best analyst and is ranked 22nd overall among over 4 000 contributing analysts  This season TheEmulator23 has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 60  and 54  of the time respectively throughout 149 estimates  Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case TheEmulator23 is expecting Walgreen to beat the Estimize community s forecast on EPS but come up short on revenue 
This quarter the Estimize community is expecting Walgreen s to come up short of Wall Street s quarterly profit target  The harsh weather this winter has kept customers off the road and out of stores leading retailers to offer aggressive sales to get shoppers into stores which can have a cost on the bottom line  Although profit is expected to be lower  the community expects quarterly revenue to increase by  941 million compared to FQ2 last year  Investors will also be waiting to see if Tuesday s earnings report brings any announcement about Walgreen s decision to keep after tobacco sales or follow CVS and give them up completely ",2014-03-24,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-walgreen-kick-its-smoking-habit-tuesday-207157,207157
179652,401168,WBA,Pharmacies  Cigarettes  And Market Impact,opinion,"To sell smokes or not to tell smokes  that is the  2 billion question  In early February CVS Corporation  NYSE CVS  became the first national drugstore chain to voluntarily give up selling cigarettes and other tobacco products by October 1st  CVS was the first brick to fall due to mounting pressure coming from 28 state and territory attorney generals  These AGs have not yet threatened any legal action  but the case certainly brings the NYC sugary drinks ban to mind  In July a court judge struck down Mayor Bloomberg s proposed ban because of separation of powers  the mayor had no legal right to tell consumers what they could or could not buy 
Cigarettes are well documentated as being far more detrimental to health than soda  but they are also heavily regulated and come with clear warning labels  But regardless of whether or not the legislature has any actual power or not  the situation still levies immense pressure against the pharmacies   In addition to CVS the AGs have also targeted Wal Mart Stores Inc  NYSE WMT   Walgreen Co  NYSE WAG   Kroger Company  NYSE KR   Rite Aid Corporation  RAD   and Safeway Inc  NYSE SWY  which together represent the top 5 pharmaceutical retailers which also sell tobacco products  The purpose of this note is to discuss whether or not pharmacies should sell tobacco  so Kroger and Safeway which primarily operate as supermarkets will no longer be included in the discussion  Since Walmart sells just about everything in the observable Universe  we will be leaving them out of the conversation as well 

The numbers may have changed a bit since 2010 but for all intents and purposes Walgreen  CVS  and Rite Aid all have similar numbers of stores and otherwise equal branding  CVS jumped on the opportunity to become an industry leader by giving up its cigarette sales and is now benefiting from positive press coverage and generating goodwill from both smokers and nonsmokers alike  But that s not to say this decision doesn t come without a cost  CVS is expecting its forfeiture of tobacco sales to cost the company s top line about  2 billion per year  To put things in perspective  according to data from Estimize com CVS generated a total of  126 955B revenue in the last fiscal year  While  2billion is a lot of money  kicking the tobacco habit will only lower CVS s annual sales by only about 1 6  
CVS has taken the first mover advantage and given up a small   of its revenue in exchange for brand differentiation from 2 otherwise identical pharmacy chain commodities  And their move puts Walgreen and Rite Aid in what could be a state of decision making paralysis  From a game theory perspective  this move looks brilliant  If Rite Aid and Walgreen are the only other 2 large pharmacy chains  neither would be wise to be give up their tobacco sales after CVS made the first move  There are two problems with being the second mover to give up tobacco sales  The first is that much of the positive press and goodwill have already been taken by CVS  The second is that giving up tobacco sales would leave the third pharmacy with the distinct and significant advantage of being the only major pharmacy chain still selling tobacco products  CVS created a huge chicken game between its competitors  There is a subset of the pharmacy going population that always buys cigarettes at the pharmacy and all of these customers would flock to the last Marlboro Man standing  There isn t a strong incentive for either Walgreen or Rite Aid to be the second major pharmacy chain to give up its tobacco sales 
The third possibility is that  both Walgreen and Rite Aid agree to simultaneously surrender tobacco sales  In this situation  all three pharmacies lose  but no one company loses too badly  Rite Aid and Walgreen could understand the dilemma and collude to make this compromise and mitigate their risk  There is building political and legal pressure to force pharmacies to give up their cigarette sales and both of the remaining chains could lose brand power if they try to fight the forces that be  even if they win  in plain view 
Part of the beauty of our product at Estimize is that if we come together as a community and submit forward looking estimates for the pharmacies  we can get a consensus on how the market believes each of the 3 pharmacies will be affected  What are your thoughts  Will Walgreen and Rite Aid continue to sell cigarettes or will they give billions of dollars in sales  Will smokers ditch CVS to get a pack while picking up their prescription  Or on the other hand will the health conscious public rally around CVS Caremark  The beauty of having a public consensus openly available is that if you are confident in your own thesis and think the market s expectations are wrong about something  you can trade on it and potentially unlock alpha  Head over to  and submit estimates for CVS  WAG  and RAD to tell us what you think ",2014-03-26,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/pharmacies,-cigarettes,-and-market-impact-207361",207361
179653,401169,WBA,What To Expect From Rite Aid s Earnings Report,opinion,"Rite Aid Corporation  RAD  is set to report FQ4 2014 earnings before the market opens on Thursday  April 10th  Rite Aid is one of the largest retail pharmacy chains in the country  In February competitor CVS Corporation  NYSE CVS  announced it would end all tobacco and cigarettes sells by October 1  Rite Aid and Walgreen Co  NYSE WAG  are yet to announce an end to tobacco sales  but there is mounting pressure for pharmacies to give up their tobacco sales and focus on the health of customers  CVS  WAG  and RAD all had great years in 2013 and Rite Aid s revenue is expected to continue growing  This quarter Wall Street is expecting Rite Aid to post year over year sales growth of 1 5  although EPS is predicted to fall by 8c per share  Here s what investors expect from RAD Thursday 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Rite Aid to report 5c EPS and  6 550B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 14 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 6c EPS and  6 544B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Rite Aid  to beat the Wall Street consensus on EPS but come up a few million dollars short on revenue 
By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing a small difference between the two groups  expectations 

The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 5c to 7c EPS and from  6 492B to  6 600B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a narrow distribution of estimates on EPS for Rite Aid and a wider distribution of estimates on revenue 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A narrow distribution of EPS estimates signaling more agreement in the market  which could mean less volatility post earnings  In this case we are seeing a tight range of profit expectations with much more uncertainty around sales 

Over the past 4 months the Wall Street EPS consensus fell from 6c to 5c while the Estimize consensus both started and ended the period at 6c  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue consensus climbed from  6 495B to  6 550B while the Estimize forecast also increased from  6 532B to  6 544B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and upward analyst revenue revisions at the end of the quarter are often a bullish indicator 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is BradHewitt91 who projects 6c EPS and  6 540B in revenue  BradHewitt91 is ranked 13th overall among over 4 000 contributing analysts  Over the past year BradHewitt91 has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 53  and 49  of the time respectively throughout 655 estimates  Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case BradHewitt91 is expecting Rite Aid to report in line with the Estimize consensus on EPS but come up slightly short of the community s expectations on revenue 
Rite Aid stock had a great year in 2013 returning 254   Shares were beaten down to prices as low as  1 43 at the start of last year but 4 consecutive quarters of beating Wall Street expectations on both the top and bottom line gave RAD a considerable boost  This quarter contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform have lower expectations than the Street and are projecting yoy revenue growth of 1 4  compared to 0  yoy revenue growth reported in FQ4 of last year

179690,401206,WBA,Graham Value Portfolio Update,opinion,In January I announced a   a Benjamin Graham  inspired  value stock portfolio  The purpose of the hypothetical portfolio is to track returns for a portfolio of 15 stocks selected based on a variety of valuation metrics  I originally intended to update the portfolio monthly  however  in the spirit of creating a lower turnover  value driven portfolio it is now updated approximately once per quarter  I have also added an additional criteria to limit turnover in the portfolio  see below   The Graham portfolio is an attempt to add a value strategy to   which is otherwise focused on momentum  trend  income and market timing strategies  There are numerous ways to add market timing or hedging techniques to any stock portfolio  such as shorting the S P 500 when it trades below a long term moving average while simultaneously holding a portfolio of long stock positions  However  for the purposes of this portfolio there will be no additional timing or hedging techniques  The criteria used to select the stocks are listed below  The tools used to perform the screen and backtests are courtesy of    SS123   and    P123    The actual screen factors are below Liquidity filter  No OTC StocksEliminate companies classified in the Miscellaneous Financial Services Industry  most of which are investment companies and funds and not the kind of stocks this all star tended to seekCurrent ratio must be at least 1 5Long term debt must be no higher than 10  above working capitalEPS must be above breakeven in each of the last four quarters and in each of the last five annual periodsTrailing 12 month EPS most be above EPS in the latest annual periodEPS in the latest annual period must be above EPS in the prior year and five years agoThe company must have paid common dividends in the last 12 monthsThe ranking system used as a basis for selecting the top 15 based among those stocks that pass the Graham screen are below Valuation   60  of totalTrailing 12 month P E  15  of this category Price to Book  15  of this category Price to Tangible Book Value  35  of this category Operating P E  defined as Market Capitalization divided by Business Income  which is Sales minus Cost of Goods sold minus Selling  General   Administrative Expense and omits unusual items  35  of this category Earnings   40  of total5 year EPS Growth Rate  50  of this category EPS Stability  defined as the standard deviation of EPS over the past 16 quarters  lower being better  50  of this category I began tracking this portfolio real time on January 13th  2012  As of this writing  the portfolio is down 2 11  including dividends compared to a positive return of 11 63   excluding dividends  for SPY over the same period and 10 5  for Vanguard Small Cap Value ETF  VBR  over the same time period The portfolio has been hampered by big drawdowns in a handful of names  which the quantitative rules continue to define as undervalued  These are excellent examples of the challenges in value investing   a stock could be defined as under valued for a good reason  and may remain so for a significant period of time  perhaps years or forever if the company has experienced a permanent and material change in operations  a  value trap    On the other hand  under valued stocks may lag longer than investors wish  but patient  longer term investors who aptly select value stocks can be rewarded in the long run A real world application of this portfolio could also utilize stop losses in order to prevent large drawdowns in single positions  However  for the purposes of tracking the portfolio results  all positions are bought and held until rebalancing In July a rule was added to help limit portfolio turnover   stocks will only be sold when they drop out of the top 20 in Graham Value screen  Thus  a stock could theoretically drop to the 20th ranking but remain in the 15 stock portfolio if it is a current holding An interesting early trend in live tracking is that of smaller  less liquid equities appearing frequently on the list  This makes for a potentially more volatile  higher beta list of equities  This could also be of concern for those nervous about equity markets  As mentioned earlier one potential strategy for hedging equity positions would be to short the overall equity market when an index such as the S P 500 drops below a long term moving average Another filter worth consideration is one based on market capitalization  Given my personal level of discomfort with stocks with ultra low market capitalizations  and especially those based overseas  going forward any new additions to the portfolio will be required to have a market cap greater than  100 million  Three stocks remain in the portfolio with market caps below  100 million but no new stocks will be added with market caps below  100 million The top 20 stocks based on the screen criteria  no market cap requirement  are listed below Below are 3  5  and 10 year backtest results for this screen  with no market cap requirement  using a quarterly rebalance and  5  slippage to help account for bid ask

179707,401223,WBA,Newsflash  Dividend Aristocrats Found The Lost Decade ,opinion,Introduction   There are many people who continue to hold a jaundiced view of stocks because they were traumatized by the last two recessions  Precipitous drops in equity prices drove them to distrust stocks and stock markets  However  I believe that most of the negative sentiment is a function of what I would describe as vague ideas about what really happened  A lot has to do with many investors failing to recognize  or make the important distinctions  that were the true causes of our last two market crashes    The first market collapse  late summer 2000  was first a function of significant overvaluation  especially regarding the technology sector  followed by the mild recession of 2001  The second market collapse was the result of a greedy and fraudulently induced  and consequently  more serious recession dubbed the great recession of 2008  Therefore  at least in my opinion  the two huge drops in stock values were not really the result of a weak economy  as many people think  The first was the result of an extremely inefficiently behaving stock market  and the second  the result of a greedy financial sector induced by poor government policy    Nevertheless  these two major catastrophic events have shaken the confidence of many investors  What bothers me about this is how it is driving people away from investing in our country s finest companies at precisely the time when I believe that it makes more sense to do so than it has in many years  Most importantly  the conditions that existed when these two market collapses occurred no longer exist  Nevertheless  investors and pundits alike  continue to look for reasons why a market collapse will soon reoccur  Their views are based on a pessimistic view of equities  and I believe an exaggerated view of the risk profile of stocks that was caused by the trauma    Personally  I abhor pessimism  because I believe it is both an erroneous and dangerous mindset for investors to possess  In a recent article  I mistakenly titled my introduction  pessimism is for losers  and therefore  inadvertently offended many readers  Although I accept the responsibility that it was my fault for penning such a provocative statement  the offended readers misunderstood my intent  I was not calling pessimistic people losers  I was attempting to articulate that a pessimistic attitude can create unnecessary losses    Furthermore  many readers also mistook my words to mean that I was a  perma Bull  that was in denial that a future market collapse could even occur  That is not what an optimistic attitude is actually about  An optimistic attitude is about understanding and believing that even though a recession or market collapse can occur  both will inevitably end  Therefore  both our equity markets and our economy will prosper and grow once again  it s only a matter of time    But the real problem is that pessimists are most likely to sell at the bottom of the market and as a result realize unnecessary losses  Market bottoms have always represented great buying opportunities  that only an optimist is capable of exploiting  More simply stated  people usually sell their equities when the risk of owning them is the lowest and the opportunity for gain the highest  In other words  selling into the bottom of the market instead of buying into it as the optimist does    Since 2000  Dividend Aristocrats Outperformed the S P 500   I have come to learn that Dividend Growth investors  which have also been disparagingly referred to as Dividend Zealots  are among the most optimistic investors in the universe  And in many ways  perhaps the most misunderstood  Dividend Growth investors often state that they are not concerned with drops in the price of their stocks  but only that their dividends grow  For some reason  this offends certain people who apparently feel that this makes Dividend Growth investors arrogant and or even ignorant    What these detractors misunderstand in my judgment  is that the average Dividend Growth investor does not worry about short term volatility because they do not intend to sell  Dividend Growth investors buy in order to hold quality dividend paying companies for the long run  that have long histories of increasing their dividends every year  There are two popular sources of identifying the consistent dividend achiever  They are the lists of Dividend Champions  Contenders and Challengers provided by David Fish found   and perhaps the more widely known Standard   Poor s Corp s Dividend Aristocrats  Both the Dividend Champions and Dividend Aristocrats are comprised of companies that have increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years    Since there are fewer names on the Dividend Aristocrats than there are the Dividend Champions  51 versus 103   I took the easy route and calculated the returns of the Dividend Aristocrats since calendar year 2000  Although we are now into our 13th year  thus going three years beyond the so called  Lost Decade   the evidence of rebounding stock values is profoundly obvious  Not only did all but three of the Dividend Aristocrats dramatically outperform the S P 500  they also provided very strong returns  that on balance  out stripped inflation and even taxation    I was motivated to run this study because of a comment that one reader made on my article  link provided above  as follows     The average S P 500 index fund is down roughly 28  since 1 1 2000  after adjusting for inflation  Add in dividends and that gets investors to nearly the breakeven point  Subtract the funds taxes from Gains and dividends  and investors are back to a loss     The same commenter also expressed the same sentiment in another comment to another reader as follows     it is likely that nearly all the dividend buy  and  hold Bulls have lost money relative to year 2000  after adjusting for inflation and taxes     Although the first comment above is accurate regarding the S P 500 as inflation was approximately 28   by my calculation inflation was actually 32 3    his second comment is inaccurate where his view is biased by his first comment  In truth  at least regarding the Dividend Aristocrats who increased their dividend every year for 25 straight years  all the dividend buy and hold bulls that held them would have trounced the S P  inflation and taxes    The following tables generated by the  research tool reviews the performance of the Dividend Aristocrats since December 31  1999  Astoundingly  only 3 of the 51 Dividend Aristocrats underperformed the S P 500  Furthermore  only 7 of the 51 companies would have failed to generate the 3  compounded annual return necessary to combat inflation and taxes  Moreover  the majority of the Dividend Aristocrats have lavishly rewarded their dividend buy and hold bulls  optimists   As you review the list  note that every company from Procter   Gamble  PG  and above outperformed the S P 500  inflation and taxes    Table One  Top 15 Dividend Aristocrats Since 1999   Our first table lists the top 15 Dividend Aristocrats in order of highest performing to the lowest  Sherwin Williams  SHW   the best performer averaged over 16  returns per annum  with Becton Dickinson   Co   BDX  rounding out the top 15 by averaging a 10 1  compounded annual return    As you review the records of these first 15 Dividend Aristocrats  keep in mind that this is during one of the worst 13 year periods of price performance in stock market history  For added perspective and insight and just following this first table  I provide the complete earnings and price driven F A S T  Graphs   plus performance tables on these two Dividend Aristocrats Sherwin Williams Co There are at least two very interesting takeaways that the 13 year earnings and price correlated graph on Sherwin Williams reveals  First of all  Sherwin Williams was not overvalued at the beginning of calendar year 2000  This validates a point that I ve often written about that states that in every market  whether bull or bear  the scrutinizing investor can always find good stocks at fair value to invest in  Second  I would like to point out that I believe that Sherwin Williams is currently significantly overvalued  which greatly contributes to its outperformance There was no  Lost Decade  for shareholders of Sherwin Williams Company since 1999  Not only did they receive significant long term capital appreciation  they were rewarded by strong growth in their dividend income  Finally  what follows is a napkin calculation of Sherwin Williams  return after inflation and taxes  576 154 38 capital appreciation   33  inflation    386 203    56 287 of total dividends paid   15  tax    47 844    329 916 total cash return  The figure needed to beat inflation is approximately  133 000  Becton Dickinson   Co   BDX Becton Dickinson is also interesting in at least two ways  First  it represents another example of a company that was fairly valued at the beginning of calendar year 2000  However  it was overvalued in 2008  which contributed to their large drop in stock price during the great recession  But even though they have not returned to their previous high price of  93 24 in 2008  fair value at that time was approximately somewhere between  65  70 per share  In other words  Becton Dickinson s stock price should never have been that high in the first place  As an aside  even the optimistic investor should have  or could have  realistically sold or lightened up on their position at that time The scrutinizing reader might notice that Becton Dickinson shareholders enjoyed a total rate of return  10 1   that was very close to its operating earnings growth rate of 10 4   At the end of the day  fundamentals matter  Also  note that dividends increased in close correlation with earnings growth Table Two  Top Performing Dividend Aristocrats 16   30Our second top 15 best performing Dividend Aristocrats also soundly outperformed the S P 500  inflation and taxes Table Three  Top Performing Dividend Aristocrats 31   45On this list of Dividend Aristocrats  only one company  Walgreen Co   WAG  did not outperform the S P 500  inflation and taxes Table Four  Final Six Lowest Performing Dividend AristocratsOnly 3 of our final 6 of 51 Dividend Aristocrats failed to outperform the S P 500 since December 31  1999  Technically  none of these final six would have outstripped inflation or taxes either  However  only two of the six would have actually generated a real loss  excluding inflation and taxes  However  the reasons why are fascinating  and are reviewed in detail following the table Wal Mart Stores Inc   WMT Our next to last worst performing Dividend Aristocrat was Wal Mart  which tells a very interesting story about stock market inefficiency  Clearly  the company was significantly overvalued at the beginning of calendar year 2000  However  the reader should also note that this company grew earnings at above average rates through both the recession of 2001 and the great recession of 2008  It was an inefficient stock market  not poor operating results  or even weak economies  that hurt the performance of this company Even though Wal Mart s earnings growth averaged better than 11  per annum since calendar year 2000  the shares were not able to overcome the headwinds of excessive overvaluation  Consequently  shareholders lost money  but not because the company was poorly managed or because the economy went through two recessions  Shareholders lost money because Mr  Market overpriced their shares in a very inefficient manner during the irrational exuberant period which ended in calendar year 2000 Pitney Bowes Inc   PBI Our worst performing Dividend Aristocrat  Pitney Bowes  is one of the few Dividend Aristocrats that actually experienced an earnings drop off since calendar year 2000  However  all of it occurred since the great recession of 2008  Therefore  this company had two strikes going against it  Strike one  was massive overvaluation at the beginning of the timeframe  and strike two  falling earnings since the great recession However  in spite of falling earnings  Pitney Bowes managed to raise their dividends every year since calendar year 2000  Nevertheless  shareholders lost a considerable portion of their initial investment even when dividends are added in  But most importantly  Pitney Bowes  problems were all company specific  rather than a function of a bad market Summary and ConclusionsThere are numerous lessons that I believe can be learned by a careful analysis of the above tables and individual earnings and price correlated company specific F A S T  Graphs   First of all  it should be recognized that Dividend Aristocrats  almost by definition  are above average quality operating enterprises  A company cannot increase its dividend every year for 25 or more years without having a good operating history that includes strong balance sheets  and healthy earnings and cash flow generation  Second  the results that these quality companies produced validate my thesis that it is more appropriate to think of a market of individual stocks in contrast to a stock market But perhaps one of the most important lessons of all is the validation of the benefits of taking an optimistic view of stocks  Business cycles  which include recessions and sometimes unforeseen catastrophic events such as 911 should be expected  However  we should all realize that so far none has ever been severe enough to completely destroy our economy  And  God forbid  if one ever does  there is absolutely nothing anyone could do to protect themselves anyway  As I like to say  you can t manage portfolios based on Armageddon  Therefore  I strongly believe that the optimistic approach is the superior and most profitable one to take  Volatility can only hurt you if you react to it  And you should not react to it unless there is a real fundamental deterioration with the fundamentals of the businesses you own  If fundamentals are strong and price falls  then buy more if you can  or hold if you can t buy more  Note that as three of the four specific examples that were cited in this article illustrate  the very best companies can remain profitable even during our most severe economic challenges  Consequently  when you can find these companies on sale  regardless of what caused it  I believe you should consider optimistically investing in them  It sure beats taking losses that you don t need to absorb Disclosure   Long CLX  VFC  WAG  MKC  BCR  ADP  MDT  T  XOM  MCD  KO  PG  GPC  KMB  ITW  MHP  SYY
