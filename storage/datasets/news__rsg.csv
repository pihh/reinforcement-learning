145734,367249,RSG,Deep Dive  These companies have the most at stake when the world clamps down on plastic pollution,news,"Pollution is a tremendous and complicated problem around the world  requiring a variety of actions by governments  companies and people to clean up waste and reduce harm to the environment   Analysts at New York based investment bank Jefferies Group have published a detailed research report describing many approaches to mitigating the plastic pollution disaster  They highlighted companies that might suffer from narrower profit margins under overlapping pollution reduction scenarios  as well as those that may benefit from new rules and cleanup programs  The growth of the plastics industry that led to the disaster illustrated above was summed up in one word a long time ago 





Plastic has been a boon to all of us  making so many things lighter  less expensive and more durable  But the problems of single use plastics and the incredible amount of plastic waste in the world s oceans are familiar to most people  It s only a matter of time before world governments take strong action to reduce pollution and begin the plastic cleanup in earnest  Scores of companies have already signed pledges to reduce their own plastic pollution  One example is Coca Cola

145747,367262,RSG,Fearing lawsuits  U S  banks set sky high limits for director pay,news,"By Olivia Oran
NEW YORK  Reuters    Over the past two years  a growing number of U S  banks has capped their directors  earnings  but the ceilings are so high that they primarily serve to fend off potential shareholder litigation rather than control the pace of pay increases 
Most of the caps are typically 2 3 times what directors now get paid  according to data and filings reviewed by Reuters 
For instance   Morgan Stanley  s quarterly financial statement last month noted a new  750 000 limit on annual compensation for independent directors  That is more than double the  350 000 median the bank now pays its directors 
Morgan Stanley s board has permission to  alter  amend or modify the plan at any time   according to the bank s filing 
Pay consultants and recruiters say banks need such flexibility because heightened regulatory burdens make positions on bank boards less attractive than in other sectors 
Competitive pay can help lure qualified directors who otherwise would choose less time consuming and highly scrutinized jobs  they say 
 The time spent in these type of positions has grown  as has the risk and potential liability   said Rose Marie Orens  a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners 
However  advocates of reforming executive pay   by linking it with performance and reducing incentives for risk taking   argue the pay ceilings are so high they lack teeth 
 It doesn t really change the landscape significantly other than insulate companies from lawsuits   said Yaron Nili  a law professor at the University of Wisconsin who focuses on corporate governance 
Overall  the median annual board compensation at the six biggest U S  banks was  349 027 in 2015  nearly  80 000 more than the median director pay at S P 500 companies overall  according to executive compensation data firm Equilar   Graphic  
While regulators scrutinize executive pay at big banks  investors wield the stick when it comes to independent directors  earnings  Several shareholder lawsuits on the issue got banks  attention 
In one important case  investors sued waste disposal company  Republic Services Inc   NYSE RSG   accusing directors of paying themselves too much  The judge ruled in 2012 that the company lacked  meaningful limits  on director awards 
 Facebook Inc   NASDAQ FB  settled a similar lawsuit in 2014 by agreeing to review director compensation annually and to bring in an independent consultant 
No banks have been subject to litigation over director compensation  but have preemptively imposed pay caps to avoid facing similar suits 
CONVENIENT PROTECTION
 For the most part  these limits aren t really going to affect director pay  other than the fact that it s really just a protection for them   said Bill Gerek who advises companies on executive pay and governance matters at Korn Ferry   What s the cost  
Consultants and lawyers say having any ceiling makes a company less likely to be targeted in a lawsuit 
Director pay has been rising at banks at a similar pace as at other large companies in recent years  However  the rise in compensation has generally outpaced banks  share performance 
From the beginning of 2014 to the end of 2015  the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index rose 5 2 percent compared with a 11 percent rise in the S P 500 Index  Average director pay at the 10 biggest U S  banks rose 7 percent during the same period  according to Equilar  which tracks such data 
So far this year  the KBW index is roughly steady while the S P has risen 6 3 percent 
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS  pays its board the most among banks and ranks sixth among S P 500 companies  according to executive recruiting firm Spencer Stuart  Its directors earned a median annual compensation of  595 000 last year  up 32 percent since 2011 
Goldman does not have caps on board pay  The majority of its directors  pay comes in the form of stock whose sales are restricted until several quarters after they retire 
A Goldman spokesman declined to comment on director compensation 
A Willis Towers Watson analysis of Fortune 500 companies found that about 52 percent of financial institutions now have limits on stock awards directors can receive  compared with 28 percent for the whole 500  The majority of companies have instituted limits just for stock based awards  while others have targeted overall compensation  including cash 
In addition to Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS    Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C    American Express   NYSE AXP   US Bancorp  NYSE USB  and Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK  Corp also have director pay limits  Citigroup s cap of  900 000 on stock awards is more than 2 5 times its current median director pay  Bank of New York Mellon s cap of  1 million is about 3 5 times its median annual compensation 
An American Express spokeswoman said the pay caps are good corporate governance  The other banks declined to comment beyond the filings 
The greater focus on executive pay means investors also care more about board pay  said Pat McGurn  head of strategic research and analysis at corporate governance firm ISS 
Limits on board pay are  becoming part of the checklist now   he said ",2016-09-01,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/fearing-lawsuits,-u.s.-banks-set-sky-high-limits-for-director-pay-423580",423580

145874,367389,RSG,Here s Why You Should Hold On To ManpowerGroup  MAN  Stock,opinion,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks  At times  it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions 
Here we focus on ManpowerGroup Inc    NYSE MAN    which has expected earnings per share  EPS  growth rate of 23 3  for 2018 and a  of B  It has a long term  three to five years  EPS growth rate of 8 5  
Factors That Bode Well forManpowerGroup
The staffing industry is currently benefiting from a strong economy  leading to robust manufacturing and non manufacturing activities and higher corporate spending post the tax reform  So  there is plenty of room for growth for ManpowerGroup in the United States in the near to mid term as the demand environment stays strong  Also  there are ample opportunities for the company in emerging markets as penetration rates are still well below global standards 
To increase productivity and efficiency and reduce cost  the company is making significant investments in restructuring and technology  In the third quarter  ManpowerGroup transitioned a major portion of its business in Germany to a new integrated front office system  The company is also upgrading its business with cloud based front office systems 
ManpowerGroup Inc  Revenue  TTM 
   Acquisitions should continue to support top line growth  Acquisitions contributed 30 basis points  bps  to third quarter 2018 revenue growth rate and are expected to add 10 bps to the same in the fourth quarter 
The company has a consistent record of rewarding shareholders with dividends and share repurchases  In the first nine months of 2018  the company paid  66 million in dividends and repurchased shares worth  299 2 million  In 2017  the company returned  123 7 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and  203 9 million of share repurchases  In 2016  ManpowerGroup paid  118 4 million of dividend and repurchased shares worth  482 2 million 
Such moves indicate the company s commitment to create value for shareholders and underline confidence in its business 
To Conclude
In spite of significant growth opportunities  ManpowerGroup is not free from overhangs  Southern  NYSE SO  Europe   the company s largest reportable segment  41  of 2017 revenues    should experience staffing margin pressure resulting from competitiveness and employment  CICE  rate decrease from 7  to 6  in France  Escalation in costs due to investments may decelerate bottom line growth  Nevertheless  we believe that economic stability  acquisitions and prudent investments bode well for the company in the long run

145977,367492,RSG,Why Should You Retain Republic Services In Your Portfolio ,opinion,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks  At times  it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions 
Here we discuss about Republic Services  Inc    NYSE RSG    a stock with an expected long term earnings per share growth rate of 11 1  
In the past six months  shares of the company have gained 4 7   outperforming the 2  increase of the  it belongs to 

 
We believe the stock has the potential to exceed expectations moving ahead  The reasons behind our optimism include the company s continuous internal growth increasing operational efficiency 
Let s discuss them in detail 
Continuous Internal Growth via Long Term Contracts
Republic Services continues to grow internally with the help of long term contracts for the collection  recycling and disposal of solid waste materials  Such agreements increase the company s contracted revenue base  thereby strengthening its market position 
Further  the company continues to look out for strategic price improvement in order to offset increased costs and enjoy an appropriate return on its substantial investments in vehicles  equipment  landfills  transfer stations and recycling centers  Notably  the company s first quarter 2018 revenue growth includes a 3 8  positive impact of internal growth 
Republic Services  Inc  Revenue  TTM 
   Increased Focus on Operational Efficiency
Republic Services is focused on improving its operational efficiency by shifting to compressed natural gas  CNG  collection vehicles and converting rear loading trucks to automated side loaders  which will reduce cost and improve profitability  The company is highly optimistic about the usage of CNG vehicles that will help it compete effectively on grounds of maintaining a clean environment  Despite higher expenses  CNG reduces the company s overall fleet operating costs through lower fuel expenses 
The company s focus on enhancing its operations by streamlining the cost structure  improving revenue quality and seeking growth through profitable investment opportunities is impressive 
Bottom Line
Despite riding on significant growth prospects  Republic Services is not free from overhangs  High competition and weak landfill pricing remain concerns  However  we believe that long term contracts  investments and operational efficiency efforts bode well for the company 
Zacks Rank   Key Picks
Republic Services has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the broader  include Verifone Systems  Inc    NYSE PAY    FLEETCOR Technologies  Inc    NYSE FLT   and WEX Inc    NYSE WEX    While Verifone and FLEETCOR Technologies carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   WEX sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see   
The long term expected earnings per share growth rate for Verifone  FLEETCOR Technologies and WEX is 14 9   16 5  and 14 3   respectively 
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars 
Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research

146083,367598,RSG,The Challenges Of Finding Investment Income,opinion,I was fortunate to be in Boca Raton  Florida last week at the GAIM conference on hedge funds  enjoying a 50 degree temperature advantage over NY  I had the opportunity to meet with several retired people who live in Florida either part time during the winter or all year  Chatting with them about investments really brought home to me the challenge many face of obtaining sufficient stable income on which to live  Bonds purchased years ago are maturing and the replacement opportunities are far less attractive  Equities remain a scary place although the strong start to the year is leading to modestly improved risk appetites  But for many retired baby boomers  they are having to confront significantly lower investment income than they imagined perhaps as recently as 6 7 years ago  There remains a great deal of cash on the sidelines Discussions of Master Limited Partnerships  MLPs  were well received  Indeed  MLPs have had a good year already less than a month into 2013  with returns year to date that are double all of 2012  Barring a disaster over the next couple of days  January will be one of the five strongest months since 1996  as far back as the Alerian MLP Index goes   We continue to like MLPs as an investment  although distribution yields of 5 6  with growth rates of 4 6  suggest a long term annual total return of 10 12   January has pretty much delivered that in one month  so some moderation shouldn t be surprising Dividend yielding stocks have similarly bounced back  as the concerns about investment tax rates that were so pervasive in December turned out to be somewhat more negative than reality We have recently made a couple of small sales  Insurance companies have been seeing improved pricing and consequently their discounts to book value have been narrowing  We sold the last of Aspen Re  AHL  as it approached 80  of book value  We continue to own AIG which is still just a little over 50  of book value and looks set to continue shrinking its shares outstanding through buybacks  thus raising its book value  We also sold Republic Services Group  RSG  which we felt was fully valued  We remain constructive on equities overall though  so will be looking for opportunities to reinvest this cash At the GAIM hedge fund conference I gave my presentation about my book  The Hedge Fund Mirage  Hedge fund investors largely agreed with my findings  at least  the ones I spoke to  and my conclusions echoed many of their personal experiences  Most of the delegates with whom I chatted agreed that the hedge fund industry needs to make some changes if it is to thrive  My bet is that it will   there are far too many intelligent people with their careers in the business to assume that they ll fail to adapt to the difficult return environment so many face George Soros  who knows a thing or two about hedge funds and how they operate  said in Davos last week that hedge funds couldn t beat the market because of the fees they charge  He must have read my book ,2013-01-30,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-challenges-of-finding-investment-income-153000,153000
