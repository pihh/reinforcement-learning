24289,245804,LAMR,Iron Mountain Completes Digital Recording Of Stonewall Inn,opinion,"Iron Mountain Inc    NYSE IRM   and CyArk have recently completed a 3D scan of the iconic Stonewall National Monument in New York  site of the 1969 Stonewall Uprising  The latest effort is part of the ongoing partnership between the companies to digitally capture  archive and share the historical heritage site 
Through this project  Iron Mountain has created an experiential record to preserve the cultural monument and make it accessible to visitors across the globe 
While CyArk documented the Stonewall National Monument  consisting of the Stonewall Inn and Christopher Park  Iron Mountain provided its facilities to preserve the digital copies of the monument   
Specifically  a 3D mapping technology was used to create a comprehensive record of the site  Subsequently  the digital copies are preserved in a highly secure Iron Mountain facility for future use by CyArk 
The project used data to create a photorealistic digital archive of Christopher Park and the Stonewall Inn  It will be available on CyArk s website and can be downloaded through the Open Heritage 3D platform  a project by CyArk  the University of South Florida Libraries and Historic Environment Scotland to provide free access to high resolution 3D data of cultural heritage sites globally 
Additionally  the scan has been integrated into both virtual reality and augmented reality  The virtual reality format allows viewers to move around within the scan  providing an interactive photorealistic experience  Further  the augmented reality format offers pre recorded stories and perspectives from those who were accompanying the scan 
Iron Mountain and CyArk had earlier joined hands to record the moai of Easter Island  Fort York  Toronto  the Palacio de Bellas Artes  Mexico City  and the Royal Exhibition Building  Melbourne  Australia

4 REIT Stocks to Add as U S  Treasury Yields Remain Volatile
High flying growth stocks in the recent past no doubt grabbed attention with the stock market witnessing an impressive run  But things of late went haywire as the Federal Reserve deviated from its stance of aggressively hiking the interest rates and rather adopted a more dovish stand  indicating at the recent FOMC meeting that it was unlikely to increase the rates at all in 2019 
Consequently  investors  sentiment took a hit as concerns are raised over the fate of the U S  economy amid the ongoing trade war  the economic slowdown in Europe and China and the declining stimulus from the lower tax rates  Further adding to the woes is the cut in GDP growth and the inflation projections by the central bank  Fed s statement read   recent indicators point to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter    
Obviously  recessionary fears are brewing up in the market  compelling investors to look for safer havens  particularly toward the security of the government bonds  Demand for long term bonds surged of late and the yield on the 10 year Treasury note went below the yield on the 3 month Treasury bill  resulting in an inversion of the yield curve 
All these brought back the interest sensitive REITs to the limelight  This is because these are often treated as bond substitutes for the high dividend paying nature  Particularly  government regulations mandate the REITs to disburse at least 90  of their taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders each year 
Moreover  the underlying fundamentals of several asset categories in the REIT sector exhibit strength  The occupancy levels of properties are hovering near the record high marks  indicating strong demand and the scope for generating steady revenues 
Therefore  backtracking to the REITs and scouting for stocks with better fundamentals and dividend seem an apt choice  We have handpicked stocks based on a favorable Zacks Rank  high dividend yield and other relevant metrics 
Plymouth Industrial REIT  Inc focuses on the acquisition and management of the single and multi tenant industrial properties  The company targets properties in the secondary and select primary markets across the United States and is based in Boston  MA 
This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock has a dividend yield of nearly 9   Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year funds from operations  FFO  per share has witnessed a 59 9  upward revision over the past 30 days to  2 59  reflecting analysts  optimism on the stock 
Based in Newton  MA  Industrial Logistics Properties Trust is focused on the ownership and leasing of the industrial and logistics properties  primarily in the United States  This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  player s expected FFO per share growth for the current year is 7 4   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year FFO per share has moved nearly 1 8  north over the past 30 days  The stock has a dividend yield of 6 6  
Headquartered in Tysons  VA  Park Hotels   Resorts Inc  is a lodging REIT with premium branded hotels and resorts  majority of which are situated in the key United States markets with high barriers to entry  The stock with a Zacks Rank of 2 has a forward dividend yield of 5 8   Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year FFO per share has been revised nearly 1 3  upward over the past 30 days

forma funds from operations  FFO  of 63 cents per share in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The figure indicates a 5  increase from the year ago quarter tally of 60 cents For full year 2017  pro forma FFO per share came in at  2 45 per share  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The bottom line figure for full year 2016 was  2 32 per share Results display growth in property net operating income  NOI  supported by same store properties  and lease up of redevelopment and acquisition communities  However  these positives were partially offset by the loss of income from apartment sales in 2016 For the reported quarter  total revenues of  255 2 million comfortably outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  249 8 million  In addition  the reported figure came in 2 3  higher than the prior year quarter tally of  249 5 million For full year 2017  total revenues came in at  1 01 billion  exceeding the prior year figure by about 1    It also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  988 6 million Quarter in DetailSame store revenues increased 2 8  year over year to  148 4 million  while expenses increased 2 1  from the prior year quarter to  40 4 million  Consequently  same store net operating income  NOI  climbed 3 1  to  108 million on a year over year basis Same store average daily occupancy expanded 20 basis point  bps  year over year to 96 3   Rental rates on new leases were down 0 8  whereas rental rates on renewal leases were up 4 5  from the expiring lease rates As of Dec 31  2017  Aimco held cash and restricted cash on hand of  95

on its revolving credit facility were  67 million and available capacity was  521 million  after considering  12 million of letters of credit backed by the facility Portfolio ActivityDuring the reported quarter  Aimco invested  51 million in redevelopment and development In addition  Aimco is revamping its portfolio through property sales and reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents  superior margins and higher than expected growth Through these efforts  the company increased its revenue per apartment home by 7  to  2 123  Additionally  it enhanced the quality and expected growth rate of its portfolio  Specifically  the percentage of A  B and C  home came in at 53   32  and 15  in fourth quarter 2017 compared with 51   36  and 13   respectively  recorded in the year ago quarter  GuidanceFor full year 2018  the company expects its pro forma FFO per share guidance in the range of  2 42  2 52  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is  2 54  Notably  management has excluded legal costs relating to the case filed against Airbnb from this guidance because of the unpredictable nature of the costs For first quarter 2018  Aimco provided pro

cash dividend of 38 cents per share of Class A Common Stock for the fourth quarter  This marks a 6  year over year increase  The dividend will be paid on Feb 28 to stockholders of record as of Feb 16  2018 Bottom LineAimco s efforts to reposition its portfolio by shedding non strategic properties and investing the proceeds in opportunistic acquisitions will likely drive long term growth  In addition to this  the company has a solid portfolio diversified both in terms of geography and price point  This is likely to help meet the rise in demand for apartment properties efficiently However  stiff competition from new supply in various markets is expected to dampen Aimco s rent growth and new lease pricing ability  Additionally  interest rate hike and dilutive effect of sale of assets remain concerns Apartment Investment and Management Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Aimco currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  You can see  Upcoming ReleasesWe now look forward to the

It enjoys presence in key cities and opts for strategic joint ventures to drive long term profitability  Moreover  a solid balance sheet and fragmented ownership of its industry will likely prove conducive to portfolio consolidation and strategic acquisitions However  the company is likely to be affected by the development boom going forward  In fact  many of its markets are witnessing an escalating supply of new self storage space and this is anticipated to fuel competition for the company  curb its power to raise rents and turn on more discounting

24979,246494,LAMR,Best And Worst ETFs  And Mutual Funds   Mid Cap Value ,opinion,The mid cap value style ranks eleventh out of the twelve fund styles as detailed in my style roadmap  It gets my Dangerous rating  which is based on an aggregation of the ratings of 12 ETFs and 206 mutual funds in the mid cap value style as of July 19  2012  Figure 1 ranks from best to worst the nine mid cap value ETFs that meet our liquidity standards and Figure 2 shows the five best  and worst rated mid cap value mutual funds  Not all mid cap value style ETFs and mutual funds are created the same  The number of holdings varies widely  from 21 to 617   which creates drastically different investment implications and ratings  The best ETFs and mutual funds allocate more value to Attractive or better rated stocks than the worst  which allocate too much value to Neutral or worse rated stocks  To identify the best and avoid the worst ETFs and mutual funds within the mid cap value style  investors need a predictive rating based on  1  stocks ratings of the holdings and  2  the all in expenses of each ETF and mutual fund  Investors need not rely on backward looking ratings  Investors should not buy any mid cap value ETFs or mutual funds because none get an Attractive or better rating  If you must have exposure to this style  you should buy a basket of Attractive or better rated stocks and avoid paying undeserved fund fees  Active management has a long history of not paying off  Figure 1  ETFs with the Best   Worst Ratings   Top 5  where available    Best ETFs exclude ETFs with less NAV s less than 100 million Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filingsFirst Trust Mid Cap Value AlphaDEX Fund  FNK  and iShares Morningstar Mid Value Index Fund  JKI  are excluded from Figure 1 because their total net assets  TNA  are below  100 million and do not meet our liquidity standards Figure 2  Mutual Funds with the Best   Worst Ratings   Top 5  Best mutual funds exclude funds with NAV s less than 100 million  Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings Seven mutual funds are excluded from Figure 2 because their total net assets  TNA  are below  100 million and do not meet our liquidity standards  WisdomTree MidCap Earnings Fund  EZM  is my top rated mid cap value ETF and Touchstone Strategic Trust  Touchstone Mid Cap Value Opportunities Fund  TMOIX  is my top rated mid cap value mutual fund  Both earn my Neutral rating  SPDR S P 400 Mid Cap Value ETF  MDYV  is my worst rated mid cap value ETF and ProFunds  Mid Cap Value ProFund  MLPSX  is my worst rated mid cap value mutual fund  MDYV earns my Dangerous rating and MLPSX earns my Very Dangerous rating  Figure 3 shows that 360 out of the 1429 stocks  over 23  of the total net assets  held by mid cap value ETFs and mutual funds earn an Attractive or better rating  However  there are not any mid cap value ETFs or mutual funds that earn an Attractive or better rating  The takeaways are  mutual fund managers allocate too much capital to poor quality stocks and mid cap value ETFs offer exposure to poor quality stocks  Figure 3  Mid cap Value Style Landscape For ETFs  Mutual Funds   Stocks   Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings As detailed in     the fund industry offers many cheap funds but very few funds with high quality stocks  or with what I call good portfolio management  Investors need to tread carefully when considering mid cap value ETFs and mutual funds  because 83  of ETFs are rated Dangerous and 77  of mutual funds are rated Dangerous or worse  No mid cap value ETFs or mutual funds earn an Attractive or better rating  Investors desiring exposure to the mid cap value category should buy a basket of Attractive or better rated mid cap value stocks TRW Automotive Holdings  TRW  is one of my favorite stocks held by mid cap value ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Attractive rating  Sometimes when a company institutes a restructuring plan  it s a dying gasp and a desperate move to squeeze out a few more years of life  TRW Automotive  however  is a great example of a company that has been able to benefit dramatically from restructuring  The financial crisis and recession were hard on the auto industry  but TRW took advantage of the downtown by tightening their belts and improving their operating efficiency  They emerged from the recession stronger than ever  Over the past two years  pre tax operating margins were about double the margins of the two prior years  up to 8 5  in 2010 and 7 7  in 2011  up from 3 4  and 3 7  in 2008 and 2009   Keep in mind that our calculation of pre tax operating income  NOPBT  excludes the 2008 and 2009 restructuring charges  So those numbers do not reflect merely the absence of restructuring charges  they are genuine improvements  With revenues up to pre crisis levels and growing  TRW turned in their most profitable years on record in 2010 and 2011  Before restructuring  TRW never earned an ROIC higher than 6  and were eroding away shareholder value  After restructuring  however  they turned in 13 8  ROIC in 2010 and 13 7  in 2011  This is a company that has dramatically improved the profitability of its business and TRW s focus on long term value creation is paying off  Best of all  the market is pricing TRW as if its after tax profits  NOPAT  are going to permanently decline by 37   Sometimes Mr  Market can irrationally hold a grudge  but when he does  it can create an attractive opportunity for investors who do the proper due diligence  Lamar Advertising  LAMR  is one of my least favorite stocks held by mid cap value ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Dangerous rating  At first glance  Lamar Advertising does not seem like an awful company  Their revenues and NOPAT have been steady over the last decade and their NOPBT margins have been hovering around 20  for several years  However  LAMR has consistently failed to generate positive economic earnings  Lamar s ROIC has never reached above 3 5  since 1998 when my model begins  Companies that earn ROIC   WACC destroy shareholder value  The secret behind Lamar s dismal ROIC is that they produce invested capital turns of only 0 26 to 1  placing LAMR in the 16th percentile of all Russell 3000 companies  That means every dollar invested in Lamar s business generates a mere 26 cents in revenues  But yet  in order to justify their current stock price  Lamar needs to see profit growth of 15  compounded annually for the next 15 years  LAMR is a stagnant and inefficient company priced as it will achieve tech start up levels of growth  Figures 4 and 5 show the rating landscape of all mid cap value ETFs and mutual funds  Figure 4  Separating the Best ETFs From the Worst Funds Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company

106847,328362,LAMR,Lamar Alexander opposes witnesses  likely sealing quick end to impeachment trial,news,"Sen  Lamar Alexander  R Tenn   said Thursday night he would not vote to hear witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump  likely dooming a bid by Democrats and moderate Republicans and heralding the quick end of the trial  A vote to call witnesses is expected Friday  and is now likely to be blocked by Republicans  who may move to acquit Trump as soon as Friday night   In a statement  Alexander said   There is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the United States Constitution s high bar for an impeachable offense   The Constitution does not give the Senate the power to remove the president from office and ban him from this year s ballot simply for actions that are inappropriate    The question then is not whether the president did it  but whether the United States Senate or the American people should decide what to do about what he did  I believe that the Constitution provides that the people should make that decision in the presidential election that begins in Iowa on Monday   Our founding documents provide for duly elected presidents who serve with  the consent of the governed   not at the pleasure of the United States Congress  Let the people decide    Alexander was seen as the key swing vote for or against calling witnesses  Since Republicans hold a 53 47 majority in the Senate  Democrats need at least four Republicans to join them in seeking witness statements  Maine s Susan Collins  Alaska s Lisa Murkowski and Utah s Mitt Romney  all moderate Republicans  appear likely to vote to hear witnesses   The New York Times reported earlier this week that Bolton says in a forthcoming book that Trump personally told him that nearly  400 million in security aid to Ukraine should be withheld until Ukrainian officials agreed to investigate Democrats  including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son  Hunter  That would undercut a key line of defense for Trump  whose lawyers have said the aid holdup was unrelated to any investigation  Trump s defense asserted Wednesday that even if Trump did seek  quid pro quo  from Ukraine  it was not an impeachable offense
