United Tech s cash flow came in ahead of Wall Street estimates  largely because of timing around the costs of various deals ahead of the spinoff of its Otis and Carrier segments  the company says the businesses already are operating in an independent manner 
Today s likely are the last reported by United Technologies  the new company will be called Raytheon Technologies 
The company is assuming a roughly 90 day production delay for the MAX  CEO Greg Hayes said on today s earnings conference call  adding that Q4 saw little fallout from Boeing s problems because of support from the additional aftermarket work on other aircraft that remain flying at airlines 
United Tech reported  6 6B in free cash flow during FY 2019  better than its previous forecast of  5 2B  5 7B  but it said much of the improvement came from timing  it expected  1B in breakup costs but only recorded  400M in Q4 ",2020-01-28,Seeking Alpha,https://invst.ly/pnzsd,2069607

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood morning and welcome to the United Technologies  Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call  On the call today are  Greg Hayes  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Neil Mitchill  Acting Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  and Nathan Ware  Senior Director  Investor Relations  This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC s website at  note  except where otherwise noted  the Company will speak to results from continuing operations  excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a non recurring and or non operational nature  often referred to by management as other significant items  The Company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectation and other forward looking statements provided on this call are subject to risk and uncertainties  UTC s SEC filings including its forms 10 Q and 10 K provide detail on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements In addition  in connection with the proposed Raytheon merger to be discussed today  UTC has filed with the SEC a registration statement which includes as prospectus of UTC and a joint proxy statement of UTC and Raytheon  that contains important information about UTC  Raytheon and the merger and related matters   Operator Instructions Please go ahead  Mr  Hayes Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Catherine  Good morning  everyone  So a couple of new folks on the call with me this morning  Neil Mitchill  taking over for Akhil Johri  as our new Senior VP and CFO  and Nathan Ware  taking over for Carroll Lane  Head of Investor Relations  So a little bit of change here  but no change in terms of the results as you would have expected  So really a solid quarter and more importantly  a great year    record year in fact of financial performance This morning  we are going to cover three topics  We will of course go through the fourth quarter and full year 2019 results  but I m also giving you an update on where we are with the UTC portfolio transformation  including the Rockwell Collins integration  the separation activity around Otis and Carrier and of course  the pending merger with Raytheon  And finally  Neil will take you through the 2020 outlook for Pratt   Whitney and Collins Aerospace  Just a word on the cadence of our outlook disclosures for the years can be a little bit different this year given the separation activity  and given the pending merger  We recently announced that Carrier and Otis investor meetings are scheduled for February 10th and 11th respectively  This is when Dave Gitlin and Judy Marks along with their senior team will give you guys an overview of their respective businesses and provide their financial outlook for 2020 So we re not going to pre empt those today and go through their guidance  but you can look forward to talking including Dave and Judy in early February  Also  you ll notice that we re not going to provide EPS or cash outlooks today  We ll come back and talk about all of those metrics and the full year outlook for Raytheon Technologies following the completion of the merger  which we expect to close early in the second quarter So as you expect  different timeline this year given the various transformational events under way  but again  it will    we will get it all out there in due course  So starting on 2019  for the year  we reported record sales  adjusted EPS and free cash flow  Adjusted EPS that was  8 26 and that s up 9  versus last year  Sales   77 billion  that s up 16  and importantly  organic growth  5  and that s on top of the 8  organic sales growth we saw in 2018 All four businesses contributed to the organic growth  We saw good margin expansion at the aerospace business as well as a return to earnings growth and margin stabilization at Otis  At Carrier  the team closed out a challenging year on a positive note  slightly exceeding the most recent outlook for the business  Free cash flow for UTC was  6 6 billion for the year and that included approximately  400 million of one time cash payments  related to the portfolio separation activities The cash performance was about  1 1 billion better than the midpoint of our latest outlook due to the timing of separation tax payments  most of which will take place here in the first half of 2020 and of course  better operational performance from each of the businesses  In total  we continue to expect about  2 5 billion to  3 billion of one time cash costs associated with the portfolio separation  So strong results for 2019 above our expectations coming into the year and above our expectations as late as October with each of the businesses well positioned as we move into 2020 Okay  on the webcast  this is now on to slide 2  In addition to the financial results  we had several notable highlights and we ve made significant progress on the transformational initiatives that we ve been working for the last year  Let me give you a quick update on a few of those At Pratt   Whitney  the GTF and F135 engine output continue to ramp in 2019  We continue to add to the order book for both programs including yesterday s announcement that Wizz Air had selected the GTF engine to power its next lot of 166 aircraft adding to an order book of more than 10 000 firm and option engines for the GTF program While durability issues on the GTF continue to be addressed  it s clear  our customer see the value of the engine  which continues to meet or exceed all of the key performance metrics  including fuel burn  reduced noise and emissions  And with    we now have more than 700 GTF powered aircraft in service about 4 3 million flight hours  Since October  Pratt has also secured contracts totaling more than  7 billion for the production of more than 400 F135 engines in the related program support  So  a very strong backlog at Pratt   Whitney This past quarter  we also celebrated the one year anniversary of Rockwell Collins  Throughout the year  following close  the Collins team has delivered outstanding performance  We achieved approximately  300 million of acquisition related cost synergies and captured about  200 million of sales synergies in our order book Adjusted EPS accretion from the Collins acquisition was  0 66 for the year  Now you recall  going into the year  we had estimated about  0 35 of accretion  So a very strong year from Kelly Ortberg and the whole team at Collins Aerospace  We continue to see clear line of sight to the  600 million of cost synergies that we started out with  but more importantly over  1 billion of sales synergies  we would expect from the acquisition Okay  Let s turn to the separations  For both Otis and Carrier  they are substantially complete from an operational standpoint  That happened on January 1  where we cut them off from the corporate systems for the most part and they are now operating independently  Both companies as you see  announced their future Board of Directors in December and are looking forward to their pre spin investor meetings in early February Importantly  we received both US and Canadian tax rulings for the separation and we re currently working through a few final legal entity restructuring activities required to stand up the businesses as independent companies  Again  we re now targeting early in the second quarter for the spin of both businesses  So  no surprises there  portfolio separations remain on track Finally  on the merger with Raytheon  Our goal is to have the combination of UTC s aerospace businesses with Raytheon closed concurrent with the portfolio separation in early April  As of course subject to receiving all regulatory approvals  integration planning is well under way and we are already working a detailed list of items to generate the  1 billion of gross cost synergies that we re targeting for the transaction  I also remain very excited about the technology synergies that result from the combination and the opportunity this merger presents to create best in class premier aerospace and defense system provider Okay  with that  so let me turn it over to Nathan to take you through the fourth quarter results and then Neil will walk you through 2020 outlook and I ll be back to wrap up at the end  Nathan Nathan Ware    Senior Director of Investor RelationsAll right  Thanks  Greg  Moving to slide 3  as Greg said  Q4 was another solid quarter for UTC  reported sales of  19 6 billion were up 8  including 1  organic growth and 8 points of M A benefit driven by the Rockwell Collins acquisition  Foreign exchange was a 1 point headwind in the quarter  Adjusted earnings per share was  1 94  down 1  versus the prior year on a difficult compare  You will recall  we saw 22  adjusted earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter of 2018  Within the quarter  segment profit growth was offset by expected higher corporate items including interest expense and higher share count On a GAAP basis  earnings per share was  1 32  that s up 59  versus the prior year and includes  0 16 of restructuring and  0 46 of net non recurring charges including  0 39 related to the portfolio separation activities  The GAAP earnings per share growth was largely driven by the absence of a tax charge that you will recall we booked last year  partially offset by the portfolio separation charges incurred this year  Free cash flow was  1 9 billion  up 54  or approximately  700 million compared to the prior year and included approximately  200 million of one time cash separation payments  The quarter capped a strong year for free cash flow as Greg mentioned earlier Okay  With that  I ll move on to the segment results and I ll be speaking to the segments at constant currency as we usually do and as a reminder  there is an appendix on slide 17 with additional segment data as a reference  So starting with Otis on slide 4  sales of  3 4 billion in the quarter were up 4  organically  New equipment sales grew 1  driven by high teens growth in China  partially offset by declines in Asia Pacific and the Middle East  Service sales grew 5  driven by growth across all regions  Within service  maintenance and repair was up 5  and modernization was up 8  At constant currency  new equipment orders grew 3  driven by mid single digit growth in the Americas and Europe  as well as low single digit growth in China as the region continue to benefit from favorable pricing and mix  Asia Pacific was down low single digit  Operating profit was up 3  at constant currency driven primarily by volume growth and favorable price and mix in service  partially offset by higher research and development and strategic investments in the business  Service contribution also grew for the sixth straight quarter with all regions contributing  Foreign exchange translation was a 2 point headwind to sales and a 1 point headwind to earnings For the year  Otis  sales grew 5  organically with mid single digit growth in both new equipment and service  Operating profit was up  28 million at actual currency  The benefits from service transformation initiatives globally and improvements in China led to margin stabilization during the year and establishes a solid base for Otis to build upon as they become independent company Moving to Carrier on slide 5  Carrier sales were down 2  organically in the quarter driven by refrigeration which was down 8   That s mainly due to hard compares in the North American truck trailer business  which was up almost 50  in Q4 of 2018  Global HVAC sales were flat and global fire   security was up 1  in the quarter  Moving to orders  Carrier equipment orders contracted 4  organically in the quarter  primarily driven by transport refrigeration  which was down 32   Within transport refrigeration  North American truck trailer was down 63  after being up over 50  in the fourth quarter of last year Fire   security product orders were down 3  while global HVAC orders were up 2  with North American residential up mid single digit and global commercial HVAC flat  Within commercial HVAC  EMEA was up 10  offset by high single digit declines in the Americas  On a constant currency basis  operating profit was down 4  in the quarter  Lower volume and adverse mix as well as headwinds from lower discount rates used for valuing long term liabilities were partially offset by pricing benefits and material productivity net of tariff impacts  Operating profit included the gain on a sale of an equity investment and a land sale offsetting the absence of prior year similar items  For the year  Carrier sales were up 1  organically and operating profit was down  80 million at actual currency  slightly exceeding the most recent outlook for the business Turning to Pratt on slide 6  sales of  5 6 billion were up 2  on both an organic and reported basis in the quarter and that was on top of 22  organic growth last year  Commercial OEM sales were down 7  driven by expected declines in V2500 shipments  partially offset by higher GTF engine shipments and favorable engine mix at Pratt   Whitney Canada Commercial aftermarket sales were flat in the quarter  Early GTF shop visits  as well as higher Pratt   Whitney Canada and V2500 volumes offset expected declines in legacy programs and the absence of prior year contract adjustments  Military sales were up 12  driven by continued ramp of the F135 program and higher aftermarket sales across all key platforms  Operating profit of  456 million was up 34   drop through on higher military sales  favorable commercial aftermarket mix and growth at Pratt   Whitney Canada more than offset commercial OE mix headwind and the net impact of contract adjustments  Results also benefited from lower engineering and development expense in the quarter  For the full year  organic sales were up 8  driven by higher GTF and Pratt   Whitney Canada engine shipments and higher military volume  Operating profit was up  239 million All right  turning to Collins Aerospace on slide 7  sales in the quarter were  6 4 billion  up  1 5 billion on a reported basis and 1  organically  Operating profit of  1 billion was up  236 million versus the prior year  You ll recall that the fourth quarter of last year contained about five weeks of results from the Rockwell Collins acquisition  On a pro forma basis  including results for Rockwell Collins  the entire fourth quarter of 2018  Collins Aerospace delivered operating profit growth of 8  on 4  higher sales  The pro forma sales growth reflects continued strength in commercial aftermarket and military channels  partially offset by commercial OEM volume Commercial aftermarket sales were up 11  driven by continued strength in initial provisioning and demand for modifications and upgrades  Military was up 10  driven by F35 volume and overall aftermarket growth  Commercial OEM sales were down 6  driven by expected declines on legacy programs which more than offset growth in new platform sales Operating profit growth was driven by the contribution of two additional months of results from the Rockwell Collins acquisition  drop through on higher commercial aftermarket and military sales and synergy benefits  The growth was partially offset by lower commercial OE volume and unfavorable mix as well as higher SG A and engineering and development  On a full year basis  Collins Aerospace delivered 6  organic sales growth and over  1 8 billion of operating profit growth  driven by contributions from the Rockwell Collins acquisition  solid execution and synergy capture and strong end markets  Pro forma operating profit growth was 16  on 7  sales growth With that  I ll hand it over to Neil  who will provide more detail on the 2020 outlook  Neil Neil G  Mitchill    Acting Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Nathan  I m on slide 8  As Greg said  I m going to talk about the 2020 outlook for Pratt   Whitney and Collins Aerospace today  As you think about both businesses  let me begin by highlighting a few of the dynamics we see impacting our outlook before I go through the specific numbers  Starting with the positives  revenue passenger miles are projected to remain solid and grow over 4  in 2020 which will continue to support growth in the underlying aftermarket demand in both Pratt   Whitney and Collins Aerospace I d say  we also have clear line of sight to continued growth at our military businesses driven by higher F135 engines and F35 system content as well as strong aftermarket demand across key programs including the F117  F119 and F35 programs  And lastly  we will see continued synergy benefits at Collins Aerospace as they enter year two as a combined entity  We expect to capture approximately  150 million of incremental cost synergies from the Rockwell acquisition and that s on top of the  300 million that we realized in 2019 On the challenges side of the equation  no surprises here  we anticipate headwinds at Collins Aerospace  driven by the suspension of the 737 MAX production as well as an expected decline in volume associated with the ADS B mandate as the deadline for compliance in the US with the end of 2019  We do see some ADS B demand in 2020 driven by the mid year European deadline  but substantially less than levels we saw last year So turning to slide 9  you will see the 2020 segment outlooks for both Pratt   Whitney and Collins Aerospace  As usual  the appendix has a detailed sales and operating profit walk for both businesses  At a high level  we generally see these outlooks in line with our S 4 projections excluding the impact of the suspension of the 737 MAX production  the expected impact of divestitures associated with the merger with Raytheon as well as cost to achieve synergies at Collins Aerospace Okay  Starting with Pratt   Whitney and the outlook there  We expect mid single digit sales growth in 2020  organically commercial OE will be up high single digit as GTF volumes will continue to ramp and we expect to see higher Pratt   Whitney Canada OEM sales driven by business jet and helicoptered engine shipments  Commercial aftermarket is expected to grow low to mid single digits  primarily driven by continued V2500 growth and GTF activity  partially offset by declines in the legacy engines  The military business will continue to see benefits from higher F135 engine shipments and continued aftermarket demand that is expected to grow mid single digit On the profit side  we expect Pratt s operating profit to increase  225 million to  275 million driven by drop through on the higher commercial aftermarket and military sales  Commercial OE profit is expected to be flat year over year So now turning to Collins Aerospace  Reported sales are expected to be down low single digit  including approximately 5 points of headwind due to the suspension of the 737 MAX production  lower ADS B mandate volume and the divestitures that I just mentioned  Organically  commercial OEM sales will be down mid single digit as declines in the 737 MAX and legacy programs more than offset the ramp of other new programs Commercial aftermarket is expected to be up slightly and within the commercial aftermarket  provisioning is expected to be down mid single digits after being up over 20  organically in 2019  Military sales will be up mid single digit and continued strength in the military end markets  Operating profit for Collins Aerospace will be down  275 million to  325 million versus 2019  including approximately  550 million to  600 million of combined headwinds due to the 737 MAX  the ADS B mandate and the required divestitures These headwinds are partially offset by drop through on higher military sales and the  150 million of incremental cost synergies I referenced earlier  Lastly  before I hand it back over to Greg  just a few comments as you think about UTC in the first quarter prior to the spins and merger  Starting with sales  We expect Q1 2020 reported sales to be up slightly versus the prior year  We expect low to mid single digit growth at the aerospace businesses despite the 737 MAX headwind and this growth will be partially offset by Carrier  which is expected to be down driven by tough first half compares for the refrigeration business and some FX headwind On the earnings front for Q1  at the segment level  we expect operating profit to be flat  including the 737 MAX and ADS B headwind as well as some incremental costs at Otis and Carrier as each business staffs to be a stand alone entity  Below the line  we see a few moving pieces  First  we have some FX pressure due to the portfolio separation  interest expense and other corporate costs which accounts for around  0 10 of headwind and second  non service pension income will be lower by  0 03 driven by the discount rate impact we discussed last quarter In addition  the absence of a prior year tax gain  which you will recall was related to the legacy BE business as well as higher minority interest adds another  0 06 of pressure and finally share count will be higher than last year  On the cash front  we expect Q1 free cash flow to be an outflow and that s driven primarily by the approximately  1 6 billion of portfolio separation payments expected to occur in the first quarter So with that  I ll hand it back to Greg Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Thanks  Neil  So some moving pieces  as always  but really strong performance in 2019  excuse me  As we look to 2020  I would just remind everybody that the priorities of our businesses remain clear and consistent  We re focused on executing on our commitments to customers  driving growth through innovation  cost reduction and of course remaining disciplined in capital allocation  At the same time  we continue to monitor the macroeconomic environment  The US remain strong  Asia  of course  continues to grow but at a little bit slower rate and the Europe remains a watch item  Overall  the aerospace and defense end market remain robust and we feel very good about our ability to deliver in 2020  That said  we re also keeping our eye on the developing Coronavirus situation  any impacts that could have to all of our businesses And while 2020 marks the last chapter for United Technologies as it stands today  it also begins a bright future for Otis  Carrier and Raytheon Technologies as stand alone public companies  I m excited about the future of each of these businesses and I m confident of the teams that we put in place to drive sustainable long term value creation  that s going to benefit customers  employees  shareowners and our communities for decades to come With that  let s go ahead and open up the call for questions  Catherine Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  And our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research  Your line is open Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystThank you  Good morning  everyone Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Mr  Sprague Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystFeeling a little nostalgic here  This is the last call  But good run  Phonetic   Thank you Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  It s amazing  isn t it Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystYes  This is really    Greg  I was hoping you could unpack a little bit to some degree kind of the Collins Aerospace headwind between what is MAX  what is ADS B and what is tied to the divestitures and does that assume kind of a full year halt on production Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  So let s start with the 737 MAX that s probably the easiest part for everybody to understand  So we ve assumed roughly a 90 day production delay  which is consistent with the direction that we ve received from Boeing  So if you re thinking about that each month  if you add up both the OEM  the aftermarket provisioning that you re not going to get  costs you about  100 million in revenue and about half of that in operating profit and a big chunk of that operating profit is coming from lack of absorption in our factories  So think about  100 million over three months  that s  300 million of sales plus about  150 million of op profit and then in the back half of the year  we ve essentially cut production in half from the rate that we had  so from 42 to 21  Phonetic   So you can double that in the back half of the year and you get roughly  600 million and  300 million We ve also  in the guidance added in some monies for some supplier disruption  So we think  overall  the impact could be somewhere between  350 million and  375 million to the year  I hope that s conservative  we hope  but again the reduction resumes more quickly  but as we sit here today  That s the best outlook that we can give you  The ADS B mandate  I think we ve taken you through that number before and again it s a    north of  100 million of earnings that will go away and the other big piece of course is the divestitures So two divestitures  one was the military GPS business at Rockwell    legacy Rockwell Collins out in Cedar Rapids  that s a great business  As you guys saw  BAE brought that or signed a contract to buy that  That will close sometime we think in the back half of the year and then on top of that  our business in Danbury  Connecticut  our ISR business  military optics  space optics that will also will probably sign here in the next couple of months and that will also close in the back half of the year  So that s the additional headwind that we see both on top line and bottom line  So you are only going to see about six months impact from the divestitures this year You ll see a full year obviously next year  Obviously  the good news is  we ll get another shot at this guidance in probably May  Once we close with Raytheon  we ll come back in early May  probably a month after the merger and give you full year guidance for RTX and give you an update on the MAX and everything else that s going on Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystAnd just one more and I ll pass it on  What was the MAX impact in the fourth quarter Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt was    it really was not significant  Again  we were    Boeing was still taking at a rate of 42  Phonetic   again  our original guidance had assumed  it was going to be 56  Phonetic   I think  So there was a little bit of an impact  you can do the math  but it wasn t significant  And most of that was made up by additional aftermarket in the other    for the other aircraft that are flying Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystGreat  Thank you  Good luck with everything Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Jeff OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies  Your line is open Sheila Kahyaoglu    Jefferies    AnalystGood morning  Thank you  Greg Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi  Sheila Sheila Kahyaoglu    Jefferies    AnalystJust to continue on the MAX  This has been a pretty favorable environment for the GTF in general  And Airbus recently announced the new allocation between CFM and Pratt with a higher share for CFM  So I guess  when we think about GTF  how does that change that trajectory in terms of production  How do we think about annualized losses  You mentioned was there    are there other opportunities to take some share Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo  let me just put GTF in perspective  I think I mentioned it as we started  We ve got about 10 000 GTF engines in backlog and as a program to date  we ve got about 40  share on the A320 family  Higher share on the A321 than on the A319 and 320  If you think about it in the last 12 months  we ve won about 50  of the orders that are out there  We just announced Wizz Air  obviously  I think that came out yesterday  As you think about it going forward  I think the opportunity is even better for GTF  as you think about the XLR  the long range version of the A321  that requires a higher thrust engine  which will be able to deliver for Airbus and for their customers  And again  we think more production going to the higher ends  even the    just the basic A321 where Pratt is  got probably a stronger offering Having said that  we are  I would say production constrained in terms of how many engines that we can build  I think loss provisions last year were about the same as the year before about  1 1 billion or so  We expect that number will probably continue at this rate  Cost came down roughly 8  to 10  last year  We ll continue to take cost out  but we re trying to be judicious in terms of which customers we choose and which customers we elect not to make offerings to  You ll note in the    in the discussion before  there were some contract adjustments at Pratt in the quarter that obviously relates to some of the durability issues that we ve seen on the GTF  specifically in some of those very difficult operating environments  But again very  very good performance and a very good future I think for GTF Sheila Kahyaoglu    Jefferies    AnalystThank you Neil G  Mitchill    Acting Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Greg  Jeff  Phonetic     Greg  I will add a comment to that on production  Sheila  the numbers that you ll see in our external documents here  our combined GTF and V2500 obviously the legacy engines production is coming down substantially  If I look at the production sequentially Q3 to Q4 on the GTF  it was up over 30  on a full year basis about 20  and we d expect that same kind of rate going into 2020  So the numbers you see are aggregated  but we re supporting Airbus in 2019 and we re aligned with them in 2020 to deliver the engines for their airplanes Sheila Kahyaoglu    Jefferies    AnalystGreat  Thanks OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan  Your line is open Steve Tusa    JP Morgan    AnalystGood morning  guys Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Steve Steve Tusa    JP Morgan    AnalystEcho Jeff s comments  This is kind of a silly question  but have you guys gone back and looked at what possibly kind of could happen here with air traffic  I know it s early on with this whole virus thing  but just looking back at past events like this  what the risk    kind of frame the risk around that Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Steve  we actually    we obviously went back and took a look at 2003 and the impact of the SARS virus  and as you ll recall  air traffic slowed down significantly for about three months and really  there was about a six month impact overall in the aftermarket  I would say  there are two major differences today  One is the airlines are a hell of a lot healthier than they were in  03  You were coming off of 9 11 and airline bankruptcies and nobody had any money  The fact is air traffic remains pretty strong  but there will be a blip in Asia this quarter as a result of this The second thing is the flu  it happens every year  I just    we went back and we re looking at the last full flu season  we had 960 000 people in the US were hospitalized with the flu and 80 000 people passed away  So as we think about this  you got to keep it in perspective  it s a big deal  obviously until they get it contained  But the Chinese government  I think is doing a much better job today in terms of being proactive in containing this and while we expect there will be some impact on the commercial aftermarket  we don t expect it will be significant  I think back in 2003  we saw about a 20  drop in the aftermarket for that    for two quarters  I don t expect  it s going to be that bad this time Steve Tusa    JP Morgan    AnalystRight  And then just last    one last one on the math here  When you look at the kind of  8 billion plus cash target  obviously this is somewhat temporary  you guys seem to make  obviously a lot of money on or what you re supplying to them  So it s a little bit different than engines  where you might be loss making  so lack of deliveries would be kind of a positive from that perspective  but    and any    any change to kind of that  8 billion target in kind of that  21 time period from   Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo  So look  there is clearly a cash impact this year  it was probably in the    let s call it  400 million range at Collins Aerospace and I would tell you  that s within the    that s contemplated in our overall guidance for the year  It s not going to change the  8 billion target and again  it is temporary  Next year  I think that as MAX production ramps back up  that abates  So I think again  it s a one time issue and part of it  of course  as you know  see  we re trying to keep the supply chain going a little bit here and anytime you have these production disruptions  you always worry about the supply chain and some of the smaller suppliers out there  So Collins is doing the right thing here  trying to manage that proactively  so that we don t have a problem as we start to line back up with suppliers who can t meet the new demand Steve Tusa    JP Morgan    AnalystRight  Okay  great  Great color  Thanks a lot  I appreciate it Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Thanks  Steve OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research  Your line is open Carter Copeland    Melius Research    AnalystGood morning  gentlemen Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Carter Neil G  Mitchill    Acting Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Carter Copeland    Melius Research    AnalystGreg  I wondered  if you might expand  just quickly to clarify on that cash impact that s    how much of that is payments to suppliers versus inventory you may build that s higher than the rate just to keep the production healthy Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  you can do the math on terms of the lost sales  right  We re talking about  600 million roughly for the year  So most of that is going to be cash  we re not seeing from suppliers    from our customer  but there is a small piece of that    look we    Collins folks have identified as going to the supply chain  It s not  we re not talking hundreds of millions of dollars here  we re talking probably less than  100 million  Phonetic  Carter Copeland    Melius Research    AnalystYeah  So it sounds like you re not planning on building inventory in any substantial amount above whatever the agreed upon rate is Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So it will be  I would say more surgical than just we re going to bring all the inventory  We re going to do    we re going to bring inventory where we need to  So the other opportunity here is  to the extent that we were behind on certain programs  Collins does have a pretty significant backlog of things that they can work on  There is still disruption costs in the factory as you could imagine and absorption issues  but we think  we ve captured all of that in the guidance numbers here Carter Copeland    Melius Research    AnalystAnd do you have any  just as a final point  do you have any cost actions built into that or what not  are you basically just going to eat the stranded cost Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI believe    we do not anticipate any lay off  I think that would be the easiest thing to do  but quite frankly  given the scarcity of talented aerospace workers out there  We re not going to be laying anybody off for a 90 day delay here  I think  we re going to work on the backlog  We ll try and keep everybody busy  but it just doesn t make sense to lay people off for 90 days and try and bring them back  There is probably some offset here and again on the aftermarket    haven t really been able to quantify what that is  given the kind of the late breaking nature of this change  But there s probably some upside in the aftermarket from what    what we ve got baked into the guidance today  But we ll see what    how that whole thing shakes out as the year progresses Carter Copeland    Melius Research    AnalystGreat  Thanks  Greg Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Carter OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America  Your line is open Ronald Epstein    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHey  Greg  good morning Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Ron Ronald Epstein    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystCould you walk through some of the kind of where we stand on the durability issues on the GTF  you alluded to it being challenged in some of the more    by this challenging operating environments  but like where do we stand  What s going on and how should we think about it Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo I think  let me just categorize  There is no new durability issues on the GTF  We ve had three issues that we ve identified over the last couple of years that have required retrofits  The biggest issue today is on the third turbine blade    third stage turbine blade  This was a problem or an issue that we identified early on in the program  originally that blade was made of a titanium aluminum material which proved to be way too fragile for the operating environment  And so  we ve moved to a nickel based alloy  That change was made a couple of years ago  All the new engines have the upgraded blade  Unfortunately  some of the issue or some of the early engines  especially those in India that s in Indigo and GoAir  and some of the other Asian operators still have the older blades in there As you can get fired  Phonetic  through the engines  this blade tends to fracture and causes in flight shut down  So in a    I would say  to be very cautious focus on safety first  we re doing some accelerated inspections and accelerated retrofit to get this older design blade out of the market or out of the    out of the fleet  So that will    it will happen mostly in India in the first half of the year  again in very difficult operating environments and we re monitoring that around the rest of the world  but probably all of that    the retrofits going to take through the end of this year to get complete The two other issues that we ve always talked about  one was the auxiliary gearbox  where we had a gear that needed to be replaced  We are getting some resonance and some early fatigue on that  that retrofit is under way  And lastly  of course  the combustor liner  which again has been a problem since the get go  especially in these difficult operating environments  given the temperature that this operates at  So that will  again we ve got a retrofit program in place for that    the latest version of the combustor the DE  Phonetic  will be out sometime in the    in June timeframe this year  so we ll be retrofitting that So no new issues  but I ll tell you  it s causing out of the operators  pain  especially in India and China  and again some of these more difficult operating environment  So as a result of that  again  we re trying to be very cautious here  We don t want to put anybody to risk  So a lot of inspections  a lot of time on wing  and a lot of time out there trying to get all of this fleet upgraded and it s just going to take us  probably through the first half of this year to get most of that work done Ronald Epstein    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  great  So you expect to get it mostly done through the first half there  Super  Great  Thanks Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Ron OperatorOur next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays  Your line is open Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystHi  Good morning Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Julian Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystGood morning  Just a question around Pratt  so you do have those legacy programs weighing on the aftermarket growth  maybe just help us understand what headwind do you have dialing in for legacy aftermarket sales declines in 2020 and what the scale of that legacy piece now is within Pratt  And then perhaps  switching text slightly within Collins Aerospace  maybe give any color around the cadence of organic sales as we go through the year  please  within that down slightly guide how we think about first half  second half Neil G  Mitchill    Acting Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerJulian  thanks  It s Neil  Just a couple of comments on the Pratt aftermarket  clearly the legacy programs are starting to trail off  but there is still a pretty substantial part of the profit going forward in Pratt  We ve had some headwinds  we talked about that earlier this year and some contract adjustments  But I think about the V though  when we came out of the fourth quarter here  very strong inductions and so we saw about a 6  increase quarter over quarter in induction activity on the V  We re well capacitized to deal with that level of inductions through 2020 and we d expect the underlying demand to be there Keep in mind though in order to overhaul an engine  it needs to come off of the wing and with the 737 MAX situation  the legacy planes are flying quite a bit more  And so    and we ve seen good durability on the V2500  That said  still expecting to see growth there  The network is    recovered from the early blips that we had in 2019  So I think  well positioned for 2020 on the aftermarket side at Pratt  As for the Collins organic growth  I think  we ll expect to see that fairly ratable through the year  What I would say is that the first quarter will hurt a bit more from the 737 MAX headwind that we just talked about  and you will recall that the first quarter of 2019 for Collins was exceptionally strong  especially given the Rockwell post merger activity Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystGreat  thank you Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYou re welcome OperatorOur next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird  Your line is open Peter Arment    Robert W  Baird    AnalystThanks  Good morning  Greg  Neil Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Peter Peter Arment    Robert W  Baird    AnalystJust you had some acquired divestitures with the Collins GPS and I guess  the optics business  I think you mentioned regarding that    that s going to still be closed to  you re assuming of    what about other divestiture activity  Just given the    the merger with Raytheon  are you thinking about other things or should we expect other actions going forward Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI m not going to announce anything today  Peter  But let me tell you  I don t want to get ahead of myself here  but I think  it s clear  when we get    when we complete the merger with Raytheon  we re going to have a fairly substantial portfolio  And I think  as we typically would do at UTC  we re going to take a look at that portfolio and quite frankly  some of it is investable and some of it probably is not  but I think  we will take the first year  Mike Dumais  who heads up our strategy group here  he and I will go through the portfolio on both sides of the business  And I think there ll be places where we might elect not to invest and to cash out in other places where we may want to double down  But right now  I can t tell you what that s going to be other than the fact that we re going to  as we typically do here  we will take a dispassionate look at the whole portfolio and figure out where we think  we can really add value over the long term and where we can t Peter Arment    Robert W  Baird    AnalystI appreciate that  And just if I could just ask one follow up quickly on the GTF  Greg  are you changing the cash profile of that outlook just given some of these durability issues or is that still kind of tracking to what you originally said back   Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo  it s    we talked about the charge we took in the fourth quarter  impacted the aftermarket because of some of these durability issues  But again  it doesn t change the overall    the overall return on the program or the cash outlook Peter Arment    Robert W  Baird    AnalystI appreciate the color  Thanks  Greg Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Peter OperatorOur next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research  Your line is open Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystThanks  good morning Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Nigel Neil G  Mitchill    Acting Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystGreg  congratulations on getting this piece to the finish line   Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAlmost there Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystSo I just wanted to ask my first question on the Collins EBIT this quarter  Obviously fully in line with your guidance  but a big step down from the  1 1 billion to  1 2 billion run rate through to 2019  So I m just curious  is that normal seasonality for Collins as is now or was there a mix differential  Anything    any color there Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Look there is a lot of moving pieces there  I think obviously the aftermarket was still strong  but you also had some OEM headwinds in the quarter and some additional E D spend  which impacted the quarter  a little more than normal  Keep in mind also as we picked up the last five weeks of Collins last year that was a very  very strong five weeks of activity as you can imagine in any of these acquisitions  So I wouldn t draw any conclusions from the fourth quarter compared to Collins  I mean the business is doing great   300 million of cost synergies  Overall  the aftermarket for the year was up what 14  with 20  growth in provisioning  So it s just a solid quarter and again  no drama there Neil G  Mitchill    Acting Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI fully agree with that  It was I would say characterization of OE deliveries from Q4  We see some of that coming back in Q1  So nothing abnormal in the results  they re very strong Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystThanks  But they re very helpful  And then Neil  a quick follow on to you  You provided some  I know that    I know Otis and Carrier guidance will be in two weeks time but you provided some elements of guidance of the outlook for 2024 for the commercial businesses  Can you just remind us on that  I didn t catch all the elements that I think you said flat while profit but maybe I m confused there Neil G  Mitchill    Acting Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAll I was talking about there was with respect to the first quarter  So we do expect Carrier to be down a little bit on the sales  that s a headwind we expected because of the transport refrigeration headwind and some foreign currency headwind on the sales side  We also have a couple of some cost coming through in the first quarter  Now that these two businesses are operating separately  There are costs embedded in their stand alone business right now that are not incremental to the combined UTC and so they won t be measured out  So we have a little bit of headwind there  but that s as expected because we re ready to turn them on to be stand alone companies Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  just remember  Nigel  We always thought just probably about  300 million of annual cost that the businesses have added between the two of them for stand alone public company costs  And that of course  on a year over year basis will be headwind here in the first quarter is  I think both Judy and Dave have done most of the staffing  I think we re over 90  in fact of what we have expected  needed to be added to these businesses  So  it s a    it s just a funky quarter with all of these transition costs  some of it    we will identify them when we re done with the quarter  but it s just  it s going to be a little choppy Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystGreat  Thanks  guys and good luck Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Neil G  Mitchill    Acting Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorNext question is from Myles Walton with UBS  Your line is open Myles Walton    UBS    AnalystThanks  Good morning Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Myles Walton    UBS    AnalystI think the last six or seven quarters  you ve done much restructuring in at Pratt and obviously a big tick up here in the fourth quarter  So maybe  was there something you saw there that you re taking action that you had  had an opportunity to do previously  And then  as you look out over the next year not considering the kind of the integration  which sounds like you re going to keep the two businesses relatively separate with Raytheon  but what s the outlook for opportunity at both    at both Collins Aerospace as well as Pratt Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo at Pratt  in the fourth quarter  we had a early retirement program which was I would say well received and frankly for the last five years as we ve ramped up GTF production at Pratt  we have added a tremendous amount to the workforce in the back office to support procurement and quality manufacturing  etc  And as Chris Calio is taking over there  we decided that it was time probably to turn this    that spicket off and take some and get some efficiencies in the overhead pools  So we ve taken out over 1 000 people through the early retirement program and obviously  the payback is phenomenal on that    that s in fact what s driving a big chunk of Pratt growth next year  is that restructuring There remains other opportunities  And I think  we will get an opportunity later this year to have Mr  Calio and Mr  Ortberg  take you guys through some of the opportunities they have  Chris is looking at    at a restructuring of some of the other manufacturing operations there  There will be other things that we can do  I think to drive efficiency at Pratt  Collins is    I think Neil mentioned  we expect another  150 million of cost synergies this year  that s going to slow down a little bit  but there are still  I would say  lots of opportunities in the facility side that Kelly and team continue to look at So even though we haven t done a lot in the last I d say six quarters  We haven t forgotten how to do this  I would tell you also Carrier over the course of the last year did a lot of restructuring  I think  that took out about 1300 indirect heads during the year  So we haven t forgotten our roots on cost reduction  We re just trying to be judicious with the aerospace sales up like they have been for the last couple of years  there just hasn t been as much opportunity  but we certainly see more on the horizon Myles Walton    UBS    AnalystOkay  And just one clarification  the GTF manufacturing and delivery profiles of the last year  has that changed significantly in terms of your outlook or is it roughly the same Neil G  Mitchill    Acting Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  I d say  it s roughly the same Myles Walton    UBS    AnalystOkay  Thank you Neil G  Mitchill    Acting Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYou re welcome OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse  Your line is open Robert Spingarn    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  Good morning Neil G  Mitchill    Acting Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Robert Spingarn    Credit Suisse    AnalystI wanted to follow up on the question on the Collins cadence from a couple of minutes ago and focusing on the interiors business  We don t talk about it a lot  but given that it s a discretionary driven business  it behaves differently than the others  I wanted to see how that was trending at the back end of  19 and what you re expecting there in 2020 Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think  I would tell you that the interiors business  first half of last year and even back in 2018  it was not doing as well as what we had hoped  But they have really picked up the cadence here in the back half and very strong backlog  They ve got some new products out there  both on the economy  and economy plus as well as in the business class seating  and they ve got a very strong backlog  So if anything  I would expect there s some pretty decent growth coming out of the interiors business this year Robert Spingarn    Credit Suisse    Analyst Speech Overlap  Neil  I m sorry Neil G  Mitchill    Acting Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI was just going to say  the interiors business was a major part of our parts and repair performance in the fourth quarter  So they are performing quite well Robert Spingarn    Credit Suisse    AnalystDoes the pressure from MAX on the airlines interfere with that discretionary spend or is the idea that that s really narrow body carriers really doesn t influence what is otherwise a wide body business Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  just to be clear  we still supply a lot of I would say economy  economy plus seating in the narrow body sector  Now we haven t seen a big impact this past year  of course because Boeing was still building the aircraft and still doing    fitting out the interiors  And keep in mind  it s more than just seating  It s also all the galleys  where we ve got pretty good share as well  So when we think about that  we ve talked about  100 million of sales a month  a chunk of that will come out of the interiors business here in the first few months as Boeing has this production pause  But beyond that  the backlog still remains very robust  We ve continued to add there folks both in the Philippines  at our factory there as well as down in Winston Salem  So  I would say  that business has turned around nicely Robert Spingarn    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay  Thank you very much OperatorThank you  And our last question comes from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen  Your line is open Cai Von Rumohr    Cowen and Company    AnalystYes  thank you very much  I think  I followed UTC longer than most  So Greg  you mentioned on the MAX that the 90 day suspension and then you re going to 21  Phonetic  in the second half  is that based on your estimate or with some rough guidance from Boeing Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI would say that we have been in constant contact with Boeing and so this is our best guess  I would say  educated guess and working with Boeing about what that production pause will look like  Obviously  I mean  we re working with them on the software elements of this  but we think this is a    the most reasonable view we could have in terms of what the impact will be to the year  If it s better  you guys will certainly see it  but for right now  we think that s what it s going to be Cai Von Rumohr    Cowen and Company    AnalystBut you mentioned that you don t plan on laying anyone off for 90 days  but it isn t really 90 days  because your production rate in the second half by your assumption is going to be down 50   So could this very high drop through of the decremental volume be lower  I mean at some point  are you going to think of laying some people off  given  this goes for more than nine months Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  keep in mind  Cai  This    if you think about Collins   26 billion in revenue last year  You ve got a lot of other programs out there  you ve got growing demand on the military side  you ve got backlog in wheels and brakes and many other parts of the business  So will we work some less over time  probably  but are we going to lay people off because of this  No  I think again  it s just  it hurts on the absorption front  but it s not significant in terms of the overall Collins business Cai Von Rumohr    Cowen and Company    AnalystOkay  terrific  Thank you Gregory J  Hayes    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Cai  So we want to thank everybody for listening today  I know it s a busy earnings day  This will be the last earnings call for UTX  All things being equal  and we look forward to seeing everybody  talking to everybody with the completion of the merger and we wish our friends at Carrier and Otis very well  and thank everybody for listening today  Take care Operator

187175,408691,UTX,United Technologies Looks Like a Good Value  But Risk Is Rising,news,"The failure of an early return to service  RTS  of the Boeing  NYSE BA  737 MAX is starting to bite at aerospace suppliers  but for now  the market seems to be accepting it as a question of  when  not if   Indeed  the latest earnings report from industrial conglomerate United Technologies  NYSE UTX  and the market s reaction to it only served to enhance this perception  Let s take a look at what happened and what you need to know before you buy stock in United Technologies and or its future merger partner Raytheon  NYSE RTN  

Why Raytheon matters  too
In case you are wondering why I ve referenced Raytheon  it s simply because the company is set to merge with the aerospace businesses of United Technologies  UTC   namely Collins Aerospace  aerostructures  interior  avionics  and mechanical systems  and Pratt   Whitney  engines and aftermarket   Consequently  if you are buying Raytheon  you are de facto buying into the future prospects of United Technologies  aerospace businesses too 
United Technologies guidance 
It s an important point to consider when considering the guidance that UTC just gave for its aerospace businesses    guidance for Carrier  heating  ventilation  air conditioning  fire and security products  and refrigeration  and Otis  elevators  will be given on their respective investor meetings in February 
The table below shows the segment profit for the last couple of years and the implied guidance for the aerospace businesses in 2020  Interestingly  Otis and Carrier both delivered profits slightly ahead of the implied guidance given on the third quarter earnings call 

Data source  United Technologies   Rockwell Collins was acquired in 2019  
Pratt   Whitney on track
The company appears to be over the larger part of its technical issues on its all important geared turbofan  GTF  engine  one of two engine options on the Airbus A320 NEO   although UTC CEO Greg Hayes acknowledged Pratt would be retrofitting some components on the engine through 2020 
However  Pratt s profitability in 2020 will be a tale of two parts  On the commercial original equipment  OE  side profit is expected to be similar to 2019 as production of the GTF increases    aircraft engines are usually loss making with the real money made on the aftermarket revenue overtime  Instead  the commercial aftermarket  is expected to grow low  to mid single digits  primarily driven by continued V2500 growth and GTF activity  partially offset by declines in the legacy engines  according to UTC CFO Neil Mitchill on the earnings call  For reference  the V2500 is an engine used on the Airbus A320 family 
Collins Aerospace
Observant readers will note that Collins Aerospace operating profit is forecast to drop by  275 million to  325 million in 2020  The reason  Mitchill put it down to  approximately  550 million to  600 million of combined headwinds due to the 737 MAX  the ADS B mandate and the required divestitures  
Later on the earnings call  CEO Greg Hayes said the effect from the grounding  and subsequent production delay on the 737 MAX  to Collins Aerospace would be responsible for  somewhere between  350 million and  375 million to the year  with something  north of  100 million  from the ADS B effect  and the rest due to revenue lost from the divestiture of businesses  The ADS B effect is simply revenue that won t repeat in 2020  which comes from aircraft being mandated to have automatic dependent surveillance broadcast  or ADS B  technology equipped 
There s definitely going to be a negative effect from the 737 MAX grounding on Collins Aerospace s year  but Hayes is taking the view that the effect  is temporary  Next year  I think that as MAX production ramps back up  that abates  
In other words  once Boeing gets RTS on the 737 MAX and production increases again  Collins Aerospace will play catch up on lost revenue  Indeed  Hayes maintained guidance for  8 billion in free cash flow for Raytheon Technologies by 2021    implying the lost earnings cash flow in 2020 will be recovered next year  If so  then the company will look like a good value 
What are investors to make of it 
Clearly  United Technologies and Raytheon  by default  have become part of a growing list of industrial names whose profit outlook for the next year or so is somewhat dependent on a successful RTS for the 737 MAX  Moreover  the underlying assumption is that the supply chain around the 737 MAX will not develop any gremlins while the industry waits 
If these assumptions come true  then both stocks look like a good value  but it s hard to argue that the risk isn t rising with every passing month that RTS hasn t happened for the 737 MAX ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqvrb,2075378
187176,408692,UTX,United Technologies  UTX  Tops Q4 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"United Technologies  UTX  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 94 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 84 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 95 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5 43   A quarter ago  it was expected that this maker of elevators  jet engines and other products would post earnings of  2 03 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 21  delivering a surprise of 8 87  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
United Technologies  which belongs to the Zacks Diversified Operations industry  posted revenues of  19 55 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 66   This compares to year ago revenues of  18 04 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
United Technologies shares have added about 0 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 0 4  
What s Next for United Technologies 
While United Technologies has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for United Technologies was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 94 on  18 91 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  8 71 on  79 23 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Diversified Operations is currently in the bottom 22  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2020-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/united-technologies-utx-tops-q4-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200502272,200502272
187178,408694,UTX,Raytheon Shows Its Strength Heading Into United Technologies Deal,news,"Most of the attention surrounding Raytheon  NYSE RTN  right now is understandably related to its pending megamerger with the aerospace arm of United Technologies  NYSE UTX   But Raytheon  in what could be its final earnings report as an independent company  demonstrated the potential in its portfolio and gave investors plenty to get excited about heading into the merger 
Raytheon  unlike the other defense primes  is not focused on building large military platforms like tanks  ships  or planes  but rather specializes in missiles  space  cyber  electronics  and sensors  Raytheon has always been somewhat of a contrarian in the defense sector  and that will only increase when it combines with the commercial aerospace heavy UTC portfolio and becomes one of the most diverse large companies in the industry 
Here s a look at how Raytheon performed in the final three months of 2019  and what management had to say about the future 
A choppy quarter  with potential
On Jan  30  Raytheon reported fourth quarter earnings of  3 16 per share   0 04 ahead of consensus estimates  on revenue of  7 8 billion  about  200 million below expectations  For the year  the company reported earnings of  11 92 per share on revenue of  29 2 billion  up 17  and 7 8  year over year  respectively 
 Raytheon had a very successful year in 2019  and our global growth strategy is delivering record results for our shareholders   CEO Thomas A  Kennedy said during a post earnings call with investors  He added   Bottom line  we have a strong foundation for the future  

The quarter contained a lot of noise  Raytheon beat thanks to stronger than expected earnings from its integrated defense systems business  which specializes in air and missile defense  radars  and control systems  and its intelligence business  as well as a lower than expected tax rate  The company s space  missile  and Forcepoint cyber business all came in below expectations 
Missiles is Raytheon s largest business  but it registered just 1  sales growth for the quarter  and for the year saw its operating margin drop 70 basis points    that is  0 70 percentage points    to 11   Management blamed the sluggish sales on timing issues  with some purchases not happening as quickly as expected  implying the company should be able to register better growth in early 2020 
Raytheon generated  2 8 billion in operating cash flow for the quarter  more than  200 million better than guidance  primarily due to improved working capital  For the full year the company generated  4 5 billion in operating cash flow  compared to a pension adjusted  3 4 billion in 2018 
Sector best growth for 2020 
Where Raytheon stood out among defense stocks was in its outlook for 2020  Raytheon had record bookings of  12 1 billion in the fourth quarter  resulting in a sector best book to bill ratio of 1 54  over 1 means more orders are coming in than being fulfilled  a sign of strong demand   Full year 2019 bookings were  36 3 billion  while its backlog stood at a record  48 8 billion at year s end  an increase of 15  in 12 months 
Raytheon guided for 6  to 8  revenue growth in 2020  a couple of percentage points better than what rivals Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman expect  And the company should be able to translate that revenue growth into better earnings  since it expects the bulk of growth to come from space and integrated defense  its two highest margin businesses 

The company registered strong sales in classified areas  achieving  8 billion in classified bookings for the full year  including more than  2 billion apiece in intelligence and space  While it is impossible to say what exactly that work entails  classified projects tend to be higher margin contracts 
Raytheon also continues to be the defense prime with the most foreign exposure  providing a nice hedge to potential U S  budget battles or election year pressures  International sales were  8 6 billion for the year  or nearly 30  of the company s total revenue 
Buy with confidence
I was hesitant to buy into Raytheon after its planned merger with United Technologies was announced  fearful that due to the all stock nature of the deal Raytheon shares would be tied to the non aerospace businesses UTC intends to spin off before the transaction is complete  As the closing date nears  I see no reason not to buy in now 
Raytheon and UTC hope to create the new Raytheon Technologies in April  so it s possible this is the last Raytheon standalone earnings report we will get 
If so  the company used the release to make its case as a defense prime well positioned in areas like missiles  missile defense  and high tech sensors that are key to the Pentagon s future strategy and should command strong margins throughout the budget cycle  Raytheon also is strong in areas that are in need of immediate attention to address potential flareups in the Middle East 
The new Raytheon Technologies will have the revenue diversity to lean on defense when commercial aerospace issues like Boeing s 737 MAX grounding arise  and to lean on commercial and international sales when the Pentagon budget is under pressure  Raytheon s fourth quarter results give investors every reason to be excited about the combination ",2020-02-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/prycv,2077818

187204,408720,UTX,ORKLY Vs  UTX  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Diversified Operations sector have probably already heard of Orkla Asa  ORKLY  and United Technologies  UTX   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Both Orkla Asa and United Technologies have a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
ORKLY currently has a forward P E ratio of 2 45  while UTX has a forward P E of 17 66  We also note that ORKLY has a PEG ratio of 0 72  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  UTX currently has a PEG ratio of 2 01 
Another notable valuation metric for ORKLY is its P B ratio of 2 45  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  UTX has a P B of 2 90 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to ORKLY s Value grade of B and UTX s Value grade of C 
Both ORKLY and UTX are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that ORKLY is the superior value option right now ",2019-12-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/orkly-vs-utx-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200490000,200490000

and American Water Works Company  Inc    NYSE AWK   Buy These 5 Stocks with Attractive Sales GrowthA healthy business with steady sales growth is the key to survival in today s fast changing and highly competitive operating environment  As such  higher revenues are necessary to drive growth  and most companies look for a strong relationship between sales growth levels and the value of an enterprise Revenues are income generated by a company through business activities  Though a company might not be profitable over a particular time period  it usually generates revenues unless there are unforeseen situations In cases when companies tend to incur loss on a temporary basis  they are valued on the basis of revenues and not earnings  This is because sales growth  or decline  is usually an early indicator of the company s future performance The Price to Sales  P S  ratio takes into account a company s revenues while valuing it  The ratio remains a key stock selection criterion as management usually has limited opportunities to fiddle with revenues as it can with earnings  Thus  the P S ratio is subject to lower manipulation than the Price to Earnings ratio   While sales growth is an important metric for any corporate for the purpose of growth projections and strategic decision making  this in isolation doesn t indicate much about a company s future performance  Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  a huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits So  a consideration of a company s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Most importantly  an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at Disclosure

187213,408729,UTX,Here s Why United Technologies Rocketed Higher in 2019,news,"What happened
Shares in industrial conglomerate United Technologies  NYSE UTX  rose 40 6  in 2019  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence  There are two reasons for the increase  operational performance and the announcement of a deal to merge the aerospace business  Pratt   Whitney and Collins Aerospace  with defense company Raytheon  NYSE RTN   I ll briefly discuss both in turn 
It s been a mixed year for this large and diverse company  A look back at its third quarter earnings report shows that the aerospace businesses have outperformed in 2019  Pratt   Whitney is on track to do slightly better than management expected at the start of the year  and Collins Aerospace has outperformed due to a buoyant aerospace market  aftermarket  defense  and original equipment  and the successful integration of the Rockwell Collins acquisition 

So what
The elevators business  Otis  is doing slightly better than management originally expected at the start of the year  and the company appears to be growing new equipment orders again in the crucial China market    a key part of its plan to win market share and then generate highly profitable services revenue over the long term 
The one major disappointment has come from Carrier  air conditioning  fire security  and safety products   where management has shifted the midpoint of its full year operating profit guidance from an increase of  125 million  given in January  to a decline of  125 million  updated in October  due to weakness in transport refrigeration and residential heating  ventilation  and air conditioning 
Frankly  Carrier has underperformed its peers on a revenue and margin basis for a while  and there s a case for arguing that it could be the biggest beneficiary of the plan to split United Technologies up into three companies    the aerospace business will merge with Raytheon after Otis and Carrier are separately spun off 
Turning to the plan to merge the aerospace businesses with Raytheon  it appears that the market has warmed to the idea  This was no easy task for management to accomplish after hedge funds began bleating about it after it was announced  If the stock price is the ultimate arbiter  it seems that United Technologies management was right and the hedge funds were wrong 
Moreover  despite the rise  the market still appears to be undervaluing the proposed deal  You can get an idea of how the market is valuing the proposed new company  to be called Raytheon Technologies  by looking at Raytheon s current market valuation  An analysis of the deal suggests that the market is still undervaluing  Raytheon Technologies  relative to its peer group  and consequently  both stocks look like a good value 
Now what
Investors will be hoping for a smooth 2020 as Otis and Carrier are spun off and the Raytheon merger then takes place  United Technologies management has a good track record of integrating major companies    Goodrich and Rockwell Collins are both outperforming management s initial targets for cost savings     and investors can look forward to the creation of Raytheon Technologies with a sense of optimism ",2020-01-13,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/phehj,2058077
187222,408738,UTX,ORKLY Vs  UTX  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Diversified Operations stocks have likely encountered both Orkla Asa  ORKLY  and United Technologies  UTX   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Currently  Orkla Asa has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while United Technologies has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This means that ORKLY s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
ORKLY currently has a forward P E ratio of 2 37  while UTX has a forward P E of 18 26  We also note that ORKLY has a PEG ratio of 0 70  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  UTX currently has a PEG ratio of 2 08 
Another notable valuation metric for ORKLY is its P B ratio of 2 37  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  UTX has a P B of 2 99 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to ORKLY s Value grade of B and UTX s Value grade of C 
ORKLY stands above UTX thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that ORKLY is the superior value option right now ",2019-11-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/orkly-vs-utx-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200484993,200484993

NEW DELHI  Reuters    IndiGo   NS INGL  must replace all Pratt   Whitney  P W  engines on its fleet of 97 twin engined Airbus A320neo family aircraft with new P W power units  India s air safety watchdog said on Friday following recent inflight engine shutdowns 
The incidents have caused  serious concern  and the decision to order the engines be replaced was taken after  considerable deliberations   the Directorate General of Civil Aviation  DGCA  said in a statement 
 You will appreciate that four successive events have not happened ever before and therefore  we call for urgent and effective action  We regret the inconvenience but we need desperate measures to put things in order   the DGCA said 
 This situation cannot be allowed to go on indefinitely   it said  adding that the engines would need to be replaced by Jan  31  2020 
IndiGo is Airbus   PA AIR  biggest client for A320neo planes 
While the United Technologies   N UTX  Pratt   Whitney engines are fuel efficient there have been issues since they entered into service in 2016  forcing the airline to ground its planes several times 
The groundings have cost IndiGo  which last month posted its biggest ever quarterly loss after being forced to lease aircraft to replace planes grounded with engine issues

187263,408779,UTX,Why United Technologies  UTX  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
United Technologies in Focus
Headquartered in Farmington  United Technologies  UTX  is a Conglomerates stock that has seen a price change of 28 09  so far this year  The maker of elevators  jet engines and other products is paying out a dividend of  0 74 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 16  compared to the Diversified Operations industry s yield of 1 4  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 91  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 94 is up 3 7  from last year  In the past five year period  United Technologies has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 4 26   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  United Technologies s current payout ratio is 37   This means it paid out 37  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for UTX for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  8 03 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 5 52  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that UTX is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-09-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-united-technologies-utx-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200469197,200469197

could get a deal faster has been launched  the sources said  They said it would take at least until early 2020 to launch an IPO and a listing would only produce the best valuation in the right market environment   something that Kerkhoff cannot count on  Kerkhoff said earlier this month that management would look at concrete offers and make a decision based on what is best for the group  its shareholders and the division   To rebuild the company you need cash   said Tomas Johansson  portfolio manager at SKAGEN Funds   Everyone knows that Thyssenkrupp needs to sell elevators  That s seldom the best time to do a transaction but they have no choice   Thyssenkrupp  whose roots go back more than two centuries  has been under pressure for years from shareholders   especially its second largest  Cevian Capital   to simplify its sprawling empire which includes subsidiaries making elevators  steel  car parts  warships  chemical plants and submarines  The conglomerate s complex mix of disparate assets   449 companies in 78 countries   is the result of efforts to diversify beyond steel making through acquisitions and mergers  leaving the company hard to manage  Efforts to slim down its portfolio suffered a setback when a proposed merger of its steel making operations with Tata Steel s  NS TISC  European divisions failed in May in the face of more demands from European antitrust regulators for concessions  When the steel merger collapsed  Kerkhoff announced the plan to list ET  the world s fourth biggest lift maker  and explore new ownership structures for some of its remaining units  including materials trading and plant engineering  Initially welcomed by investors  doubts about the viability and effectiveness of Kerkhoff s plan have intensified as he struggles to stop what he calls  the bleeding  of cash  At the moment  the group is losing 2 7 million euros   3 million  of cash a day and will probably be kicked out of Germany s blue chip index next month  Its debt is now deeper in junk territory following more downgrades this month from ratings agencies S P and Moody s  Thyssenkrupp s shares are trading near 16 year lows and its gearing stood at a staggering 204 5  at the end of June   meaning its net debt was twice as high as its total equity   all of which puts pressure on Kerkhoff to restructure quickly    GRAPHIC Rocky year for Thyssenkrupp shares link    BULLSEYE NEEDED As part of the elevator sale process  which kicks off in the fall  Kerkhoff has reached out to private equity firms to discuss offers  the sources said  Potential bidders include KKR  N KKR   CVC  Advent  Apollo  N APO   EQT  as well as Finnish elevator rival Kone  HE KNEBV   among others  First round bids for the lift division  which is valued at anywhere from 12 billion to 17 billion euros  are expected in November with final offers due in January  one of the sources said  Thyssenkrupp declined to comment on expected valuations or a timeline for any sale process  The advantage of an outright sale to private equity firms   some of which are forming consortia to bid   is that a deal could be faster than an IPO and less exposed to the vagaries of the stock market  two people familiar with the matter said  But private equity firms would probably demand outright control of the asset  forcing Kerkhoff to draw up a new business model for Thyssenkrupp without its elevator business  One person also said the market s lack of confidence in Thyssenkrupp s management would make it unlikely that the company would be allowed to retain a significant stake  Thyssenkrupp wants to  maximize value while minimizing execution risks   a separate source told Reuters  explaining that bids by rival elevator companies risked lengthy antitrust reviews while private equity bids would be easier to pull off  A takeover by Kone  for example  would combine the world s third  and fourth biggest elevator makers in market already dominated by a few large firms  The biggest  Otis  is itself being spun off from United Technologies Corp  N UTX  next year   Antitrust     is definitely a big  big hurdle for any attempt   said Thomas Oetterli  CEO of Switzerland s Schindler  S SCHP   the world s second biggest elevator maker by sales  adding it would be  incredibly difficult to get approvals   It might be less of a problem for smaller rivals including Japan s Mitsubishi Electric  T 6503   Fujitec  T 6406  and Hitachi  T 6501   one of the sources said  Thomas Hechtfischer  managing director of shareholder advisory group DSW  which typically represents 1  of Thyssenkrupp s voting rights at annual general meetings  said there was no room for further missteps by Kerkhoff   The next shot needs to be a bullseye   he said   For an interactive version of the graphic click    BAD ASSET  Further chipping away at Kerkhoff s credibility  which has suffered from botched efforts to spin off Thyssenkrupp s capital goods units  are plans to restructure  sell or shut down those divisions burning the most cash  The problem is that all those subsidiaries   system engineering  springs and stabilizers and heavy plate   operate in the steel and autos sectors  industries that have come under extreme pressure in recent months   Why would you try and sell a bad asset in a market environment at the worst possible time   one person familiar with the plans said  Winding down the units  an option Kerkhoff has said was not being ruled out  will not be easy either  With a combined staff of 9 300  closing them would incur large restructuring costs at a time when Thyssenkrupp s balance sheet is already stretched  Some analysts argue that far greater job cuts are needed  Bucephalus Research estimates that sacking 30 000 people  or 19  of total staff  is necessary for a serious overhaul but it would involve restructuring costs of about 3 billion euros  Without an injection of cash from a sale of ET  Kerkhoff would struggle to fund even a portion of these layoffs   even if powerful labor representatives  who control half of the 20 seats on Thyssenkrupp s supervisory board  give the go ahead   We are prepared for change but not at any price   said Markus Grolms  vice chairman of Thyssenkrupp s supervisory board and trade secretary at Germany s most powerful union  IG Metall   Swinging the axe does not address the group s problems   Grolms said it needed to improve the operating performance of its divisions  most of which are lagging rivals  echoing comments from the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen and Halbach Foundation  Thyssenkrupp s largest shareholder with a 21  stake  Tapping new growth markets and developing innovative products would also require substantial funds  putting pressure on Kerkhoff to get his next move right after a series of setbacks  including four profit warnings under his watch   Thyssenkrupp faces a very challenging situation  The market environment and the economy have continued to deteriorate   the foundation

187381,408897,UTX,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For United Technologies  UTX ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider United Technologies  UTX   This company  which is in the Zacks Diversified Operations industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This maker of elevators  jet engines and other products has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 19 14  
For the most recent quarter  United Technologies was expected to post earnings of  1 75 per share  but it reported  1 91 per share instead  representing a surprise of 9 14   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 51 per share  while it actually produced  1 95 per share  a surprise of 29 14  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for United Technologies  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
United Technologies currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 49   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-united-technologies-utx-200436515,200436515
187382,408898,UTX,United Technologies  UTX  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"United Technologies  UTX  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of elevators  jet engines and other products is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 04 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 6  
Revenues are expected to be  19 46 billion  up 16 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 08  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for United Technologies 
For United Technologies  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 43  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that United Technologies will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that United Technologies would post earnings of  1 75 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 91  delivering a surprise of  9 14  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
United Technologies doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/united-technologies-utx-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200440146,200440146

Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
UTX currently has a forward P E ratio of 15 89  while MMM has a forward P E of 18 45  We also note that UTX has a PEG ratio of 1 81  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  MMM currently has a PEG ratio of 1 82

187420,408936,UTX,United Technologies  UTX  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
United Technologies in Focus
United Technologies  UTX  is headquartered in Connecticut  and is in the Conglomerates sector  The stock has seen a price change of 19 14  since the start of the year  Currently paying a dividend of  0 74 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 32   In comparison  the Diversified Operations industry s yield is 1 59   while the S P 500 s yield is 2 04  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 94 is up 3 7  from last year  United Technologies has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 4 37   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  United Technologies s payout ratio is 38   which means it paid out 38  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for UTX for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  7 97 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 4 73  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  UTX presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-06-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/united-technologies-utx-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200428233,200428233

187487,409003,UTX,Earnings Preview  United Technologies  UTX  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"United Technologies  UTX  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of elevators  jet engines and other products is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 75 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 1  
Revenues are expected to be  18 08 billion  up 18 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 1  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for United Technologies 
For United Technologies  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that United Technologies will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that United Technologies would post earnings of  1 51 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 95  delivering a surprise of  29 14  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
United Technologies doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-united-technologies-utx-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200407212,200407212
187488,409004,UTX,Why United Technologies  UTX  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider United Technologies  UTX   This company  which is in the Zacks Diversified Operations industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This maker of elevators  jet engines and other products has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 17 88  
For the last reported quarter  United Technologies came out with earnings of  1 95 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 51 per share  representing a surprise of 29 14   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 81 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 93 per share  delivering a surprise of 6 63  
Price and EPS Surprise

For United Technologies  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
United Technologies currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 23   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on April 23  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

187603,409119,UTX,Japan s Daikin  thriving in Asia and India  sets sights on Africa,news,By Makiko Yamazaki and Yoshiyasu Shida TOKYO  Reuters    Daikin Industries   T 6367  the world s largest maker of air conditioning equipment  is turning to Africa for further expansion  10 years after a successful gamble on sharing its key technology with a Chinese company  As Japanese manufacturers such as Panasonic stepped back from home appliances over a decade ago to avoid price wars with Asian rivals  Daikin did the opposite  going head to head with the likes of South Korea s LG  KS 003550   Fighting off low cost competitors through local partnerships and acquisitions  Daikin grabbed top share in markets such as India  Africa  where LG and China s Haier are established giants  may seem like another difficult target for Daikin  But Yoshihiro Mineno  Daikin s senior executive in charge of Asia  said the company is used to silencing critics  recalling the controversy more than 15 years ago over its decision to target mass markets overseas   Many skeptics at the time said it would be impossible to make profits in the  volume zone  in Asia  and that it was pointless to invest there   Mineno told Reuters in an interview  Conventional wisdom  he said  held that the 94 year old company should focus on high end markets   Daikin saw limited potential for growth in that area  however  and executives knew the company would have to focus on low cost and high volume if it wanted to boost its global presence  The company s market value now exceeds those of electronics conglomerates Panasonic Corp  T 6752  and Hitachi Ltd  T 6501    If advanced technologies or added value products are your only selling points  your rivals are likely to catch up and overtake you   said Hideki Yasuda  an analyst at the research arm of Ace Securities   But Daikin s business model is backed by cost competitiveness   Yasuda added   It s among a few Japanese companies that can compete head to head with the Chinese   The United States  the world s largest market for air conditioning  has been tougher to crack  Daikin has struggled to compete with local rivals such as United Technologies   N UTX  Carrier and Johnson Controls  York  which specialize in ducted air conditioning  Daikin acquired the U S  company Goodman in 2012 to strengthen its expertise in that area  but has made little headway   The prospect of tariffs from a trade war between the United States and China adds another headache  Daikin assembles air conditioners in the U S  using some Chinese made parts  Mineno said the company may need to export components from elsewhere in Asia if the trade war escalates  For a graphic on Daikin sales  click   REGIONAL STRATEGY In 2006  Daikin took over Malaysian contract manufacturer OYL Industries for  2 1 billion  The deal boosted its purchasing power  and provided access to cheaper global suppliers and nimble product development  Two years later  it shocked the industry by agreeing to a partnership with major Chinese rival Gree Electric Appliances  SZ 000651   The deal gave Daikin mass market production capabilities in return for access to its advanced inverter technology  which saves electricity by efficiently regulating temperatures   Critics said the move amounted to self sabotage because of the potential for such valuable components to be copied   The technology did end up in air conditioners from other Chinese companies  But Daikin expanded production so quickly with Gree s help that it drove smaller rivals out of the market    We effectively created a market for inverter air conditioners with Gree   Mineno said  Gree is still a partner in producing low end models and components for Daikin  although they compete in most other segments   Being the No  1 player in inverter machines gave us access to government officials and allowed us to influence regulations   Mineno said  adding that stricter energy consumption rules  for instance  made Daikin inverters more attractive  Daikin s sales have tripled since the OYL acquisition  with overseas markets now accounting for 80 percent of its  20 billion annual revenue   By contrast  other Japanese manufacturers have struggled to maintain their edge in products that include televisions  smartphone screens and semiconductors  Experts say most failed to innovate enough to continue charging more than their Chinese and Korean rivals  eventually giving up both market share and margins   INDIA TO AFRICA Executives said Daikin s biggest growth driver is India  where it has established itself as a top player despite competition from LG  Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  and local manufacturers  It appointed Indian industry veteran Kanwal Jeet Jawa to lead operations there  built a sales network and localized production with low cost know how from OYL  Daikin s market share in room air conditioners in India jumped from less than 2 percent in 2010 to 17 percent over eight years  lifting the company to the top total sales spot of air conditioners for commercial buildings and industrial use  Jawa will lead the expansion in Africa as well  the company said  It plans to set up a regional office in east Africa in a few months   Jawa said Daikin would continue to aim for the volume zone   It s a very price sensitive market   he said of Africa   We want to use our leverage of Indian operations and we want to replicate what we have done in India   Daikin is adding production capacity for further global expansion  It opened an assembly plant in Vietnam in May and plans another in Malaysia this year  It is also considering a new Indian plant to help produce products for Africa  Jawa said  Daikin has set a 2020 sales target of 90 billion yen   812 71 million  for Africa and the Middle East  an increase of 11 percent from last year  but Mineno said it may need to revise that upward   Globally  I still see a lot of growth potential that can be unleashed by our volume zone strategy   he said ,2018-08-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/japans-daikin-thriving-in-asia-and-india-sets-sights-on-africa-1581014,1581014
187609,409125,UTX,Why United Technologies  UTX  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
United Technologies in Focus
United Technologies  UTX  is headquartered in Farmington  and is in the Conglomerates sector  The stock has seen a price change of 9 92  since the start of the year  The maker of elevators  jet engines and other products is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 74 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 51   This compares to the Diversified Operations industry s yield of 1 51  and the S P 500 s yield of 2 01  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 94 is up 3 7  from last year  United Technologies has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 4 34   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  United Technologies s current payout ratio is 39   This means it paid out 39  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  UTX expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  7 78 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 2 23  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  UTX is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-united-technologies-utx-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200378855,200378855

187645,409161,UTX,Loeb pressures Nestle for more sales  restructuring,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss
BOSTON  Reuters    Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb on Sunday stepped up pressure on food group Nestle SA  S NESN   in a letter that urged its board to be  sharper    bolder  and  faster  in spinning off businesses and untangling its complex management structure 
 This is a call for urgency   rather than incrementalism   said Loeb s letter  It came with a 34 page presentation with recommendations and critiques  Third Point  the  18 billion hedge fund which has invested more than  3 billion in Nestle  also launched website  to push its case 
Loeb s letter  seen by Reuters  demanded that Nestle spin off more businesses that do not fit its strategy including ice cream  frozen foods  and confectionary  divide itself internally into three divisions   beverages  nutrition and grocery  and add an outsider to the board with expertise in the food and beverage business 
Each division should have its own CEO  regional structure and marketing heads  Loeb said  This would  simplify  Nestle s  overly complex organizational structure   the letter said 
Nestle had no immediate comment on the letter  which was first reported by the Financial Times 
Loeb s demands came roughly on the first anniversary of his investment in Nestle and at a time of significant merger activity in the food industry  For months  the activist investor who previously pushed for change at Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  and  Dow Chemical   NYSE DOW  as well as other companies watched and periodically made supportive public comments about Nestle s new chief executive officer  Mark Schneider 
But his letter made clear that Third Point is no longer willing to keep its critiques behind closed doors 
It criticized Nestle s slow sales growth  declining stock price and its failure to sell off more pieces that do not fit its  nutrition health and wellness  strategy 
The fund manager s biggest concern was corporate structure  with the board of directors in charge of strategic direction 
 Nestle s insular  complacent  and bureaucratic organization is overly complex  lethargic  and misses too many trends   Loeb said in the letter 
In early 2017  the Swiss company hired Schneider  a German  as its first non Swiss CEO in nearly a century  He had won praise for overhauling Fresenius Medical Care  DE FMEG  
But former CEO Paul Bulcke remained Nestle s board chair  which raised eyebrows among governance experts  Insiders say that after months at the helm  Schneider has yet to bring in a broad team of his own 

Industry experts say CEOs sometimes privately welcome public critiques from big shareholders  as effective cover to push through changes more aggressively  Loeb has only put together websites twice before   at Yahoo and Dow Chemical  but he has been vocal at plenty of companies and most recently pushed for United Technologies  NYSE UTX  to break itself into three companies ",2018-07-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/loebs-third-point-urges-nestle-to-split-into-three-units-letter-1514173,1514173

187655,409171,UTX,Earnings Preview  United Technologies  UTX  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"United Technologies  NYSE UTX  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of elevators  jet engines and other products is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 50 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 3  
Revenues are expected to be  16 59 billion  up 5 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 2  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for United Technologies 
For United Technologies  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that United Technologies will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that United Technologies would post earnings of  1 81 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 93  delivering a surprise of  6 63  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
United Technologies doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-united-technologies-utx-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200376182,200376182
187656,409172,UTX,Will United Technologies  UTX  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering United Technologies  UTX   which belongs to the Zacks Diversified Operations industry 
This maker of elevators  jet engines and other products has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 6 56  
For the last reported quarter  United Technologies came out with earnings of  1 93 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 81 per share  representing a surprise of 6 63   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 85 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 97 per share  delivering a surprise of 6 49  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for United Technologies  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
United Technologies currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 74   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 23  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss

187672,409188,UTX,Airbus heads for dogfight with UTC over CSeries costs,news,"By Tim Hepher and Allison Lampert PARIS MONTREAL  Reuters    Airbus is preparing to cross swords with United Technologies over the price of components and services for the Bombardier CSeries in a bid to make it easier to market the jet it agreed to bail out last year  people close to the matter said   Airbus  PA AIR  is concerned about an increased share of the Canadian project that would be controlled by United Technologies  N UTX  after it completes its  23 billion acquisition of Rockwell Collins  NYSE COL   they said  asking not to be named  Together  the pair will have by far the largest share of CSeries parts and systems by value  placing it at the center of efforts by Airbus to reduce the plane s cost and echoing a broader power struggle between planemakers and suppliers  A key part of the acquisition is  muscling the supply chain down on price   said Richard Aboulafia  vice president of analysis at Virginia based Teal Group   Bombardier couldn t do that  they just didn t have the leverage  And Airbus has more than enough leverage   Airbus and UTC declined to comment  A Bombardier spokeswoman said UTC was the largest CSeries supplier even before completion of the Rockwell Collins merger  but declined to comment further   Airbus agreed last October to buy the struggling CSeries for a token one Canadian dollar  with both sides reckoning its global sales presence and clout with suppliers would make the plane more competitive and easier to sell  The deal came weeks after United Technologies teamed up with Rockwell Collins with plans to create a new super supplier  Among shared components   United Tech  supplies engines for the CSeries and Rockwell Collins supplies cockpit systems  Aboulafia said pre merger UTC supplied about a quarter of CSeries content   Items up for negotiation are likely to include the cost of parts  spares and services like repairs  sources said  MARKETING DILEMMA  Costs are not the only factor as the CSeries seeks a fresh start  Airbus is also studying how to use its marketing weight  One proposal is to drop the 14 year old CSeries name and call it the A200  indicating a smaller cousin of the Airbus product line that stretches from the A318 to the mammoth A380  But the possible change  first reported by Bloomberg News  could upset politicians in Quebec who fear losing a key brand and jars with some in Europe who say it harks back to the first A300 Airbus or even the troubled A400M  The debate over what to call it mirrors deeper questions over how Airbus will market the plane  a decision that would send a message on how it views its new Canadian partner  Airbus is trying to decide whether to integrate it into the Airbus sales force or set up a new dedicated team  sources said  A separate structure would give it strong attention but shift the emphasis away from cross selling with Airbus models  Having one sales force would highlight the opportunity for package deals across the Airbus portfolio  but risk distraction from key priorities like reviving weak sales of the A330neo

187804,409320,UTX,More layoffs at Indiana factory Trump made deal to keep open,news,"By Amanda Becker INDIANAPOLIS  Reuters    More than 200 workers clocked in for their final shifts on Thursday at Carrier Corp  in Indianapolis in the latest round of layoffs at a plant President Donald Trump toured in December 2016 to trumpet a deal to save jobs and prevent its closure  Under pressure from the newly elected Trump  Carrier and its parent company United Technologies Corp  NYSE UTX   dropped its plan in late 2016 to close the plant and move 1 400 factory jobs to Mexico  In return  the company received  7 million in state tax breaks to stay in Indiana   Trump praised the deal  under which he said 1 100 jobs would be saved  as a model of how he would push American companies to keep jobs in the country   Trump did save hundreds of positions at Carrier  but manufacturing workers who now face unemployment say they feel let down by a deal that started out as a presidential campaign rallying cry but turned out to be less than it appeared  Carrier said this week that 1 100 workers will remain at the factory  upholding its deal with Trump  They include 730 manufacturing jobs and about 300 engineering and administrative positions that were never slated to move  But Carrier also laid off 338 manufacturing workers in July and another 215 this week  Those jobs are going to the company s plant in Monterrey  Mexico  where workers make about  3 an hour  according to Indiana union officials   Yes he  Trump  saved jobs  yes he did  But he didn t save mine  he didn t save manufacturing jobs  He saved office personnel  okay   said Renee Elliott  45  who supported Trump in the 2016 election and was among those being laid off on Thursday  Elliott began working at Carrier in 2013 as a seasonal employee making  13 per hour  She currently makes  18 per hour  taking advantage of overtime shifts  and sometimes works seven days a week   DISAPPOINTED BY DEAL She does not know what she will do next and said she is disappointed that Trump did not make a better deal for factory floor workers  During his visit  Trump strode through the furnace factory  with TV cameras rolling  and shook hands with workers  telling them the deal with the company was  very exciting    Companies are not going to leave the United States any more without consequences  Not going to happen   Trump said  Elliott said Trump s visit raised hopes among the entire workforce but it became clear later that some workers would lose their jobs anyway   It was like royalty coming here  we knew the world was watching   Elliott said   He s walking through and we re in awe  like  Savior    That s the way we re looking at it  He led us to believe that we were all going to be saved   The White House said Trump s intervention in the case of Carrier was successful    The President was proud that he was able to help save the jobs of 1 100 Americans from being shipped to Mexico by overseeing a deal between United Technologies and the state of Indiana   White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement on Thursday  The U S  economy is growing steadily  unemployment is low at 4 1 percent and wages have started to rise  About 2 1 million new jobs were created in 2017 and 2 24 million in 2016 as one of the longest economic recoveries on record has pulled people back into the labor force  Trump had repeatedly criticized Carrier during the presidential campaign as he pledged to rip up bad trade deals and save American jobs  And he put pressure on the company to change course after his election victory in November 2016   Carrier workers now question why their factory  which will continue making furnaces after fan coil operations move to Monterrey  was singled out by Trump when hundreds of steelworkers in Indiana are in a similar predicament  United Technologies Electronic Controls  another United Technologies facility two hours away in Huntington  Indiana  is closing in 2018  also sending its operations to Monterrey   About 400 workers were laid off in 2017 and another 230 will be this year  a company spokeswoman said   Rexnord Corp   just down the road from Carrier  closed in November  laying off 300 workers represented by the same local steelworkers union as the Carrier employees   Trump wrote on Twitter shortly after touring Carrier that Rexnord  which also relocated operations to Mexico  was  rather viciously firing  its workers   This is happening all over our country  No more   Trump wrote   Don t get me wrong  me and the people here that work for Carrier are very grateful for it but when he was running during the election he stated that these things wouldn t happen anymore   said Robert James  president of the local United Steelworkers union    How do you save 730 jobs at Carrier and not give a damn about the 700 jobs in Huntington  Both owned by the same company  Why would you leave them out of the equation   James asked  Indiana s unemployment rate was 3 7 percent in November 2017  lower than the national rate of 4 1 percent  But the U S  steel industry  in particular  has struggled over the past decade  
Chuck Jones  the former president of the local United Steelworkers union  said that while some laid off Rexnord and Carrier workers have been able to find comparable union jobs  others are in warehouse jobs paying about half the  25 per hour they used to make ",2018-01-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/more-layoffs-at-indiana-factory-trump-made-deal-to-keep-open-1094317,1094317

Price to Book  P B   This ratio is a cornerstone for value investors  A lower number here indicates a better value play  And at 3 55  United Technologies looks reasonable  but P B varies greatly based on the industry 
hese two metrics are a great place to start when valuing a company    but your analysis should go much deeper   ",2018-03-07,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/investor-insight-united-technologies-stock-utx-200296205,200296205

187849,409365,UTX,What Chinese CEOs See in Trump Is a Dealmaker  Not Trade Basher,news," Bloomberg     Having listened to President Donald Trump s  America First  rhetoric and his hammering of the need to reduce U S  trade deficits  what many Chinese executives say they hear is not the threat of a trade war  but the words of a dealmaker who ll be good for business 
In interviews with more than a dozen executives in Shanghai  Guangzhou and other Chinese cities over the past week  the sentiment expressed repeatedly was a confidence in strong economic ties between the world s largest economies    not despite of Trump but because of him 
 He looks at managing a country as similar to doing business  and this is a good thing   said Hu Huazhi  founder and chairman of EHang Inc   a drone maker based in southern China   If America does well  it will pull along other countries more rapidly  
Behind that optimism is the belief among the executives that a trade war would be too costly for both countries  While having repeatedly bashed China on the campaign trail  Trump has in office softened his rhetoric and walked away from threats to declare the country a currency manipulator and slap heavy tariffs on its goods 
 Even though some people say he has been anti globalization  in fact he is a pragmatic  realistic person when it comes to protecting his own country s interests   said Guangzhou Automobile Group President Feng Xingya  noting that U S  manufacturers sell far more auto products to China than Chinese manufacturers sell to America   So establishing a good relationship between our two countries is very beneficial to the U S  
If there were a trade war  many of these executives would have much to lose  Drone maker EHang  for example  signed an agreement last year with Silver Spring  Maryland based Lung Biotechnology to develop machines to transport items for medical use 
Chinese investment into the U S  reached a record of  46 billion last year  While newly announced Chinese takeovers of U S  companies has fallen 67 percent this year  that was mainly because Chinese regulators tightened capital controls  according to the New York based consultancy Rhodium Group 
Midea Group Co     the world s biggest appliance maker  which early this year bought German robot maker Kuka AG for  4 billion    is another example  It has manufacturing and distribution joint ventures with United Technologies Corp  NYSE UTX   s air conditioner unit Carrier in Argentina  Brazil and North America  The U S  company also has a small stake in Midea s refrigerator business in the Chinese city of Chongqing 
 The scale of our cooperation is getting bigger and bigger every year  UTC s transactions with us are more than  1 billion every year  If it wasn t a win win relationship  it would not have grown so much   Midea Chairman and CEO Paul Fang said in an interview   In terms of our bilateral relationship  it s the same    if it were not win win  China and the U S  would not have such a scale of cooperation  
Not everyone is as optimistic  A survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China found that representatives of about four fifths of U S  companies say they feel less welcome than before  citing inconsistent use of regulations and unclear laws as top challenges  Efforts to reach an agreement on a bilateral investment treaty are making slow progress  with too many sectors still closed to foreign investment  said AmCham China Chairman William Zarit 
At the Canton trade fair in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou  Sarah Ouyang  a sales representative for an exporter of outdoor sportswear  downplayed the potential impact that U S  policies could have on China  She noted a September meeting of leaders from Brazil  Russia  India  South Africa and China in the city of Xiamen as an example of how trade ties are being fostered with more countries around the world

187965,409481,UTX,Stocks Dip To Start September  The Market s Traditional Worst Month,opinion,"With the Dow  S P 500  and Nasdaq indices all in the red through morning trading on Tuesday  it s clearly not been a hot start to September  which is historically the stock market s worst month of the year 
As investors returned from the Labor Day holiday this week  several major stories appeared to ratchet up fear and hesitation  For one  investors appear less than impressed with United Technologies    NYSE UTX    23 billion  Rockwell Collins   NYSE COL    Shares of UTX  a component of the Dow  were down more than 4 7  through morning trading hours 
On top this  broader concerns about a handful of domestic and international political issues continue to loom over investors  heads 
The threat of a nuclear conflict with North Korea has reached new highs over the past few weeks  and as result  President Trump looks ready to initiate a trade war with China  Here at home  the debt ceiling drama is far from resolved  and Hurricane Irma could be poised to add to the devastation in the Gulf region 
 It s probably a safe bet that volatility will pick up in September    Hinsdale Associates investments director William Lynch 
September is widely accepted as the worst month for stock market performance  Since 1950  the Dow has averaged a 1 1  decline during the month  while the S P 500 has averaged a 0 7  drop in September  The Nasdaq was first established in 1971 and has dropped an average of 1  during September since its founding 
There are many theories as to why September is such a difficult month for stocks  although we do lack one universally agreed upon reason 
Some think it s fair to blame the dip on the unofficial end of summer  The summer months normally mark the lightest trading volumes in the calendar year a fact that most people assume is related to investors taking vacation time 
Also  many major mutual funds end their fiscal years in September  Many mutual fund managers will shed their losing positions as their fiscal years conclude  which could also contribute to a weaker month overall 
This year  these traditional factors will be in play yet again  but it could be a caution inducing combination of other external elements that results in new volatility

Stocks in Asia finished mixed as sentiment remained cautious after this weekend s claim that North Korea detonated a hydrogen bomb  while the markets digested a report that showed growth in China s key services sector activity accelerated  Japanese equities fell  with the yen extending gains  while those traded in South Korea gave up early gains and dipped  with media reports suggesting North Korea is preparing another intercontinental ballistic missile  ICBM  test

peers to gauge the underlying metrics and relative performance  Let us perform a similar comparative analysis between two stocks in the Diversified Conglomerates sector   3M Company   NYSE MMM   and United Technologies Corporation   NYSE UTX     to pick the better investment option First Quarter Earnings3M started 2017 on a positive note with strong first quarter results  driven by healthy year over year increase in earnings and revenues  GAAP earnings for the reported quarter were  1 323 million or  2 16 per share compared with  1 275 million or  2 10 per share in the year earlier quarter  The year over year improvement in earnings was largely due to higher sales  The reported earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 cents for an earnings surprise of 4 4   Net sales during the quarter were  7 685 million  up from  7 409 million in the year ago quarter and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  7 515 million for a sales surprise of 2 3  United Technologies reported first quarter 2017 adjusted earnings  from continuing operations  of  1 48 per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 39 for an earnings surprise of 6 5   The company s bottom line primarily benefited from organic sales growth  Adjusted net sales for the quarter were  13 815 million compared with  13 357 million in the year earlier quarter  Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  13 316 million for a sales surprise of 3 8   The rise was primarily attributable to improved performance across all its segments Although there seems to be an apparent tie between the stocks relative to the first quarter earnings  United Technologies has a slight edge over 3M due to a better earnings and sales surprise percentage First Quarter Price PerformanceFor the first quarter  3M clearly outperformed United Technologies with an average return of 7 1  compared with 2 4  gain for the latter  During this period  3M s shares performed better than the Zacks categorized  industry that gained 1 4    Guidance3M raised its earlier guidance for 2017 on strong quarterly results and improved business outlook  The company anticipates 2017 GAAP earnings in the range of  8 70 to  9 05 per share  up from prior projection of  8 45  8 80  This represents year over year growth of 7 11   up from 4 8  expected earlier  Organic local currency sales are expected to be 2 5   up from 1 3  projected earlier while free cash flow conversion rate is anticipated to be 95 105  Incorporating its improved expectations for organic sales growth in the near future  United Technologies reaffirmed its guidance for 2017  The company expects adjusted earnings in the range of  6 30  6 60 per share on revenues of  57 5  59 billion  The company s acquisition expectation is between  1billion and  2 billion and free cash flow guidance is in the range of 90 100  of net income  It also plans to repurchase shares worth  3 5 billion in 2017 Zacks Rank   VGM ScoreWith a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   3M has a Value Growth Momentum score    of  B   United Technologies has a VGM Score of  C  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of  A  or  B  combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  offer the best investment opportunities for investors  Consequently  3M appears to be better positioned compared to United Technologies with regards to this metric Estimate RevisionsOver the last month  3M s current quarter estimates increased from  2 25 to  2 50 per share while that for the current year increased from  8 64 to  8 91 United Technologies  current quarter estimates decreased a penny to  1 76 during the last month while current year estimates increased a penny to  6 57 per share  With positive estimate revisions  investor sentiments clearly appear to be bullish on 3M compared to United Technologies To Sum UpBased on the current scenario  3M seems to have trumped United Technologies on most fronts and stands out as a better investment proposition  A couple of other stocks worth considering in the industry include Crane Co    NYSE CR   and Federal Signal Corporation   NYSE FSS    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2 Crane has a long term earnings growth expectation of 10 1   It surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 8 4  Federal Signal topped estimates

188135,409651,UTX,Why American Manufacturing Jobs Will Prove Very Hard To Win Back,opinion,"President elect Donald Trump made a strong promise to bring back jobs to the U S  from overseas  Manufacturing employment was a particular showcase in this campaign pledge  There are a lot of reasons to believe that a to return jobs to the U S  will be extremely hard to accomplish  I am particularly struck by the data on the health of manufacturing in the U S  First of all  the productivity of American manufacturing workers  as measured by real output for worker hour  is better than ever 
However  that productivity has stalled through most of the economic recovery  The stagnation stands in stark contrast to the soaring productivity that characterized American manufacturing from around 1990 to 2007 and then again in the first years of the current economic recovery 
Manufacturing productivity has plateaued through most of the recovery   a starkly different pattern from the soaring productivity since 1990 
The lack of productivity gains acts as a drag on the attractiveness of American manufacturing  To the extent other countries experience strong productivity gains  those locations may increase in attractiveness all else being equal even beyond simple wage differentials 
Even more interesting is the level of manufacturing employment versus real manufacturing output  The level of employment in manufacturing reached an absolute peak in 1979  From 1966 to 2001  manufacturing employment bounced within a tight range from around 17 1 million to 18 8M  just below the 1979 peak of 19 6M  After 2001  employment took its  final  plunge and never came back  YET  real manufacturing output continued to soar going into the last recession 
After the recession ended  real manufacturing output soared all over again as employment made the slightest of recoveries  In other words  America s manufacturing muscle as measured by output is relatively healthy  However  a lot fewer workers are needed for this output  Technological advancement  not foreign competition  is likely the biggest culprit of this dynamic since jobs sent overseas cannot contribute to America s manufacturing output 

America s manufacturing employment went into stasis starting in the late 1960s  The current secular decline has not prevented real output from reaching new all time highs 
In other words  to make a serious dent in manufacturing employment Trump will most likely have to figure out how to increase the productivity of manufacturing workers faster than the productivity gains of the technology that reduces their employment  Government is probably the wrong place to figure out how to pull off such a marvel 
There are of course minor victories to be had in forcing companies to change existing plans to ship jobs overseas   as in the now famous case of   a unit of United Technologies  NYSE UTX    but resurrecting jobs that are now lost to technological advancement will be next to impossible  Even the math of saving existing jobs does not quite add up as expected as expressed by the disappointment of some Carrier workers  see     
At this point  Trump s administration would do well to focus on somehow cranking up the engine of innovation  an expansion of types of products  more businesses  and bigger GLOBAL markets  What has been lost is mostly gone  What can be gained is somewhere in the future of American ingenuity

Creating a new aerospace giant to rival US peers
This announcement ends nearly a decade of speculation about potential consolidation in the French aerospace and defence market  The merger of Safran and Zodiac Aerospace will create the world number three in aerospace with revenues of  21bn  balanced between propulsion and aircraft equipment  and in aircraft equipment alone it will be the number two player  The new Safran will look a lot like two divisions of the US firm United Technologies  NYSE UTX   with positions across the whole aircraft value chain and exposure to all key aircraft programmes

188139,409655,UTX,Trump plans to overturn Obama ban on Dakota oil pipeline,news,"Investing com   President elect Donald Trump is continuing with his new industrial policy to save and retain U S  jobs    and it is still more than a month before he takes the oath of office in Washington D C  Immediately after the Obama administration stopped the progress of a prominent midwestern oil pipeline  by refusing to issue a new permit for the rest of the route  a spokesman for Trump s transition team said the incoming administration supports completing the project 
 With regard to the Dakota Access Pipeline  that s something that we support construction of and we ll review the full situation when we re in the White House and make the appropriate determination at that time   said Jason Miller  a spokesman for the president elect  in New York City  at Trump Tower 
Out of state environmental activists broke out into public cheers during a rally after the U S  Department of the Army  staffed by President Obama s progressive team  said the department wouldn t grant an easement required by Dallas based  Energy Transfer Partners LP   NYSE ETP  to proceed through the Missouri River reservoir  the final 1 100 foot link yet to be built in the nearly 1 200 mile pipeline 
The Army statement said that alternate routes would be considered and a complete environmental study of the project should be conducted 
The statement Monday by the Trump transition team  however  demonstrated that decision would not hold any power after the new administration takes over in the coming weeks  The new oil pipeline is expected to generate 500 000 new barrels of oil per day 
Trump last week intervened in a threatened move overseas of a unit of United Technologies Corp   NYSE UTX   and in the weeks before that prevented  Ford Motor Co     NYSE F  from shuttering a plant in Kentucky and moving 1 000 jobs to Mexico  The move caused hackles at the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal  by zealous free market intellectuals  but generated approval from the  average Joe  workers whose blue collar jobs were saved by the policy pronouncement 
The moves signal an industrial policy somewhat reminiscent of the Reagan era or the JFK era  when the U S  goverment preached free trade  within American borders  and took an overall deregulatory approach  But was somewhat protectionist against foreign encroachments on U S  markets which were not reciprocated by trading partners  and which harmed the  little guy   the American working man  Obama s policies have been viewed by market analysts as highly regulatory at home  especially of  green energy  issues and the energy industry in general  but laissez faire  free market with respect to foreign moves by publicly traded manufacturing corporations based in the U S  Obama had told a worker last summer  whose job at UTC was being eliminated  that he should  get retrained in the clean power industry  ",2016-12-05,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/trump-plans-to-overturn-obama-ban-on-dakota-oil-pipeline-445733,445733

188143,409659,UTX,Trump picks opponent of higher minimum wage for Labor Department,news,"By Amanda Becker and Robert Iafolla WASHINGTON  Reuters    President elect Donald Trump named fast food executive Andy Puzder to head the U S  Department of Labor on Thursday  drawing criticism from labor advocates worried about his opposition to a higher minimum wage and government regulation of the workplace   Puzder  chief executive of CKE Restaurants Inc  which operates the Carl s Jr  and Hardee s fast food chains  has frequently argued in the media that higher minimum wages would hurt workers by forcing restaurants to close   He has bashed a new Labor Department rule aimed at extending overtime pay to more than 4 million U S  workers and has praised the benefits of automation in the fast food industry   Fast food workers  who are largely not unionized  are engaged in a multi year campaign known as the  Fight for  15   which is supported by labor unions  to raise minimum wages to  15 an hour  They have had state wide successes in New York and California and in cities and municipalities such as Seattle  The federal minimum wage is  7 25  Workers in states that have higher minimum wages are entitled to the higher rate  the Labor Department says  Trump  in a statement released by his transition team  praised Puzder for a  record fighting for workers  and said he would ensure occupational safety standards   He will save small businesses from the crushing burdens of unnecessary regulations that are stunting job growth and suppressing wages   Trump said  In the same statement  Puzder  66  said he agreed with Trump that  the right government policies can result in more jobs and better wages for the American worker   The Labor Department regulates wages  safety and discrimination in the workplace  Republican Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton in last month s election by carrying swing states   and some traditionally Democratic states   in the U S  Rust Belt after promising to create jobs and to review or cancel trade deals that he said were bad for workers   National labor leaders had urged their rank and file members to back Clinton  saying Trump s appointments and policies would not align with his promises to workers  Labor leaders have been girding for Trump to appoint pro business regulators at the Labor Department and the National Labor Relations Board  and to roll back key regulatory initiatives of the Obama administration such as the Labor Department rule granting overtime pay to more than 4 million salaried workers  both unionized and not unionized   He was talking a good game when he was running for president  as far as helping workers and leveling the playing field for them  but with the nominations he s made it s just the opposite   said Lee Saunders  president of the public employees union AFSCME  Shake ups are expected under Trump at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  or EEOC  which enforces federal anti discrimination laws  Trump will have an early opportunity to shape the EEOC when he replaces its general counsel  Obama appointee David Lopez  who is leaving the agency this month  and a vacancy on the commission   Trump will also be able to fill two current vacancies on the five member NLRB early in his term  likely tipping the agency to a more business friendly posture  Although just 11 1 percent of U S  workers were represented by a union in 2015   down from 20 1 percent in 1983  the first year government statistics were kept   labor unions are a powerful force in Democratic politics  But union members  support for Clinton at the election was lower than it had been for President Barack Obama four years ago  About 51 percent of voters from union households backed Clinton  with 42 percent supporting Trump  a CNN exit poll showed  Democrat Obama won 58 percent of the same voters in his 2012 re election win against Republican Mitt Romney  Business groups welcomed the appointment of Puzder  Robert Cresanti  president of the International Franchise Association  an industry group  praised him as an  exceptional choice  who would bring  business experience and policy acumen on so many issues impacting employers and employees   Democrats were critical    In Andrew Puzder  Trump found a labor secretary that would help him roll back the minimum wage  end the overtime rule that will raise wages for millions  weaken safeguards for workers  and to wipe out unions   said American Bridge  a liberal advocacy group  DISPUTE WITH UNION LEADER Trump s decision to pick Puzder comes

CHICAGO  Reuters    United Technologies Corp  N UTX  plans retrain U S  workers at its Carrier Corp air conditioning unit who will lose their jobs once production moves to Mexico  the company s top executive said on Tuesday 
 These are real people with real jobs and real lives   United Technologies Chief Executive Officer Gregory Hayes said at a conference in Chicago on future technologies   We do have a responsibility to those workers  
He gave no details about what the retraining would entail 
Carrier Corp s announcement in February about the production move that would cost 1 400 jobs at a plant in Indianapolis and 700 at another plant in Indiana has come under sustained attack from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump 
Local union leaders said Carrier had told them the jobs would go to Mexican workers who would make  3 an hour compared with more than  20 for their U S  counterparts 
Trump has said if elected he would impose steep tariffs on Carrier air conditioners imported into the United States  The Republican nominee has also criticized  Ford Motor Co   N F  and other U S  corporations for moving American jobs abroad 
Hayes said globalization poses a broader challenge when it comes to training and retraining workers that the United States and other countries must address 
 The genie is out of the bottle   Hayes said   The big question is how do we train the next generation of workers and how do we retrain the current generation  ",2016-10-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/united-technologies-will-retrain-carrier-workers:-ceo-430302,430302

188252,409768,UTX,Why The Brexit Could Spark A New Wave Of MA,opinion,"When the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union last month  the news triggered a wave of volatility across the globe 
The reason for the volatility was simple  uncertainty 
Markets hate it   and the Brexit delivered it in spades 
On a corporate level  many companies delivered another shock to their shareholders by admitting that they had no  Plan B  and don t know what will happen 
Needless to say  that s like kryptonite for investors 
And one thing is unanimous  Britain s economy is in for a rough ride 
Other more proactive British firms  however  have analyzed what the new reality means for them   and positioned themselves to combat it accordingly 
Melrose Industries PLC  LON MRON  is one of them 
Melrose Goes Big to Break out of Britain
In an effort to seek exposure outside the U K   the power generation equipment manufacturer agreed last week to acquire Rhode Island based Nortek Inc  NASDAQ NTK  for  86 per share   a chunky 40  premium to the company s value prior to the acquisition announcement 
This normally unremarkable acquisition could be the beginning of a big and profitable trend for U S  investors  as British companies see a sudden and urgent need to diversify out of their home market 
And that s just what Melrose has done  given that Nortek mostly makes home products such as air conditioners  ventilation fans  home security products  and has a growing home automation division  Almost all of its sales come from the United States and Canada 
My one concern is that while Nortek is a solid company that will benefit from new homes and home improvement   86 per share is a steep price for Melrose to pay   over 10 times the company s cash flow 
Investors don t seem to care  though  Melrose shares shot up by nearly as much as Nortek s on news of the acquisition   an indication of just how desperate British shareholders are for their companies to reduce exposure to the U K  market 
And if the deal goes through  it could just be the tip of the iceberg 
Where to Find the Next Wave of Acquisitions
We can expect other British companies with large domestic exposure to make international acquisitions 
And American companies will be the prime beneficiaries of the coming trend  as the country offers the highest number of companies willing to be acquired in an economy that s growing  even if that growth is tepid 
The prime candidates 
Smaller to mid sized companies  with a largely domestic  retail customer base in industries ripe for consolidation and with relatively small exposure to volatile commodities 
Manufacturers like Nortek are squarely in that wheelhouse  but so are many food companies  retailers  insurance companies  entertainment and media companies  and healthcare providers 
Granted  that s a sizeable list  And it s tricky to pinpoint surefire acquisition candidates at the best of times 
But the possibility of a  bracquisition  is certainly something to consider for U S  investors 
For example  perhaps you previously favored U S  companies seeking more exposure to international markets  whereas a more domestic focused firm might now be a better choice 
Or perhaps some sectors you thought were fairly priced may actually be undervalued  due to the possibility of increased M A activity 
A New  British Invasion  
That being said  it would be remiss to not factor in the potential barriers to British led M A activity  too 
Acquisitions are more expensive for British companies  With the pound getting hammered in the wake of the Brexit vote  paying cash for acquisitions  as Melrose is  has suddenly become more expensive for British firms  Those companies will have to come to the same conclusion Melrose did   that it s worth paying extra to diversify outside of the U K
Share for share purchases are out  Very few companies will be open to being acquired for shares trading on one of the most volatile exchanges in the world right now 
Because of the high pound denominated cost of acquisitions  British bidders are vulnerable to counterbids  This could yet happen in the Melrose Nortek deal  where United Technologies Corp  NYSE UTX  was rumored to be interested in the company  too  A bidding war would be good news for Nortek shareholders  of course  but in the longer run  it could discourage future British bids for other companies 
Those concerns aside  though  I m convinced that Melrose s acquisition of Nortek is the first wave of a new  British invasion    one that will be good news for select American shareholders ",2016-07-13,Wall Street Daily,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-brexit-could-spark-a-new-wave-of-m-a-200141505,200141505

reductions in interest rates by European Union nations and other countries  which he says could hurt manufacturing jobs at home  Trump has also said he would slap 35 percent tariffs on air conditioners made in Mexico by United Technologies  NYSE UTX  Corp s Carrier after the company decided to move production there from Indiana  and on Ford Motor  NYSE F  Corp vehicles made in Mexico that are sold in the United States  TAXES Trump has pledged to cut and simplify taxes  Individuals making less than  25 000 per year and married filers earning less than  50 000 would not pay income tax  There would be three other tax brackets  down from seven currently  with a top marginal income tax rate of 25 percent  and a top rate for long term capital gains and dividends of 20 percent  The current top marginal income tax rate is 39 6 percent and the current top rate for long term capital gains is 20 percent  Deductions for charitable giving and mortgage interest would remain unchanged

insurance premiums from income tax  He would move to allow insurance companies to sell plans across state lines to spur competition   He would allow individuals to use tax free Health Savings Accounts  which he says should be allowed to accumulate and be passed on to a person s heirs  Currently  Health Savings Accounts  which were created as part of Obamacare  can be used only with high deductible health plans  They are tax free and can accumulate and be rolled over into a retirement account when a person is ready for Medicare  Trump has said he could save the government  300 billion by

family members of Islamic State militants and would like to shut down  areas  of the Internet to try to stop the group from recruiting members  He wants to build a  safe zone  for Syrian refugees in

And that is what is happening today  With a mini Golden Cross  20 day SMA crossing up through the 100 day SMA  the price is building a bullish engulfing Candlestick  This is a signal of a further move higher  But as I write this the candle is also a Marubozu  This candle without an upper shadow shows string intraday price movement higher and adds weight the Engulfing candle  With the RSI turning back higher after touching the mid line  and the Bollinger Bands  rising  the picture to the upside is complete  Look for a move over 101 to join the climb higher ",2015-11-13,Gregory W.

188326,409842,UTX,United Technologies Shows Clear Structure,opinion,"After reaching 101 00 in the beginning of November  United Technologies Corp  N UTX   stock started declining again  It has been trading near the 93 dollar mark recently  but should we expect more weakness or the bulls are about to return soon  The chart below might help us find the answer 

As visible  the top of 101 00 marks the end of a nice five wave impulse  This means the current pull back is just the three wave correction  which naturally follows every impulse  It appears to be close to finding bottom  So  the 5 3 wave cycle would be complete soon  According to the Elliott Wave Principle  we should expect prices to continue in the direction of the five wave sequence   to the north  Wave  C  has the potential to take United Technologies stock above 101 00  But why are we speaking about wave  C   Why did we mark the cycle  A  and  B   instead of  1  and  2   The daily chart below will tell you why 
Because there is a larger impulsive decline from 124 41 to 85 47 on the daily chart  Therefore  the recovery on the hourly chart is just a part of the  A   B   C  correction to this impulsive sell off  So  we are talking about different degrees of trend here  The trend might be bullish on the hourly chart  but it is bearish on the daily  Once wave  C  to the upside is over  the bears could be expected to grab the wheel again  United Technologies stock may see higher prices soon  but investors should not be misled  because the advance is likely to be short lived ",2015-12-13,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/united-technologies-shows-clear-structure-375645,375645
188327,409843,UTX,Top Trade Ideas For The Week December 28  2015  UTX,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
United Technologies  N UTX   has its hands in many complex systems and companies in the aerospace industry  It makes things that fly but its stock certainly has not been doing that lately  Since June it had lost nearly 30  of its value before bouncing in October  That bounce found resistance just above the round number 100 at 101 and pulled back again 
The last pullback retraced 61 8  of the bounce and then turned back higher last week  This formed a higher low  A positive for the stock  The rounded bottom on the pullback is also a good signal  The stock has support for a move higher from the positive and bullish momentum indicators  The RSI is moving into the bullish zone as it rises while the MACD is crossed up and rising 
There is resistance above at 98 40 and 101 followed by 104 40 and a gap to fill to 109 40  Support lower comes at 92 30 and 90 90  Short interest is moderate at 6 1  and the company is expected to report earnings next on January 27th 
Checking the options chains reveals weekly chains  The December 31st Expiry has the highest open interest at the 95 and 100 strikes on the call side  The January monthly options show very large open interest at the 85 put strike and then similar but smaller by a factor of 2 size at each of the 90  95  97 5  100 and 105 strikes  Moving to the January 29th expiry  beyond earnings  sees little open interest at this point  Finally in February monthly options the open interest is much large on the call side and from 95 to 105 
United Technologies  Ticker  UTX
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock now  over 95  with a stop at 92  A straight stock trade 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock now with a January 29 Expiry 94 88 Put Spread  100 Covered Call Collar  38 cents   Adding protection through earnings with a collar to the stock trade 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the January 96 5 100 Call Spread   1 10   A defined risk way to participate in upside 
Trade Idea 4  Buy the January 96 5 97 5 Call Spread  57 cents  and sell the January 94 Put  62 cents  for a 5 cent credit  A short term leveraged trade for those comfortable owning the stock at 94 
Trade Idea 5  Buy the January January 29 Expiry 97 5 Call Calendar  69 cents   A trade for upside on earnings but not before January monthly expiry 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which  heading into another holiday shortened week  and one that should prove to be very light on everything  sees the equity markets have rebounded but are still looking vulnerable  especially the SPY 
Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate in its downtrend while Crude Oil continues a bounce in its downtrend  The US Dollar Index looks to be weaker short term in consolidation while US Treasuries consolidate  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue consolidation with an upward bias while Emerging Markets bounce in their consolidation of the downward move 
Volatility looks to remain Subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s N SPY  N IWM and O QQQ  Their charts agree with that in the short term with the IWM looking the strongest  In the intermediate term the SPY looks weakest while the IWM and QQQ continue the sideways churn  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

188372,409888,UTX,Inflation Still Lacking With FTSE Looking Toppy,opinion,"UK inflation  as expected slipped back to zero last month as prices in clothing  food and fuel continued to falter  Oil prices  on the back the Iran deal look set to be even softer over the coming months and this may delay any monetary tightening from the BOE 
This has been the case since February and when taken in context of wage growth  which has risen at the fastest pace in almost eight years  it s actually a positive for the UK economy  It s expected that real pay growth around 3  will be sustainable for the next couple of years and may well push towards the pre crisis growth of 4 5  by 2017 
Last week s Budget tends to present a mixed outlook  The cap of 1  on public sector pay  despite low current inflation levels could take its toll  Productivity growth needs to recover  Should this not materialise and wage growth continues its trajectory  we may well see the MPC forced to accelerate its tightening timeline  Some policymakers  including Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty  have hinted that they could start calling for rates to rise from a record low of 0 5  in the coming months  Markets are pricing in a 65  probability of a rate hike by year end
Cable has barely moved but a strong Spanish bond auction has elevated the euro slightly against the pound in early trade but while below the 0 7150 level  the trend should favour a weaker euro  Industrial production in the euro area rose 1 6  year on year but slowed on the month  Investor expectations saw a print of 29 7 versus the consensus for 29  For now  any contagion risk from Greece seems to be waning 
The UK benchmark is beginning to look a little toppy at current levels  The fact that the main gainers in the FTSE have been of the defensive variety should signal a warning  Mark Carney is due to speak later and may offer some clues as to when we can expect a rate hike

Meggit   2 7   Bid speculation has sent the defence and aerospace engineer to the top of the UK benchmark today  Rothschild  its financial adviser is said to be drawing up potential defence plans  Meggitt s appointment of Sir Nigel Rudd as chairman in April stoked speculation that it could be a bid target  United Technologies  NYSE UTX  and Honeywell are seen as being among the potential buyers  Since March  the share price has fallen dramatically by some 23  but has seen some bargain hunting at the 450p level  Average broker target price is 540p 
Michael Page   2 52   despite record sales in high potential markets  FX headwinds have made found their mark  A slowdown in its Asia Pacific region is also weighing  The recruitment firm reported a 6  like for like gross profit rise to  145 3m   204 73m   224 81m  in the second quarter of its 2015 financial year on 14 July  The EMEA gross profit as reported grew by 0 6  year by year  but the company said it went up by 11 4  on a constant basis

SKY PLC  LONDON SKYB   1 76   Raised to buy by Deutsche Bank  Also trading at an all time high  and up 23  year to date  DB clearly see additional upside for the company  Strong resistance at 1110p may see the stock decline before a move higher  Support found around the 1060 p level

Iran deal rises the probability of a BoC cut on July meeting
Oil slides 2  on news that a nuclear deal with Iran has finally been reached  Iran  OPEC s second largest producer  is now getting ready to step in the oversupplied oil market to boost competition  The 60  slide in the oil market over the past year has significantly tightened the profit margins and already pushed several players out of the market  The Saudi s determination to expand its market share has already been a heavy weight on the global players  shoulders  As Iran warms up to enter the game  its capacity to flood the market and its competitive advantage in a market suffering from tight profit margins could only drive competition out of the door  Iranian Oil Minister says a million barrel could be added within 7 months  Get prepared for another wave of weakness in oil markets 
The Iran deal has been the catalyst for the Canadian dollar weakness versus the US dollar  USD CAD hit 1 28 for the first time since March 18  The market requires lower rates from the bank of Canada in anticipation of further debasement in the oil market  The Iran deal increases the probability of a 25 basis point cut in July 15 MPC meeting  It is just a matter of time before the USD CAD hits the 1 30 for the first time in more than six years 
Asymmetry in Greek deal could cost more to the EU
The asymmetry of deal that Greece has accepted raises several questions on how healthy is this deal for Greece and the EU  First  Greece has been constrained to accept a more coercing deal than the one that has got rejected by the population on July 5 referendum  The EU menaces outweighed democracy at its birth place  Second  the sovereignty of member states is highly questionable and could lead to a rising risk of political contagion  In the absence of which  Germany   the major winner on the euro deal   could expand its financial and diplomatic power across Europe  Third  the political squeeze in Greece could revive reactions in the UK and increase the mass of non EU partisans  A potential Grexit from the EU could be an expensive bill for the EU  The strategic mistake from Germany   that has showed a disproportional and excessive power in Greek negotiations   could lead to further instability within the economic union 
Greece paid back Yen 11 7 billion of samurais yesterday  yet is not expected to pay the Eur 450 million due to the IMF on Monday 
Greek PM Tsipras has until tomorrow to get the EU deal approved by the Parliament and avoid a default on its 3 5 billion euro bond repayment to the ECB on July 20  Same old  just another chapter in the story of an unhappy union

The Hartford based multinational conglomerate  which has a market value of more than  100 billion  will engage in a lengthy review on whether to sell Sikorsky Aircraft  one of the world s largest helicopter manufacturers  The process could be completed by the end of the year  Hayes said 
Besides producing the legendary Black Hawk  Sikorsky is also the manufacturer of the Presidential Marine One helicopter and a host of other defense aircrafts  Sikorsky  the largest helicopter producer in the United States  derives more than two thirds of its sales from defense contracts 
 Today  Sikorsky is a world leader in the design  manufacture and service of military and commercial helicopter platforms  It has unmatched technological capabilities  outstanding people and a strong backlog   Hayes said in a statement   Looking to the future  we are evaluating whether Sikorsky s unique business as a rotorcraft OEM with a predominately military customer base is best positioned as a stand alone company  and whether a separation would allow United Technologies to better focus on providing high technology systems and services to the aerospace and building industries

188663,410179,UTX,China signs deal to purchase 123 Airbus helicopters,news,"By Andreas Rinke and Tim Hepher BEIJING PARIS  Reuters    Airbus Group NV s  PA AIR  helicopter division sealed a  600 million deal on Monday to sell 123 helicopters to Chinese companies during a visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel 
The orders  including both light single engine helicopters from Airbus Helicopters  Ecureuil family and the light twin engine EC135  are being placed by three Chinese general aviation service providers  the company said 
The deal is among the biggest since China recently relaxed restrictions on low altitude flying in its mainly military controlled airspace 
The easing of controls has fueled projections of a sharp increase of orders to fill a gap in one of the world s major untapped markets for helicopters and general aviation 
 We think these first sizeable contracts are signals that this market is starting to take off   said Guillaume Faury  chief executive of Airbus Helicopters 
 Today there are 350 civil helicopters flying in China  In Europe there are 10 0000 and in the U S  there are 12 000  Therefore the market potential for helicopters in China is huge   he said in a telephone interview 
China currently buys about 50 helicopters a year out of an annual global market for 800 civilian helicopters  according to estimates by Airbus Helicopters  formerly known as Eurocopter 
By 2020  its purchases are expected to quadruple to 200 a year and by then  instead of 6 7 percent of the global market  it is expected to make up 20 percent of demand  Faury said 
 This means a significant shift in the market and we will of course be open to opportunities to keep investing in China and to continue to be present  not only commercially but industrially  as the market continues to flourish   Faury said 
Airbus Helicopters  part of the Franco German Airbus Group  PA AIR   co operates with China s industry on two programs  the EC120 light helicopter and EC175 medium helicopter 
The world s largest civil helicopter maker has a market share of 40 percent in China but expects this to rise as the country s buyers prioritize light single engined and light twin engined rotorcraft   two segments in which it has most sales 
Airbus Helicopters is initially targeting a Chinese market share of 50 percent  Faury said  But it is seen as facing stiff competition from Anglo Italian rival AgustaWestland  MI SIFI  and U S  Sikorsky  a unit of United Technologies  N UTX  
China could also be ready to build its own civil helicopter from scratch by the end of the decade  Western experts say  as it seeks to strengthen its bid to become a new aviation power 
In other aviation business during Merkel s visit  Germany s Deutsche Lufthansa AG  DE LHAG  and China s flag carrier  Air China Ltd  SS 601111   signed a provisional deal to expand their partnership ahead of a possible commercial joint venture 

The two Star Alliance members also said they were working to offer better flight connections  particularly on China Europe routes  and expand collaboration in maintenance and services 
But planemaker Airbus did not announce jet orders  as some in the industry had predicted  and the expected purchase of dozens of A320 family jets could now be postponed until further contacts between German and Chinese officials in October
