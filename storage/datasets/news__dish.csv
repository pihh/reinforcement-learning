157749,379265,DISH,Boost founder says willing to pay up to  2 billion to buy brand from Sprint,news,"By Sheila Dang
 Reuters    Boost Mobile founder Peter Adderton is willing to pay up to  2 billion to buy back the prepaid wireless brand from Sprint Corp  N S   he told Reuters on Monday  a significant potential premium to what satellite TV provider Dish Network  O DISH  agreed to pay for Sprint s entire prepaid wireless business 
U S  regulators approved Sprint s  26 5 billion merger with larger rival T Mobile US Inc  O TMUS  in July  As a concession to regulators  the companies agreed to sell Sprint s prepaid wireless business  which includes the Boost and Virgin Mobile brands  to Dish for  1 4 billion  as well as sell some wireless spectrum  or airwaves that carry data  to Dish for  3 6 billion 
The merger still faces a lawsuit by state attorneys general that alleges the merger is harmful to consumers 
T Mobile and Sprint are currently re negotiating terms of their merger agreement  which had expired on Nov  1  providing a window of opportunity to make the offer  Adderton said 
T Mobile Chief Executive John Legere earlier this month declined to rule out requesting the  26 billion price be reduced as part of the negotiations 
Ever since the merger between T Mobile and Sprint was announced last year  Adderton has been outspoken on Twitter that the combination would harm lower income consumers who depend on prepaid phones  where users pay for phone service at the beginning of the month and are not required to pass a credit check 
Adderton has also questioned Dish s commitment to serving Boost customers  as the satellite company has focused its priorities on building a next generation 5G wireless network

157751,379267,DISH,Democratic lawmaker presses antitrust enforcers on company ties  settlements,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    The chair of the U S  House of Representatives antitrust subcommittee pressed top regulators on Tuesday over merger decisions  including the Justice Department s approval of T Mobile US Inc s  O TMUS  proposed purchase of Sprint Corp  N S  
Congressman David Cicilline raised antitrust questions as activists and Democratic presidential candidates are advocating for more aggressive enforcement of rules governing market concentration and corporate behavior 
In questions posted on a House website  Cicilline asked Makan Delrahim  head of the Justice Department s Antitrust Division  about text messages he had sent to Dish Network Corp  O DISH  Chairman Charlie Ergen  who plans to buy assets that T Mobile and Sprint would sell as part of an agreement to win federal approval for their deal 
The planned merger of the third and fourth largest wireless providers is being challenged by state attorneys general  led by California and New York  A trial in New York is underway 
Cicilline noted that Delrahim wrote to Ergen   Today would be a good day to have your Senator friends contact the chairman   a reference to the chair of the Federal Communications Commission which has since approved the merger 
Cicilline asked Delrahim if he had offered lobbying advice to other merging companies and if it was appropriate to offer such advice 
Cicilline also pressed the antitrust chief on a report that the Trump administration has brought fewer criminal antitrust cases  essentially price fixing  than any in 50 years   Is it your view that market participants are no longer engaging in price fixing at the rates they previously had   Cicilline asked 
Cicilline asked Federal Trade Commission Chairman Joe Simons about the November approval of Bristol Myers Squibb Co s  N BMY   74 billion purchase of Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  on the condition it divest the drug Otezla 
Cicilline asked the agency whether its practice of focusing on product overlap is enough when analyzing this and other pharmaceutical mergers 
Cicilline also pressed Simons on the FTC s record  5 billion settlement with  Facebook Inc   O FB  for the social media company s violation of an earlier settlement with the agency  He cited criticism that Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg was not held responsible for the order violations

157752,379268,DISH,DISH Network CEO s Cost Savings Claims Don t Add Up,news,"Over the course of the past six months or so  a debate has swirled around DISH Network  NASDAQ DISH   The company s co founder and board chairman Charlie Ergen has suggested the organization could build the infrastructure necessary to power an entire wireless telecom network for a modest  10 billion  The key  he explained  would be the utilization of software rather than hardware  which lowers upfront costs between 40  and 60   Meanwhile  MoffettNathanson s senior analyst Craig Moffett unofficially led a chorus of critics suggesting that estimate was alarmingly low  In his words   The idea that DISH might spend  10 billion  their own estimate on previous conference calls  and then somehow be finished is  well  just silly   Moffett underscored his assessment by adding   Verizon spends  15 billion annually to maintain a network that they ve already built  
The financial truth is likely somewhere in between  While  10 billion might underestimate DISH s total cost of getting into the wireless business should Sprint and T Mobile finally consummate their long awaited union  virtualized networks rather than dedicated hardware with a relatively short lifespan probably does represent some degree of cost savings 
The problem is that roughly two thirds of AT T s  NYSE T  wireless network is now virtualized  but the move hasn t measurably lowered the telco s total capital spending or operating costs 

AT T s software driven shift hasn t driven savings
Given the choice  network operators like the idea of a software driven blank slate over hardware dependent infrastructure  Upgrades and repairs to a purely physical system often require workers climbing up towers with new technology  whereas virtual networks can be updated and integrated remotely with just a few keystrokes  That s where Ergen says DISH can save money  Others are skeptical 
It s not as if investors and industry insiders can only guess as to the benefits of virtualization  though  AT T has been virtualizing its wireless network since 2016  with 65  of it being software defined as of the end of last year  If there are any meaningful net savings to the shift  they re not evident in any of the company s  relative  numbers 
That s not necessarily an idea easy to ferret out with just a cursory glance  AT T isn t just mobile phones  It s also landlines  and television  and  as of 2018  it s also HBO and Time Warner  The company doesn t break out capital spending by division  Of all its arms  though  mobility is still the single biggest    accounting for about one third of its total revenue    and easily the most cost intensive in terms of capital requirements  Of the  20 billion earmarked for capital investments in 2020  the bulk of it is intended to expand its 5G service as well as build the underlying fiber optic network that 5G and the Internet of Things will ultimately necessitate 
Any noteworthy savings just aren t there     not yet  anyway  As a percentage of revenue  the third quarter s 11 5  worth of spending on property and equipment is more or less in line with the past four years  each of which saw AT T wade deeper into virtualization water  The proportion may have lowered  relatively  in 2018  That s only because of the addition of Time Warner into the mix  though  which didn t require a great deal of additional capital spending 

The shift hasn t dramatically lowered operating expenses for AT T s mobility division either  The company spent 56 2  of Q3 s wireless revenue just to keep its network up and running  but that s in line with operating expense levels we ve seen since 2016 

Ergen has also noted that existing wireless providers are still servicing legacy 3G and even 2G connections  and he s right  Nevertheless  with three fourths of its network now virtualized  one would have expected AT T to at least show some sort of measurable savings by now 
Virtualization isn t a panacea
If software defined networks are truly cheaper to plug in  then where s the money going  Aside from the modest expense linked to its lingering 3G and 2G connections  AT T s financials point to a concern voiced by Ovum s principal analyst Daryl Schoolar last year when Ergen s idea moved into the spotlight  Schoolar explains   There s a sense also that it probably costs you more money on the network services and integration side  You have to spend more money there integrating more disparate vendors together   ACG Research s lead analyst Chris Nicoll echoed the idea  warning   They better find an excellent systems integrator to help them along  
In that vein  AT T has done a great deal to ensure its software driven network works as well as it needs to  It created its very own digital engine  called ECOMP  enhanced control  orchestration  management   policy   specifically aimed at making the company s virtualization ambitions a reality  In 2017  the company released its home grown ONAP  open networking automation platform  open source coding to help hardware vendors better meet AT T s unique needs  Even then  the company concedes that the closer it gets to its 2022 goal of 100  virtualization  the more difficult it s become to continue moving forward 
It would be short sighted to think DISH Network won t bump into a similar  unexpected headwind 
It s possible one could look at AT T s CapEx and mobile operational spending trend and say there s a tiny amount of progress being made  One could also argue all of the prospective savings associated with virtualization lie ahead  After four years of steady progress down the virtualization road for AT T  though  something demonstrable should have fallen into place by now  It s just not there  DISH  as well as AT T investors  should be asking why 
The good news in all this  Carriers can do a whole lot more for consumers with software minded networks than they could with hardware driven networks ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfek6,2054885

157754,379270,DISH,DISH Network Is Hoping to Join the Communication Services Big League,news,"Over the last several months  the merger between telecoms T Mobile US  NASDAQ TMUS  and Sprint  NYSE S  has been inching along through a variety of legal hurdles  Several state attorneys general are still arguing in court that the merger should be blocked  as it would further consolidate power in the industry  reducing competition and potentially hurting consumers  A federal judge will likely rule on the case in the next few weeks 
The most affected investors are likely those holding Sprint stock  which has seen a price fall of some 40  over the last six months   But the biggest winner of the deal may actually be DISH Network  NASDAQ DISH   As part of the merger agreement  Sprint s prepaid business and some wireless spectrum will be sold to DISH  By taking over Sprint s assets  DISH will be in a good position to expand from a media content provider into a diversified provider of media and telecom services  in the same league as AT T  
While still uncertain  signs point to the merger between T Mobile and Sprint eventually going through  When that happens  DISH will effectively catapult itself from a satellite TV provider operating in a slow growth market into a diversified communications company competing as a major contender in the faster growing national wireless market  Furthermore  DISH will be categorized not as a stock in the media and entertainment sector  but rather into a new  bigger  broader investing sector  communication services  This new classification  developed by investment outfits like MSCI and S P Dow Jones  accounts for 10 4  of the S P 500  compared to 2 8  for telecom  and significantly opens up interest from deep pocketed groups of interested investors  That s good news for DISH 

Punching above its weight and now a national contender
DISH Network has long been planning to make the leap and become a national wireless carrier  As part of the merger deal announced in 2019  Dish will buy the Sprint mobile brands  Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile  as well as pay  3 5 billion for a portion of T Mobile s spectrum licenses  Prior to the agreement  DISH did not offer cellphone service  with the deal  DISH inherits 9 million new prepaid wireless subscribers  From Sprint  DISH will acquire 14 MHz of its 800 MHz spectrum for  3 6 billion within three years  In addition  T Mobile will be required to offer access to its wireless network on a wholesale basis to DISH for a period of seven years  in order for DISH to strengthen its market presence and provide more competition and choice to consumers  
The new assets will certainly put DISH in a highly competitive position  The 800MHz wireless spectrum is low band and designed for better building penetration and coverage  The new 800MHz spectrum will also work perfectly with DISH s current 600MHz and 700MHz low band spectrum  More spectrum band and better coverage will only strengthen DISH s ability to grow subscriber numbers beyond Sprint s present levels  Some 400 Sprint employees will be transferred to DISH  along with the use of Sprint s nationwide network of 7 500 retail outlets 
 New T Mobile  will also give DISH Network access to up to 20 000 of its decommissioned cell sites by 2023  To make certain those sites are available to the consumer market  DISH will be required to build additional sites  and commit to covering 70  of the national market with 5G broadband service 
By taking on these assets to create a fourth U S  presence in the wireless sector  DISH demonstrates far greater ambitions than your average satellite TV provider  Over the last decade  DISH has been steadily spending to build a bare bones 5G network  using spectrum rights it acquired in periodic acquisitions  Building up telecom assets that produce no actual revenue shows how determined    or foolish  depending on how you look at it    DISH has been to become a major contender 
DISH Network co founder and chairman Charlie Ergen has often told analysts about his grand plans to build capacity  compete against the incumbent national wireless players  and become a contender in 5G  Ergen has long been aware that the satellite TV market is facing tough times  Horizontal expansion into better  hotter markets is essential for DISH  Since 2010  Ergen has spent billions amassing wireless spectrum in various acquisitions to assemble the new business  Getting all of its telecom assets up and running will also eliminate a regulatory concern that has been hanging over DISH  If the spectrum it currently controls continues to go unused  DISH risks losing its license from the FCC  Federal Communications Commission  to operate the spectrum 
Last November  to finance the acquisition of new telecom assets  DISH announced a rights offering to raise proceeds of approximately  1 billion  The proceeds from the rights offering  as well as anticipated proceeds from new common stock  are intended to be used for investments in the wireless business 
A new classification and a new era
A third party content provider like DISH Network can aggressively leverage the complex synergy between media and telecom  The years long rollout of 5G wireless services  and the new services that rollout makes possible  create an environment where virtually every smartphone subscriber in the U S  can generate revenue for both the telecom business and the media business  And DISH wants to be one of the few communication services conglomerates positioned across sectors  so it can tap into that combined revenue stream 
By integrating and growing Sprint s telecom assets  DISH could be able to stream and monetize content over every screen in America    whether TV  laptop  tablet  or phone  DISH recognized the potential of cross sector horizontal growth when it launched Sling TV  one of the first  over the top  internet TV providers that began the trend of cord cutting  eliminating all subscriptions to broadcast TV  in favor of internet delivered content  The cord cutting trend presented an existential threat to traditional cable media providers  But for DISH  internet TV was the beginning of a new era of innovation  opportunity  and growth 
After acquiring Sprint s assets  DISH will likely have more opportunities to grow top line revenue and income by strategically acquiring even more telecom operators 
Sprint is only a first step
The media and telecom industry is undergoing enormous disruption in technology and demographics  The consumer market is slowly moving away from traditional media providers  and is fanning out to access content through a myriad of channels  Taking over Sprint s assets allows DISH Network to expand far beyond the confines of the satellite TV market  More significantly  DISH will make the first aggressive step into a consumer media market that combines a complex mix of telecom  content  and broadcasting 
Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   similarly  was one of the very first hybrid media companies that saw the long term potential in the synergies between telecom  internet  and digital content  Netflix is now competing against traditional broadcasters and Hollywood studios as a major content creator  However  it may still be some years before those synergies deliver hard results  and for the stock market to fully understand the potential of Netflix s unusual hybrid model  Netflix stock underperformed the market for its first decade of existence  but since 2010  Netflix stock has rocketed up by over 4 200  
DISH Network stock may not launch into orbit the way Netflix stock did  but its growth potential makes it a good long term hold  With this merger deal  DISH will likely emerge as an eventual winner in the complicated and broad new industrial sector of communication services ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqwyt,2075480

157777,379293,DISH,Dish Network  DISH  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q4 Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Dish Network  DISH  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This satellite television provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 62 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 1  
Revenues are expected to be  3 17 billion  down 4 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 7 88  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Dish 
For Dish  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 94  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Dish will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Dish would post earnings of  0 59 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 66  delivering a surprise of  11 86  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Dish appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-02-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dish-network-dish-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4-release-200504924,200504924

157817,379333,DISH,Can T Mobile   Sprint Clear The Long Awaited Merger Trial ,opinion,After a long period of uncertainty  telecom giants   T Mobile US  Inc    NYSE S   and Sprint Corporation   NYSE S     are currently facing a landmark trial from certain state attorney generals  aiming to prevent the  26 5 billion megamerger deal  Notably  this federal trial is the outcome of an alliance of 14 Democratic state attorneys general  AGs   who believe that the proposed deal will threaten competitive market in the U S  wireless industry  affecting customers and escalating costs While the deal has already received approval from the Department of Justice and Federal Communications Commission  FCC   the plaintiffs argue that the wireless industry is already too consolidated to squeeze four major competitors   AT T Inc    NYSE T    Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    T Mobile and Sprint to three The telecom bigwigs  however  argue that such consolidation will rather emphasize strong broadband Internet access with the rollout of ultra fast 5G mobile data to more than 90 million U S  customers  They further believe that the proposed blockbuster deal will bring in healthy competition and create new cost saving plan for customers  catapulting T Mobile s position to the second largest U S  carrier Per media reports  T Mobile s CEO stated that the new T Mobile would refrain from increasing the prices of their plans post the closure of the deal  reinforcing cost saving plans such as  15 month prepaid plan that includes 2 gigabytes of mobile data  However  U S  District Judge  Victor Marrero  stated that such deal can only augment the prices of the cellphone plans  leaving customers with limited choices in the long run This July  T Mobile and Sprint had received the Justice Department s approval for the deal as DISH Network Corp  NASDAQ DISH   agreed to pay  5 billion for their wireless assets  Dish received a seven year agreement to sell T Mobile s wireless service under its brand  The terms also include a three year service agreement from T Mobile to provide operational support as prepaid customers move to Dish However  the AGs are of the opinion that instead of demonstrating its ability to establish a nationwide wireless network  Dish is especially known for its history of accumulating FCC licenses  As a result  the satellite TV provider will be liable to pay fines up to  2 2 billion if its 5G wireless network fails to cover at least 70  of the U S  population by June 2023 What to Expect Given the major apprehension surrounding Dish s history of amassing FCC licenses  it is likely that Charlie Ergen  cofounder and chairman of Dish Networks  will be questioned by the coalition of the AGs  whether it will be able to diversify and scale up its operations to compete in the long run by replacing Sprint as the fourth largest carrier in the United States Despite T Mobile s success at winning votes from Texas  Mississippi and Colorado  state officials representing 40  of the U S  population still oppose the deal  The opposition list includes AGs from Connecticut  Illinois  Massachusetts  Michigan  Oregon  Pennsylvania and Washington  DC  to name a few  The trial is expected to last two weeks and Sprint Chairman  Marcelo Claure  and T Mobile CEO  John Legere  are all set to take their respective stance against the AGs  The trial  which is considered to be the concluding hurdle for the company  will ultimately decide the telecom bellwether s fate to deploy faster and seamless 5G technology across the country  thereby benefiting the larger population Wrapping UpMarkedly  the combination of the two networks is expected to fill coverage gaps and provide more 5G connectivity  helping the company to devote more resources toward building new 5G infrastructure  According to media reports  the merged company would roll out 5G technology to 97  of Americans  including 85  of rural locales Nonetheless  the state litigators are concerned about competition in the greater telecom space  even as officials from each of the companies stated that the deal will keep a control on prices for three years  Jobs are another major area of focus as the deal will likely harm independent wireless dealers  leading to a substantial loss of retail jobs and lower pay for workers Currently  T Mobile has long term

157818,379334,DISH,Tap These 7 Value Stocks With Impressive Price to Sales Ratios,opinion,When considering valuation metrics  price to earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice  This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy  However  price to sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits While a loss making company with a negative price to earnings ratio falls out of investor favor  its price to sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued A stock s price to sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company If the price to sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So  it goes without saying that a stock with a price to sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth   Thus  a stock with a lower price to sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price to sales ratio Price to sales is often preferred over price to earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low price to sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance  rise in market cap and ultimately a higher price to sales ratio In any case  the price to sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book and Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry  The lower the price to sales ratio  the better Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry  The lower  the better Price to Book  common Equity  less than Median Price to Book for its Industry  This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock Debt to Equity  Most Recent  less than

157841,379357,DISH,Analysts Estimate Dish Network  DISH  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Dish Network  DISH  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This satellite television provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 59 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  28 1  
Revenues are expected to be  3 14 billion  down 7 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Dish 
For Dish  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  1 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Dish will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Dish would post earnings of  0 66 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 60  delivering a surprise of  9 09  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Dish doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-dish-network-dish-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200480122,200480122

What s Next for Dish 
While Dish has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

157864,379380,DISH,Are Investors Undervaluing Dish Network  DISH  Right Now ,opinion,"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks  we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies  With this in mind  we are always looking at value  growth  and momentum trends to discover great companies 
Of these  value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  Value investors use a variety of methods  including tried and true valuation metrics  to find these stocks 
On top of the Zacks Rank  investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will want to focus on the  Value  category  Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and  A  grades for Value will be some of the highest quality value stocks on the market today 
One company value investors might notice is Dish Network  DISH   DISH is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as a Value grade of A  The stock holds a P E ratio of 18  while its industry has an average P E of 18 64  DISH s Forward P E has been as high as 21 68 and as low as 8 35  with a median of 14 29  all within the past year 
Investors should also recognize that DISH has a P B ratio of 1 83  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This stock s P B looks attractive against its industry s average P B of 3 17  Within the past 52 weeks  DISH s P B has been as high as 2 22 and as low as 1 36  with a median of 1 79 
Value investors also frequently use the P S ratio  This metric is found by dividing a stock s price with the company s revenue  This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  so they are often considered a better performance indicator  DISH has a P S ratio of 1 33  This compares to its industry s average P S of 2 26 
Finally  investors should note that DISH has a P CF ratio of 9 24  This metric focuses on a firm s operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook  This stock s P CF looks attractive against its industry s average P CF of 9 99  Within the past 12 months  DISH s P CF has been as high as 11 01 and as low as 3 76  with a median of 6 54 
These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at  but they help show that Dish Network is likely being undervalued right now  Considering this  as well as the strength of its earnings outlook  DISH feels like a great value stock at the moment ",2019-09-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-investors-undervaluing-dish-network-dish-right-now-200463725,200463725

157887,379403,DISH,DISH Network On Cusp Of Longer Term Trend Higher,opinion,"Investors in DISH Network Corporation  NASDAQ DISH  would do well to turn off their TV sets and start watching this stock right now  as it is on the cusp of breaking free and developing a longer term trend higher  based on some volume price analysis lessons  And perhaps this is the place to start 
As always in any rally higher  there is selling as profits are crystallized  In such weeks  and where primary indices may also be the driving force  any move to the downside could signal a reversal in sentiment  or at the least a congestion phase to build  However  for this stock  on two occasions where we saw a strong move lower  this was followed by recovery with the weekly candle closing with a narrow body and deep lower wick  but more importantly with high volume  The first of these occurred in February with the stock holding above  30  and the second last month and on this occasion closing above  34 and balanced on the volume point of control as denoted by the yellow dashed line  Note the volume on both candles  it was high or very high signalling strong buying by what is sometimes known as the  smart money   The last of these reactions has been followed by two weeks of rising price action combined with rising volume 
So where next for this stock  and here we need to focus on the  38 to  42 price area which is positive for investors for two reasons  First  volume on the volume point of control histogram is falling away quickly in this region  and so presents a weak barrier to any move higher  Second  price resistance is also very weak with only two levels in place  one just below  40 and the other just above  42  But notice how thin these lines are  They have only been tested once in the past and therefore represent a weak area of potential price resistance and once broken the next significant resistance and major level awaits at  45 where we have the blue dashed line of the accumulation and distribution indicator  So several positives for longer term investors in this stock  Finally  note the Trend Monitor indicator remains firmly blue confirming the bullish sentiment 
Moving to the EPS reports for DISH  last year was an excellent one with just a miss in the final quarter  followed by a recovery in March as the consensus forecast was met at  0 65  and if last year s results are repeated  the EPS next time may surprise the markets once again with better then expected data ",2019-06-13,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/for-dish-investors-stop-watching-tv-and-start-watching-the-stock-200431124,200431124
157888,379404,DISH,FX  Crypto  Markets  Stock Volatility Expected Ahead Of Fed Meeting ,opinion,"Forex Market Overview
Last week was surprisingly productive for the US dollar  which found itself outperforming all other major currencies  With plenty of announcements  reports  and decisions from the government and Federal Reserve on the horizon  the dollar will remain a currency worth watching 
The Canadian dollar also exceeded many trader s expectations  especially during a time where petroleum prices have been unpredictable  Meanwhile  the euro and Swiss franc had sluggish weeks  which was largely caused by a stimulant avoidant European Central Bank 
While the Japanese yen and British pound both had positive movements last week even in the face of growing Brexit tensions the Australian and New Zealand dollars saw quite a bit of undesirable movement  Following several negative reports  New Zealand is hoping that upcoming GDP announcements can effectively change their fortune  As we continue to move to the close of another quarter  keep an eye on quarterly reports from the world s top currencies 
Taking a Closer Look at AUD JPY
On the charts  the AUD JPY pair has officially broken below the key support level of 75 20  which may have opened doors for further drops towards the lows of January s flash crash at around 72  This has been a key support since 2009  so unless a full on trade war breaks out the reck the international economies  we re expecting the pair would rebound after testing this level 
AUD JPY Technical Analysis on Monthly Chart   Approaching Key Support Below Ichimoku Cloud
The pair remains below the Ichimoku Cloud across all time frames 
Crypto Market Overview
The main story coming from the crypto industry last week was Facebook s talks of introducing its own blockchain called GlobalCoin  Though there still are plenty of details that need to be figured out  the prospect of one of will undeniably benefit the industry as a whole 
Of course  we have Doctor Dooms of the world such as Nouriel Roubini who says this has nothing to do with Bitcoin  but we tend to ignore them  Unsurprisingly  most coins had a positive week last week  reflecting Bitcoin s rise of more than  1 000  Though a lot of this progress was simply making up for ground lost the week before  Bitcoin has once again broken the  9 000 and has reached a new high for the year 
On a more negative note  roughly 40 different cryptocurrencies are currently dealing with regulatory issues coming from FINRA  Though these conflicts may have added some barriers to entering the industry  they may also force FINRA to some important questions that are yet to be answered 
Elsewhere in the crypto industry  Russia s central bank announced its own interest in creating a digital currency  This news  interestingly  coincided with breaking news of Russian hackers conducting the largest instance of crypto theft to date 
Stock Market Overview
The S P 500 experienced a bit of a down week last week  dipping below 2 900 points last Tuesday and remaining below that mark for the rest of the week  Other major American exchanges experienced mildly depressing weeks as well  largely due to ongoing geopolitical issues and falling oil prices 
Most analysts are predicting above average levels of volatility early in the week as traders eagerly prepare for announcements from the Fed  Following the Fed s next meeting  which is scheduled for this Wednesday  prices may break out into a new range 
Stocks To Watch   
Following actions from the United States government  Chinese tech giant Huawei is expected to lose roughly  30 billion in future revenues  The company has remained at the center of a US China trade conflict that is yet to be resolved  As the world s two largest economies  we ll pay close attention to this story over the next few weeks 
Lastly  Sprint  NYSE S  and T Mobile  NASDAQ TMUS  are inching closer to a merger deal  though there are still many factors yet to be determined  If DISH Network  NASDAQ DISH  is unable to acquire some of the companies  key assets  dealmakers may need to get a little bit more creative

157889,379405,DISH,Here s Why Dish Network  DISH  Is A Great Momentum Stock To Buy,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Dish Network  DISH   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Dish Network currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for DISH that show why this satellite television provider shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For DISH  shares are up 4 75  over the past week while the Zacks Cable Television industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 4 6  compares favorably with the industry s 1 36  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Over the past quarter  shares of Dish Network have risen 20 76   and are up 31 06  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 2 97  and 8 25   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to DISH s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  DISH is currently averaging 1 920 473 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with DISH 
Over the past two months  1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost DISH s consensus estimate  increasing from  2 44 to  2 45 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that DISH is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Dish Network on your short list ",2019-07-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-dish-network-dish-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-200442681,200442681

157984,379500,DISH,Should Value Investors Pick DISH Network  DISH  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put DISH Network Corporation   NASDAQ DISH   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  DISH Network has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 5  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 2  If we focus on the long term PE trend  DISH Network s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past three years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 24 2  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers However  we should point out that DISH Network has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 10 8  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  DISH Network has a P S ratio of about 1 2  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 1 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  DISH is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  DISH Network currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes DISH Network a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 6 8  which is better than the industry average of 8 7  Clearly  DISH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though DISH Network might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of A  This gives DISH a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending higher  The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen five upward and two downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 4 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 1 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below DISH Network Corporation Price and Consensus    This positive trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDISH Network is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a robust industry rank  among the Top 7   and a solid Zacks Rank instills investor confidence However  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall as over the past two years  the industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite the poor past performance of the industry  a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in DISH Network Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment

Of these  perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing  which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments  Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued  leaving room for profits 
Luckily  Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits  Value investors will be interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with both  A  grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now

Dish shares have lost about 34  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 3 1  
What s Next for Dish 
While Dish has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Dish was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

158048,379564,DISH,Why Is DISH Network  DISH  Down 1 3  Since Its Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for DISH Network Corporation   NASDAQ DISH    Shares have lost about 1 3  in that time frame 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is DISH due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts 
Recent EarningsDISH Network delivered first quarter 2018 earnings of 70 cents per share that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by couple of cents and declined 7 9  year over year Revenues slumped 6  year over year to  3 46 billion  lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of almost  3 50 billion Segment DetailsSubscriber related revenues  99  of revenues  declined 6 1  from the year ago quarter to  3 42 billion  Pay TV video and related revenues fell 5 3  to  3 35 billion  Broadband revenues plunged 30 2  year over year to  75 1 million Equipment sales and other revenues dipped 1  to  35 8 million United States contributed 99 7  of revenues which declined 6  year over year to  3 45 billion  Canada and Mexico contributed the rest of the revenues which fell 1  from the year ago quarter to  9 5 million Subscriber Loss ContinuesDISH exited the quarter with 10 845 million DISH TV subscribers and 2 303 million Sling TV subscribers  Total Pay TV subscribers were 13 148 million  down from 13 528 million reported in the year ago quarter Net Pay TV subscribers declined approximately 94K as compared with a decline of roughly 143K in the year ago quarter  Pay TV average revenue per user  ARPU  declined from year ago quarter s figure of  86 55  84 50 Net DISH TV subscribers declined approximately 185K and Sling TV subscribers increased almost 91K DISH TV s average monthly subscriber churn rate was 1 47  against year ago quarter s 1 92  Operating DetailsIn the first quarter  subscriber related expenses declined 2 6  year over year to  2 18 billion  However  as percentage of revenues  subscriber related expenses expanded 220 basis points  bps  on a year over year basis to 63 2  Total subscriber acquisition costs  SACs  plunged 32 4  from the year ago quarter to  196 million  As percentage of revenues  SACs declined 220 bps to 5 7  Operating income declined 12 8  year over year to  529 5 million  Operating margin fell 120 bps to 15 3  in the reported quarter Balance Sheet   Cash FlowAs of Mar 31  2018  cash   cash equivalents  including marketable investment securities  were  2 35 billion as compared with  2 05 billion as of Dec 31  2017 Cash flow from operating activities was  751 6 million  while free cash flow was  387 million 
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
It turns out  fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month  There have been five revisions higher for the current quarter compared to two lower 
DISH Network Corporation Price and Consensus   VGM Scores
At this time  DISH has a subpar Growth Score of D  however its Momentum is doing a lot better with an A  Following the exact same course  the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side  putting it in the top 20  for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Zacks  style scores indicate that the company s stock is suitable for value and momentum investors 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising  Notably  DISH has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   We expect an in line return from the stock in the next few months ",2018-06-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-is-dish-network-dish-down-13-since-its-last-earnings-report-200322945,200322945
158049,379565,DISH,Is DISH Network  DISH  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put DISH Network Corporation   NASDAQ DISH   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  DISH Network has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 4  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts DISH Network  current PE ratio considerably below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 33  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that DISH Network has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 12 1  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for DISH Network  stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  DISH Network has a P S ratio of about 1 2  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is noticeably below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  DISH Network currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes DISH a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 6 8  which is somewhat better than the industry average of 8 2  Clearly  DISH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though DISH Network might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of B  This gives DISH a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current year has seen four estimates go higher in the past 30 days  compared to three lower and the next has seen three estimates go higher in the past 30 days  compared to three lower As a result  the current year consensus estimate has increased nearly 1 6  in the past month  while the next year estimate has inched up 1 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below DISH Network Corporation Price and Consensus   Even though DISH Network has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDISH Network is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 25    it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  Also  over the past year  the broader industry has underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ,2018-06-07,Zacks Investment

158161,379677,DISH,Exclusive  SoftBank willing to cede control of Sprint to entice T Mobile   sources,news,"By Liana B  Baker NEW YORK  Reuters    Japan s SoftBank Group Corp  T 9984  is prepared to give up control of Sprint Corp  N S  to Deutsche Telekom AG s  DE DTEGn  T Mobile US Inc  O TMUS  to clinch a merger of the two U S  wireless carriers  according to people familiar with the matter  SoftBank has not yet approached Deutsche Telekom to discuss any deal because the U S  Federal Communications Commission has imposed strict anti collusion rules that ban discussions between rivals during an ongoing auction of airwaves  After the auction ends in April  the two parties are expected to begin negotiations  the sources told Reuters this week   Two and a half years ago  SoftBank abandoned talks to acquire T Mobile for Sprint amid opposition from U S  antitrust regulators  That deal would have put SoftBank in control of the merged company  with Deutsche Telekom becoming a minority shareholder   T Mobile was worth around  30 billion at the time  but its market value has since risen to more than  50 billion as it overtook Sprint as the No  3 wireless carrier by subscribers  Sprint s market value is around  36 billion  roughly the same as in 2014  Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Tim Hoettges has said in recent months that the German company is no longer willing to part with T Mobile  prompting SoftBank to explore a new strategy towards a potential combination  the people said  Deutsche Telekom owns about 65 percent of T Mobile  SoftBank  which owns about 83 percent of Sprint  has been frustrated with its inability to grow significantly on its own in the U S market  which is dominated by  Verizon Communications  Inc  N VZ  and AT T Inc  N T   the two largest U S  carriers  While SoftBank is still open to discussing other options  it is now willing to surrender control of Sprint and retain a minority stake in a merger with T Mobile  the sources said  They asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential  The Reuters report sent shares of T Mobile surging as much as 7 9 percent before they eased back to close up 5 5 percent at  63 92  Shares of Sprint ended 3 3 percent higher at  9 30  Investors have said a merger between T Mobile and Sprint  ranked third and fourth respectively  would still face antitrust challenges  but made strategic sense as the industry moves to fifth generation wireless technology  Carriers will need to spend billions of dollars to upgrade to 5G networks that promise to be 10 times to 100 times faster than current speeds  SoftBank  Sprint  Deutsche Telekom and T Mobile all declined to comment    We may buy  we may sell  Maybe a simple merger  we may be dealing with T Mobile  we may be dealing with totally different people  different company   SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son told analysts on the company s latest quarterly earnings call earlier this month   With the advent of 5G  Deutsche Telekom may receive offers for T Mobile from other U S  companies  such as  DISH Network  Corp  O DISH  and Comcast Corp  O CMCSA   Sprint could also be an acquisition target for other companies  the sources said  Dish declined to comment and Comcast did not immediately respond to a request for comment   DISCOUNTING PLANS Under CEO John Legere  T Mobile has rolled out unlimited data plans and international roaming packages  Combined with aggressive marketing  this has boosted T Mobile customer base at the expense of its rivals   T Mobile said it had 71 5 million total customers while Sprint had 59 5 million at the end of 2016  T Mobile is now almost as big as Deutsche Telekom s German business   We are not in the mood of selling the business   Hoettges told investors last November   While Sprint s customer base has also grown under CEO Marcelo Claure and financials have improved  the growth was primarily driven by heavy price discounts  Despite new investment  the company s network is still viewed by many consumers as weaker than its rivals  Reuters could not determine how much of a premium SoftBank may want Deutsche Telekom to pay for control of Sprint   Barclays   LON BARC  analysts wrote in a note in December that a merger of T Mobile and Sprint could result in  25 billion to  30 billion in synergies but said   it is not imminently clear to us that the various regulatory agencies would reverse course having already blessed the outcome of a four player market   The FCC and the U S  Department of Justice sent strong messages in 2014 that they did not want Verizon  AT T  Sprint and T Mobile to merge among themselves  Since then  AT T acquired satellite television provider DirecTV and signed an agreement to buy media giant  Time Warner  Inc  N TWX   though that deal is still under regulatory review and has attracted criticism from U S  President Donald Trump  Verizon has also been exploring other acquisitions  Antitrust experts said it was difficult to predict how the Trump administration would view a T Mobile Sprint merger since key antitrust appointments at the Justice Department have not been made  It is also not clear how such a combination would be viewed by the FCC  whose new chairman Ajit Pai is viewed as more business friendly than his predecessor   I am of the camp that that will not happen even in a Trump administration   Christopher Marangi  co chief investment officer at GAMCO Investors Inc  said on the prospects of a T Mobile Sprint combination   That kind of merger means lots of job cuts in the U S   Craig Moffett  an analyst at MoffettNathanson  said price wars between Sprint and T Mobile have driven down overall wireless prices for consumers    Antitrust regulators could well argue that this is precisely the dynamic they would want to preserve   Moffett added

158165,379681,DISH,Is Telecom Cable TV Media Convergence Inevitable ,opinion,"Rapid technological advancement is gradually redefining the parameters of the telecommunications  cable TV and media industries  The market landscape is fast changing  as these industries are systematically converging  Will 2018 witness more mergers and acquisitions between telecom  cable TV and media companies 
The legacy local and long distance wireline phone services have largely been replaced by wireless services  This in turn has resulted in massive deployment of airwaves and optic fiber based networks  Now  Internet TV and online TV streaming services are replacing legacy TV viewing  This has resulted in the merger of content creation and distribution  Emergence of digital media and robust growth of digital advertisement are major catalysts to the coming together of the three industries 
Here we will briefly discuss a few factors leading to the convergence of the telecom  cable TV and media industries 
Technological Advancement 
The major thrust to the broader telecom sector is coming from the industry as a result of continuous network and product upgrade  and inventions by industry players  Robust growth of smartphone and tablets along with continuous development of high speed data transfer technologies has acted as a key driver of the convergence 
A growing economy speeds up the demand for real time voice  data and video manifold  Given that cord cutting is affecting the cable TV industry  it has now become more essential for media companies to join telecom giants 
Industry Overlapping 
Wireless networks are key to the growth of the overall telecom industry  Wireless network standards are continuously evolving worldwide in order to provide faster speed  As wireless networks run on radio frequency  spectrums  airwaves  have become the most sought after commodity in the industry 
Powered with their strong WiFi network  cable TV operators are gradually entering the wireless field through MVNO  mobile virtual network operator  agreements with incumbent carriers  On the other hand  major telecom operators are entering the pay TV industry  especially through Internet TV and online TV streaming services 
At the same time  cable TV and telecom giants are foraying into the media industry with big ticket acquisitions  Comcast became a media mogul after acquiring NBC Universal in 2011  AT T is currently awaiting the regulatory approval for its proposed  85 4 billion cash and stock deal to acquire media giant Time Warner Inc  NYSE TWX   Verizon may also follow suit  It has already acquired AOL and the core businesses of Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  
Mobile Video Business  Gains Ground
Internet TV is gaining a strong foothold in the United States and has emerged as a strong alternative to counter this competitive threat  Presently  the web based digital media market is growing by leaps and bounds  Digital media brands are becoming immensely popular with the younger generation  With demand for smartphones and tablets on the rise  target customers are increasingly watching videos online  and preferring them over costlier legacy pay  TV connections 
Moreover  an increasing number of customers are using the Internet to watch videos and they want mobility of their content  This has given wireless operators an opportunity to differentiate their products by offering access to select content through their networks  By making deals directly with content developers  wireless carriers are trying to draw customers with   bundles   of content such as streaming entertainment or sporting events  possibly with no additional data charges 
Online Digital Advertisement  Solid Prospects
Advertisement on the mobile video platform is gradually shifting from simple selling of banner ads on the mobile web to automated or programmatic ad selling  Pay  TV operators are steadily adopting the data driven advertising technique that has already become popular in the web based advertisement arena  To derive maximum synergy from the combined video content and video distribution platform  these companies are aggressively penetrating the advertising technology market  Inclusions of dynamic ad insertion  targeted audience advertising and data driven TV advertisements are steps toward the same objective 
Quad Play   Future Growth Path 
Technologically  we are moving from triple play  voice video data  bundled services offering to quad play  voice video data mobile  bundled offering   Video on demand is the new norm for telecom  cable TV and media industries  Technological changes have enabled distributors to come up with different ways of bundling and disseminating content  effective content creation methods and creating new business models  Companies are innovating newer options to push discovery of their content to consumers or help them discover it to get a competitive edge 
It is to be noted that  exponential growth of mobile data usage supported by flourishing high end smartphone and tablet devices has changed the entire dynamics of the traditional telecom and cable TV industry  Therefore  mergers between telecom or cable TV operators with media giants have become crucial as both the industries are aggressively delivering content on online digital platform 
Repeal of Broadband Privacy Rule
On Apr 3  2017  President Donald Trump signed a repeal of Obama era broadband privacy rules  This has given a major boost to the ISP  Internet Service Provider  industry  The broadband privacy rules proposed by former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler required ISPs to get consumers  explicit consent before selling or sharing web browsing data and other private information with advertisers and other companies  Since ISPs have direct access to user database  they used to sell the data to digital marketing firms for targeted advertising  This was a major source of revenues for the ISPs 
The digital advertisement market is growing exponentially and ISPs have been increasingly investing resources to cash in on bountiful opportunities  However  the FCC s previous directive stipulated that the ISP should notify customers before sharing any user data for advertising  This would have marred ISP prospects  Consequently  a new FCC body  headed by Ajit Pai  exercising lesser restrictions  certainly augurs well for the ISP industry 
Stocks in Focus
We focus on four companies with strong long term growth potential as these are poised to benefit the most from the shift in industry dynamics toward a converged telecom cable TV media space  Each of this stocks carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    The largest wireless operator in the United States has started conducting field trials for its upcoming 5G wireless network with partners  Verizon is planning to merge its Internet video service  Go 90  into other digital platforms  At present  almost 15  of Go90 s content is distributed to AOL Video 
In fact  the company has begun to distributing Go90 content across some of its Oath brands  Oath is Verizon s new company overseeing Yahoo and AOL  including more than 20 brands  Verizon has a long term  three five years  EPS  earnings per share  growth estimate of 2 82  and a dividend yield of 5 26  
AT T Inc    NYSE T    The second largest wireless operator has also emerged a major pay TV operator after its acquisition of DIRECTV offering both legacy satellite TV  fiber based TV and online TV streaming services  At present  AT T is awaiting the regulatory approval of its  85 4 billion mega media merger with Time Warner Inc 
The company has strong foothold in Mexico  Brazil and a few other Latin American markets  AT T has a long term  three five years  EPS growth estimate of 4 24  and a dividend yield of 5 73  
Comcast Corp    NASDAQ CMCSA    The largest cable MSO  multi service operator  in the United States entered the wireless arena in mid 2017  The foray into the wireless space will enable the company to have a platform for expanding its Internet TV service  The wireless venture is also aimed at retaining customers in this competitive world 
Moreover  the NBC Universal media division of the company is performing well  Comcast has a long term  three five years  EPS growth estimate of 9 39  and a dividend yield of 1 71  
DISH Network Corp    NASDAQ DISH    The second largest satellite TV operator has created an extensive portfolio of spectrum  the most important component of wireless networks  The company boasts a portfolio of 80 MHz of radio frequencies of different bands which will be utilized to deploy 4G LTE wireless network in top 100 U S  markets 
DISH Network s CEO Charlie Ergen has hinted that the company is interested in the potential deal making to enter the wireless industry  At the same time  Ergen also stated that DISH Network has a clear plan of building a wireless network on its own  DISH Network has a long term  three five years  EPS growth estimate of 10 33  
Bottom Line
Business models and the economics of the telecom  cable TV and industries are changing  Content creators and distributors are trying their best to judge the mood of the consumers to derive how to make content and advertisements more personalized  Advertisement on the mobile video platform is gradually shifting from simple selling of banner ads on the mobile web to automated or programmatic ad selling  All these forces are moving towards telecom cable TV media convergence

158184,379700,DISH,FCC says TV airwaves being sold for wireless use worth  86 4 billion,news,"By David Shepardson WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Federal Communications Commission said on Wednesday the price of 126 MHz of television airwaves taken from broadcasters to be sold for wireless use in an ongoing auction is  86 4 billion  But analysts said wireless providers may not be willing to pay the staggering amount for the airwaves to expand their networks  which could prompt the FCC to hold another round of auctions  The FCC disclosed the price in a statement after completing the first part of an auction to repurpose low frequency wireless spectrum relinquished by television broadcasters   Strong participation from broadcast stations made this initial clearing target possible   Gary M  Epstein  chair of the FCC s incentive auction task force  said in a statement  The so called  broadcast incentive  spectrum auction is one of the commission s most complex and ambitious to date  In this round  called a reverse auction  broadcasters competed to give up spectrum to the FCC for the lowest price  In the next stage  the forward auction  wireless and other companies will bid to buy the airwaves for the highest price  If wireless companies are unwilling to pay  86 4 billion  the FCC may have to hold another round of bidding by broadcasters and sell less spectrum than had been expected  analysts said  Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner said the results confirm that broadcasters have  significantly inflated expectations    In an election year  with a lot of uncertainty with Brexit making the debt markets jittery   it is unlikely that wireless operators with deeps pockets  such as AT T Inc  N T  and  Verizon Communications  Inc  N VZ   would raise more debt to bid in the auction  Entner said  A second round of the reverse auction later this year is likely  Dan Hays  principal at audit firm PwC s consulting arm Strategy   said in an email statement   Indeed  we could well see the proceedings drag on into early 2017 before coming to a final conclusion   Hays said

158222,379738,DISH,FCC begins first phase of airwaves auction,news,"By David Shepardson and Malathi Nayak
WASHINGTON NEW YORK  Reuters    The U S  Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday kicked off an auction of low frequency spectrum relinquished by television broadcasters to wireless companies and other bidders that are seeking new airwaves to build and improve wireless networks 
The so called  broadcast incentive  auction is considered one of the FCC s most complex and ambitious spectrum auctions to date 
The first step is a  reverse auction   where the government recovers spectrum from broadcasters that will voluntarily give up airwaves either to go off the air for a payout or be shifted to another frequency band for a smaller sum 
 A successful auction means that spectrum will be repurposed  a huge amount of money will change hands  and technology and spectrum policy will be shaped for the future   said National Association of Broadcasters Executive Vice President Rick Kaplan 
Of the 1 800 eligible broadcasters  an undisclosed number submitted applications to take part  Eligible broadcasters have until 6 p m  EDT Tuesday to submit a binding agreement to take part The reverse auction should be completed by summer and will be followed by a  forward  auction  where the government sells to telecommunications operators and other bidders the spectrum  which it will package into new bands  The results of that auction are expected by October 
The government plays the middleman in the auction  which is designed to give broadcasters an incentive to sell at the lowest price and encourage telecommunications companies to buy at the highest price  The government keeps a large part of the difference 
The names of the TV broadcasters that are participating in the reverse auction will not be revealed by the FCC during the auction 
Last week  the FCC said it saw 104 applications for the forward auction  69 of them complete and 35 incomplete  Participants included wireless companies  Verizon Communications  Inc  N VZ   AT T Inc  N T  and T Mobile US Inc  O TMUS  and pay TV providers Comcast Corp  O CMCSA  and Dish Network Corp  O DISH  
Puerto Rico Telephone Company Inc  a unit Mexican telecommunications provider America Movil SAB  MX AMXL   rural carriers and financial companies such as Silicon Valley investment firm Social Capital have also filed to take part 
Analysts forecast that the upcoming auction could fetch proceeds in the  15 billion to  45 billion range  but they said they expect bidders to be less aggressive than in the FCC s last auction  the  AWS 3 auction   which ended last year and attracted a record  44 9 billion in bids 
FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has said the FCC has seen strong interest in the auction and will boost wireless data   If broadband Internet service is an engine for economic growth  then mobile broadband has been its booster rocket  creating a platform for innovation  competition and new markets   he said ",2016-03-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/fcc-begins-first-phase-of-airwaves-auction-392374,392374

satellite and IPTV operators  will lose approximately 10 8 million customers by 2021  Total pay TV subscribers will be around 82 3 million at that time  which will be 20  less than the industry s historical high level In terms of customer retention  legacy pay TV operators are yet to cope with the onslaught of low cost online video streaming service providers  In the last 10 years  the internal dynamics of the pay TV market have gradually shifted from legacy pay TV offerings to low cost over the top  OTT  service providers  According to SNL Kagan  in the first half of 2017  the U S  pay TV industry lost 1 8 million customers The strong presence of online video streaming providers is posing a significant threat to the existing pay TV business model  Video offering  which represented the core business function of cable TV operators  seems to be fast slipping out of their hands In order to remain competitive in the market  pay TV operators stared offering Internet TV with selected TV channels at cheap rate  Technically  Internet TV is similar to pay TV offerings  Its shows can be viewed using a broadband connection and mobile gadgets like tablets  smartphones  Roku box and smart TV  to name a few Major pay TV operators  such as AT T Inc   NYSE      and DISH Network Corp   Nasdaq      have already launched their Internet TV services  Verizon Communications

will hold nearly 80  of the market share till 2022  They will continue to do so despite facing intensified competition from low cost OTT service providers Nevertheless  pay TV operators are yet to

158269,379785,DISH,Will National Wireless Carriers Make A Comeback In 2H17 ,opinion,The U S  wireless telecommunications industry has been trending down over the past several quarters  The decline continued in the first quarter of 2017 results as well The domestic wireless industry continues to struggle with some major inherent headwinds like saturation issues  pricing competition  technological changes and marketing costs associated with any kind of promotional offers Let s take a closer look at how these factors have impacted the industry negatively SaturationThe U S  wireless industry is already saturated  where spectrum crunch has become a major issue in the domestic telecom industry  Most of the carriers are finding it difficult to manage mobile data traffic  which is growing by leaps and bounds  The situation has become acute with the growing popularity of smartphones  online mobile video streaming  cloud computing and video conferencing services Intra Industry CompetitionApart from saturation issues  competition is becoming intense in the United States wireless postpaid and prepaid industry  The gap between prepaid and postpaid average revenue per user  ARPU  has narrowed significantly  forcing telecom biggies to turn their attention to domestic prepaid mobile service business Stiff pricing competition in the industry is a genuine concern  Few months back  we witnessed four major wireless telecommunications companies  Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    AT T Inc    NYSE T    T Mobile US Inc    NYSE T   and Sprint Corp    NYSE S    participating in the unlimited postpaid data plan war in order to remain competitive  These wireless operators are now extending their unlimited data plan to the prepaid market as well Inter Industry Competition Two major national cable behemoths  Comcast Corp    NYSE S   and Charter Communications Inc    NYSE T   have agreed to jointly work on their wireless services businesses so as to better explore their opportunities  accelerate and enhance each other s ability to participate in the national wireless marketplace  Recently  Comcast completed the nationwide rollout of its wireless services under the Xfinity Mobile brand  Meanwhile  Charter Communications plans to offer wireless service in 2018  The wireless venture is also aimed at retaining customers in this competitive world  Satellite TV operator DISH Network Corp    NYSE S    is also looking for wireless opportunities  It already has a strong portfolio of wireless spectrum Promotional Liquidity WoesAdditionally  the companies have been continuously trying to lure customers with attractive promotional plans and lucrative discounts  as a counteractive measure against the competition posed by other carriers  This has led to a high cash burn rate and heavy losses for these companies Price Performance  Jan   Jun  2017The downfall has been noticed in their price performances  Over the six months span from January June 2017  the shares of Verizon  Sprint and AT T have declined 16 3   2 5  and 11 3   respectively while that of T Mobile US soared 5 4   When compared with the market at large  the stock s performance looks miserable  as the S P 500 index has rallied 9 3  Big Beat in Second Quarter 2017Financial results of the national wireless carriers for the quarter ended Jun 30  2017  was a positive  We witness a stark improvement in terms of their revenue growth and subscriber statistics Let s have a closer view on their prospects   Verizon reported an addition of 614 000 postpaid customers and 19 000 prepaid customers in the last reported second quarter 2017  compared with a loss of 307 000 postpaid and 17 000 prepaid customers in the first quarter of 2017  Meanwhile  total revenue increased 0 1  year over year to  30 548 million AT T had 136 500 million total subscribers  with 196 000 million postpaid wireless additions T Mobile US  innovative network expansion methodologies have lured 1 333 million net customers  signifying the 17th successive quarter of over 1 million net customer additions  The company s total revenue jumped 10  year over year to  10 213 million in the reported quarter Sprint registered an impressive number of customer additions for the first quarter of fiscal 2017  As of Jun 30  2017  Sprint had 53 698 million wireless connections  up 0 63  year over year   with net additions of 61 000 wireless customers  Quarterly total revenue amounted  8 157 million  up 1 81  year over year Notably  backed by such impressive subscriber additions and revenue growth  the management of all these four companies have raised their outlook for full year 2017 All the above mentioned stocks carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  You can see  Price Performance  Jul   Aug  2017We get to see a remarkable improvement in the price performances of the wireless carriers  Over these two months span from July August 2017  the share price of Verizon  T Mobile US  Sprint and AT T has rallied 8 6   4 7   0 7  and 0 3   respectively  When compared to the market at large  the stock s performance looks favorable  as the S P 500 index inched up 2 1   over the same time span What to Expect in Second Half of 2017 On the back of such impressive financial results  we expect the trend to rise further in the coming quarters of 2017  This should likely have a positive influence in the second half of this year At present  the U S  telecom industry enjoys several positive attributes  First  the new telecom regulatory body   Federal Communications Commission  FCC    has given enough indications that it will be less stringent compared with the Obama administration and is likely to roll back several regulations of the previous regime  Second  the less restrictive nature of the FCC will aid mergers and acquisitions which are likely to spur growth in 2017  Third  a growing U S  economy drives demand for real time voice  data and video  This escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans 4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market s record highs  but picking the best ones to buy can be tough  There s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector  Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without  More importantly  it reveals 4 top stocks set to skyrocket on increasing demand for these devices  I encourage you to get the report now   before the next wave of innovations really take off ,2017-08-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-national-wireless-carriers-make-a-comeback-in-2h17-200210431,200210431

Dish  led by media mogul Charlie Ergen  said it lost about 12 000 pay TV subscribers in the third quarter compared with the second quarter 
Analysts on average had expected net addition of 22 100 subscribers  according to market research firm StreetAccount 
Dish attributed the loss of subscribers to intense competition  with rivals offering discounts to new customers and aggressive plans to existing ones to retain them    
Average revenue per pay TV subscriber rose to  84 39 in the quarter from  80 98 a year earlier  mainly due to price increases in February  Dish said in a regulatory filing 
The company has been playing hard ball on agreeing to contract renewals with media companies such as CBS Corp  N CBS  and Time Warner Inc s  N TWX  Turner Broadcasting 
Dish dropped some of Turner s channels such as CNN  Cartoon Network and late night comedy channel  Adult Swim  in October after the companies failed to hammer out a deal 
Dish  which has about 14 million pay TV users  is also at odds with CBS Corp over the monthly price per subscriber for the CBS channel 
Net income attributable to Dish fell to  145 5 million  or 31 cents per share  in the third quarter ended Sept  30 from  314 9 million  or 68 cents per share  a year earlier  mainly due to higher expenses

158296,379812,DISH,21st Century Fox  FOXA  Q4 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"Twenty First Century Fox  Inc    NASDAQ FOXA   is scheduled to report fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 9  In the previous quarter  the company s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 14 9  Notably  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 16  in the trailing four quarters  Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
What to Expect 
The question lingering in investors  minds now is whether Twenty First Century Fox will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 34 cents  reflecting a year over year decrease of over 24   We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has decreased by a couple of cents witnessed in the past 30 days  Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  6 734 million compared with  6 646 million reported in the prior year quarter 
Factors Influencing This Quarter
Robust affiliate fees at the company s broadcast and cable television divisions are anticipated to drive the revenues higher  In the third quarter  Cable Network Programming revenues increased 2 1  on the back of robust affiliate revenues growth  after increasing 10  and 7 1  in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017  respectively  Affiliate fees are the dominant source of revenue for the Cable Network segment and a major contributor to total revenue 
However  increase in cost at Cable Network Programming has been worrying investors  In the first nine months of fiscal 2017  Cable Network Programming costs have increased 6 3  to  7 687 million  The rise in expenses was mostly due to elevated sports programming costs  We believe that an increase in expenses  due to higher sports programming costs may hurt the margins and affect the bottom line in the coming quarters Twenty First Century Fox  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   What Does the Zacks Model Unveil 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Twenty First Century Fox is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Twenty First Century Fox has an Earnings ESP of  2 94  as the Most Accurate estimate is 33 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 34 cents  Although  the company s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise 
Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates
Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat 
Nexstar Media Group  Inc    NASDAQ NXST   currently has an ESP of  1 09  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see

158315,379831,DISH,Exclusive  Overstock CEO says bitcoin sales to add 4 cents to 2014 EPS,news,"By Gertrude Chavez Dreyfuss NEW YORK  Reuters    Overstock com Inc s sales through bitcoin are expected to add 4 cents per share to its earnings this year  the online retailer s chief executive  Patrick Byrne  told Reuters 
Bitcoin sales at Overstock  O OSTK   which started accepting this type of currency as payment for items on its website in January this year  have exceeded  2 million so far  or about one quarter of 1 percent of total sales 
Byrne expects bitcoin sales of  6 million to  8 million in 2014  most of it from new customers 
 I think the world expects us to make 75 80 cents per share this year  And 4 cents of that would be attributable to bitcoin   Byrne said to Reuters last Friday 
So far  total bitcoin sales have totaled  15 000 per day  or  300 0000 per month  By the end of the year  Byrne expects Overstock to do  1 million in bitcoin sales per month 
Overstock  which uses Coinbase as a payment processor  has been at the forefront of the bitcoin revolution  It was the first company with at least  1 billion in sales to accept bitcoin payments  The company expects  1 5 billion in sales this year 
Soon after Overstock accepted bitcoins  other large U S  companies followed suit  Computer maker Dell Inc  Dish Network Corp  O DISH  and Newegg Inc   an online retailer of computer hardware and software  announced they would accept bitcoin payments as well 
More than 60 000 merchants worldwide accept bitcoin  according to data from CoinDesk  a provider of bitcoin data 
 When technology comes along like crypto currency  which can replace at a far lower cost     I am all for supporting it   Byrne said 
Bitcoin payment processors such as Coinbase charge Overstock less than 1 percent  sometimes near zero  to process a transaction  A credit card payment  on the other hand typically has a 3 percent transaction fee  analysts said 
Gil Luria  managing director and financial technology analyst at Wedbush Securities  said a 2 percent to 3 percent savings in transaction costs is a meaningful number especially for retailers like Overstock  which has  razor thin margins  
Overstock also plans to accept bitcoin payments from international customers by mid September this year  In addition  it will allocate 4 percent of bitcoin sales to promote the currency  effective mid September as well 
 We re in bitcoin for the long haul  I intend to make it permanent   said Byrne   Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are going to be around for as long as the law of mathematics works  

On Wednesday  Overstock was down 1 2 percent at  17 23  while bitcoin fell 4 percent to  544 88

Deutsche Telekom views potential offers valuing T Mobile at  35 a share as being substantially too low  Reuters reported last week  countering a Bloomberg report

158317,379833,DISH,Exclusive  Univision to provide content for DirecTV online service by year end,news,"By Ronald Grover and Liana B  Baker  Reuters    Hispanic media giant Univision will be a major supplier of content when satellite operator DirecTV  O DTV  launches an Internet delivered service aimed at a Hispanic audience  according to two people with knowledge of the agreement 
Univision s content would be a crucial offering for DirecTV s online service  which is expected to launch later this year  It would also help the satellite operator to counter smaller rival Dish Network Corp  O DISH   which is creating a multichannel Internet TV service that would be a cheaper alternative to traditional cable and satellite services 
In addition to Univision  DirecTV is talking with other Spanish language media companies  according to the two people  who are not authorized to speak publicly 
The Hispanic service would be the first of a series of lower priced niche online channels CEO Mike White has said the satellite provider would launch 
White had previously discussed the possibility of an Internet channel aimed at Latinos  but neither the timing nor the fact that Univision had agreed to provide content for the service had previously been revealed 
Both the multichannel Dish offering and the more targeted DirecTV service are aimed at potential subscribers for whom traditional satellite service is too expensive 
The lure of a Hispanic channel is the thriving Spanish language market that is generally younger and more likely to bypass cable or satellite to go online for entertainment  said Macquarie Research analyst Amy Yong  who covers DirecTV 
 This would serve the millennials   she said 
DirecTV  which has accepted a  48 5 billion takeover offer from AT T Inc  N T   secured Internet rights to Univision content as part of a previously disclosed agreement signed in March 2013 
The companies at that time did not specify that the agreement   which included the rights to its flagship Univision broadcast network  its 62 local TV stations  cable channel Galavision and the sports cable channel Univision Deportes Network   also allowed the satellite provider to use the programming in an over the top service 
DirecTV s planned online service  to be called YaVeo  joins a growing number of companies signing deals with media companies to offer content for new online  or over the top  services  Viacom and Sony announced on Sept  10 an agreement for Viacom s 22 cable channels  including MTV and Nickelodeon  to be offered online through Sony Internet connected devices 
Verizon Communications Inc  N VZ  CEO Lowell McAdam said on Thursday that the telecoms provider plans to launch an Internet based television service in the first half of 2015 
Dish plans to offer a service by the end of the year  Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen told analysts during an August 6 earnings call  The company has signed deals with Disney and A E Networks to provide ESPN  the Disney Channel and Lifetime  among others 
Univision spokeswoman Monica Talan and DirecTV spokesman Robert Mercer had no comment 

The plan to name the service YaVeo was previously reported by Gigaom

158318,379834,DISH,France s Iliad drops plan to buy T Mobile US,news,"By James Regan and Marina Lopes
PARIS WASHINGTON  Reuters    French low cost telecoms operator Iliad SA  PA ILD  abandoned its attempt to buy T Mobile US Inc  N TMUS  on Monday because of resistance from majority owner Deutsche Telekom  DE DTEGn   becoming the third bidder to walk away from the carrier in three years 
While Iliad s approach had been widely perceived as a long shot  its formal withdrawal sent shares of the U S  carrier to a 10 month low  The move came three months after Sprint Corp  N S  dropped its own bid to buy T Mobile 
Now T Mobile  which had been gaining market share thanks to aggressive marketing tactics  will face new questions about whether it can continue to prosper as an independent entity 
 There haven t been any other viable offers that have emerged since Sprint backed out  and that was not a formal offer to boot  There may be some questions about the price a larger buyer is prepared to pay in turn for a regulatory battle they may have to face   said Bill Menezes  an analyst at Gartner 
T Mobile shares fell as much as 4 3 percent to  26 41  their lowest level since December 2013  The stock ended 2 5 percent lower at  26 92 
A person familiar with Deutsche Telekom s thinking said on Monday that the group preferred to keep its U S  business longer since it was unconvinced that Iliad  as a newcomer to the U S  market  could run the business better than its current management 
T Mobile US and Deutsche Telekom  which owns 66 percent of the business  declined to comment  Iliad said it would now  continue its profitable growth policy as it has been conducted over the last 15 years  
Iliad had set a mid October deadline to decide whether to improve its  33 a share bid for 56 6 percent of the fourth biggest cellphone network operator in the United States  sources told Reuters last month 
The low cost telecoms operator set up by maverick French tycoon Xavier Niel said it had formed a consortium with two  leading private equity funds  to bid for 67 percent of T Mobile US at  36 per share including cost savings  Excluding the synergies  the bid was for  33 in cash per share  the same level as Iliad s original offer in late July for 56 6 percent of the company  said a person familiar with the situation 
Deutsche Telekom believes it is better off waiting to see if deals with the likes of Sprint or satellite TV provider Dish Network Corp  O DISH  become possible under a different U S  administration with a more favorable view on consolidation  the person said 
Another person close to Deutsche Telekom s management said the new offer was not a significant improvement   It would not have made any sense to leave Deutsche Telekom with still a large stake of equity exposed to a company they have serious doubts about   the person said 
Deutsche Telekom  which makes about a third of its sales and a fifth of core profit in the United States  has tried to sell T Mobile twice since late 2011 because it sees it as too small to compete with market leaders Verizon Communications Inc  N VZ  and AT T Inc  N T  
Regulators rejected AT T s  39 billion bid for T Mobile US three years ago 
T Mobile has been searching for a buyer with access to U S  spectrum licenses and an American customer base  Jefferies analyst Mike McCormack said in an analyst note after meeting with T Mobile s investor relations team last month 
The note has fueled rumors that Dish  which has been stockpiling billions of dollars  worth of wireless spectrum  may be a potential suitor for the company 

In August  Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen said it makes sense for the company to consider making a bid for T Mobile now that Sprint is out of the picture

158320,379836,DISH, Deutsche Telekom to avoid answering any cash calls from T Mobile US  analysts,news,"By Harro Ten Wolde and Peter Maushagen
FRANKFURT  Reuters    Deutsche Telekom had already given up on trying to sell its near 67 percent stake in T Mobile US  N TMUS  before upstart French telecoms firm Iliad  PA ILD  dropped its bid on Monday and is now looking to avoid having to stump up more funds for the U S  mobile network operator  analysts and investors said 
The French low cost telecoms operator said late on Monday it had abandoned its attempt to buy T Mobile because of resistance from Deutsche Telekom  becoming the third bidder to drop out in three years 
Competition regulators blocked AT T s  N T  agreed  39 billion deal to take over T Mobile US in 2011 and also headed off this year s attempt by Sprint  N S  and its majority owner Softbank Corp  T 9984  to merge the two firms 
Deutsche Telekom had hoped to reduce its exposure to the U S  business before next year s scheduled auction of radio waves which analysts estimate will cost T Mobile billions of dollars to get the lower range frequencies it needs to give its mobile network further reach and better compete with rival operators Verizon  N VZ   AT T and Sprint 
 T Mobile US s credit profile is weaker than Deutsche Telekom s  therefore a sale of T Mobile US to a strategic partner would have been the preferred option   said Nikolai Lukashevich  a credit analyst at Fitch 
But Deutsche Telekom management  led by Tim Hoettges since he took over as chief executive in January having previously been the group finance chief  has became more confident that a longer stay in the United States business could make sense as T Mobile s turnaround has made promising progress this year  sources familiar with the matter said last month 
 They believe that T Mobile can take care of itself  a person close to the German firm s management said   That has been Tim s objective ever since he merged the company with MetroPCS last year  
Hoettges  strategy for the T Mobile USA business since he spun it off from its German parent via a reverse takeover by its smaller listed rival MetroPCS  has been  de risking  self funding and kingmaker   he told analysts in August 
In the meantime T Mobile US had turned profitable in the second quarter after four quarters of losses during which it spent heavily to buy customers out of rival contracts 
And T Mobile US added 552 000 post paid customers in August  more customer additions than any other month in the history of the company  Chief Executive John Legere told investors at a conference in New York last month 
 It is Deutsche Telekom s only growth story at the moment  They have invested heavily in the past two years  We expect to see returns in the coming year for Deutsche Telekom   one of the German company s 20 biggest shareholders said on Tuesday 
A telecoms industry banker said that Hoettges is now likely to wait and see how the U S  spectrum auction turns out and whether any new suitors emerge as a result  such as satellite TV operator Dish Network  O DISH   Dish has been buying up mobile spectrum in recent years and said in August that it might be interested in bidding for T Mobile 
 I don t think it changes the fact that they  Deutsche Telekom  want to sell the US eventually   the banker said 
COSTLY AUCTION
Analysts estimate that T Mobile US will need anywhere from  5 to  10 billion to bid for the best frequencies in next year s spectrum auction as well as billions more to improve its network to keep up with consumer demand for quality and speed 
But Deutsche Telekom investors are confident the U S  company can raise the money to fund those investments via issuing new shares or bonds without calling on its German parent for more cash 
 They sacrificed  2 billion in operating profit in the past two years  Deutsche Telekom wants to see that money coming back now   said the institutional investor 
A credit investor who declined to be named also noted that T Mobile US is a bond issuer in its own right in the U S  high yield market  and carries out its financing at arms  length from Deutsche Telekom 
But Lukashevich  the Fitch analyst who rates Deutsche Telekom at BBB  with a stable long term outlook  believes a fresh share issue would be the best option 
 T Mobile is pretty leveraged at the moment with a debt EBITDA ratio of around 3 5  From a creditors  perspective a share issue would be the best scenario to fund the spectrum auctions   he said 
 I expect competition in the U S  will only increase in the near future with Sprint increasing pressure  We will have to see how T Mobile will deal with that  
Deutsche Telekom  which is due to update investors on its strategy at a  Capital Markets  presentation on Dec  9  declined to comment

158321,379837,DISH,Exclusive  LightSquared has deal to end Chapter 11 under lender control   source,news,"By Nick Brown NEW YORK  Reuters    LightSquared  the bankrupt wireless venture owned by Phil Falcone s Harbinger Capital Partners  has reached a deal to bring the company out of bankruptcy under control of lenders  according to a person close to the matter 
Harbinger had been fighting to keep at least some control of LightSquared by breaking up the company  However  the deal would keep the company together while distributing equity to lenders including Charles Ergen  chairman of Dish Network Corp  O DISH   said the person  who declined to be named because the deal is not public 
The agreement comes on the heels of a second round of mediation  and sides have scheduled a hearing on Monday afternoon to reveal details of those talks 
Harbinger and Ergen had been embroiled in fierce litigation for more than a year over allegations by Harbinger that Ergen used underhanded means to acquire LightSquared s loan debt with an eye toward taking control of its assets on Dish s behalf  Ergen insisted he was interested in LightSquared only for his personal account 
The new deal still needs to be memorialized in a Chapter 11 plan  but appears to be a blow to Harbinger s hopes of salvaging control of LightSquared  The deal has enough support from stakeholders to receive court approval  the person said 

LightSquared  which promised high speed wireless coverage across the United States  filed for chapter 11 protection in 2012 after regulators barred it from using its wireless spectrum because of fears of GPS interference

	Chicago  IL   June 27  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include AT T Inc  NYSE T    NYSE           DISH Network Corp   NASDAQ           Sony Corp  T 6758    NYSE           Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ    NYSE          and Comcast Corp   NASDAQ          

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  

Will U S  Pay TV Spending Continue to Rise in the Future 

	As per a recent report by research firm Strategy Analytics  annual spending on subscription video and TV services in the US will reach  130 3 billion in 2019  However  the figure will gradually decline after that  In terms of customer retention  legacy pay TV operators are yet to cope with the onslaught of low cost online video streaming service providers  the former group s average revenue is still 10 times higher than that the online video streaming service providers 

	Strategy Analytics further stated that major pay TV operators who offer both traditionally managed TV services and next generation online services will hold nearly 80  of the market share till 2022  They will continue to do so despite facing intensified competition from low cost over the top  OTT  service providers 

	The Internet TV service  launched by leading pay TV operators in the U S   is gaining market traction since 2015  Technically  Internet TV is similar to pay TV offerings  Its shows can be viewed using a broadband connection and mobile gadgets like tablets  smartphones  Roku box and smart TV  to name a few  To sum it up  Internet TV offers a TV Everywhere experience to subscribers at a cost effective manner  The growing deployment of 4G LTE mobile network and significant adoption of portable mobile devices are the primary reasons propelling its popularity 

	Major pay TV operators  such as AT T Inc   NYSE           DISH Network Corp   NASDAQ          and Sony Corp   NYSE          have already launched their Internet TV services Verizon Communications Inc   NYSE          and Comcast Corp   NASDAQ          are the latest entrants  Most of these companies are offering both legacy pay TV as well as Internet TV services with selected TV channels at lower costs 

	Nevertheless  the pay TV operators are yet to find out an appropriate trade off between these two types of services  Making online ventures more attractive is resulting in more subscribers for the new services at the expense of the traditional pay TV business model  Ultimately  the cord cutting due to Internet TV is yet to stop  which is currently the biggest threat for pay TV operators 

	Meanwhile  more online TV services like YouTube and Hulu  have entered the market  This has made the Internet TV market highly competitive  It remains to be seen how major pay TV operators can survive the competition

158336,379852,DISH,LightSquared  Dish s Ergen reach settlement deal,news,"NEW YORK  Reuters    Bankrupt wireless venture LightSquared and its largest creditor  Dish Network Corp  O DISH  Chairman Charles Ergen  have resolved a long running dispute over Ergen s treatment under LightSquared s proposed restructuring  
According to court papers filed on Monday in U S  Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan  the sides reached a deal after extending a previously completed mediation session  
An agreement would resolve more than a year of fighting between the parties  and could obviate the need for a second major trial scheduled for later this summer  While the filing gave no details on the deal  a hearing was scheduled for Monday afternoon in the Manhattan court  
LightSquared  owned by Phil Falcone s Harbinger Capital Partners  went bankrupt in 2012 after the Federal Communications Commission revoked its license to operate its spectrum amid fears of GPS interference 
Ergen later acquired about  1 billion of LightSquared s senior loan debt  leading the company to accuse him in a lawsuit of trying to surreptitiously gain control of the company  
Judge Shelley Chapman sided with LightSquared in the lawsuit  but still rejected the company s plan to reorganize by subordinating Ergen s debt  saying the plan went too far  After a failed mediation  Ergen also opposed a second LightSquared restructuring proposal that would have subordinated a piece  but not all  of his debt  and vowed to litigate again 

Monday s announcement would appear to signal peace between the parties

Kraft Heinz  shares have gained  2 4  year to date  outperforming the beleaguered Zacks categorized Food Miscellaneous Diversified industry which has lost  1 1  over the same period  Estimates have also remained stable ahead of the company s first quarter earnings release  Cost savings initiatives and strong gains from innovation continue to have a positive impact on the company s performance 

	The Zacks analyst also likes the company s productivity improvement initiatives including zero based budgeting  modernization and capability building  However  the company is experiencing top line weakness over the past several quarters 

	Soft spending by U S  shoppers and shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food are hurting the company s categories  Unfavorable currency translation continued to be a dampener for the segment through 2016 and is likely to hurt results in 2017 as well   You can   

	Shares of Nike have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector on a year to date basis  gaining  8 2  vs   11 6  for the sector  But the Zacks analyst likes the company s customer centric approach  innovative products and strong brand portfolio  This  along with the company s desire for increasing its global footprint  popularity and market share demonstrates its growth appetite 

	These factors  along with SG A leverage and ecommerce growth have helped Nike to beat earnings for 19 straight quarters now  However  Nike s top line fell prey to stiff competition and a tough retail backdrop in the last reported quarter  Persuaded by these factors  management provided soft sales growth outlook for fourth quarter fiscal 2017  It also expects currency headwinds to linger and hurt revenues in the fiscal 

	But Nike remains confident of driving sustainable and profitable capital efficient growth in the long term  Moreover  its shareholder friendly moves bode well   You can   

Stryker  shares have gained  17 4  over the last six months  outperforming the Zacks Medical Products industry  which has gained  11 2  over the same period  Stryker ended the first quarter of 2017 on a solid note  squarely beating expectations  The Zacks analyst thinks the company s innovative product pipeline will be a key catalyst in the near term 

	Additionally  growing adoption of MAKO will drive sales in the orthopedic and reconstructive surgery market  Additionally  the acquisitions of Sage Products and Physio Control and the tie up with Indo UK Institute of Health s Medicity Program are major positives 

	On the flip side  China might prove to be a challenging market for the company  Coming to supply side headwinds  the company has been grappling with issues in the spine business for a while  Additionally  challenging global economic conditions raise concerns   You can

158338,379854,DISH,T Mobile  TMUS  And Sprint  S  Gain On Latest Merger Chatter,opinion,"Shares of T Mobile   NYSE T   and Sprint   NYSE S   moved higher in afternoon trading Thursday after T Mobile CFO Braxton Carter noted that Sprint would be a logical merger partner as the industry continues to consolidate  TMUS gained about 3   while Sprint shares moved up more than 7  
A merger could allow the third and fourth largest U S  mobile carriers to put themselves in a stronger position heading forward  especially considering the competitive advantage Verizon   NYSE V   and AT T   NYSE T   will have as 5G networks begin to be deployed 
 Also read   
 The combined company would have the ability and the resources to really put all of that spectrum to work for the benefits of consumers and businesses everywhere   said Carter 
Of course  a deal between T Mobile and Sprint is not a new idea  The companies were engaged in late stage merger talks back in 2014  but regulators in the Obama administration quashed the deal  opting to maintain a four player mobile market  However  the Trump administration appears more willing to allow major M A moves

158364,379880,DISH,FCC To Initiate Stage 3 Of The 600 MHz Spectrum Auction,opinion,"The Federal Communications Commission  FCC  is likely to commence the stage 3 of the second part  forward auction  of the ongoing 600 MHz low band wireless spectrum auction  popularly known as the Incentive Auction 
The Incentive Auction  which was initiated by the FCC on Mar 29  2016  completed its first part in Jul 2016  In this part  which was essentially a reverse auction  the airwaves were freed by TV broadcasters who no longer had any productive use of the same  The TV broadcasters had agreed to free a substantial 126 MHz of spectrums for a massive  86 4 billion 
As per the Final Stage Rule of the FCC  the proceeds from the forward auction  net of bidding credits and impairment discounts  must be sufficient to cover Incentive Auction costs  These costs include the aggregate of broadcaster clearing costs  approximately  226 million to cover the FCC s costs for conducting the auction and  1 75 billion for the TV Broadcaster Repacking Fund   Accordingly  the forward phase of the Incentive Auction must generate  88 4 billion for the whole process to be successful 
Stage 1 of the Incentive Auction witnessed total bids worth  23 billion after the twenty seventh round of bidding  Notably  the FCC s first Final Stage Rule was that the minimum bid total should reach  15 9 billion for the spectrum auction to continue 
In stage 2 of the auction procedure  the FCC reduced the event clearing spectrum size to 114 MHz instead of 126 MHz decided previously  However  the FCC further reduced the option clearing spectrum size to 90 MHz for a clearing price of  54 6 billion later  Nonetheless  stage 2 of the Incentive Auction came to an unanticipated and abrupt end after a single round of bidding generated only  21 5 billion 
For the stage 3 of the auction process  the FCC has set a target price of  40 3 billion for 108 MHz of broadcasters  spectrum that would free up 80 MHz for wireless use  Nevertheless  several industry watchers have opined that even the stage 3 may not be able to cross the auction clearing mark  Consequently  the FCC is likely to start stage 4 by the end of Dec  2016 which will continue till early 2017  Notably  the freed spectrums cannot be utilized commercially before 2020 
Further  some industry watchers have predicted that telecom operators might need around 60 MHz to 70 MHz of spectrums in the 600 MHz bands for a clearing price of around  30 billion  Low band spectrum is essential for wireless operators as the signals can be transmitted over longer distances and through brick and mortar walls in cities  However  several industry experts believe that telecom operators may be unwilling to shell out such a hefty sum for low band airwaves 
The FCC has received as many as 62 applications for the second part of the Incentive Auction  All 62 bidders have made upfront payments  Important bidders include national telecom giants Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    AT T Inc    NYSE T    and T Mobile US Inc    NYSE T    satellite TV operator DISH Network Corp    NASDAQ DISH   and cable MSOs  multi service operators  Comcast Corp    NASDAQ CMCSA    Each of these stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Price Performance of Wireless Carriers Participating Incentive Auction 

Year to date  the Zacks categorized U S  wireless industry has registered an impressive growth of 14 56   However  the stock prices of two relatively large telecom operators  namely  Verizon and AT T have underperformed the industry mark  While AT T has registered a growth of 12 21   Verizon witnessed just 7 77  growth in the same time period  On the other hand  T Mobile US surged 39 16  in the same time frame 
Price Performance of Cable TV Operators Participating Incentive Auction

Year to date  the Zacks categorized U S  cable TV market has also registered impressive growth of 14 54   While Comcast outperformed the industry mark registering a growth of 21 89   the DISH Network fumbled with a negative growth of 2 85  in the same time period  However  DISH Network has a strong portfolio of lucrative wireless spectrum which can be utilized to offer wireless service or can be monetized in future  We believe is this the primary reason that DISH Network is carrying a Zacks Rank  3 along with Comcast

quarter 2016 results  The company reported earnings of 59 cents per share from continuing operations as against a loss of 22 cents in the year ago quarter It should be noted that TiVo Corporation was formerly known as Rovi Corporation  Upon successfully completing the acquisition of TiVo Inc  early this September  Rovi adopted the iconic TiVo brand name Hence  this was the first quarterly results of the combined company  However  it only includes 23 days of TiVo Inc  operations  Let s discuss the quarter in detail  Quarter in DetailTiVo s revenues jumped 33 3  year over year to  153 1 million mainly due to inclusion of 23 days operations of TiVo Inc  and revenues from Dish Network s   NASDAQ DISH   licensing agreement The company s revenues from Licensing  services and software division increased 29 4  year over year to  148 5 million  contributing 97  to total revenue  Hardware division s revenues grew over thirty seven times to  4 6 million and contributed 3  to total revenue In

185 million to  195 million Our TakeTiVo reported strong third quarter results with year over year improvement in its top and bottom lines  Moreover  the company s outlook for the full year was encouraging Prior to the acquisition  Rovi provided a set of solutions that allowed businesses to protect  enable and distribute digital goods to consumers  helping them discover and manage digital media across multiple channels  On the other hand  TiVo Inc  pioneered a brand new category of products by developing the first commercially available digital video recorder  However  over the years  the company expanded its capabilities beyond hardware sales and patent licensing to online subscription services Therefore  the merger has brought together two leading players in the media entertainment industry with complementary products and services as well as a number of patented technologies  The new TiVo Corporation has now become the global leader in entertainment technology and audience insights  The company has a diverse product portfolio that ranges from interactive program guide to the DVR  The combined company has emerged as the world s leading media and entertainment provider to deliver the ultimate entertainment experience Apart from this  the combined company has over 6 000 issued and pending patents  which offer it a competitive advantage over other media and

158434,379950,DISH,Second Round Of FCC s Reverse Auction Sees A Price Cut ,opinion,The Federal Communications Commission s  FCC  ongoing reverse auction wherein TV broadcasters sell airwaves to wireless operators has seen a massive drop in threshold price  Initially  TV broadcasters have been demanding  86 billion for 100 Mhz spectrum and have now lowered it to  54 6 billion for 90 Mhz airwaves  The auction is being conducted with the intention to free up some spectrum for wireless use Spectrum CrunchIn a saturated wireless market  spectrum crunch has become a major issue in the U S  telecom industry  Most of the carriers are finding it increasingly difficult to manage mobile data traffic  which is growing by leaps and bounds  The situation has become even more acute with the growing popularity of iPhone and Android smartphones as well as rising online mobile video streaming  cloud computing and video conferencing services  Thus  in order to free up some of the usable spectrum for wireless communication  the FCC has asked TV broadcasters such as CBS Corporation   NYSE CBS   to sell their unused spectrum to wireless carriers like AT T Inc    NYSE T   and Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   Lowering PricesDuring the initial stage of the auction  broadcasters were demanding  86 4 billion for their airwaves  However  wireless players deemed the price as too high and offered to pay only  23 1 billion  However  the FCC has revised the price target to  54 6 billion  a massive drop albeit there will be 10  fewer spectrum licences than the first round   However  the revised price is still too high for the wireless providers and the auction is likely to drag on to the third round To ConcludeThe airwaves in the auction are of high importance to wireless carriers as these are ideal for transmitting cellular signals over long distances and have higher penetrating ability in buildings  Thus  many wireless operators are looking to buy these spectrums for their wireless services  Also  the auction is very important to Comcast Corporation   NASDAQ CMCSA   who is set to launch wireless services next year  Meanwhile  Dish Networks Corp   NASDAQ DISH   is also actively participating in the spectrum slae as it is on the lookout for a wireless partner to launch wireless operations Confidential from Zacks Beyond this Analyst Blog  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ,2016-10-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/second-round-of-fcc's-reverse-auction-sees-a-price-cut-200158881,200158881
158435,379951,DISH,FCC Reduces The Clearing Target Price For Incentive Auction,opinion,"The U S  telecom regulator  Federal Communications Commission  FCC   recently reduced the clearing target price of the ongoing 600 MHz low band wireless spectrum auction  popularly known as the Incentive Auction  At present  the regulatory body is going through the stage 2 of the second part of the auction 
Stage 1 of the second part of the Incentive Auction witnessed total bids worth  23 billion after the twenty seventh round of bidding  Notably  the FCC s first Final Stage Rule was that the minimum bid total should reach  15 9 billion for the spectrum auction to continue 
The Incentive Auction  which was initiated by the FCC on Mar 29  2016  completed its first part in Jul 2016  This part was essentially a reverse auction in which  the airwaves were freed by TV broadcasters who no longer had any productive use of the same  The TV broadcasters had agreed to free substantial spectrum of 126 MHz for a massive  86 4 billion 
Per the Final Stage Rule of the FCC  proceeds from the forward auction  net of bidding credits and impairment discounts  must be sufficient to cover Incentive Auction costs  These costs include the aggregate of broadcaster clearing costs  approximately  226 million to cover the FCC s costs for conducting the auction and  1 75 billion for the TV Broadcaster Repacking Fund   Accordingly  the forward phase of the Incentive Auction must generate  88 4 billion for the whole process to be successful 
In stage 2  the FCC reduced the event clearing spectrum size to 114 MHz instead of 126 MHz fixed earlier  However  99 6  of the spectrum offered in this stage will be completely unimpaired compared with 97  of that offered in the first stage 
Consequently  the auction clearing target price has also been lowered substantially to  54 6 billion from the initial target price of  86 4 billion  Importantly  during this stage of the bidding process  the FCC is negotiating with TV broadcasters to determine the amount of spectrum they will release to the  forward  portion of this event and the price of the same 
The FCC has received as many as 62 applications for the second part of the Incentive Auction  All 62 bidders have made upfront payments  Important bidders include national telecom giants Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    AT T Inc    NYSE T    and T Mobile US Inc    NYSE T   and cable MSOs  multi service operators  Comcast Corp    NASDAQ CMCSA    All these stock currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Additionally  satellite TV operator DISH Network Corp    NASDAQ DISH    which already has a strong portfolio of spectrums  is also taking part in the bidding process  Low band spectrum is essential for wireless operators as the signals can be transmitted over longer distances and through brick and mortar walls in cities  However  several industry experts believe that telecom operators may be unwilling to shell out such a hefty sum for low band airwaves 
Some industry watchers have also predicted that telecom operators might need around 70 MHz to 80 MHz of spectrums in the 600 MHz bands instead of the total freed up 126 MHz airwaves  In such a scenario  the FCC might have to conduct another round of reverse auction for a reduced volume of spectrum at lower prices 
The FCC was initially hopeful of completing the Incentive Auction process by the end of the third quarter of 2016  However  industry watchers are now anticipating it to be more prolonged and it is likely to continue till early 2017  Notably  the freed spectrums cannot be utilized commercially before 2020

T Mobile US offers its customers unlimited high speed data starting at  70 per month for one connection with DVD quality video streaming  charging an extra  25 for those who want high definition video services  The price rises up to  120 for two lines and  140 for three lines  Any additional line after that is  20 extra a month  The company s pervious unlimited plan was available at  95 per month  On the other hand  Sprint reduced the cost for its unlimited data plan to  60 from  75 a month while giving users access to DVD quality streaming video 
On the other hand  U S  telecom behemoth AT T Inc    NYSE T   has declared discarding its policy of charging fees to customers exceeding their data caps  The carrier will instead lower the connection speed   something which has been done by its rivals for a while now 
In the last week  AT T was in the news for two more developments  The company announced its collaboration with chipset manufacturer Intel Corp    NYSE T   to develop new software centric network technologies  This will aid AT T in optimizing its Network for Functions Virtualization  NFV  capabilities for its AT T Integrated Cloud  AIC  service  Moreover  AT T entered into an agreement with Cuba s state run telecommunications company Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba  ETECSA  to offer direct roaming mobile interconnection services between the two countries

Analyst Expectations
A senior analyst at Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   Marci Ryvicker  CFA and CPA had the following notes on the recent developments on DISH 
This morning  6 9  DISH announced it has priced  2B of new senior notes due 2026 at 7 75   expected to be placed on June 16th  We provide answers to some of the questions we ve been getting since this morning s announcement 
What are the proceeds for  The release states  for strategic transactions  which may include wireless and spectrum related transactions  we believe some of the funds will be put toward the upfront payment that the FCC requires for participation in the forward part of the broadcast incentive auction  We would also point out that Charlie said on 6 2 that he s running with less cash on the balance sheet than he is typically comfortable with  cash on hand was  709MM as of 3 31  so it also could be that DISH is just taking advantage of a favorable high yield market 
What do we know about the upfront payments  The size of every bidder s upfront payment will vary as it is based on the specific licenses upon which it intends to bid as well as on the opening bid prices  For reference  to bid on 10MHz of nationwide spectrum  a bidder would need to make an upfront payment of  587MM  or  1 17B for 20MHz and so on   The deadline for upfront payments is July 1st at 5pm 
How active do we expect DISH to be in the incentive auction  Before this debt raise  we had thought that DISH would be relatively inactive during this auction  Clearly this  2B throws a bit of a wrench into that view  although our gut tells us that Charlie is just being opportunistic  He had always talked about the 600MHz as a  nice to have  rather than a  need to have  and we don t think this view has changed 
What does this do to DISH s leverage  By our calculation  this new debt issuance would raise DISH s total leverage ratio to 4 6x from 4 0x although net leverage would remain in the high 3x range until the cash is actually spent
