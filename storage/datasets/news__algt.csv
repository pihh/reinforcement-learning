14172,235687,ALGT,Here Is Why Airline Stocks Underperformed The Market In 2019,opinion,It is a well documented fact that stocks in the airline space have not had a great time in 2019  to which we will soon bid adieu  Headwinds like lackluster cargo business due to reduced freight demand and trade tensions between the United States and China  and loss of revenues following flight cancellations arising out of the grounding of Boeing  NYSE BA  737 MAX jets  have prevented the stocks from flying high this year The Zacks  industry has significantly underperformed the S P 500 Index so far this year  The industry has gained 14 5  on a year to date basis compared with the S P 500 s appreciation of 27 2   Let s delve deep to unearth the reasons behind the unimpressive performance of airline stocks in 2019 Challenges posed by the prolonged grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets have hurt their carriers  Notably  three U S  carriers   Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV    American Airlines   NASDAQ AAL   and United Airlines   NASDAQ UAL     have 34  24 and 14 Boeing 737 MAX jets in their fleet  respectively  According to Forbes  a report by U K  based flight data information firm OAG has predicted that Boeing 737 Max s grounding will hurt global airline industry revenues by in 2019  including  600 million for the aforementioned U S  airlines As a reminder  all U S  registered Boeing 737 MAX jets have been grounded since March this year after they were involved in two fatal air crashes in different parts of the world over a span of five months apparently due to software malfunctioning  The grounding of the above mentioned jets has resulted in reduced capacity and escalation of non fuel unit costs  thereby limiting bottom line growth  For example  American Airlines now expects its 2019 capacity to increase only about 1  over 2018 levels  earlier guidance had predicted an increase in the e in the 2 3  range   This reduction from the previous guidance is primarily due to the grounding of the company s 737 MAX aircraft  Moreover  the carrier anticipates its full year pre tax income to be hurt by roughly  540 million due to the grounding Moreover  decline in cargo revenues  the second largest contributor to the top line of most carriers after passenger revenues  was another undesirable development in 2019  The decline was mostly due to lower volumes and yield  For example  at Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL    cargo revenues declined 13  year over year to  567 million in the first nine months of 2019 According to the International Air Transport Association   IATA   cargo demand declined 3 3  in 2019   the sharpest drop since 2009  Moreover  freight carriage declined from 63 3 million tons in 2018 to 61 2 million tons in 2019  Trade dispute between the United States and China took a heavy toll on air freight volumes in 2019  Trade tensions apart  escalated levels of political uncertainties across the globe hurt the air cargo business in 2019 In fact  trade in emerging countries have underperformed that of advanced nations this year primarily due to higher sensitivity of the emerging economies to trade tensions  rising political instability and sharp currency depreciation in some of the key emerging markets  This development has spelt doom for air freight demand Weather related disturbances have also disrupted airline operations this year  resulting in loss of revenues and increased non fuel costs due to the resultant flight cancelations  For example  the Miramar based discount airline Spirit Airlines  September quarter revenues were hurt to the tune of roughly  25 million due to Hurricane Dorian induced flight cancellations Reflecting these headwinds  in December  IATA revised its 2019 profit forecast for the industry to  25 9 billion from the  28 billion forecast provided in June 2020 Might be Brighter for AirlinesRecent positive developments on the trade war front  including agreement on the terms of a phase one trade deal  indicate that tensions between Washington and Beijing might ease in 2020  This bodes well for airlines  In fact  IATA predicts 2  growth with respect to cargo traffic in 2020 Also  demand for air travel is expected to be stronger in 2019 with IATA forecasting a 4  improvement in passenger numbers to  4 72 billion in 2020  Moreover  Boeing 737 Max jets might resume operations next year Want to Own Airline Stocks Now With IATA suggesting good things for airlines in in 2020  investors might want to add stocks from the space to their portfolio  We have shortlisted three   Hawaiian Holdings   NASDAQ HA    Ryanair Holdings   NASDAQ RYAAY   and Allegiant Travel Company   NASDAQ ALGT     that might be solid bets  You can see  While Hawaiian Holdings and Ryanair

14174,235689,ALGT,Which Airline Stocks Could Be The Allegiant  ALGT  Of 2020 ,opinion,Airline stocks did not set the stage on fire in 2019  which is about to end  thanks to headwinds like a lackluster cargo business due to reduced freight demand and trade tensions between the United States and China  and loss of revenues following flight cancellations arising out of the grounding of Boeing  NYSE BA  737 MAX jets However  amid these headwinds  Allegiant Travel Company   NASDAQ ALGT   stood out as the shining star of the Zacks industry this year  Shares of this in Las Vegas  NV based company  which operates a low cost passenger airline through its subsidiary Allegiant Air  gained roughly 75  in a year s time  easily outperforming the industry s nearly 14  appreciation in the same time period Let s delve deeper and analyze the reasons behind the company s impressive price performance Allegiant s results this year have been aided by strong passenger revenues  which account for bulk of the carrier s top line  On the back of surging demand for air travel  passenger revenues increased 9 4  in the first nine months of 2019  Backed by strong passenger revenues  the company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in two of the three quarters of 2019  The bullish earnings history is a huge tailwind since earnings beat generally leads to stock price appreciation We are also impressed by the company s efforts to modernize its fleet  The carrier operates an all Airbus fleet  Allegiant s fleet size at the end of 2019 is expected to be 93  38 A319 and 55 A320   indicating an increase of 22 4  from the year ago reported figure  The transition to an all Airbus fleet  completed in November 2018  increased Allegiant s fuel efficiency  Additionally  as the carrier does not have Boeing 737 MAX jets in its fleet  it is immune to troubles that have arisen due to their prolonged grounding Moreover  the current scenario of moderate fuel prices is favorable for Allegiant as expenses on fuel represent a substantial input cost for any airline company  Evidently  average fuel cost per gallon  scheduled  declined 10  to  2 17 at Allegiant in the September quarter  The company expects fuel cost per gallon of  2 15 in 2019 Will the Scenario be Better for Airlines in 2020 As mentioned earlier  the airline industry struggled in 2019  with the exception of the likes of Allegiant  However  things are likely to look up for airlines in the coming year In spite of the deal inked by the OPEC group and its allies in mid December to cut production  most industry experts expect crude oil prices to remain stable in 2020  This outlook should support the bottom line of airline players  In fact  the International Air Transport Association expects oil prices to average around  63  Brent  per barrel in 2020 compared with  65 expected in 2019  Fuel bill for the industry in 2020 is expected to be  182 billion  lower than 2019 The research firm expects the entire picture with respect to airline profitability to be brighter in 2020 than 2019  Evidently  the industry is expected to generate profits of roughly  29 3 billion  average net profit per departing passenger is predicted to be  6 2 compared with 2019 s estimated figure of  5 7  in 2020 compared with the  25 9 billion predicted for 2019 Thus  it s time to invest in airline stocks that are likely to make hay in 2020 by replicating Allegiant s blowout 2019 performance 3 Solid PicksHowever  given the vastness of the airline industry  identifying stocks with the potential to shine in

22188,243703,ALGT,3 Airline Stocks To Buy On IATA s Improved 2020 Profit View,opinion,It is no secret that stocks in the airline space have not had a great time in 2019  which is in its last leg  Headwinds like loss of revenues due to flight cancellations arising out of the grounding of Boeing  NYSE BA  737 MAX jets  lackluster cargo business due to reduced freight demand and trade tensions between the United States and China have prevented the stocks from flying high this year The downtrend can be made out from the fact that the Zacks  industry has significantly underperformed the S P 500 Index so far this year  The industry has gained 9 6  on a year to date basis compared with the S P 500 s appreciation of 23 9  Reflecting these headwinds  the International Air Transport Association  IATA  revised its 2019 profit forecast for the industry to  25 9 billion from the  28 billion forecast provided in June However  the research firm expects the picture to be sunnier in 2020  Profitability for the industry is expected to be  29 3 billion  average net profit per departing passenger is predicted to be  6 2 compared with 2019 s estimated figure of  5 7   The outlook for the top line is also brighter at  872 billion  suggesting 4  growth from this year Highlights of IATA s 2020 ForecastThe bulk of the global profits   16 5 billion  is expected from the North American region  However  the figure is lower than  16 9 billion expected in 2019  The North American region  which boasts carriers like Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   and American Airlines   NASDAQ AAL    is likely to witness profit of  16 per passenger  on average  and net margin of 6  next year Profits from Europe  Asia Pacific and Latin America are expected to generate post tax net profit of  7 9 billion   6 billion and  0 1 billion  respectively  However  carriers from Middle East and Africa are expected to perform dismally and register losses of  1 billion and  0 2 billion  respectively According to the forecast  passenger traffic and capacity are expected to grow at 4 1  and 4 7   respectively  next year   Load factor  percentage of seats filled by passengers  for 2020 is expected to decline 40 basis points to 82  as capacity expansion is likely to outweigh traffic growth  The decline in load factor is anticipated to put pressure on yields Why the Improved ForecastIt is a well known fact that there is an inverse relation between crude prices and the value of aviation stocks  Naturally  a decline in oil prices is favorable for carriers as it will result in lower operating expenses  Airlines are likely to benefit in this respect  The IATA expects oil prices to average around  63  Brent  per barrel in 2020 compared with  65 expected in 2019  Fuel bill for the industry in 2020 is expected to be  182 billion next year  lower than 2019 Moreover  IATA expects trade growth to pick up in 2020 to 3 3  from 0 9  in 2019 as  election year pressures in the U S  contribute to reduced trade tensions   Due to strong demand for air travel  passenger revenues  excluding ancillaries   which usually account for most of the top line for carriers  are anticipated to touch  581 billion  higher than 2019 levels  IATA expects around 4 72 billion to take to the skies in 2020  up year over year  Moreover  net profit margin is predicted to be 3 4   again higher than 2019  Airlines Represent Solid Investment OpportunitiesIn view of IATA s improved forecast for 2020  we believe that stocks from the space should grace one s portfolio  We have  thus  selected three airline stocks sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Moreover  two of our selected stocks are from Europe since IATA expects profitability of European carriers to increase 27 4  year over year in 2020 to  7 9 billion  Factors like moderate capacity expansion and an uptick in economic growth in the region have contributed to the rosy forecast for European carriers Ryanair Holdings   NASDAQ RYAAY   is based in Ireland and provides scheduled passenger airline services  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings moved up 5 8  in the past 60 days Deutsche Lufthansa  DE LHAG

22192,243707,ALGT,Is Allegiant Travel Co   ALGT  A Good Value Investor Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Allegiant Travel Company   NASDAQ ALGT   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Allegiant Travel Company has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 65  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 61  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Allegiant Travel Company s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 12 99 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands significantly below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  Moreover  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Transportation Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 67  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Allegiant Travel Company has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 11 87  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Allegiant Travel Company s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Allegiant Travel Company has a P S ratio of about 1 54  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 39 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Allegiant Travel Company currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Allegiant Travel Company a solid choice for value investors For example  the PEG ratio for Allegiant Travel Company is just 0 45  a level that is marginally lower than the industry average of 0 62  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  ALGT is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Allegiant Travel Company might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and Momentum Score of D  This gives ALGT a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current year has seen six upward revisions in the past sixty days compared to no downward revision  while the full year 2020 estimate has also seen six upward revisions compared to no downward revision in the same time period The current year consensus estimate increased 4 7  in the past two months  whereas the full year 2020 estimate rose 9 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Allegiant Travel Company Price and Consensus   Notably  the stock with a solid earnings surprise history and long term EPS growth rate of 26 3  has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   which is why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAllegiant Travel Company is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  the company carries a robust industry rank  among top 24  of more than 250 industries  So  value investors might want to wait for broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases  They re also finding ways to edit the human genome to literally erase our vulnerability to these diseases Zacks has just released Century of Biology  7 Biotech Stocks to Buy Right Now to help investors profit from 7 stocks poised for outperformance  Our

22196,243711,ALGT,5 Incredible Value Stocks To Buy For 2020,opinion,So far in 2019  various events like the U S  China trade war  Brexit related uncertainty and the Fed s decision to cut interest rates thrice in the year have impacted stocks from all sectors in some way or other Still  the S P 500 index has been hitting new all time highs  So far this year  the S P 500 rose 26 1   Because of this rise  most of the stocks are likely to have become expensive for investors at present Nevertheless  this should not be considered as bad news by value investors  who benefit from buying stocks that are trading at a discount or are less expensive because all stocks have not been able to match the stock market s rally Due to the global concerns   including the trade war   there are some stocks  which did not appreciate much in price  and are still trading at a reasonable discount and hence seem to be good investment options for value investors In fact  value investors search for those stocks that they think the stock market is underestimating  Value investing is one of the most popular ways to find such undervalued stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys or offer tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value Notably  these investors try to look at several key metrics and financial ratios  which are crucial in the value stock selection process Two of the most commonly used ratios are price earnings  P E  and price sales  P S   which are used to determine whether a stock is trading cheap The P E ratio shows us how much an investor is willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  By comparing the P E ratio of a given stock with that of the broader market or with the stock s sector  an investor finds out whether the stock is currently trading cheap Similarly  the P S ratio compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where  like the P E ratio  a lower reading is considered better  Some people prefer this metric more than P E because this ratio considers sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Also  earnings can be negative while sales cannot So  it can be concluded that there are still a number of stocks  which are good investment options for value investors  Hence  such investors should buy these stocks for 2020 We have taken the help of the  to shortlist five stocks that are incredible for value investors to buy for 2020 as these currently carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   You can see  Also  the stocks have a  of A or B  Our research shows that stocks  with a Value Score of A or

22315,243830,ALGT,Transportation Overcomes Headwinds To Shine In Q3  4 Picks,opinion,It is a well documented fact that the highly diversified Zacks  sector is plagued with multiple headwinds like a dismal freight scenario in the United States  grounding of Boeing  NYSE BA  737 MAX jets and driver shortage Despite the headwinds  sector participants fared well in the Q3 earnings season  The rosy picture is supported by our   which states the S P 500 transportation stocks witnessed an impressive 8 2  year over year bottom line growth  Moreover  73 3  of the S P 500 transportation companies outperformed with respect to the bottom line in the September quarter Let s delve deep to unearth the reasons behind the impressive performance of transportation stocks in Q3 amid challenges Expenses on fuel comprise a substantial input cost for any transportation company  On this note  transportation companies were well served as oil prices fell 8 5  during the July September period  mainly owing to the restoration of production capabilities of crude following the drone attack on Saudi Arabia s oil facilities in mid September Moreover  airline companies  which are crucial to the transportation sector  benefited in Q3 from robust traffic during the summer season  Strong demand for air travel boosted passenger revenues thereby bolstering the top lines of carriers  This is because passenger revenues account for the bulk of top line of most airline companies Despite soft U S  rail volumes due to economic sluggishness  the bottom line performance of most railroads   another important corner of the Transportation sector   benefited in Q3 from cost cut efforts following the adoption of precision scheduled railroading model  Additionally  results of car rental companies like Hertz Global Holdings   NYSE HTZ   gained from upbeat demand and favorable pricing Bullish Picture Continues Post Q3 Earnings Season What is more encouraging is that there are ample tailwinds to suggest that sector participants will continue to perform well in the tough environment  For instance  U S  carriers like Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   are likely to attract significant traffic during the Thanksgiving travel period  Nov 22 Dec 3   As a result  passenger revenues should see a further uptick  thereby bolstering the performance of carriers in the December quarter With the U S  economy expanding at a steady pace and consumers remaining confident about their well being  a greater number of Americans are opting for a vacation  This is boosting travel demand as highlighted by the Airlines for America s rosy  Additionally  with railroads continuing their cost control efforts  their bottom line should continue to grow despite a sluggish freight environment  Moreover  oil prices are unlikely to touch the astronomical highs of 2014 any time soon  In fact  the U S  Energy Information Administration predicts average oil prices at 2019 end to be  56 45 per barrel  lower than the 2018 figure of  65 06 per barrel  This should support the bottom line growth of transportation stocks   In fact  the Zacks Transportation sector has outperformed the S P 500 Index so far in Q4  The sector has gained 6 6  of its value on a quarter to date basis compared with the S P 500 s appreciation of 5 3  Transports Represent Solid Investment OpportunitiesIn view of the enthusiasm surrounding

22357,243872,ALGT,U S  airlines focus on investor returns as industry profits,news,"By Karen Jacobs  Reuters    Major U S  airlines posted earnings gains on Thursday  aided by higher airfares and summer demand  and the two largest carriers announced moves to return more cash to investors 
American Airlines Group  O AAL   the largest by traffic  capped off a strong second quarter by announcing its first cash dividend since 1980 and a share buyback 
United Continental Holdings  N UAL  also said it would repurchase  1 billion in stock 
The buybacks mark a significant change as the four largest U S  airlines  all the products of mergers  now focus on capital deployment and raising returns for investors  American s 2013 merger completed a consolidation period that has helped put the U S  industry on sound financial footing 
 The companies are obviously seeing their fundamentals good enough and improving at a fast enough pace that allows them to  start dividends and buybacks  said Kris Kelley  a research analyst with Janus Capital Group 
Delta Air Lines  N DAL  resumed a dividend and buyback last year and Southwest Airlines  N LUV  also pays dividends  Among the smaller carriers  Alaska Air Group  N ALK  pays a dividend 
 The conversation  around airlines  has definitely changed   Kelley said   Investors are starting to look at these stocks as actual companies rather than just proxies for the global economy  
American  Alaska Air  Southwest and United had second quarter profit that topped average analyst estimates  buoyed by price increases and summer demand that helped keep seats full 
United s results showed benefits from cost cutting  and Southwest said revenue of  5 billion was a quarterly high  American said its net profit of  1 5 billion excluding charges was also a record 
JetBlue Airways  O JBLU  reported higher quarterly profit as well on Thursday  following strong results from Delta on Wednesday 
 Demand has remained strong and airlines have continued to refine their route networks     fine tuning their schedules and the aircraft they fly  and becoming more aggressive in how they manage their seats   said Henry Harteveldt  founder and travel industry analyst at Atmosphere Research Group 
He said airlines were becoming more targeted in how they conduct fare sales  extending promotions to a select group of customers rather than having massive sales across all routes and seats 

U S  airlines have better aligned available seats with demand and retired less efficient airplanes to improve operations while charging extra fees for items such as seat upgrades to boost revenue 
The airlines are also keeping a close eye on costs  United has cut staff  while Delta and Allegiant Travel  O ALGT  said this week they had recently offered voluntary retirement or buyout options in efforts to keep costs down 
Shares of airlines were mixed  with United up 2 8 percent to  47 29 and Southwest up 0 2 percent to  28 94  American and Delta eased less than 1 percent  and Alaska was off 3 9 percent to  47 73

22362,243877,ALGT,3 Airline Stocks To Buy On A4A s Rosy Thanksgiving Forecast,opinion,According to a projection by Airlines for America  A4A   the trade organization for leading U S  airlines  companies in the airline space are set to have a busy time in the 12 day Thanksgiving travel period  Nov 22 Dec 3   The projection indicates 3 7  more passengers flying to various destinations in the period compared to 2018 The bullish forecast further confirms strong demand for air travel  Affordable ticket prices have contributed to the favorable projection  Needless to say  with the economy expanding at a steady pace and consumers remaining confident about their well being  a greater number of Americans are opting for a vacation So  it makes sense to invest in airline stocks that can make the most of an upbeat A4A view A4A s ProjectionAccording to the forecast put forward by the Washington based trade group  approximately 31 6 million passengers will travel on U S  airlines during the Thanksgiving holiday period this year  The forecast implies that 2 63 million people will take to the skies per day compared with 2 55 million fliers per day in the same period last year  Moreover  Dec 1 is likely to be the busiest day for carriers ever  with 3 1 million people expected to take to the skies on that day To meet the surge in travel demand  U S  carriers are increasing the number of available seats by 108 000 per day  In fact  they will be operating 859 more flights a day during the period compared to 2018 Additionally  the robust financial health of most domestic carriers has prompted them to invest substantially in improving the flying experience of travelers  in a bid to stay afloat amid stiff competition  Driven by the above reasons  the 12 day period is likely to see 93 000 additional passengers taking to the skies per day on various U S  carriers Passenger Revenues Likely to Get a BoostThe upbeat forecast implies that the already strong passenger revenues will be augmented in the Thanksgiving holiday period  This should aid the top line of carriers significantly as passenger revenues account for a bulk of the top line of most airline companies For instance  passenger revenues at American Airlines   NASDAQ AAL   and Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   accounted for 91 9  and 92 6  of the top line  respectively  in the first nine months of 2019 Bullish Forecast Coincides With Oil Price DeclineIt is a well known fact that fuel prices represent a substantial input cost for any airline company  Airlines have been well served in this regard as oil prices have declined approximately 10  over the past six months  mainly owing to the restoration of production capabilities of crude  following the drone attack on Saudi Arabia s oil facilities in mid September In fact  this drop in oil prices supported bottom line growth in the third quarter of 2019  Airline heavyweights like Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL    American Airlines and United Airlines   NASDAQ UAL   reported year over year growth in third quarter earnings due to low fuel costs Airlines Represent Solid Investment OpportunitiesIn view of the enthusiasm surrounding airline stocks  as

The U S  based automotive retailer of new and used vehicles recorded better than expected results in the last reported quarter on the back of high same store sales across all business lines 
As far as earnings surprises are concerned  Lithia Motors has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  the average beat being 8 04   This is depicted in the graph below Lithia Motors  Inc  Price and Consensus   Which Way are Top and Bottom Line Estimates Headed 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter earnings per share of  3 14 has been revised down by a penny over the past seven days  It calls for a year over year increase of 10 95   The consensus estimate for revenues of  3 24 billion suggests an uptick from  3 09 billion in the prior year quarter 
Factors Setting the Tone
A diverse physical network and strong brands are expected to have driven Lithia Motors  sales in third quarter 2019  Enhanced digital solutions is expected to have boosted profits and market presence for the company  The company is also anticipated to have widened omni channel capabilities in order to expand and modernize transportation solutions for customers 
With rising prices of new vehicles  customers are more inclined to purchase used vehicles  This is likely to have driven the company s used vehicle unit  which has been a major growth driver over the last several quarters as well 
With rapid growth in dealership purchases  Lithia Motors  continued acquisitions are likely to have helped expand market share and cater to varied customer requirements in the quarter  The recent takeovers of Lincoln Morgantown and Hazleton Honda dealerships are worth a mention in this context 
Meanwhile  the quarter is expected to have seen a continuous rise in SG A expenses  primarily due to acquisition costs and insurance reserves  partially offset by store sales  This is likely to show on its net income results 
The company s new vehicle unit sales are expected to have declined in the quarter  majorly because of disrupted distribution of vehicles at stores in Northwest  Also  a huge availability of off lease used vehicles in the market might have partly contributed to the decline

22747,244262,ALGT,Allegiant  International Paper  Amazon  Atlas Air And Air Transport Services Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 4  2019    Allegiant Travel Company   NASDAQ ALGT   as the Bull of the Day  International Paper   NYSE IP   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings   NASDAQ AAWW   and Air Transport Services Group   NASDAQ ATSG   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Shares of Allegiant Travel Company have soared in 2019 to easily outpace the broader Transportation Air Market  Many of the discount airline firm s fundamentals appear strong and its top and bottom lines are projected to climb significantly both this year and next   The Basics Allegiant refers to itself as an  integrated travel company with an airline at its heart   The Las Vegas based firm offers customers low cost flights from smaller cities throughout the U S   as well as to vacation hubs such as Phoenix  Orlando  and of course  Las Vegas  Allegiant also sells travel package bundles that include flights  hotels  rental cars  and tickets to local entertainment events Investors should also note that the firm doesn t even fly every day  opting instead for flights on  only the days when most people want to fly   This helps the company that was founded in the late 1990s save money  In fact  Allegiant s 22  airline operating margin led the industry in the first quarter and that figure popped to 24  in Q2 Allegiant currently runs more than 450 routes across the country and provides nonstop  scheduled service from over 110 U S  cities  The firm also boasts that its base fares cost less than half than average domestic roundtrip ticket  ALGT doesn t really compete against giants such as United   American or even JetBlue  Instead  it likely finds itself up against the likes of Spirit and other discount airlines  Nonetheless  Allegiant looks poised to expand its business  which includes bringing its leisure model to Mexico and the Caribbean in the  coming years  Price Movement Moving on  ALGT stock has crushed its industry over the last decade  The last three years have  however  been far more turbulent for Allegiant and the Transportation Air Market both up just around 4   With this in mind  shares of the discount airline firm have had a comeback over the last year  ALGT stock is up 5  over the last 12 months  against its industry s 14  decline Better yet  Allegiant has soared over 41  in 2019  Despite its strong overall performance  shares of ALGT currently rest roughly 10  below their 52 week highs  which could set up a solid buying opportunity for those high on Allegiant Other Fundamentals Allegiant currently utilizes two aircraft  the 156 seat Airbus A319 and the roughly 180 sear Airbus A320  The simple fact that Allegiant hasn t been exposed to Boeing s 737 Max groundings is a good thing  Allegiant executives also praised Airbus  fuel efficiencies  With this in mind  lower global oil prices could help the company during the upcoming holiday travel period Furthermore  Allegiant s total passengers surged 12 6  last quarter  with revenue passenger miles up 11 5  and available seat miles up 13 4   On top of that  the overall airline industry appears strong right now  which might help boost Allegiant  The Transportation   Airline industry currently ranks in the top 12  of our 256 Zacks industries Investors should note that ALGT holds  B  grades for both Value and Momentum in our Style Scores system  The company is also set to pay a dividend of  0 70 per share on September 27 to shareholders of record as of September 20  Allegiant s annualized payout currently comes out to  2 80 a share  with a 1 97  yield that looks very strong as the yields on the 10 year U S  Treasury sit at 1 46  Outlook   Earnings Trends Looking ahead  our current Zacks Consensus Estimates call for the firm s Q3 2019 revenue to jump 9 23  to reach  429 39 million  This would fall short of last quarter s 12 6  operating revenue expansion  Still  the firm s Q4 revenue is projected to grow by over 11  to help lift full year fiscal 2019 revenue by 9 7  to  1 83 billion  Then  peeking ahead to 2020  Allegiant s revenue is projected to climb 11 3  above our current year estimate to reach  2 04 billion At the bottom end of the income statement  ALGT s adjusted third quarter earnings are projected to skyrocket from  0 94 per share in the year ago period to reach  2 23 a share  The firm s Q4 earnings are expected to climb 40   with fiscal 2019 s EPS figure then projected pop 36 5   And this insane bottom line growth is projected to be followed up with another 12 4  expansion in 2020 Bottom LineAllegiant has seen its earnings estimate revision activity trend more heavily in the right direction recently  especially for fiscal 2019 and 2020  This positivity helps ALGT earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and look like a stock that investors might want to consider picking up at the moment Lastly  the company announced in early August that it landed the naming rights for  the under construction future home of the Raiders and UNLV football   which could help provide more national exposure  Shares of International Paper have tumbled over 25  in the past year as part of a much broader industry downturn that has seen the paper market slide over 45   And International Paper s outlook doesn t appear as though it will inspire much investor confidence anytime soon Quick Overview International Paper is a global paper giant that produces renewable fiber based packaging  pulp  and paper products  The Memphis  Tennessee based firm manufactures products around the world and its more than 25 000 customers helped it pull in  23 billion in revenue last year  Overall  69  of the company s total sales come from its Industrial Packaging division  with most of that coming from its North American segment  This includes packaging and boxes used in everything from processed food and beverages to durable non durable goods The firm also runs a North American recycling business  Meanwhile  International Paper makes pulp used in tissue  diapers  and other personal hygiene products  Its global Cellulose Fibers division accounts for 12  of revenue  Lastly  IP produces a variety of papers geared toward both businesses and households  which makes up 19  of sales International Paper is still a global powerhouse  but it faces some tough market conditions  In April  Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC  analyst George Staphos downgraded IP stock on the back of larger  non company specific forces   Recent containerboard and box data suggests producers are having challenges managing excess inventory and production  and pricing could remain subdued for the foreseeable time    in a note  Last quarter  IP s net sales slipped roughly 2 8  and fell short of our estimates Outlook   Earnings Trends Looking ahead  International Paper s third quarter fiscal 2019 revenue is projected to come in at  5 73 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  This would mark a similar 2 8  decline from the year ago period  The firm s Q4 sales are then projected to fall roughly 3 7  to help bring full year fiscal 2019 sales down 1 9   Peeking further ahead  fiscal 2020 revenues are expected to come in roughly 1  below our current year estimate The bottom end of the income statement looks much worse for International Paper  The company s adjusted Q3 earnings are projected to tumble approximately 36  from the prior year quarter  IP s fourth quarter EPS figure is expected to sink over 25   And the firm s full year fiscal 2019 earnings are projected to slip 15 6   with 2020 expected to come in 13 3  lower than our current year estimate Bottom LineInternational Paper is still a strong company that returns money to investors through dividends and repurchases  The firm also boasts some solid valuation metrics  which are somewhat inflated based on its recent downturn  Nonetheless  IP s earnings estimate revision activity has trended heavily in the wrong direction recently  This helps it earn a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and a  D  grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system Amazon Roundup  India  Indonesia  Canada  Logistics   MoreAmazon is strengthening its position in India despite regulatory setbacks  it is investing in a leading Indonesian ecommerce company  increasing logistics capabilities in Canada  and helping the police  getting sued by publishers and defeating the IRS in the U S IndiaIndia s crackdown on fraudulent practices by non banking financial institutions and its move to ban international auditing firm Deloitte and a KPMG affiliate has rattled corporate heads  contributing to lower growth rates and impacting the stock market  Amazon India head Amit Agarwal took the opportunity to say that India could improve its growth rates by promoting ecommerce rather than holding it back with red tape and unfriendly laws He also said that Amazon s push for SMB exports had contributed a billion dollars to the country s exports and that the next three years would see this number climb to  5 billion Amazon is specifically opposing the government s move to protect small sellers that can t compete with the deep discounts on the platform  The Confederation of All India Traders  CAIT  are accusing big retailers like Amazon of continuing to use complex measures to circumvent the protective law that went into effect this February Agarwal s comments seem to indicate that the company is opposing rather than requesting time to build the data centers necessary to store Indian data within its borders  in line with global sentiments Amazon has however inaugurated a new campus in the southern city of Hyderabad and there are no known plans of slowing down investment in the country  where Prime memberships continue to grow at the fastest rate in the world Amazon is making arrangements to acquire a larger stake in Future Retail  one of the leading traditional retail chains in India  So  through Amazon Com NV Investment Holdings LLC it has agreed to buy a 49  stake in Future Coupons Ltd  which holds warrants that can be converted partly or wholly into Future Retail shares  The warrants can be exercised in the next three to 10 years  It was earlier reported that Amazon was looking to buy a 10  stake in the company  valued at 20 billion rupees  or  278 million Investment in Indonesia s Gojek AppBloomberg and Reuters are saying that Amazon is in talks to acquire a stake in Indonesian super app Gojek Presumably the super prefix is because the app lets you hail rides  order dinner  shop groceries  make payments through a digital wallet  appoint cleaners  masseuses  hairdressers  etc  order medicines  and many other things  Its usefulness has enabled its expansion across Indonesia  the Philippines  Singapore  Thailand and Vietnam  where it serves 260 million people and competes with Alibaba  NYSE BABA  and Shopee  In Indonesia  where it launched  ecommerce sales are expected to jump from the current  12 2 billion to  53 billion in the next five years The terms of the deal aren t known  but it definitely looks like a good place to kick start Amazon s investment in the region Equity Stake in Canadian Airline CargojetAmazon continues to corner logistics capabilities in an attempt to serve its customers better  So similar to its agreements with U S  air carriers Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group  it has signed an agreement with Toronto based Cargojet  which operates 21 freighters  Boeing  NYSE BA  757s and 767s  Accordingly  Cargojet will issue warrants that can  after seven years  be converted into voting shares  giving Amazon a 9 9  stake in the company  In exchange  Amazon will make sure it contributes C  400 million in volumes through the period  There s also a separate agreement giving Amazon warrants to buy  after seven years  an additional 5  of variable voting shares  for C  200 million Partnership with 400 Police ForcesAmazon owned Ring has set itself up for fresh controversy by partnering with 400 police departments across the country It allows law enforcement access to video recorded by the camera system that typically detects motion and transmits to the user  which can be viewed and shared as desired  Policemen won t get live access to the data unless publicly shared  but only by requesting the home owner  who has the prerogative to refuse   Privacy advocates and critics fear this could increase racial profiling  while turning police officers into salespeople for surveillance systems and increase community paranoia Amazon  however  has said that the technology is so great that it can also identify emotions like fear  happiness  sadness  anger  surprise  disgust  calmness and confusion although it isn t against a certain amount of regulation Its shareholders rejected proposals to stop selling the technology to government agencies and also to investigate privacy violations Amazon s Audible Sued for Copyright InfringementAmazon doesn t appear to learn well from past mistakes  or tries to stretch what it can do with everything at its disposal  In the past  the company has got on the wrong side of publishers  authors and the Authors Guild because of unauthorized use of copyrights  And now it s doing pretty much the same thing with its audio book company Audible Its new speech to text feature called  Captions  can use machine learning to reproduce voice recordings so children can see the text that they re hearing  The text may not be a hundred percent accurate  Amazon warns  and is intended to be more an education aid than anything else  according to the company  This is supposed to legalize the textual reproduction notwithstanding the fact that it will in all probability impact sales of print and digital book sales  hurting authors and publishers  Of course  publishers  including Hachette  HarperCollins  Macmillan  Penguin Random House  Simon   Schuster  Chronicle Books and Scholastic don t agree with the thinking  So they and the Association of American Publishers  to which they subscribe  have sued Amazon in the Southern  NYSE SO  District Court of New York for copyright infringement IRS Appeal in U S  Tax DisputeAmazon won a 3 0 ruling in its favor at the 9th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals in Seattle  The court upheld the 2017 U S  tax court ruling against the IRS  represented by the Justice Department The case was in relation to the definition of intangibles that were transferred to its Luxemburg headquarters in Europe  Amazon claimed that the value was limited to independently transferable assets  while the IRS wanted to include things like goodwill  employees and  culture of innovation  A 2017 amendment to the tax law does include these things  and would have enabled the IRS to increase the tax bill  But the judge held that since the increased scope of intangibles in 2017 did not apply to what Amazon transacted in 2005 and 2006  it couldn t be held liable RecommendationAmazon shares carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here Legalizing THIS Could Be

announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Allegiant Travel Co    NASDAQ ALGT    Bristol Myers Squibb Co    NYSE BMY    NewMarket Corp    NYSE NEU    North American Construction Group Ltd    TSX NOA   and TiVo Corp    NASDAQ TIVO   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog 5 Strong Buy Ultra Safe Stocks for an Uncertain SeptemberWall Street started September with a sharp decline after a choppy August  The lingering trade conflict between the United States and China is taking a toll on U S  business activities  especially the manufacturing sector  Moreover  the global economy is facing a slowdown due to the trade tussle and several geopolitical concerns Manufacturing Activities Decelerate in AugustOn Sep 3  the Institute of Supply Management  ISM  reported that the U S  manufacturing PMI  purchasing manager s index  fell to 49 1  in August from 51 2  in July and lagging the consensus estimate of 51 3  August s reading was the lowest since January 2016  Notably  any reading below 50  indicates contraction in manufacturing activities  Last week  IHS Markit reported that the U S  manufacturing PMI declined to 50 3  in August from 50 4  in July  reflecting its lowest reading since September 2009 The ISM reported that a large majority within a panel of more than 300 purchasing and supply chain management executives expressed diminishing business confidence in light of an intensifying tariff war with China  which resulted in higher input costs and the lack of clarity in government policies Slowing global demand significantly affected U S  manufacturing exports  The new orders index plunged to a seven year low of 47 2  from 50 8  in July  This index posted a reading of below 50  for the first time since December 2015  Moreover  the new export orders index recorded a reading of just 43 3   marking its lowest since April 2009 In a nutshell  shrinkage of U S  manufacturing activities in August ended the index s 35 month long expansion with an average PMI index of 56 5   Apart from the new orders index  both productions of employment indexes declined sharply in August New Tariffs Likely to Dent Consumers  ConfidenceOn Sep 1  the U S  government imposed a 15  tariff on  112 billion of Chinese goods  Most of these items will be consumer goods like clothes  shoes and sporting goods  Moreover  President Trump has decided to levy a 15  tariff on a new set of  160 billion Chinese products used for making consumer products These new sets of tariffs will likely dent consumer confidence  So far in 2019  U S  consumer spending  which constitutes two third of the GDP  remained robust  However  several major consumer goods developers have said that higher tariff will compel them to shift it to end users through increased cost of final products Moreover  President Trump s decision to raise tariff rates from 25  to 30  effective Oct 1 on existing  250 billion of Chinese exports  most of which are inputs to high tech U S  products  will force businesses to raise prices of final products as well as trim manpower recruitment in order to remain competitive  Once again  general individuals will be mostly affected Notably  last week  the University of Michigan s revised index of consumer sentiment came in at 89 8  compared with an initial reading of 92 1  and below the 98 4  reading in July  This was the lowest reading of U S  consumer sentiment since December 2012 Yields on Government Bonds PlungeGrowing risks in the stock market is compelling investors to dump equities and invest in safe haven government bonds  This phenomenon is resulting in higher bond prices and declining yields Extreme volatility resulted in inversion of yields on 2 year and 10 year U S  Treasury Notes on Aug 14  for the first time since December 2005  Several economists and financial experts consider treasury yield curve inversion as a clear indication of an impending recession The yield curve inversion happened several times last month  Meanwhile  the yield on 30 year U S  Treasury Note fell below its psychological barrier of 2  to as low as 1 907  last week  On Sep 3  yield on 10 year Notes plunged to 1 441   its lowest since July 2016  The yield on 30 year Notes stayed at 1 925   well below the psychological barrier of 2  Our Top PicksAt this juncture  we have applied five criterions to pick five ultra safe stocks to safeguard one s portfolio

22754,244269,ALGT,Union Pacific Trims 2H19 Volume View Amid Trade Tensions,opinion,"Union Pacific Corporation   NYSE UNP   issued a drab forecast for overall volumes at the Cowen   Company 12th Annual Global Transportation Conference  mainly due to the trade war related issues  The company s executive vice president and chief financial officer  Robert Knight  stated that overall volumes for the third quarter of 2019 decreased 7  on a year over year  basis  as of Sep 1  2019  
The unfavorable reading can be primarily attributed to double digit declines in volumes at the Premium  down 10   and Energy divisions  down 14    Volumes at the company s Premium division are being hurt by declining international and domestic intermodal shipments chiefly due to the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China 
Demand for soybean and international container also decreased significantly  thanks to the trade war tensions  Union Pacific stated that the United States is responsible for providing about a third of soybeans to China  As of Sep 1  2019  volumes at the Energy division declined 14  due to a 17  decrease in coal volumes and a 42  reduction in sand carloads  Meanwhile  at the company s Agricultural Product unit  volumes decreased 2  mainly due to a 6  decline in food and beverage shipments and a 5  reduction in fertilizer carloadings 
What is worse is that the company s volumes are likely to persistently decline throughout 2019  For the second half of 2019  Union Pacific now expects volumes to decline in mid single digits compared with the 2  reduction predicted earlier Union Pacific Corporation Price
 

   However  Union Pacific s outlook with respect to operating ratio  operating expenses as a percentage of revenues  remains unchanged as it looks to check costs for countering revenue woes due to sluggish demand 
For the current year  operating ratio is expected to be below 61   By 2020  the metric is expected to be below 60    Notably  lower the value of the metric the better

22824,244339,ALGT,Is Allegiant Travel  ALGT  A Great Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Allegiant Travel Company   NASDAQ ALGT   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Allegiant Travel Company has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 49  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 13  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Allegiant Travel Company s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 13 53 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Transportation sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 66  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Allegiant Travel Company has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 67  which is higher than the current level  So  it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term  P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Allegiant Travel Company has a P S ratio of about 1 35  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 28x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Allegiant Travel Company currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Allegiant Travel Company a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too What About the Stock Overall Though Allegiant Travel Company might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of C  This gives ALGT a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current year has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the next year estimate has seen five up and one down in the same time period This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched higher by 1 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Allegiant Travel Company Price and Consensus   Apart from this bullish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAllegiant Travel Company is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 43  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Transportation Airline industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below   So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will you retire a millionaire One out of every six people retires a

23078,244593,ALGT,United Continental s Q4 Buoys Airlines  4 Stocks To Buy ,opinion,"Investors interested in the airline space have not had much to cheer about lately  Headwinds ranging from high costs  capacity woes and weather related issues have prevented airline stocks from flying high  The dismal price performance of the Zacks  industry in a year s time bears testimony to the challenges  The industry has shed 26 3  value in the period  making its performance worse than that of the Zacks S P 500 composite  which has declined 6 6   Why Airlines Had a Field Day on Wednesday Despite the aforementioned challenges  airline investors heaved a sigh of relief on Jan 16  The catalyst was the impressive Q4 earnings report of one of the airline heavyweights   United Continental Holdings   NASDAQ UAL     which was released on Jan 15  after market close  The company s blowout Q4 earnings report and upbeat guidance boosted the entire industry with key players gaining handsomely in the next trading session Naturally  the United Continental stock is flying high after its earnings report  The stock gained 6 4  on Jan 16  closing the day at  86 36  Other airline stocks like American Airlines   NASDAQ AAL    SkyWest   NASDAQ SKYW    JetBlue Airways   NASDAQ JBLU   and Alaska Air Group   NYSE ALK   also saw their stock prices appreciate to the tune of 2 3   1 8   1 1  and 1   respectively  Consequently  the industry tracker   NYSE ARCA Airline Index  moved northward  gaining 1 9  on Jan 16 
Why United Continental s Report Excited InvestorsThe Chicago based United Continental reported better than expected earnings per share and revenues in Q4  Moreover  both metrics improved on a year over year basis  Factors like efficient cost management and uptick in airfares drove results The company s performance on the unit revenue front was also impressive with passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  a key measure of unit revenues  increasing 5   Non fuel unit costs dipped 0 7  in the final quarter of 2018 The carrier s efforts to reward shareholders through buybacks also raise optimism  During Q4 and full year 2018  United Continental repurchased shares worth  240 million and  1 25 billion  respectively  It is also active on the fleet modernization front  Toward this end  it is replacing outdated planes and adding new ones to its fleet  As an evidence  the carrier finalized an order for 24 additional Boeing  NYSE BA  737 MAX jets in December  The planes will bolster the carrier s fleet from 2020 onward The airline expects to continue its prudent cost management strategy going forward too  It expects non fuel unit costs to be  flat or better  in Q1 and full year 2019 as well  PRASM in Q1 is expected to be flat or increase up to 3   Moreover  EPS for full year 2019 is anticipated in the  10  12 band  higher than the  9 13 per share reported in full year 2018 Will Other Airlines Follow United Continental Now  the burning question is whether other earnings reports from the airline industry be as impressive as that of United Continental  While it is impossible to be sure about what awaits the industry in the remainder of Q4  the pointers are certainly encouraging It is known to all that costs associated with oil are considered major inputs for any airline company  Airlines have been well served in this regard as oil prices declined nearly 40  in the Q4 period  October December   In fact  oil prices had displayed an uptrend till early October  However  the commodity displayed a downward trend for the remainder of Q4 on fears of supply glut and economic headwinds  The sharp drop in oil prices is likely to fuel bottom line growth  Moreover  reduced tax rates  courtesy of the current tax law  should also brighten airlines  Q4  Also  robust traffic during the Thanksgiving holiday period should boost Q4 results 4 Airline Stocks to Buy NowDriven by the aforesaid factors airlines are expected to fly high in Q4  Based on the buoyancy  we believe that it is prudent to add airline stocks to one s portfolio now  However  with multiple carriers present  the task of selecting the right ones for handsome returns is not an easy one This is where the Zacks Rank  which justifies a company s strong fundamentals  can come in really handy  Based on a favorable Zacks Rank   1 or 2   we have zeroed in on four airline stocks that should be present in one s portfolio for handsome returns Spirit Airlines   NYSE SAVE

Impressive Price PerformanceIn the past three months  shares of Allegiant have outperformed the it belongs to  The stock has rallied 18 9  compared with the industry s gain of 2 1   Notably  the impressive traffic report for February should boost the stock further 
High Costs Remain a Bane
Despite the impressive traffic numbers driven by the strong demand for air travel  escalating costs  labor as well as fuel  are expected to continue hurting the company s bottom line going ahead  In the fourth quarter of 2017  cost per available seat miles  CASM   excluding fuel  increased 20 2  backed by the new pilot agreement  among other factors

23419,244934,ALGT,3 Dividend Paying Airline Stocks To Consider,opinion,"It is a well known fact that companies in the airline space have been facing challenges due to multiple headwinds  Stocks in this space have been hurt by high costs  labor and fuel   disruptions caused by the recent hurricanes  capacity overexpansion  among others 
Evidently  United Continental Holdings    NYSE UAL   third quarter pre tax income was affected to the tune of approximately  185 million due to the storms  As a result  the company cancelled 8 300 flights in the same period 
Additionally  the massacre  described as the deadliest mass shooting in modern U S  history  in Las Vegas on Oct 1  2017  pushed back airline stocks  particularly those with exposure to Las Vegas  McCarran International Airport  For instance  bookings at Allegiant Travel Company   NASDAQ ALGT   for the fourth quarter have been hurt  The company now expects total revenue per available seat miles  TRASM  to decline between 0 5  and 3  mainly due to Irma and the Las Vegas mass shooting incident

Warren Buffett Still Rooting for Airlines   A Positive Sign
Despite the sector s recent struggles  Warren Buffett   one of the most revered investors of all time   still continues to support the airline stocks  According to a third quarter filing by Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   Buffett still has stakes in American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL    Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL    Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   and United Continental  Initially Buffett had shown interest in the sector last year  after staying away from it for a long time  In fact  his last investment in airlines was in the 1980s 
Buffett s investing style has always remained simple  buy shares in great companies and hold them for a significant period of time  These companies have reliable business models that have stood the test of time 
As one of the greatest investors ever is still showing faith in airlines despite the recent turbulence  it is obvious that airline companies fit into his scheme of long term sustainability  Therefore  it can be safely concluded that all is not lost for the sector and one should remain focused on them 
Dividend Paying Stocks to the Rescue
Companies with strong fundamentals are generally payers of dividends  Such companies are financially stable and mature and can even generate steady cash flow irrespective of market and sector conditions 
In fact  dividend stocks are a safe bet to create wealth as the payouts generally act as a hedge against uncertainty and simultaneously provide downside protection by offering sizable yields on a regular basis 
Three Airline Stocks in Focus

Southwest Airlines with a Zacks Rank  3  is based in Dallas  TX  In May 2017  this low cost carrier raised its cash quarterly dividend to 12 5 cents per share  reflecting an increase of 25  over the previous quarterly payout of 10 cents per share  The company has a dividend yield of 0 91   Moreover  its past records substantiate the fact that Southwest Airlines has a stable dividend payment history  The company with a Value Score of B  has made dividend payments for more than 160 consecutive quarters 
SkyWest Inc    NASDAQ SKYW   operates a regional airline in the United States through its subsidiaries  The company has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and a Value Score of B  The carrier  with a dividend yield of 0 64   has paid dividends for more than 80 quarters in succession  In February 2017  the company s board of directors approved a 60  dividend hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 8 cents per share

23424,244939,ALGT,Should Value Investors Consider Allegiant Travel  ALGT  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Allegiant Travel Company   NASDAQ ALGT   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Allegiant has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 6  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 22  Moreover  the current level is below the highs for this stock over the past five years  suggesting it might be a good entry point  The stock s PE also compares favorably with its industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Allegiant has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 15 1  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Allegiant has a P S ratio of about 1 7 which is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  ALGT is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Allegiant currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Allegiant a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Allegiant might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of B  This gives ALGT a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The year 2017 has seen one upward and two downward estimate revisions in the past 30 days while 2018 has seen three upward estimates revisions and none downward in the same time frame Allegiant Travel Company Price and Consensus   As a result  the consensus estimate for 2017 remained stable in the past one month  while estimate for 2018 has inched higher by 2 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAllegiant is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its good lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a decent industry rank  Top 28  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb

In September 2017  Delta had projected passenger unit revenue to increase between 2  and 3   and operating margin was forecast in the 16 5  17 5  range  Those projections were made before Irma disrupted its operations leading to cancellations of 2 200 flights at Delta 
Consequently  the fresh projections  though numerically weaker than the previous ones  pleased investors as the impact of Irma on the company s financials was softer than expected  Fuel price per gallon in the third quarter of 2017 is expected between  1 68 and  1 73  Delta unveiled the projections while releasing its traffic data for the month of September 
While traffic  total system  increased 0 3  year over year  capacity expanded 0 6  for the month  Load factor  percentage of seats filled by passengers  declined 20 basis points to 84 4  in the month as traffic growth was outpaced by capacity expansion 
 2  Southwest Airlines expects operating revenue per available seat mile  RASM  to be flat to down 1  year over year  The metric was earlier projected in the range of down 1  to slightly up  Operating revenues in the third quarter are likely to be hurt to the tune of  100 million owing to the natural disasters 
This low cost carrier expects capacity in the third quarter to expand approximately 3  on a year over year basis  The metric is now expected to increase between 3 5  and 4  from the earlier projected increase in the 4  to 5  range  Fuel price  economic  per gallon is still projected between  2 00 and  2 05  Unit cots  excluding fuel and oil expense  special items and profit sharing costs  are projected to increase between 3  and 4  
3  American Airlines stated at its Investor Day that it expects total revenue per available seat mile  TRASM  in the third quarter to grow at 0 5  on a year over year basis  The company projects third quarter pre tax margin excluding special items  to vary between 8 5  and 10 5   Prior view was in the range of 10  12  
However  its long term view was very encouraging  The carrier s efforts to modernize its fleet are impressive as well  The company is on track to introduce 496 new planes in its fleet by the year end 
4   The deadliest mass shooting in modern U S  history took place in Las Vegas on Oct 1  2017  As a result of the incident  many people lost their lives and more than 500 were injured  Following the gruesome incident  many carriers including Allegiant Airlines  owned by Allegiant Travel Company   NASDAQ ALGT    are offering free flights to victims and their families 
Currently  Allegiant Travel carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see   
Notably  in the next few days  travel to Las Vegas is likely to be hurt due to the incident  This  in turn  might impact tourism as Las Vegas is a favorite tourist spot  Consequently  travel focused stocks that include airlines are likely to be on the back foot  read more

23548,245063,ALGT,Airline Stocks  Q3 Earnings Due On Oct 25  ALK  ALGT   SKYW,opinion,The Q3 earnings season is picking up pace with multiple companies reporting earnings everyday  According to the latest   by the end of this week 267 S P 500 companies will release their quarterly numbers  Out of them  180 will be reporting during the course of this week Per the report  the entire S P 500 fraternity is projected to end the Q3 reporting cycle with bottom line growth of 2 6  on a year over year basis  The same set of companies is projected to witness top line growth to the tune of 5    These projections compare unfavorably with the readings in Q2  when revenues increased 5 5  and earnings expanded 11 2   In fact  the timid Q3 projections are reflective of the headwinds including back to back hurricanes  Harvey  Irma and Maria  and the devastating Mexico earthquake The highly diversified   one of the 16 Zacks sectors  has been hit severely by the above mentioned natural disasters as well  This is because the sector includes travel focussed stocks such as airlines  Markedly  the gloomy picture for this sector is reflected by declining earnings projection for Q3 to the tune of 14 9  year over year  The estimated growth in revenues is pegged at a modest 4 5  compared with an impressive growth of 10 1  in Q2 Turbulence Awaits Airlines in Q3 Given that the airline stocks form an integral part of the transportation sector  it is needless to say that this particular space is undergoing a rough phase mainly due to the natural calamities  Even though the likes of Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   and United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL   have outperformed in Q3  results of these carriers have been hit hard by the hurricanes Evidently  Delta s pre tax income was reduced to the tune of  120 million in the third quarter due to Irma as it had to call of multiple flights  Meanwhile  United Continental cancelled 8 300 flights owing to Harvey  Irma  and Maria  Consequently  its third quarter pre tax income was hurt to the tune of approximately  185 million Moreover  surging costs  fuel as well as labor  have resulted in year over year bottom line contractions for both these legacy carriers  Of late  fuel costs are on the rise with oil prices crossing the  50 a barrel threshold mark  This upsurge can be attributed to the improving demand outlook for the commodity and OPEC deal extension talks  The trend is expected to continue in the remainder of Q3 with high costs hurting the bottom line of carriers In fact  unfavorable scenario substantiates the bearish Zacks Industry Rank of 245  out of 250 plus groups  carried by the   This unfavorable rank places the companies in the bottom 4  of the Zacks industries In this adverse situation  investors interested in the airline space will keenly await Q3 reports from key sector participants like Alaska Air Group   NYSE ALK   Allegiant Travel Company   NASDAQ ALGT   and SkyWest Inc    NASDAQ SKYW   on Oct 25 According to our quantitative model  a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   to increase its odds of an earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Alaska Air Group together with its partner regional carriers serves more than 100 cities across North America  Based in Seattle  WA  this airline company is not expected to report better than expected earnings per share in this quarter The carrier s bottom line is expected to be hurt by high costs The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter fuel price per gallon is 1 77  higher than the 1 71 reported in the second quarter of 2017 In fact  our proven model too does not conclusively show that Alaska Air Group is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of  4 02   the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 32 per share is currently pegged at nine cents above the Most Accurate estimate  and a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  or 5 going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Our model did not predict an earnings beat earlier too  When we issued its Q3   Alaska Air Group had an Earnings ESP of  3 40   while the Zacks Rank remained the same Alaska Air Group  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise      Allegiant Travel Company is the parent company of Allegiant Air  As is the case with Alaska Air  Allegiant Travel Company s bottom line is also expected to be hurt by escalated costs The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter operating cost per available seat mile  excluding fuel  CASM ex fuel   is 7 01 cents  9 2  higher than the figure reported in the second quarter of 2017  The company expects the metric to grow between 16 7  and 17 1  in the to be reported quarter In fact  our proven model too does not conclusively show earnings beat for this Las Vegas based company in Q3  This is because Allegiant Travel has an Earnings ESP of  4 76   the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 37 per share is currently pegged at six cents above the Most Accurate estimate  and a Zacks Rank  5  read more    Allegiant Travel Company Price and EPS Surprise     SkyWest  through its subsidiaries  operates a regional airline in the United States  This St  George  UT based carrier is focused on streamlining its operations  Going forward  the carrier aims to reduce the 50 seat jets in its fleet and add new E175 aircraft   Notably  a reduction in block hours  a measure of aircraft utilization  is in sync with its fleet transition plans Currently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter block hours is 468 860  5  lower than the figure reported a year ago  In fact  the same for third quarter consolidated capacity  measured in available seat miles  is 8 516 million  approximately 2  lower than the

23549,245064,ALGT,Airline Stock Roundup  Q3 Earnings At AAL  LUV   Others  Bullish Thanksgiving View,opinion,"The past week in the airline space was mostly about numbers  with several airline companies like American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL    Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV    Spirit Airlines   NASDAQ SAVE   and Allegiant Travel Company   NASDAQ ALGT   reporting their respective third quarter 2017 earnings results 
Markedly  the common trend in the quarterly reports of the above mentioned companies was the year over year decline in earnings due to higher costs  Apart from high labor costs  rise in oil prices also hurt the bottom line as fuel related expenses increased  In addition to high costs  back to back hurricanes  Harvey  Irma and Maria  and the earthquake in Mexico also distorted the earnings picture 
Despite the headwinds  most sector participants reported better than expected earnings per share in Q3  In view of these headwinds  the earnings per share estimates have been trimmed over the past few months 
With the bar  pertaining to earnings estimates  being lowered significantly  courtesy the drastic downward revisions  it is of little surprise that most carriers have managed to beat the  highly conservative  Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter 
Moreover  the fact that the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has declined 4 5  to  106 42 over the past five trading days  This further substantiates the fact that the series of earnings beat in the airline space have failed to cheer investors 
The only notable update on the non earnings front came from the Airlines for America   A4A    The leading trade group  predicted that 28 5 million passengers will opt for air travel in the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday period  Nov 17   Nov 28   implying a 3  increase from the 2016 figure  Transportation   Airline Industry 5YR   Return

3  Allegiant Travel Company   NASDAQ ALGT   too reported traffic numbers for the month of July  Traffic for the total system  which includes scheduled service and fixed fee contract and measured in revenue passenger miles  RPMs   increased 2 7  on a year over year basis to 1 16 billion  System capacity  measured in available seat miles  ASMs   improved 3 6  in the month to 1 31 billion

4  United Continental  the parent company of United Airlines posted impressive traffic numbers for the month of July  Traffic   measured in revenue passenger miles  RPMs    was 21 5 billion  up 3 9  from a year ago 
On a year over year basis  consolidated capacity expanded 4 6  to 24 8 billion  Consequently  load factor decreased to 86 9  from 87 5   a year ago  This was because capacity expansion outpaced traffic growth  The carrier still expects passenger unit revenue for the third quarter to be down 1  to up 1  on a year over year basis 
 5  The monthly data released by the IATA revealed a 7 8  year over year increase in demand for air travel across the globe for the month of Jun 2017  The rise was attributable to an increase in both international and domestic traffic  measured in revenue passenger kilometers  in the month  The report also revealed a 6 5  rise in capacity  measured in available seat kilometers  
The greater increase in traffic compared with capacity resulted in the load factor improving 100 basis points to 81 9  in June  Moreover  traffic grew at the highest pace  7 9   in 12 years in the first half of the year on the back of an improving economy and subdued air fares  Load factor also touched a record 80 7  in the first half of 2017

23574,245089,ALGT,Is Allegiant Travel  ALGT  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Allegiant Travel Company   NASDAQ ALGT   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Allegiant has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 46  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 09  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock over the past five years  suggesting it might be a good entry point  The stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Transportation sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 59  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Allegiant has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 13 33  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Allegiant has a P S ratio of about 1 37 which is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 24 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  ALGT is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Allegiant currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Allegiant a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Allegiant might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives ALGT a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging  The current quarter has seen no upward estimates revision in the past 30 days compared to five downward  while the full year estimate has seen three upward and four downward revisions in the same time frame As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped by 24  in the past one month  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 2 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Allegiant Travel Company Price and Consensus   This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAllegiant is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its good lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 8  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  In fact  over past one year  the industry to which it belongs has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think

23575,245090,ALGT,Load Factors Decline In July  Should Airlines Worry ,opinion,"It is a well documented fact that woes related to capacity overexpansion had plagued stocks in the airline space in the not so distant past  particularly 2015   In fact  the July 2017 traffic reports of most carriers have highlighted that such issues might resurface 
In such a scenario  investors fear that capacity expansion may lead to oversupply in the market even as fuel costs remain weak  Low fuel costs and capacity over expansion are believed to be the primary reasons for the decline in airfares  While low air fares are favorable for fliers  it is a drag on the top lines of carriers due to their lesser profits 
Will Capacity Woes Return 
Most carriers have seen their respective load factors  percentage of seats filled by passengers  decline in July  The reason for the downturn was capacity expansion outweighing traffic growth in the month  For example  load factor declined to 84 3  from 85 2  at American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   as capacity inched up 1 9  on a year over year basis while traffic growth was a mere 0 8   American Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Shares of the Long Island City  NY based JetBlue Airways Corp     NASDAQ JBLU    also depreciated following the release of its July traffic report on Aug 10 as load factor declined  The metric came in at 87 1   down 70 basis points as capacity expanded 5 9  with traffic increasing 5 1  
Apart from the above mentioned companies  the likes of Spirit Airlines   NASDAQ SAVE    United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL    Allegiant Travel Company   NASDAQ ALGT   also have seen their respective load factors decrease due to capacity overexpansion 
Apart from fears on capacity over expansion  the views on unit revenues for the third quarter of 2017 have lagged expectations  For example  American Airlines expects total revenue per available seat mile  TRASM  a key measure of unit revenue  growth in the band 0 5 2 5  year over year  The figure is pegged much below the 5 7  improvement registered by the carrier in the second quarter 
The third quarter TRASM guidance for Hawaiian Holdings   NASDAQ HA    the parent company of Hawaiian Airlines  is also concerning  The carrier expects the metric to grow in the band of 4 5 7 5   whereas TRASM had climbed 9 2  in the second quarter 
Generally  carriers are forced to reduce fares as unit revenues decline in the face of capacity outpacing demand growth  The Airlines for America  A4A  Labour Day projection  also highlights the fact that carriers are adding capacity to meet the anticipated demand surge  According to the forecast  carriers are anticipated to add 133 000 seats per day during the Travel period  Aug 30 Sep 5  
Price Performance in July
In view of the disappointing July traffic reports  it is of little wonder that the Zacks  underperformed the broader market in the month  The S  P 500 Index gained 2 1   while the industry contracted 3 6  
 

 
High Costs   Another Headwind
Apart from woes related to capacity  the bottom line of airlines is being hurt in the second quarter due to high labor costs  However  with labor deals in vogue in the aviation space  labor costs have been on the rise 
The earnings picture was distorted in the second quarter due to high costs as was the case in the first quarter  For example  at American Airlines total operating expenses climbed 11 1  year over year  Expenses pertaining to salaries and benefits were up 12 5  
Second quarter results at Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   were also hurt by higher costs  Total operating expenses  including special items  increased 9  year over year to  8 763 million  Non fuel consolidated unit cost or cost per available seat mile  CASM    including profit sharing  climbed 5 5   mainly owing to wage increases  product investments and the operational disruption in April 
The scenario is expected to be similar in the third quarter as well  Delta expects non fuel unit cost  including profit sharing  to increase approximately 4  in the quarter  Additionally  consolidated cost per available seat miles  excluding special items and fuel  is anticipated to increase 5  at American Airlines in the third quarter 
Conclusion
With high costs expected to limit bottom line growth in the near term  fears about the return of capacity woes highlighted by the declining July load factors pose further challenges for airline stocks  Consequently  we believe investors need to be mindful of such headwinds before investing in the space

23576,245091,ALGT,Airline Operations Disrupted As Harvey Wreaks Havoc,opinion,"Normal life has been disrupted with the tropical storm Harvey wreaking havoc  and is expected to cause further damage  In fact  the storm caused severe devastation throughout the weekend with Houston   the  city in the country    experiencing the worst hit 
Meanwhile  the city has been witnessing unprecedented rainfall  resulting in  causalities  Also  the flooding is expected to continue as Texas is battered by heavy rains due to the storm 
Notably  Harvey  which has been downgraded to a tropical storm from a category four hurricane  is expected to remain over Texas until mid week 
Flight Cancellations at Large Due to Harvey
In view of the extensive damage  it is of little wonder the natural calamity impeded travel disrupting operations of airlines  In fact  Harvey resulted in significant travel disruptions over the weekend leading to multiple flight cancellations delays at the George Bush Intercontinental and William P  Hobby airports  resulting in untold miseries and harassments to passengers 
According to a   operations at United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL   were significantly crippled due to the natural calamity as it relies extensively on its hub at Houston  causing it to cancel a huge number of flights therein to ensure the security of its passengers  Currently  United Continental carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Other carriers like Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV   had to trim Houston operations  According to   American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   had to cancel 110 flights on Aug 27 due to the calamity  majority of them to and from Houston 
Moreover  in a bid to mitigate the harassments of passengers  most carriers including the likes of Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL    Alaska Air Group   NYSE ALK    American Airlines  Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways Corp    NASDAQ JBLU   have made to passengers who are rescheduling their travel dates  These passengers will be able to do so without paying any additional charges  
Markedly  with the two Houston airports   George Bush Intercontinental Airport and William P  Hobby Airport   closed as heavy rainfall continues to hit Houston  air travel is expected to be hurt further this week 
Evidently  weather related issues have hurt airlines previously too  In March 2017 operations at carriers were disrupted big time by winter storm Stella  Moreover  this January  an icy winter storm ravaged the Southeast U S  cities  It also disrupted the flight schedules of airlines  thereby causing undue harassment  Last year  Hurricane Matthew had also caused extensive damage in the affected areas 
In fact  such acts of nature throw the schedules of carriers out of gear  causing multiple flight cancellations 
Other Headwinds Hurting Airlines Lately
Apart from the Harvey related disruption in operations  airlines have been laid low lately by quite a few other happenings 
The twin terror attacks in Spain  earlier in the month that claimed multiple lives apart from injuring many  caused travel focused stocks include airline players to lose value  Such acts of terrorism might cause travel demand to dwindle due to security fears  Naturally  airline stocks are hurt by this anticipation 
Moreover  fears related to capacity overexpansion were re ignited with July traffic reports of most carriers exhibiting a fall in load factor  percentage of seats filled by passengers   The downturn was due to capacity expansion outweighing traffic growth 
Generally  carriers are forced to reduce fares as unit revenues decline in the face of capacity outpacing demand growth  While low air fares are favorable for fliers  it is a drag on the top lines of carriers with their profits being hurt 
Also  the   one of the most revered investors of all time  to trim his stakes in three airline heavyweights   Delta  United Continental and American Airlines   also points at the fact that all is not well with this key sector 
Price Performance
In view of the above recent headwinds  it is of little wonder that the Zacks fared worse than the broader market in the last one month  The S P 500 Index contracted 0 9  compared with the industry s decline of 3  

High Labor Costs Remain a Drag
In addition to the recent challenges  high labor costs have hurt airlines for the last few quarters  With airline companies constantly inking deals with various labor groups  it is of little surprise that costs on this front are increasing  which is limiting bottom line growth 
The situation on this front is not expected to improve in the third quarter as well  Delta expects non fuel unit cost  including profit sharing  to increase approximately 4   Additionally  consolidated cost per available seat miles  excluding special items and fuel  is anticipated to increase 5  at American Airlines  Again  Allegiant Travel Company   NASDAQ ALGT   expects cost per available seat miles  CASM   excluding fuel  to increase in the band of 16 18  
Bottom Line
With airline companies already grappling with multiple headwinds  the emergence of Harvey has only added to the woes of stocks in the space  Consequently  investors are expected to remain glued to the updates  as stocks strive to return to their winning ways

23608,245123,ALGT,Hurricane Irma Follows Harvey  Airlines Continue To Suffer,opinion,"Stocks in the airline space are no doubt going through tough times  After being hurt by Harvey  the companies are likely to be negatively impacted by another natural calamity   Hurricane Irma   which is currently approaching the state of Florida 
Notably  Irma  which has already caused untold devastation in the Caribbean  is expected to hit the shores of Florida this weekend 
Airline Stocks Grounded
On Sep 7  key airline stocks lost value with multiple flights being cancelled due to Irma JetBlue Airways Corporation   NASDAQ JBLU   was the worst hit with the stock declining 3 2  to close the trading session at  18 25 
In fact  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company has significant exposure to Florida  with two hubs in the state   Orlando and Fort Lauderdale  JetBlue also has a hub in Puerto Rico   Moreover  this low cost carrier has cancelled more than 860 flights on Sep 11  Hence  Irma is expected hit the stock severely  You can see  
Again  United Continental Holdings  Inc    NYSE UAL    which has already cancelled many flights and likely to call off many more to and from southern Florida airports in the next few days  saw its stock price tumble 2 9  to  58 58  Markedly  the stock has taken a pounding lately  with it being hit the  by Harvey   Consequently  the company unveiled a bearish forecast with respect to passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  mainly due to Harvey 
Other major losers in the space included the likes of American Airlines Group Inc    NASDAQ AAL    Hawaiian Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ HA    Allegiant Travel Company   NASDAQ ALGT   and Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL    With major sector participants declining  it was of little wonder that the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declined 0 3  on Sep 7 over the previous day s closing price 
In fact  the likes of American Airlines and Delta have also cancelled many flights due to the approaching Irma  The spate of flight cancellations follows the multiple cancellations due to Harvey 
Issue Regarding Ticket Prices
Withresidents of the state trying their best to flee to safety in a bid to escape the havoc  which is likely to unleash on Florida  airline companies are apparently charging high prices for tickets on flights to and from therein  This has landed them in a  on ticket prices  even though the likes of JetBlue have capped flights out of Florida at  99 
Weather related issues have hurt airlines previously too  In March 2017  operations at carriers were disrupted big time by winter storm Stella  Moreover  this January  an icy winter storm ravaged the Southeast U S  cities  It also disrupted the flight schedules of airlines  thereby causing undue harassment  Last year  Hurricane Matthew had also caused extensive damage in the affected areas  Such acts of nature throw the schedules of carriers out of gear  causing multiple flight cancellations 
The stocks in the airline space have also been hit hard by other headwinds like high labor and fuel costs  The disastrous impact of Harvey has further complicated matters  Now  with Irma approaching there seems to be little respite for the sector in the near term

23703,245218,ALGT,U S  Carriers Likely To Have Busiest Summer  Says A4A,opinion,"According to a projection by Airlines for America   A4A     the trade organization for leading U S  airlines   companies in the airline space will make hay in the upcoming summer season  Jun 1 Aug 31   Also  it is predicted that the summer of 2017 will be the busiest season of all times for American carriers in terms of air travel  This is because 4  more passengers are expected to fly to various destinations over the period compared with the last year 
Per the forecast  approximately 234 1 million passengers will be transported through U S  airlines this summer  which sets a record in itself  In fact  the air travel projection for the summer season translates into 2 54 million fliers per day  during the said period 
Solid Balance Sheets Prompt More Infrastructural Investments
In fact  to meet the surge in travel demand the U S  carriers are increasing the number of available seats by 123 000 per day  Moreover  with the U S economy improving and consumer confidence remaining strong  more Americans are taking vacations 
Further  declining air fares in addition to a much improved job market and rising disposable income have provided added incentive for consumers to opt for air travel  Driven by the above reasons  the three month period is likely to see 100 000 additional passengers taking to the skies on various US carriers 
Additionally  the robust financial health of most domestic carriers has prompted them to invest substantially toward improving the flying experience for travellers  in a bid to stay afloat in the competitive airline space 
Strong Forecast Follows Tepid Q1
The bullish forecast on summer air travel by A4A comes close on the heels of the first  quarter earnings season that saw airlines performing moderately on the bottom line front due to high costs  According to the report  the combined pre tax earnings for nine publicly traded U S  passenger carriers   Alaska Air Group  Inc    NYSE ALK     Allegiant Travel Company   NASDAQ ALGT     American Airlines Group Inc    NASDAQ AAL     Delta Air Lines Inc    NYSE DAL     Hawaiian Holdings Inc    NASDAQ HA     JetBlue Airways Corporation   NASDAQ JBLU     Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV     Spirit Airlines  Inc    NASDAQ SAVE    and United Continental Holdings  Inc    NYSE UAL     declined 50  to  2 4 billion  despite a 1 5  increase in operating revenues on the back of higher traffic 
With carriers inking labor deals with various labor groups it is of little surprise that labor costs are on an upswing  thereby restricting bottom line growth in the first quarter  Increasing fuel costs also resulted in the distortion of the earnings picture for airlines in the quarter  In fact  per the report  operating expenses increased 9 3  in the first quarter due to the two factors 
Notably  among the above mentioned stocks  Hawaiian Holdings and United Continental carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Price Performance
Despite high costs limiting bottom line growth and other hiccups  airline stocks are very much in the limelight as suggested by the performance of the Zacks categorized  industry over the last three months  The industry has outperformed the S P 500 index in the period  gaining an impressive 9 3   This is substantially higher than the S P 500 Index s return of 1 1  in the period 
 

Additionally  the Zacks Industry Rank of 69 carried by the 25 member Zacks categorized Transportation Airline industry highlights the fact that airline stocks are very much in favor  despite certain setbacks  It should be noted that the favorable rank places the industry in the top 27  of the 250  groups enlisted  The bullish projection by A4A brings in further good news for airline stocks 
Cheap Valuation Signals More Upside
We believe that the sector s cheap valuation makes it a worthwhile investment option  Going by the EV to EBITDA  enterprise value to earnings before interest  tax  depreciation  and amortization  ratio  which is often used to value airline stocks  given their significant debt levels and high depreciation and amortization expenses  doesn t look expensive at this point  The industry currently has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of 7 87  which is favorable than what the industry saw over the last five years  The ratio is nearer the low end of 5 and far off the high end of 16 41 during the period 
Additionally  the reading compares favorably with the market at large  as the current EV EBITDA for the S P 500 is 10 61 and the median level is 9 3  The industry s favorable positioning compared with the overall market certainly signals more upside

23704,245219,ALGT,Travel Ban Partially OK d  What s In Store For Airlines ,opinion,"In what can be seen as a victory for the Trump administration  the U S  Supreme Court has reinstated major parts of the President s travel ban  While allowing major parts of the embargo to take effect   the court said that it will be up for review in October 
The RulingThe country s top court ruled in favor  partially  of the U S  government s request to do away with preliminary injunctions against ban  Consequently  visitors from six predominantly Muslim nations   Iran  Libya  Somalia  Sudan  Syria and Yemen   are banned from entering the U S   for 90 days The court also upheld the provision of the ban to suspend the admission of refugees for four months  Additionally  the ruling restricts the number of refugees entering the country to 50 000 this fiscal year  In fact  While making the above rulings  the court added that visitors from the above countries to the U S  won t be affected if they are able to prove a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the country We remind investors that initially President Trump issued a ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations   Iraq  Iran  Syria  Yemen  Sudan  Somalia and Libya   from entering the U S  in January  However  courts refused to reinstate the ban  Notably  following the opposition  a narrower version was issued by the President in March What s Ahead for Carriers  The partial reinstatement of the ban  which is aimed at preventing terrorism in the U S   negatively impacted airline stocks like Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL    United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL   and American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   due to fears of declining travel demand  All these three carriers carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  In fact  many carriers including big players like American Airlines Group have exposure to Africa and the Middle East  Consequently  their fears of shrinking travel demand cannot be ignored  To this end  their top line may shrink significantly in the near term We note that the initial announcement of the ban in January not only hurt stocks in the space severely but also resulted in a decline in international bookings to the country Other HeadwindsApart from the ban issue  the ambiguity regarding the laptop ban and President Trump s revised Cuba policy that bans individual travel to the island nation  are some other administrative challenges confronting airlines Furthermore  the surge in labor costs has been hurting the bottom line of carriers for quite some time due to the signing of labor deals  In the first quarter of 2017  growth on the bottom line front was hardly visible for airlines due to high costs  Increased costs are expected to hurt the bottom line of carriers in the second quarter as well For example  Hawaiian Holdings   NASDAQ HA   expects cost per ASM  CASM   excluding fuel and special items  to increase in the band of 4 5  to 7 5   mainly owing to the sixty three month pay related deal cleared by its pilots in Mar 2017   Moreover  fuel cost per gallon  economic  is projected to be in  1 60 to  1 70 range  which is higher than  1 55 recorded in the second quarter of 2016 Similarly  Allegiant Travel Company   NASDAQ ALGT   expects CASM excluding fuel  to increase in the band of 13 15  in    mainly on the back of implementation of the new pilot agreement  Also  Alaska Air Group   NYSE ALK   recently increased its  forecast CASM  excluding fuel and other special items  following the pay related agreement with the pilots of its subsidiary Horizon Air Apart from high costs  carriers such as United Continental Holdings and Spirit Airlines   NASDAQ SAVE   have been laid low by customer related issues Transportation   Airline Industry 5YR   Return

23721,245236,ALGT,Canadian National  CNI  Q2 Earnings  A Beat In The Cards ,opinion,"Canadian National Railway Company   NYSE CNI   is scheduled to report second quarter 2017 results on Jul 25  after the market closes 
Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4 76   Also  the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 3 45  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Canadian National Railway is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients 
Zacks ESP  The  for Canadian National Railway is  2 02  as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at  1 01  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 99 cents  A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Canadian National Railway carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2 or 3  Hold  have a significantly higher chance of an earnings beat 
Conversely  the Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
Factors at Play
The company is expected to perform well in the second quarter  driven by an improvement in the coal related scenario which should aid overall volumes  This can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has increased 3 1  in the last month 
The company s efforts to reward shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks are also impressive  The company s board approved of a quarterly cash dividend of C41 25 cents per share in Apr 2017 
The company received good news on the labor front  when the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers  IBEW  ratified a five year collective labor deal in April  this year 
Additionally in Apr 2017  the company announced a  2 6 billion capital investment plan  The plan complements its efforts to promote safety and enhance productivity  This is another positive  expected to aid the second quarter results 
However  the company s high debt levels coupled with a rise in fuel costs might hurt the bottom line in the second quarter Canadian National Railway Company Price and EPS Surprise

23740,245255,ALGT,Forcerank Weekly Review  CVX  W  GRPN  BOX,opinion,"After an extended hiatus the Forcerank weekly review is back  This week featured several economic and political events that moved the market for better and worse  The Trump rally continued to push the Dow to new record highs through improvements in the materials and industrial sectors 
Outside of the United States  OPEC reached a deal to cut oil production for the first time in 8 years  Under the deal  they ll bring production down to 32 5 million barrels per day from 33 7 million with the biggest cuts coming from Saudi Arabia  Iraq  UAE and Kuwait  Crude oil jumped about 9  immediately following the announcement  marking the biggest one day gain in 2016 
Today  the Labor Department released the first post election jobs number headlined by 178k jobs created and 4 6  unemployment rate  the lowest rate in almost a decade  Markets are trading virtually sideways in reaction to the job figures but it s becoming abundantly clear that the post election rally is starting to fizzle 
Above all else  the Forcerank consensus data accurately predicted a slew of winners and losers  Two of the biggest gainers were Chevron  NYSE CVX  and Wayfair Inc  NYSE W   both benefiting for very different reasons  Chevron received a massive boost from soaring oil prices following the OPEC deal announced earlier this week  Oil prices will need to move significantly higher from here to reconcile the losses shareholders have absorbed in recent years  This is a good start though as the stock climbed nearly 2  this week and sits atop the Forcerank E P contest  The oil major jumped three spots from the fourth position last week passing over many of its close peer including Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM  

Wayfair Inc  NYSE W   on the other hand  made significant gains thanks to a successful Holiday shopping weekend that included Black Friday and Cyber Monday  Management reported a 52  increase in web sales over this time  marking the single highest grossing period in company history  Like Chevron  though  the stock lost a majority of its value in recent years and will need more days like this past weekend to retrace its losses  Astute Forcerank users saw the upside of the shopping weekend and pushed Wayfair from dead last of its respective contest to third place  Investors that followed this prescription on Monday morning are sitting with 6  returns heading into the weekend 
As you will see the list of losers considerably outnumber the handful of winners this week  Allegiant Travel Company  NASDAQ ALGT   Groupon Inc  NASDAQ GRPN   Red Hat Inc  NYSE RHT  and Analog Devices Inc  NASDAQ ADI  made some of the biggest declines and also ranked poorly in their respective contests  Each of these names were either last or in the bottom three  reflecting the downside risk predicted by Forcerank users  Groupon  in particular  has struggled since its weak third quarter report  The stock is down over 30  in the past 2 months after surging for the better part of 2016 
IPOs from 2015 round out the list of the remaining duds  Fitbit Inc  NYSE FIT   GoPro Inc  NASDAQ GPRO  and Box Inc  NYSE BOX  all experienced declines this week  but for varying reasons  The former two companies are still stumbling after reporting abysmal third quarter results in November  Since then  the two have been amongst the worst positioned stocks in the Hardware contest  sporting an average rank around 7 5  higher ranks are indicative of negative price movement   Box  however  reported better than expected third quarter results on Wednesday  but has simply fallen victim to the rotation out of tech caused by the Trump victory 

Each week  Forcerank runs a variety of games covering different industries  What we have found  is that the highest ranked companies in their respective games deliver the greatest positive price movement while the worst ranked companies post the biggest losses  To access this information earlier in the week   contests and test your knowledge against hundreds of seasoned investment professionals ",2016-12-03,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/forcerank-weekly-review-(cvx,-w,-grpn,-box)-200167971",200167971
23753,245268,ALGT,Elliott Wave View  Allegiant Air Near A Bounce,opinion,"Allegiant Air  NASDAQ ALGT  is an American low cost airline that operates scheduled and charter flights owned by Allegiant Travel Company  The company offers low cost passenger air travel to residents of small  under served cities in the U S  and last year started flying to Newark Airport  On January  the airline announced 17 new routes that will begin service by end of May 2017  which further increases the company s growth potential for the new year   So let s take a look at the technical picture of its stock to see if is it supporting an increase in profits  
Allegiant Air Technical Elliott Wave View 
Last year  ALGT ended the downtrend cycle from 2015 peak which represented the 3rd wave c of a  which means the stock has resumed a new cycle to the upside looking for new highs or it will be at least doing a bounce against all time highs  ALGT rallied 49  from August low before ending that cycle early this year and starting a 3 waves pullback in wave   X   which is reaching equal legs area at  153    147 where the stock should be finding buyers as long as pivot at  121 low is holding  The first target to the upside if it manage to make a move higher would be around  210 area then depending of the structure of the move we can define the next path 

In the shorter term  ALGT still has the possibility to see another leg lower to end the 5th wave in wave  C  around  153  147 area in case it s doing a flat in wave   X    However  if it starts rallying from current level then wave   X   ended as a  and the stock would have missed the equal legs area by few points 


Both scenarios are supporting at least a 3 waves bounce in the near term and ALGT needs to break above January 2017 peak to open further extension to the upside  otherwise it can still make the double correction in wave   x   against the  121 low 
Recap The summer season is approaching and Allegiant Air seems to be ready for a busy schedule with its new routes  The technical view for the stock is pointing to a recovery with more gains to come in the coming months so the company may enjoy an amazing year with a phenomenal growth ",2017-03-24,Elliott Wave Forecast,https://www.investing.com/analysis/allegiant-air-elliott-wave-view:-near-a-bounce-200180055,200180055
23754,245269,ALGT,Allegiant Travel  ALGT  Q1 Earnings  Is Disappointment In Store ,opinion,"Allegiant Travel Company   NASDAQ ALGT   is scheduled to report its first quarter 2017 results on Apr 25  after market closes 
In the fourth quarter of 2016  the company s earnings of  2 48 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents  Quarterly revenues increased 8  year over year to  336 million and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  334 million  Network growth boosted results 
However  things might not be so rosy for the company in the first quarter  The negative sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter has decreased 4 3  over the last seven days 
In fact  the Allegiant Travel stock has struggled of late  underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry in the last three months  The stock was down 8 7  as against the industry s gain of 3 8  

What Does Our Model Indicate 
Our quantitative model too does not show conclusively that Allegiant Travel will beat earnings in the first quarter of 2017  According to our proven model  a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   to increase the odds of an earnings surprise  However  that is not the case as highlighted below 
Zacks ESP  Allegiant Travel has an Earnings ESP of  2 27   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 6 cents  below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 64 per share  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Allegiant Travel carriesa Zacks Rank  3 which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s  2 27  ESP complicates our surprise prediction 
Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision 
Factors Likely at Play
We expect the company s bottom line in the first quarter of 2017 to be hurt by increased labor costs  Higher fuel costs  projected at  1 81 per gallon in the first quarter  are also expected to limit bottom line growth  But cost per available seat mile excluding fuel is projected to increase in the band of 11 6  to 12  
The shift of Easter into April is expected to hurt the top line in the quarter  The company expects total revenue per available seat mile  TRASM  to decline in the range of 4 4  to 4 8  in the first quarter  However  traffic  total system  for the first quarter is projected to increase 7 5   that compares unfavorably to the increase of 10 9  in the fourth quarter of 2016  Load factor  percentage of seats filled by passengers  is projected to decline 380 basis points  bps  in the first quarter  which too is worse than the 170 bps reduction witnessed in the fourth quarter of 2016 
We are however impressed by the company s efforts to expand and are also encouraged by its efforts to reward shareholders 
Stocks to Consider
Investors interested in the transportation space may consider the following stocks  This is because our model shows that these companies too possess the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

23757,245272,ALGT,American Airlines  AAL  Pay Raise  Will It Hurt The Industry ,opinion,"Shares of the Fort Worth  TX based American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   have lost despite reporting better than expected earnings and revenues in the first quarter 2017  The reason for the sharp decline was the mid contract wage hike announced by the company for its pilots and flight attendants  The announcement not only sent American Airlines shares tumbling  but its peers like Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   and United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL   too felt the pinch and saw their stock prices moving south 
The Offer
American Airlines came out with this labor friendly announcement as the wages of their concerned labor groups was below those offered by its peers  In fact  the carrier stated that the hourly base pay of its pilots and flight attendants lagged the highest rates in the industry by approximately 8  and 4   respectively 
In a bid to match the industry leading levels in this respect  the carrier offered its pilots and flights attendants a pay rise to the tune of approximately 8  and 5   respectively  The offer took all concerned by surprise  since the current contracts for flight attendants and pilots are expected to run til 2019 and 2020  respectively 
The pilots and flights attendants would not have to wait that long for their contracts to be renewed and could earn industry leading pays from this month itself  if this labor friendly proposals are ratified by Allied Pilots Association and Association of Professional Flight Attendants respectively 
Labor Costs Already Hurting Bottom Line
In the context of the ratification of this offer  American Airlines is likely to see an increase of approximately  230 million in salary and benefit expenses in 2017  and  350 million in each of the following two years  The timing of the proposed hike is surprising as stocks in the airline space are already witnessing their bottom line being hurt  due to escalated labor costs 
With airline companies constantly inking deals with various labor groups  it is of little surprise that costs on this front are on a rise  At Delta Air Lines earnings declined 41 7  year over year due to higher costs  Consolidated unit cost or cost per available seat mile  CASM   including profit sharing  increased 5 8   mainly due to the labor deals inked by the company 
At United Continental Holdings  consolidated unit cost   excluding fuel  third party business expenses and profit sharing   increased 5  year over year  primarily due to the labor deals ratified  United Continental expects unit costs in the second quarter to increase in the band of 4 5  on the back of higher labor costs 
At American Airlines  total operating expenses climbed 11 4  year over year to  9 billion  Also  expenses pertaining to salaries and benefits were up 6 5   Consolidated operating costs per available seat miles  CASM  excluding special items  increased 7 6   Moving ahead  Consolidated CASM  excluding fuel and special items  is projected to increase 7  in the second quarter 
At Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV    Unit costs  excluding fuel and oil expenses  special items  and profit sharing expenses  in the second quarter are likely to increase 6  year over year  Apart from increasing labor expenses  rising fuel costs also distorted the earnings picture of carriers in the first quarter  Quarterly earnings also declined at the likes of JetBlue Airways   NASDAQ JBLU   and Allegiant Travel Company   NASDAQ ALGT   due to higher costs 
All the above mentioned companies carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see   
Therefore  based on this given scenario of increased costs  American Airlines  proposal on materialization is expected to put further pressure on its bottom line  No wonder the Zacks Consensus Estimate at American Airlines for 2017 and 2018 have declined 3 cents and 12 cents to  4 63 and  5 13 per share respectively  over the last seven days  despite the outperformance in the first quarter 
Price Performance
The adverse effect on the airline space due to the wage hike announcement by American Airlines is the latest blow on the sector  Recently  it has also been struggling with multiple issues like the well documented passenger fiasco at United Continental  This can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks categorized  industry gained 5 61  so far this year  while the S P 500 index increased 6 7  

 
Will Others Follow 
Currently  the question that lingers is that whether the other airline players with sound balance sheets will follow American Airlines and offer mid contract hikes to their labor groups  In that case  substantial air fare hikes might be on the cards as carriers aim to mitigate the effects of increasing costs 
According to data released by the Bureau of Transportation Services  BTS   average airfares  unadjusted  climbed 4 2  month on month in Feb 2017  In fact  the February reading was up 2 4  compared with January  on a seasonally adjusted basis  
In fact  with earnings growth being limited due to higher costs  carriers are likely to hike ticket prices further in the remainder of the year to boost their top lines to counter the pressure on bottom lines 
Moreover  many carriers are displaying growth with respect to unit revenues this year  after struggling on this front in 2016  In the first quarter of 2017  carriers including American Airlines displayed growth with respect to total revenue per available seat miles  TRASM  a key measure of unit revenues  
The metric is expected to increase in the band of 3  to 5  in the second quarter of 2017 on a year over year basis  At Hawaiian Holdings   NASDAQ HA    the metric is projected to grow in the band of 5 5 8 5  in the second quarter of 2017 
Many other carriers like Delta aim to return to positive unit revenues this year  Hiking air fares is consistent with this objective of carriers as well  Consequently  air travel might become more expensive this year  Naturally  investors interested in the space should keenly await updates on this burning issue Sell These Stocks  Now Just released  today s 220 Zacks Rank  5 Strong Sells demand urgent attention  If any are lurking in your portfolio or Watch List  they should be removed immediately  These sinister companies because many appear to be sound investments  However  from 1988 through 2016  stocks from our Strong Sell list have actually performed 6X worse than the S P 500 ",2017-05-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/american-airlines-(aal)-pay-raise:-will-it-hurt-the-industry-200186377,200186377

23858,245373,ALGT,Why Airline Stocks Surged In Wednesday s Trading Session,opinion,"It is a well documented fact that the airline industry has been struggling in the face of multiple headwinds  However  the trading session on Sep 7  2016 brought smiles back in the faces of investors interested in the airline space as major stocks in the space surged  The buoyant performance resulted in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gaining 2 69  to close Wednesday s trading session at  92 45 
 The Catalysts Behind the Surge
According to a   stocks of the U S  carriers appreciated the most in almost two months  The surge came on the back of encouraging forecasts from heavyweights like Delta Air Lines Inc    NYSE DAL   and Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV   
Fears related to overcapacity had plagued airline investors for quite some time  They were apprehensive that that airline capacity growth at a rate higher than the U S  GDP will lead to an oversupplied market  However  the fears associated with capacity were put to rest by Dallas based Southwest Airlines  upbeat projection 
The low cost carrier projects 2017 capacity to expand less than 4  on a year over year basis  The projection compares favorably with the view for 2016  wherein capacity is projected to increase in the range of 5  to 6   The carrier further mentioned that most of the 2017 capacity growth  approximately 2 points  would come from domestic markets  while international expansion would account for 1 2 points 
With carriers struggling on the revenue front and declining air fares adding to the woes  the bullish projection naturally found favor with investors  As a result  shares of the low cost carrier jumped 4 68  on Sep 7 Industry Price Index
 

Atlanta  GA based Delta Air Lines also provided a bullish outlook at the 9th Annual Global Transportation Conference regarding capacity growth in the domestic market  The airline behemoth declared that its U S  capacity is expected to expand by only 2 5  in the final quarter of the year  This compares favorably with the 5 7  capacity growth for Delta in the U S  market in the first half of 2016 
During a time when the entire industry is struggling with the decline in passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  a key measure of unit revenue   Delta s assertion that that it expects to be the first network carrier to return to  positive unit revenue growth  naturally pleased investors  resulting in the stock gaining 5 65  
In fact  the carrier mentioned that revenue per available seat mile  RASM  in the U S  market has improved substantially from summer on the implementation of  fall schedules   The carrier s Chief Financial Officer  Paul Jacobson  stated that RASM was already in the positive territory in the Latin American market and the metric was likely to be positive  ex hedges  in its Pacific market in the third quarter 
The bullish comments about unit revenues provide the much needed relief to the airline which has been on the backfoot this year  The power outage suffered by the carrier last month was the main reason behind the estimated decline of 7  in the third quarter PRASM  Operating margin in the quarter is now expected in the band of 18  to19  as against the previous guidance of 19  to 21   owing to the same reason  Fuel price per gallon in the third quarter is expected in the band of  1 47 to  1 52 
With oil prices rising substantially this year  Delta Air Lines believes that the era of boosted profits due to low fuel costs is behind it  The scenario of rising fuel costs would provide further scope to raise ticket prices  thereby boosting revenues  We note that Delta carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Shares of the Fort Worth  TX  based American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   gained 4 84  on Sep 7 following a bullish presentation by its newly appointed president  Robert Isom  at the abovementioned transportation conference  Isom said that the carrier s liquidity position was the best among network carriers  Its strong balance sheet has allowed it to buy back shares worth approximately  7 8 billion since third quarter 2014 
Isom harped on the carrier s product segmentation strategy for effective branding  selling and pricing  More segmentation was likely to further boost the top line  notably  Isom expects the  Basic Economy  segment to be launched later this year  
The Las Vegas  NV based Allegiant Travel Company   NASDAQ ALGT   was another gainer on Sep 7 with its shares appreciating 8 16   The company expects total revenue per available seat mile  TRASM  to decline in the band of 7 5  to 8 5   This compares favorably with the previous guidance of a decline in the band of 8 5  to 10 5  
The effects of the bullish updates was felt across the industry with other major carriers like United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL   and JetBlue Airways Corp    NASDAQ JBLU   gaining 4 97  and 2 83   respectively  on Sep 7

23867,245382,ALGT,Surprise  Buffett Books A Flight On Airline Stocks,opinion,"It s never too late to change your mind 
After years of deriding the airline industry  Warren Buffett confirmed last week that his holding company  Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   has invested nearly  1 3 billion in four big name domestic carriers  American Airlines Group  NASDAQ AAL   Delta Air Lines Inc  NYSE DAL   United Continental Holdings Inc  NYSE UAL and Southwest Airlines Company  NYSE LUV  

The stake is a dramatic reversal for the 86 year old investing wizard  who previously called the industry a capital  death trap  and once joked that investors would have been served well had Orville Wright s plane been shot down at Kitty Hawk 
The thing is  Buffett held these opinions long before airlines began making the fundamental changes that would flip their fortunes from bankruptcy to record profitability  When Buffett first tried his hand at making money in the aviation industry in 1989  airlines were still struggling in a fiercely competitive marketplace  Many carriers called it quits  including President elect Donald Trump s Trump Shuttle  which ceased operations in 1992  Others spent years in bankruptcy court 
But following the massive wave of industry consolidation between 2005 and 2010  a new business environment emerged  one characterized by disciplined capacity growth  new sources of revenue  greater efficiency and a commitment to repairing balance sheets  I ve written about these changes for the past 18 months  all of which are summarized in 
Buffett also likes airlines now for the same reason he s long been a fan of railroads namely  the barriers to entry are extremely high if not entirely impenetrable to new competitors  This is the  moat  Buffett refers to when talking about rail 
As a value investor  he prefers inexpensive stocks  and among industrials  airlines are cheapest of all  based on price to earnings and cash flow 

Buffett s bullish rotation into airlines was followed by news last week that Citigroup Inc  NYSE C  also made fresh buys of Southwest  Delta  American and Allegiant shares  on the  broad theme that sector consolidation and an improved economy will reap benefits   according to Seeking Alpha s Clark Shultz 
Challenges still remain  of course  but domestic airlines today are profit making  dividend paying machines  In the first nine months of 2016  the top nine U S  carriers Alaska  Allegiant Travel Company  NASDAQ ALGT   American  Delta  Hawaiian Holdings Inc  NASDAQ HA   JetBlue  Southwest  Spirit and United reported combined net income of  18 3 billion  That s quite an improvement from the  11 2 billion they pocketed for the entire year in 2014 
Over the same nine month period  airlines returned  11 4 billion to shareholders via stock buybacks   10 5 billion  and dividends   912 million   according to industry trade group Airlines for America  A4A  
Here s Why Blue Skies Could Last
In the near term and long term  airlines continue to look very attractive  Air travel demand is rising as incomes grow and the size of the global middle class expands 
This Thanksgiving week  more than 27 million passengers are expected to fly on U S  airlines  an increase of 2 5 percent over the previous year  according to A4A  Much of the demand is being driven by affordable airfare  which is at its lowest in seven years 
The picture looks just as optimistic further down the road  The International Air Transport Association  IATA  sees global passenger demand nearly doubling over the next 20 years  The group expects 7 2 billion people to fly in 2035  up dramatically from 3 8 billion last year 
The Asia Pacific region should be the biggest demand driver  with China displacing the U S  as the world s largest aviation market  As I ve written about before  the U S  and China  for business travelers  tourists and students  which has already led to increased travel between the two nations  When I last visited the New York Stock Exchange recently  I noticed that half of the tourists appeared to be from China 
What Effect Might President Trump Have on Airlines 
In the week following the presidential election  we saw modest gains in several sectors  including airlines  Evercore ISI s proprietary Company Surveys  designed to monitor the economy on a weekly basis  showed a post election bounce  rising 1 1 points to 49 6  In many more ways than one  Donald Trump is unlike any other person ever to occupy the White House  bringing with him a unique set of skills and experiences that no other president can claim  As I mentioned earlier  he will become the first U S  president who was formerly an airline executive  He also boasts an extensive background in tourism and hospitality  having built and managed everything from hotels to resorts to golf courses 
Industry leaders  therefore  hope Trump will prove to be a powerful ally and take their side on several key issues  For starters  many are encouraged that the president elect has proposed as much as  1 trillion in infrastructure spending on  our highways  bridges  tunnels  airports  schools  hospitals   as he announced 
Trump has also promised to swing the pendulum away from monetary policy toward fiscal policy cutting taxes and relaxing regulations which has put Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on the defensive  On Friday  she defended the Dodd Frank Act  which Trump has vowed to dismantle  stating a repeal would increase the likelihood of another financial crisis 
As for the aviation industry  U S  carriers have been pushing Congress for years to reform air traffic control so that the steering wheel is in the hands not of the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  but a private  not for profit entity  Canada made a similar transition in 1996 when it turned authority of its civil air navigation service over to the privately run Nav Canada  which today manages approximately 12 million aircraft movements a year 
The industry would also like to see open talks with several state owned Middle Eastern carriers  whose governments provide tens of billions of dollars in  unfair  subsidies every year 
Jill Zuckman  chief spokesperson for Partnership for Open   Fair Skies  an airline lobby group  has urged Trump  a harsh critic of international trade agreements  to protect the interests of American airlines and workers 

 The Gulf carrier subsidies threaten the jobs of 300 000 U S  aviation workers and the American aviation industry as a whole     and we are optimistic that the Trump administration will stand up to the United Arab Emirates and Qatar  enforce our trade agreements and fight for American jobs  

Other leaders see headwinds in some of Trump s more isolationist and nativist rhetoric  particularly his tough stance on immigration from Mexico currently the number two market for travel and tourism to the U S  and Arabic speaking countries  According to the Council on Foreign Relations  a travel ban on Muslims entering the U S  a controversial proposal Trump has since softened could cost the U S  economy as much as  71 billion a year and up to 132 000 American jobs  As The Economist pointed out in a recent article  travelers from the Middle East tend to be big spenders  shelling out 50 percent more per trip than Europeans on average 
Trump has also expressed interest in reversing current diplomatic relations with Cuba  favoring a reinstatement of old travel and trade embargos    The people of Cuba have struggled too long   he tweeted in October   Will reverse Obama s Executive Orders and concessions towards Cuba until freedoms are restored    Many U S  airlines have already begun scheduled flights to Havana  including United  American and Southwest  with others soon to follow  JetBlue Airways Corporation  NASDAQ JBLU   Alaska Air Group Inc  NYSE ALK   Delta and Spirit Airlines Inc  NASDAQ SAVE   among others  
As for whom Trump might name as head of the Transportation Department which oversees the FAA  Federal Highway Administration  Federal Railroad Administration and other agencies rumors are circulating that it s come down to either Rep  John Mica  R Fla    former House Transportation Committee chairman  or James Simpson  former commissioner of New Jersey s Department of Transportation 
The airline industry has proven itself resilient time and again  emerging stronger from a decade ago  For investors  the group is relatively inexpensive and generous with its dividends and stock buybacks  Changes might very well be in the cards  but I remain bullish on airlines  just as Warren Buffett is

23890,245405,ALGT,5 Companies With Biggest Revisions Heading Into Earnings,opinion,"This week  110 S P 500 companies are scheduled to report Q3 earnings results  Heading into those reports a number of names have seen large revisions on both the top and bottom line  These are the companies with the most revision activity over the past month 
eBay  O EBAY 
Information Technology   Internet Software   Services   Reports October 21 after the close
The Estimize consensus on  calls for EPS of  0 48  an 11 cent decrease in the last month  yet still 7 cents above the Wall Street estimate  Revenues estimates have also been revised downward  to  2 413B from  2 913B  and the Street is calling for  2 100B 

What to watch  This will be eBay s first quarterly report since the spin off of its digital payment arm  PayPal  and it looks like analysts are doubting its strength as a standalone service  It certainly doesn t help that the retail space in general has been challenged recently  a concern that hit a fever pitch this week after Wal Mart  N WMT  issued lower than expected guidance for the rest of the year  and into next year  as well as a warning from the National Retail Federation that holiday sales will be weaker this year  We already have July and August numbers from eBay  and they aren t looking good  US multi platform unique visitor growth increased 11  YoY in July and August  down from 23  in Q2  it seems doubtful September numbers will be able to make up that difference  Another metric that is always key for retailers is same store sales  which only came in at 5  in July and August  down from 7  in Q2  Gross merchandise volume is expected to fall 6  YoY 
Allegiant Travel Company  O ALGT 
Industrials   Airlines   Reports October 21  after the close
The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  2 56  an uptick of 6 cents from September 22  still below Wall Street s estimate for  2 60  Revenues have risen only slightly  to  300 1M from  299 4  just above the Street s consensus for  299 1M 

What to watch   is a domestic low cost carrier that has successfully been stealing market share from its larger competitors  something that has lead to double digit EPS growth in the first two quarters this year  and 10  revenue growth in the first half  The company s value proposition is that it links travelers in small cities to world class travel destinations  While it s been putting up great fundamentals  and reported a record number of passengers in the latest quarter  revenue per available seat growth has begun to flatten out

Industrials   Airlines   Reports October 22 before the open
The Estimize consensus for  stands at  2 03  a nickel better than what was expected at the end of last month  and 4 cents lower than the Street  Revenues have improved slightly to  1 515B  up from  1 508B vs  Wall Street s  1 512B 

What to watch  Airline results have been mixed this year  with many of the large carriers losing out due to currency headwinds  forcing them to cut down on international flights  and double down on domestic trips  Lower oil has no doubt been beneficial for airlines  but instead of returning fuel savings to the consumer  many airlines have actually been increasing prices this year  Alaska Airlines is a low cost carrier that operates domestically and has been putting up great fundamentals  growing EPS by double or even triple digits for the past 7 quarters  while revenue growth has been more modest in the mid to high single digits  One of the most important metrics for airlines is passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  which has been underwhelming this year to say the least  Even ALK saw a decline in PRASM of 5 3  last quarter  However  Alaska Air is still a relatively small airline with plenty of room to grow  YTD the airline increased capacity by 10

What to Watch  It s no secret that  is loved by investors who have nearly doubled its value in the past year despite an uncertain and volatile market environment  Fundamentals have been strong this year as well  with the company surpassing the Estimize consensus on the top and bottom line in Q1 and Q2  and by a sizeable amount  In fact  the Q2 EPS actual beat the higher Estimize consensus by 52   a 128  YoY growth rate  Despite a decrease in expectations  SKX estimates are still well above the Street and are anticipated to benefit from the back to school shopping season  Not only has the company been doing well domestically  but also internationally despite currency headwinds  The athleisure trend has been a large boon for Skechers which is now taking on the bigger athletic brands such as Nike  N NKE  and Under Armour  N UA   offering stylish options at more compelling prices  They are slowly starting to steal market share from those names as US consumers begin to pull back on how much of their discretionary income they are willing to allocate to apparel and accessories

23891,245406,ALGT,How Airlines Are Spending Their Record Profits,opinion,"How did you spend your  700 
That s how much the average American driver saved at the pump in 2015  according to a report from J P  Morgan Chase  The bank also found that the savings fueled consumer spending on non gas related purchases  which  based on credit and debit card transactions  were higher than previously thought  For every dollar saved  Americans spent roughly  0 80 on other things restaurant visits  appliances  new gadgets and more 
But everyday consumers weren t the only ones who saved big in 2015  Lower fuel prices represented a huge windfall for the airline industry  Delta Air Lines Inc  N DAL  alone netted  5 1 billion in savings  As a whole  U S  carriers retained between 50 and 75 percent of fuel cost savings  says Credit Suisse  and with crude oil at 13 year lows  they can expect to hang on to a similar percentage this year 
As I mentioned in a previous Frank Talk  cheaper fuel helped the domestic airline industry soar to record profits in 2015 
According to the International Air Transport Association  IATA   airlines are collectively set to post an annual  up from  17 4 billion in 2014  an increase of almost 90 percent 
Profits could touch  36 billion this year  the IATA says  resulting in record amounts of free cash flow 
So the question is  What are airlines doing with it all 
Generous Rewards  Attractive Valuations Besides upgrading their fleets to include more fuel efficient aircraft  airlines are putting the cash to work by improving balance sheets and rewarding shareholders 
In 2015  more than  10 billion about 7 percent of U S  airlines  market cap was returned to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends  That s double the amount from 2014 
Among the carriers expected to raise their dividends this year are Delta  American Airlines Group  O AAL   Alaska Air Group Inc  N ALK  and Southwest Airlines Company  N LUV   according to a Barron s article this week  Credit Suisse  VX CSGN  calls American s  1 5 billion stock buyback program  more than 12 percent of its market cap in 2015   a sign of management confidence of what s to come in 2016  
Investors are taking notice  Within the industrials sector  airlines are the least expensive  with network carriers  American  Delta  United Airlines  etc   at 7 1 times earnings and low cost carriers  Spirit Airlines Inc  O SAVE   JetBlue Airways Corporation  O JBLU   Allegiant Travel Company  O ALGT   etc   at 10 5 times earnings 
A concern some investors might have is rising labor costs  which have overtaken fuel as airlines  top expense   In its World Airline Profit Outlook 2016  the CAPA Centre for Aviation calculates that the industry s fuel expenses came down from 30 percent of revenue in 2014 to 25 percent in 2015  This year  they could fall to as low as 19 percent   There have been reports that pilots  flight attendants  ground crew and other personnel are seeking higher wages and salaries as company profits climb 
These additional costs  if approved  could be offset by not only lower for longer fuel prices but also growing ancillary revenue non ticket fees for checked in baggage  priority seating  in flight meals and the like and more disciplined capex spending 
Don t expect airfares to drop dramatically  however  As far as anyone can tell  they re likely to stay where they currently are  In the second quarter  the average price for a seat fell a slight 2 8 percent year over year  from  396 to  385 
That s a little less than the  700 you saved at the pump

23900,245415,ALGT,Earnings Watch  5 Stocks Poised To Beat,opinion,"It s been difficult to find bright spots this earnings season  and with less than 25  of the S P 500 left to report  it looks like the fourth quarter will close as one of the worst since the recession  Not since the third quarter of 2009 has both top and bottom line growth for the index come in negative  with current figures standing at  3 5  and  2 9   respectively 
That said  there are a handful of names reporting this week that carry a very bullish signal  The following 5 companies have a significant positive delta between the crowd sourced Estimize consensus and the Wall Street consensus  and also have a strong track record of beating analyst estimates  Even so  this quarter has forced us to question a value of a beat in this environment  with forward looking guidance capturing most of the attention of nervous investors 
Zendesk Inc   N ZEN  was one of our picks for stocks to watch in 2016  Despite the recent unwarranted collapse of enterprise tech names  the US economy by many measures still seems to be in good standing  and that means companies will be investing in the cloud and into their own growth  For the current quarter  the Estimize community is looking for EPS of   0 05  only two cents higher than Wall Street  but sell side estimates have been lifting into the report 

Zendesk competes in the customer data management space and is taking on the big guys like Salesforce com  N CRM   Since IPOing in May 2014  the company has had a laser focus on growing revenues  resulting in top line growth of 63   over the last 4 quarters  While still unprofitable  EPS has been trending in the right direction  and the company has beaten Wall Street estimates every quarter 
As of October  ZEN had more than 64 000 customers  up from 50k earlier in the year  and the percentage of clients with 100 or more seats accounted for 30  of recurring revenue  Recent acquisitions such as We Are Cloud certainly strengthen its portfolio and makes it a formidable contender against similar cloud analytics products from Salesforce and Amazon com  O AMZN  
Fashion accessory company  Fossil Group  O FOSL   is also scheduled to report after Tuesday s closing bell  Currently  the Estimize community is looking for EPS of  1 36  a sizeable 7 cents ahead of Street  This is a company that tends to beat the Estimize EPS consensus 63  of the time historically  and the Wall Street consensus an even greater 90  of the time  Despite the wide delta  this still suggests a 54  decline in YoY profits  Fossil is coming off a year which saw share prices fall 67  due to a decline in its portfolio of licensed brands  weaker watch sales  and sluggish international performance from currency headwinds 

Growth of Fossil s flagship product  watches  turned negative in 2015 for the first time in 5 years  due to a weakened portfolio of licensed brands and market saturation  Slower demand for Michael Kors  N KORS  products has played a large role in Fossil s sales decline  The Michael Kors brand represents roughly 25  of Fossil s revenue and has contributed to almost 50  of the company s sales growth in the past 5 years 
However  the company s biggest threat comes from the increased popularity of tech accessories including smartwatches and activity trackers  As a result  the company is adjusting its strategy by leaning on investments in smart accessories to revive growth and capture a share of the robust wearables market  Last quarter  Fossil rolled out a line of Fossil branded watches in partnership with Google  O GOOGL  and Intel  O INTC   they also recently acquired Misfit  a producer and manufacturer of wearables 
The last couple of years haven t been kind to semiconductors and chipmakers  but after Wednesday s closing bell we might just get some welcomed news from NVIDIA Corporation  O NVDA   The Estimize community is calling for EPS of  0 34 on this name  as compared to the Street s estimate of  0 32  Current estimates reflect an uptick of 35  from Estimize and 18  from the sell side over the last 3 months  Nvidia historically has surpassed the Estimize consensus 69  of the time  and that number bumps up to 75  for Wall Street 

 How can a semiconductor company be doing well in this environment    you may ask  considering the freefall of the PC market and the negative impact of the stronger dollar  Nvidia has kept it s head above water due to its focus on gaming which accounts for more than 58  of total revenues  The strong momentum in the company s graphic card sales drove the stock 64  higher in 2015  The gaming business is expected to be a growth driver once again in 2016 as NVDA diversifies from traditional PC gaming into virtual reality  However  the company s fastest growing segment is autonomous driving  with revenues estimated to have grown 85  in FY 2015 
Craft beer is having a moment  and it s certainly been beneficial for the Boston Beer Company  N SAM   The Estimize EPS consensus for Q4 currently stands at  1 21  a dime higher than Wall Street expectations  While this name only beats the Estimize consensus 50  of the time  their history of beating the Street is considerably higher at 63   Despite coming off of another strong beat last quarter  heavy revisions have brought earnings estimates down 16  

SAM faces a number of headwinds this quarter  Consistent efforts to build its portfolio of drinks have been key to revenue growth  but a slowdown in depletion trends towards the end of the year points to stiff competition in the craft beer market as well as weakness in the cider category  Hard cider which makes up 20  of total revenues  was hit hard by the popularity of hard root beer in 2015  The first mover in this category was Small Town Brewery s Not Your Father s Root Beer  which managed to capture 80  of the market  while SAM s competing product  Coney Island Hard Root Beer only held onto 18  
International expansion could be the key to future growth for the Boston Beer Company  however  as they focus on acquiring assets to expand geographically and grab market share overseas  The Indian market in particular is considered a goldmine for company 
Last on our list is Virgin America  O VA   which sits in a segment that has done very well so far in the fourth quarter  Analysts from Estimize predict the domestic airliner will report profits of  1 31 on Thursday  higher than the Street s  1 24  Revenues of  395 5M are also slightly higher  While the company has historically beaten the Estimize consensus 50  and 67   respectively  on these two metrics  that number increases to 100  when using the Wall Street consensus  With only 4 quarters as a public company  the Estimize community has been more accurate on this name in each of those periods 

One big trend culled this earnings season was the disparity in results for discount airlines vs  larger carriers  Discount domestic airlines that fly to very few  if any  international destinations  do not have to contend with the stronger dollar impact  Currency headwinds have been such a drag on multinational airlines  that several large carriers have decreased international routes  Virgin America is expected to go the way of it s contemporaries  JetBlue  O JBLU   Spirit  O SAVE  and Allegiant  O ALGT   all which had fantastic quarters when compared to international airliners such as Delta  N DAL   United Continental  N UAL  and American Airlines  O AAL  ",2016-02-16,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-watch:-5-stocks-poised-to-beat-384931,384931

23902,245417,ALGT,United Parcel Service  UPS  Q1 Earnings  Surprise in Store ,opinion,"United Parcel Service  Inc    NYSE UPS   is slated to report its first quarter 2016 financial results on Apr 28  before the opening bell 
Last quarter  UPS reported a positive earnings surprise of 11 35   The company has an impressive track record with respect to earnings  having delivered higher than expected earnings in each of the past four quarters with an average beat of 5 68  

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors at Play
We expect a strong dollar to exert pressure on UPS  top line in the first quarter  Revenues at the company s international package unit are likely to suffer due to adverse foreign currency movements  Lower fuel surcharges are also expected to hurt results 
The Supply Chain and Freight segment is expected to perform well in the quarter on the back of the Coyote Logistics acquisition  which was completed in the third quarter of 2015  The company expects 2016 adjusted earnings in the band of  5 70 to  5 90 per share  reflecting 5  to 9  growth over the comparable 2015 figure 
Furthermore  we are impressed with the package delivery company s consistent efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and share repurchases  The company paid  2 5 billion through dividends in 2015  In terms of share buybacks  the company repurchased 27 million shares at  2 7 billion in 2015  We expect an update on the above mentioned shareholder friendly activities on the first quarter conference call 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that UPS is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  this is not the case here as elaborated below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for the company currently stands at 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are currently pegged at  1 22 
Zacks Rank  UPS  Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  that alone is not sufficient to secure an earnings beat 
As a caution  we advise investors not to consider Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 and 5  going into an earnings announcement 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some transportation companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter 
Canadian National Railway Company   NYSE CNI    with an earnings ESP of  1 47  and a Zacks Rank  1  The company will report first quarter 2016 results on Apr 25

23920,245435,ALGT,Airline Stock Roundup  Earnings Beat At Allegiant  SkyWest  Delta s PRASM Woes   Zika Fears In Focus,opinion,The past week saw St  George  Utah based SkyWest  Inc    NASDAQ SKYW   report impressive numbers for the second quarter of 2016  comfortably beating earnings and revenue estimates  Allegiant Travel Company   NASDAQ ALGT   also trumped both the estimates but the revenue beat was quite marginal  Meanwhile  low cost carrier Spirit Airlines   NASDAQ SAVE   revealed mixed results  beating on earnings but missing revenues On the non earnings front  Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   and Alaska Air Group   NYSE ALK   reported traffic data for the month of July  Delta s reported a 7  decline in consolidated passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  a key measure of unit revenue  in July  which has hurt the stock significantly Moreover  the travel warning issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  pertaining to the mosquito borne Zika virus led to a widespread decline in airline stocks TRANSPORTATION AIRLINE Industry Price Index  Read the last   Recap of the Past Week s Most Important Stories 1  Spirit Airlines beat on earnings  aided by low fuel costs  The carrier s second quarter 2016 earnings  on an adjusted basis  came in at  1 11 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 07  Earnings also improved 7 8  on a year over year basis  Spirit Airlines reported operating revenues of  584 1 million  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  586 million  An increase in non ticket revenues led to a 5 5  year over year increase in the top line  In the reported quarter  operating revenue per available seat mile fell 14 3  year over year while load factor    of seats filled by passengers  increased to 86 4  from 86  in the year ago quarter  The rise in load factor was driven by a 23 8  growth in traffic which outpaced capacity expansion of 23 1   Average economic fuel price per gallon declined 29 3  to  1 47 2  SkyWest s second quarter earnings of 77 cents per share were well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents  Earnings also improved approximately 26 2  from the year ago figure  Quarterly revenues of  801 million comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  765 million and expanded 1 65  on a year over year basis  Results were aided by lower operating costs due to fewer aircraft in service apart from maintenance cost savings 3  Allegiant Travel Company s second quarter 2016 earnings per share of  3 68 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14 cents  Quarterly revenues increased 7 1  year over year to  345 million  edging past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  344 million  Air traffic rose 15 5  year over year on an 18 2  rise in capacity  while load factor stood at 83 9  compared with 85 7  recorded in the year ago quarter  Fuel expense declined 34  to  1 36 per gallon in the reported quarter For the third quarter of 2016  the company expects cost per available seat mile  CASM   excluding fuel  to grow in the range of 4  to 6  primarily driven by the implementation of the new pilot agreement  The five year deal has taken effect from Aug 1  2016  Total revenue per available seat mile  TRASM  in the third quarter is likely to decline in the band of 10 5  to 8 5   In a separate development  the company inked a deal to buy 12 new Airbus A320ceo Aircraft  in line with its objective to maintain an all Airbus fleet by 2019 4  Alaska Air Group  the parent company of Alaska Airlines  posted a significant rise in air traffic for Jul 2016  Revenue passenger miles  RPMs    a measure of air traffic   improved 7 8  on a 9 6  capacity expansion  Load factor decreased to 86 7  from 88 1  in Jul 2015 as capacity expansion outpaced the increase in traffic 5  Delta revealed a 1 2  increase in RPMs for the month of July while capacity improved 2 1   Load factor decreased to 87 1  from 87 9  in Jul 2015 as capacity expansion outweighed the increase in traffic  However  Delta witnessed a 7  drop in PRASM in the month  due to foreign exchange woes apart from the ongoing supply demand imbalance in the Transatlantic and softness pertaining to domestic yield 6  Airline stocks are faced with multiple headwinds at present  The latest blow came from the Zika outbreak in Miami which has led to fears of declining travel demand to Florida  The breakout has prompted the CDC to issue an advisory for pregnant women to avoid the Zika affected Miami neighborhood  Naturally  airline stocks are feeling the pinch as reduced travel is likely to weigh on their top lines Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last 6 months                   The table above shows that all airline stocks traded in the red over the past week  leading to the NYSE ARCA Airline index declining 5 27  to  84 60 mainly due to the bearish PRASM performance in July at Delta apart from Zika fears  Shares of Spirit Airlines depreciated the most  10 03   Over the course of six months  the NYSE ARCA Airline index appreciated 9  on the back of huge gains at GOL Linhas and Virgin America   NASDAQ VA   What s Next in the Airline Space We expect airline heavyweights Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   and United Continental Holdings to report their July traffic numbers in the coming days  Focus will also remain on earnings reports from the likes of Virgin America  Meanwhile  Southwest Airlines  ongoing dispute with some of its labor groups  pilots and flight attendants    the removal of the carrier s top executives  is likely to be in the news ,2016-08-02,Zacks Investment

23945,245460,ALGT,I Pledge Allegiant  To The Reversal ,opinion,Allegiant Travel had a great run higher from the September low at 59 96 to a high at 109 72   a move of nearly 83   BU tit has been running for a long time with some pullbacks along the way  in those pullbacks the 50 day Simple Moving Average  SMA  has played an important role as support for a reversal back higher  with more major pullbacks dropping through it but stalling at the bottom of the Bollinger Bands     It just so happens that the stock price is sitting on both the 50 day SMA and the lower Bollinger Band  right now  After a 10  pullback  it is also confirming a bottom and reversal after an exhaustion sized volumes sell candle on Tuesday  and a move higher in price Thursday  The Relative Strength Index  RSI  has held in bullish territory and is turning back higher too  Only the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator  MACD  is left to confirm a reversal  Are you ready for the next leg higher This is a smaller and thin name  If you have a position size of over  100 000 you might want to cut it back or just watch this one The information in this blog post represents my own opinions and does not contain a recommendation for any particular security or investment  I or my affiliates may hold positions or other interests in securities mentioned in the Blog  please see my  page for my full disclaimer ,2013-07-11,Gregory W.

23946,245461,ALGT,Bulls Revel In The New Normal  While Bears Lie In Wait,opinion,"After its long awaiting breakout of the 1900 level the other week  the S P 500 gained another  1 3  last week alone  but this double low progression as I call it    i e   on extremely low volume and with persistently low volatility    is worrisome  With the 2000 level now in sight  there still remains a dearth of bullish conviction  and although the technical picture remains quite extended and overbought  there is no sign yet of bearish action to produce the elusive correction that is now so overdue that bears seem to have almost given up on it    for now  In fact  we are seeing short covering and a falling put call ratio  Some market commentators are saying that market conditions are reminiscent of the mid 1990s  We haven t seen a real correction in quite some time  So  is this the proverbial new normal 
History tells us that when everyone is bullish the market is near a top  But with volume low and many still underinvested and waiting for an entry point  all these indications of bullish sentiment don t necessarily mean that everyone has already put all their money to work  So  the market can and likely will go higher  It just doesn t normally go up in a straight line as it has done  Some backing and filling is normal and healthy    and preferable 
The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  closed last week at 10 73  which set another new 52 week low  Although some observers are predicting single digits for the VIX  the greater likelihood is a mean reversion sometime soon  which could bring it back up to test the 15 threshold once again 
The 10 year yield remains below 2 60  and may yet fall further  This is at least partly because of ECB monetary stimulus to stave off the threat of disinflation in Europe  Moreover  as I mentioned last week  the flattening yield curve here in the U S  is also a signal that investors believe the Fed cannot raise rates without tanking the economy  However  others are now opining that the despite the zero interest rate policy  there is not much lending and borrowing for capital expenditures and growth  Rather  they say that the free money is being used for generating low risk trading profits or for buying back stock to prop up EPS valuations  creating a troubling asset bubble  including stocks  
SPY Chart Review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  ARCA SPY  closed Friday at 195 38  The bulls have been able to continue an unabated upward march with virtually no resistance from the bears  Small and mid caps have joined the party  as well  The only thing missing is volume to demonstrate conviction  However  all of the overbought technical observations I made last week continue to persist    but now doubly so  Price is so stretched from its moving averages that an attempt at mean reversion is virtually a given this week  Also  oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are all at extreme overbought levels  Notice how Slow Stochastic has been pinned to the ceiling for the past two weeks  Furthermore  price has officially reached the upper line of the long standing bullish rising channel  which should provide strong resistance  and the upper Bollinger Band has turned into a virtual straight line as it is being carried further higher each day 

Last week  a pullback seemed highly likely to occur soon  but now it seems inevitable    rather than simply consolidating in place to work off the overbought conditions  First test should be the 20 day simple moving average  Then a test of prior resistance turned support at 190 is a good bet  However  don t count on a full blown meltdown  Rather  once the technicals cycle back down to oversold conditions  then the bulls will likely reemerge in an attempt to rally again to new highs    perhaps targeting 197 or even 200 
Latest Sector Rankings 
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 
Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  iShares US Financials  NYSE IYF    Technology  iShares Dow Jones US Technology  NYSE IYW    Industrial  iShares US Industrials  NYSE IYJ    Healthcare  iShares US Healthcare  NYSE IYH    Consumer Goods  iShares US Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK    Consumer Services  iShares US Consumer Services  NYSE IYC    Energy  iShares DJ US Energy Sector Fund  NYSE IYE    Basic Materials  iShares US Basic Materials  NYSE IYM    Telecommunications  iShares US Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ    and Utilities  iShares US Utilities  NYSE IDU    Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each  
Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1   Technology remains in first place with a strong Outlook score of 92  which is quite impressive especially given its gigantic 34 point gap above second place Utilities at 58  Technology displays generally solid factor scores across the board  with a strong forward long term growth rate  a reasonable forward P E  the highest return ratios  and the strongest sentiment among both Wall Street analysts  upward revisions to earnings estimates  and insiders  open market buying   Utilities is the only other sector showing improving sell side analyst sentiment  It also displays a reasonably low forward P E and some insider buying activity  Healthcare has suddenly vaulted into third place over Utilities  and Industrial rounds out the top five  Notably  Energy fell 16 points and out of the top five this week 
2   Telecommunications stays in the cellar once again with an Outlook score of 2  as it scores among the lowest in every factor in the model  It is joined in the bottom two this week by Consumer Services Discretionary with a score of 14  despite its leading forward long term growth rate 
3   Looking at the Bull scores  Energy and Industrial hold the lead with a 58  while Telecom is the laggard with a 43  The top bottom spread is 15 points  reflecting modest sector correlations on particularly strong market days  It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold  rather than the all boats lifted in a rising tide mentality that dominated 2013 
4   Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities is still the leader  even after dropping from 78 last week to 66 this week  which means that stocks within this defensive sector have been the preferred safe havens on weak market days  Energy is second at 62  Interestingly  Technology and Telecom share the lowest at 51  as all sectors score above 50 this week  The top bottom spread remains has suddenly dropped to 15 points  reflecting higher sector correlations on particularly weak market days than we have seen recently  Again  it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 
5   Technology displays by far the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  followed by Utilities  Telecom is by far the worst  followed by Consumer Services  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Energy is the clear leader  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   Telecom scores the lowest  indicating general investor avoidance of these sectors during extreme conditions 
6   Overall  I would say that this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings have taken a decidedly defensive turn given the rise in Utilities and Healthcare  at the expense of Energy and Financial  This seems to support my short term technical view of market conditions 
These Outlook scores represent the view that Technology and Utilities sectors are relatively undervalued  while Consumer Services and Telecom may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look   
Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or bearish   suggests holding Technology  Energy  and Industrial in the prevailing bullish climate   In this particular model  we consider the bias to be bullish from a rules based standpoint because SPY is still above its 50 day simple moving average while also remaining above its 200 day SMA  
Other ETFs that are ranked high by our algorithm from the Technology  Energy  and Industrial sectors include First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund  NASDAQ TDIV   PowerShares Dynamic Energy Exploration   Production Portfolio  NYSE PXE   and SPDR S P Transportation ETF Trust  NYSE XTN  
For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within Technology  Energy  and Industrial  some long ideas include Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Western Digital  NASDAQ WDC   Marathon Petroleum  NYSE MPC   EOG Resources  NYSE EOG   General Dynamics  NYSE GD   and Allegiant Travel  NASDAQ ALGT   All are ranked highly in the Sabrient Ratings Algorithm and also score within the top two quintiles of our Earnings Quality Rank  EQR   a pure accounting based risk assessment signal based on the forensic accounting expertise of our subsidiary Gradient Analytics  We have found it quite valuable for helping to avoid performance offsetting meltdowns in our model portfolios 
However  if you are more comfortable with a neutral bias  the model suggests holding Technology  Utilities  and Healthcare  On the other hand  if you have a bearish outlook on the market  the model suggests holding Utilities  Energy  and Technology

23971,245486,ALGT,Airline Profits Up On Rising Demand,opinion,"The global aviation industry offers an optimistic outlook for the rest of 2014 as an expanding economy and rising cargo and passenger traffic drive demand  Rise in passenger travel demand  particularly in North America  Middle East and Asia Pacific  plus accelerated replacement of obsolete aircraft will likely boost the industry s overall performance  According to the International Air Transport Association  IATA   the expansion of the economic cycle along with rapid GDP and world trade growth is expected to boost air travel by 5 9    the best since 2011  The rise in capacity may  in turn  lead to a 3 5  cut in airfares  thus benefiting travelers  The IATA remains cautiously positive on the industry and projects overall airline profits of  18 0 billion on revenues of  746 billion for 2014  from an estimated 3 32 billion passengers  In 2014  net profit margin is expected at 2 4   up from 1 5  in 2013  The industry is expected to generate  5 42 from every departing passenger on an average  a rather soft number for a high risk business  Additionally  air cargo volumes    an important indicator of business confidence    have been in a troubled spot since 2010  However  figures have been recovering since the start of 2014 and could expand 3 1  in the course of the year to reach  197 billion  Nonetheless  the bullish stance may be partially impeded by the negative vibes surrounding air travel following the recent Malaysia Airlines catastrophe and an upturn in jet fuel prices  Apart from geo political tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East  an alarming increase in the number of airborne plane crashes raises safety concerns Regional ForecastNorth America  With the world s largest economy improving  airlines in North America hold bright prospects in 2014  Consolidation benefits  rising travel demands and several new and enhanced ancillary revenues provide an impetus to growth  Although performance will continue to vary substantially between different U S  carriers  a strong 2013 has made way for a higher 2014 profit forecast of  9 2 billion Asia Pacific  Carriers in this region are expected to post profits of  3 2 billion in 2014  higher than  2 0 billion recorded in 2013  based on strong cargo demand and healthy passenger travel demand Europe  Europe  which continues to recover slowly within the home front  will tend to be affected by stiff competition and high regulatory costs  Thus  despite having the second best load factor  the IATA expects this year s post tax profit for European carriers to reach  2 8 billion Middle East  Per the IATA  profits from carriers in the Middle East are expected to grow from  1 0 billion in 2013 to  1 6 billion in 2014 driven by rapid growth of airlines in the Gulf  Regional co operation and international partnerships should further add to the success of these carriers 
Latin America  The region s profitability is expected to enhance substantially from  200 million in 2013 to  1 1 billion in 2014  Weaker performance in the home market is expected to be offset by success in some long haul markets and consolidation benefits Africa  Airlines in the African continent could see their profits touching the  100 million mark  rebounding from a loss of  100 million in 2013  Although performance is improving slowly  Africa remains the weakest region  owing to low developmental opportunity for inter Africa connectivity  high infrastructure cost and taxation Emergence of Middle East Carriers As U S  passenger carriers are still trying to recover from the domestic economic sluggishness  several Gulf based airlines have come to the forefront  fortifying their positions within the global airline industry  Emirates leads the pack  followed by Etihad and Qatar Airways  expanding in Europe  Africa and the BRICS  thus laying the foundation for an overall successful aviation sector  Recently  Emirates stood true to its commitment made last year by announcing a  56 billion order to buy 150 777x jets from The Boeing Company  NYSE BA   with an optional plan to buy 50 additional aircraft  Emergence of these cash rich airline companies remains a concern for the legacy carriers  including those in the U S   which might lose a chunk of their international market as most passengers continue to move through the Gulf India   A Golden Opportunity The aircraft manufacturing giant Airbus and Boeing have both raised their 20 year outlook on India  owing to the high appetite for growth but low market penetration of airline services in the country  Further  India s large demography supports the growth of air transportation service as the country s working population continues to rise  The optimism swelled after Boeing received orders for 42 B 737 aircraft from SpiceJet worth  4 4 billion  while Tata Group s twin airline joint ventures with Singapore Airlines and Air Asia Berhad have opted for Airbus  A 320 fleet  Brazilian vendor Embraer SA  NYSE ERJ  also got a  2 5 billion order from Indian regional airline Air Costa  According to Boeing  Indian carriers will buy 1 600 aircraft worth  205 billion between 2013 and 2032  while its counterpart Airbus expects India to place orders for 1 290 planes valued at  190 billion  The aircraft manufacturing duo has predicted that a significant part of the order will constitute single isled narrow bodied aircraft like Airbus A320 or Boeing 737s  The country recently got its latest passenger carrier in the form of Air Asia India  which aims to reduce costs and eventually transfer them into growth  The long term rosy picture is  however  partially offset by the short term weakness within India s aviation industry  which continues to suffer from over capacity  Additionally  airfares have also surged in the last five years resulting in lower demand for air service Underlying Factors for 2014 Profits In the base case scenario  there are several dynamics that will act as driving factors for overall airline profits in 2014  These include Passenger   Cargo  The IATA suggests that economic recovery coupled with faster GDP and world trade growth will drive air transportation demand  Customers on the other hand will benefit from cheaper air travel as one way fares are expected to reduce 3 5  this year  The association projects global airline passenger growth of 5 9   The average industry load factor is expected at 80 4   Coming to demand supply balances  demand  measured in traffic  is expected to outpace capacity in 2014  While the projected capacity increase is 5 5   air travel demand is expected to see a 5 9  pickup Fuel Price Effect  Airline profit outlook depends largely on fuel prices  the major variable component in the industry  For 2014  average jet fuel prices are expected to stay at  124 2 per barrel  a notch lower than the  124 5 per barrel cost in 2013  Lower jet fuel price drives airline profits by reducing operating expenses  However  the political crisis in Middle East has led to upward pressure on oil prices  The association projects fuel cost of  212 billion in 2014  accounting for almost 30  of the overall operating cost Fleet Restructuring  Air carriers at large are looking for fuel efficient fleets in order to reduce their cost burden that has increased 55  over the period 2006 2013  The carriers are concentrating more on making money rather than expanding its market share  The companies continue to replace old and depleted airplanes with new and upgraded ones  Escalating oil prices have also played a major part in the fleet replacement decision  According to Boeing  over the next 20 years  global airlines are expected to invest around  5 2 trillion in fleet development  Over the long run  the carriers aim to replace their old narrow body jets    A320 s B757 200 300    with advanced narrow body airplanes such as A 321  A320 Neo and the B737 Max  for better service and demand supply equilibrium Jet Renovation  With passengers demanding comfort and quality service along with proper security  airlines are focusing on aircraft redesigning with new and attractive products and services within the travel plan  United Continental Holdings  NYSE UAL  is offering premium flat bed cabin seats on every long haul international flight 
Further  the carrier has installed in seat power on more than half of its mainline fliers and has paced up the installation of the satellite based first ever Wi Fi service for fliers  Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  also plans to invest  750 million over the next two year period to roll out Wi Fi as well as renovate the interiors of its narrow bodied aircraft over the next three years Hedging Strategies  Hedging strategies are frequently used by airline companies to cope with the rising fuel prices  The carriers use a combination of calls  swaps and collars at varying WTI crude equivalent price levels to hedge 
Zacks Industry Rank Within the Zacks Industry classification  airlines are broadly grouped into the Transportation sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors   We rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry 
As a point of reference  the outlook for industries in the top one third of the list  with Zacks Industry Rank  88 and lower  is  Positive   the mid one third of the list  between  89 and 176  is  Neutral   while the last one third   177 and above  is  Negative   The Zacks Industry Rank for the airline industry is currently  31  implying that the outlook remains positive on this sector for this year owing to a rise in passenger air travel demand Earnings Trends The broader Transportation sector  of which aviation is a part  reflects a stable growth pattern  So far  91  of the sector participants in the S P 500 index that combined account for 97 7  of the sector s total market capitalization have reported second quarter results  which have been fairly good in terms of growth rates and beat ratios  Total earnings for these companies are up 11 7  on 6 7  higher revenues  with 90  of the companies beating EPS estimates and 80  coming ahead of revenue expectations  This is better performance than we have seen from the Transportation sector in other recent quarters  The Consensus earnings expectation is pegged at 6 8  for the third quarter and 13 2  for 2014  The fourth quarter is expected to register earnings growth of 13 8   The revenue growth expectation is pegged at 5 2  for the third and the fourth quarter  as well as for full year 2014 OPPORTUNITIES We believe industry consolidation and various ancillary revenues will boost the profitability and cost performance of most air carriers going forward  This is a suitable time for companies to consolidate for higher profits and operational efficiency Additional Revenue Gains  Air carriers are increasingly focusing on passenger satisfaction and experience to drive growth  JetBlue Airways Corporation  NASDAQ JBLU  augmented its TrueBlue loyalty program by allowing a single customer to earn and use points as a group  while Delta has upgraded its Economy Comfort seating in all transcontinental flights operating from New York s JF Kennedy Airport to Los Angeles  San Francisco and Seattle  The IATA projects total revenue of  746 billion in 2014 Mergers   Acquisitions  Airline companies unite in order to restore lost profits and broaden their perimeter  This was evident in the past mega mergers within the industry involving Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines in 2008  United Airlines and Continental Airlines in 2010 and AirTran Holdings and Southwest Airlines Company  NYSE LUV  in 2011  All three companies    Delta  United and Southwest    are long term beneficiaries on capacity and cost fronts 
The recently merged U S  Airways Group Inc  and AMR Corporation have gained in size and capacity by creating the largest global carrier American Airlines Group  MX AAL   Despite the merged entity having more pricing power and control over a larger number of slots  we believe it will have little effect on the dynamics of the U S  aviation industry as 80  of the same market will be dominated by the new American Airlines  United Airlines  Delta and Southwest Airlines Expansion  North American carriers are continuously striving to increase their range of domestic and international flights  United Airlines is planning an international service between Los Angeles and Melbourne from Oct 2014  To expand operations in Latin and Central America  United Airlines plans to introduce services to Chile  Dominican Republic and Belize from Dec 2014  Some U S  carriers are also forming joint ventures with foreign partners to offer better connectivity to their customers  Delta Airlines is strengthening its position in Seattle by adding several domestic and international destinations from the western coastal city in addition to reinstating its Barbados operation after a gap of 3 years  Likewise  after operating for several decades within the U S  domestic market  Southwest Airlines is finally flying into international territory  with flights to the Caribbean  The carrier recently inaugurated services from Atlanta  Baltimore and Orlando to Oranjestad  Aruba and Montego Bay  Jamaica  Route expansion coupled with affordable ticket pricing will augment passenger travel demand New Choices  The formation of American Airlines has opened up new opportunities for Southwest Airlines  JetBlue and Virgin America as the merged entity has divested take off and landing slots at Washington s Reagan National Airport  DCA  and New York s LaGuardia Airport  LGA   Further  American Airlines is currently in the process of divesting gates and related facilities at each of the Boston  Chicago  Dallas  Los Angeles and Miami airports Technology Upgrades  Air carriers are opting for numerous technology upgrades and system automation for various activities such as airline reservation  flight operations and website maintenance  These upgrades allow the companies to function effectively and efficiently  minimize expenses and render better customer service 
The latest is the installation of the Automated Passport Control  APC  kiosks  which will allow U S  bound international passengers to enjoy a faster and smoother passport clearance process  Mobile boarding pass is another new technological advancement that allows passengers to use their smart mobile devices to get through security check points and board their flights sans any inconvenience or delay Emergence of Smaller Carriers Although consolidation within the U S  aviation industry will reduce competition  it is expected to be short lived because of the low barriers to entry within the same  Further  the rising profit margins within the industry have allowed the smaller operators to expand  The most aggressive of these are Spirit Airlines  NASDAQ SAVE   which plans to double its fleet size by 2017 
PeopleExpress is the latest addition in this list as the Virginia based start up plans to expand its services in 24 cities within the next 5 years  These ultra low fare carriers are gaining popularity by providing low cost options for domestic travelers  thus gaining popularity among low end customers  The major outperformers should be American Airlines  Delta and Southwest Airlines all with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   We also uphold Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stocks such as JetBlue Airways  Allegiant Travel Company  NASDAQ ALGT  and Alaska Air Group  NYSE ALK   Copa Holdings SA    and GOL Linhas A  NYSE GOL  currently hold a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  CHALLENGES Of the many challenges facing the industry  the most crucial ones include slow economic recovery  volatile fuel prices  natural calamities  industry consolidation  government regulation  unionization  airport infrastructure constraints  technological investments and safety concerns Pitfalls of Industry Consolidation  Over the last few years  the U S  aviation industry has seen several consolidations with the most significant one being U S  Airways with American Airlines in 2013  With major and legacy airlines of the U S  joining forces  the total number of carriers operating within the industry is becoming less  This has resulted in less competition  higher airfares and increased fees  thus affecting the fliers Pilot Shortage  Lack of qualified pilot is disrupting airline operation particularly for the smaller carriers in some parts of U S  thus forcing them to keep their aircrafts grounded  The Federal Aviation Administration s  FAA  rule of minimum 1 500 hour of flying experience is been held as the root cause for the shortfall of flight crew Oil Price Volatility  Fuel price volatility continues to be one of the significant challenges  as fuel costs are largely unpredictable  The geopolitical unrest will continue to affect Crude Oil prices  Airline carriers  ability to pass along the increased costs of fuel to its fliers is restricted by the competitive nature of the industry Unionization  The airline business is labor intensive  Most of the employees are unionized and depend on various U S  labor organizations  The relation between airlines and labor unions are governed by the Railway Labor Act  which states that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire    instead it becomes amendable as of a stated date  Failure to amend terms and conditions suitably may lead to work stoppages or strikes  and thereby hamper operations 
Similarly  the airline industry in the rest of the world is also exposed to labor related concerns    proved by the ongoing pension related dispute of Aer Lingus and its largest trade union  which led to the former reluctantly agreeing to pump in additional fund to revamp its superannuation scheme Federal Regulations  The airline industry is highly regulated  in particular by the federal government  All companies engaged in air transportation in the U S  are subject to the regulations implemented by the Department of Transportation  DoT   Further  airlines are also regulated by FAA  a division of the DoT  primarily in areas of flight operations  maintenance and other safety and technical matters  The new stringent pilot duty and rest rules under FAR117 will increase the carriers  expenses as the companies will need to hire more pilots to comply with the stated rules Technological Failure  Technological investment is a key expense for air carriers  The profitability of airlines could be affected by technology glitches or failure to invest in new technologies  We expect Latam Airlines Group SA  NYSE LFL  and Bristow Group  NYSE BRS   to underperform the broader market  Both the stocks currently hold a Zack Rank  4  Sell  ",2014-08-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/airline-profits-up-on-rising-demand-221321,221321

One such airline benefitting from low oil costs is Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   The company recently reported a beat on our consensus earnings estimate by 5 cents per share  read    As a result of the earnings beat  Southwest Airlines closed up over 8  for the day  Yet while LUV is still a strong choice  there are plenty of other airlines that look promising to start 2015  Here at Zacks  we have handpicked 3 airline stocks that are in this group and are worth considering as a new pick for your portfolio  Of course  they all hold a Zacks Rank  1 and may be interesting choices ahead of their earnings reports too Allegiant Travel Company  NASDAQ ALGT  Allegiant Travel made headlines on Zacks recently  as it was the Bull of the Day  Of course  a large part of this is fueled by the lower oil costs  as with the rest of the industry  What makes this airline unique compared to others is that it doesn t hedge its fuel costs   This results in even wider margins compared to its industry peers  since it is buying oil at a cost lower than most airlines  The costs that airlines incur with fuel are one of the largest expenses for the industry as a whole  The industry has a one up on the market  but Allegiant Travel has a one up on the industry  Allegiant Travel has an Expected Earnings Surprise Prediction of 24 09  for the quarter  That coupled along with a Zacks Rank  1 is a strong indicator that the company is likely to have a beat when reporting earnings   Allegiant also has an expected EPS growth of 33 57  for the year  This shows that the company has momentum pushing it forward in order to meet the demands of investors  The airliner also has a growth rate this year of 28  compared to 13 1  for the industry  This makes Allegiant Travel stand out as a pick that exceeds the standards of an already thriving industry  Additionally  Allegiant Travel has reported positive surprise earnings in 3 of the last 4 quarters  The consensus earnings estimate has moved up consecutively in the last 90  60  30  and 7 day periods   7 days ago   had a consensus estimate of  1 37 per share  Since then  it has moved up to  1 41 per share  There are numerous indications of positive momentum pushing this company forward going into earnings  so it is reasonable to expect a beat when the company reports earnings on 1 28 15

23974,245489,ALGT,Global Airline Stocks Soaring  And Not Just Because Of Low Oil Prices,opinion,"The airline industry is notoriously competitive  There s even an old joke  If you want to make a million dollars in the airline business  you need to start with two million  That joke might have run its course  however  as carriers all over the globe have been posting some of the most impressive earnings in commercial aviation s 100 year history  Revenue growth in the U S  was  unusually strong  in 2014  achieving the best margin performance in the past 10 years  according to management consulting firm Oliver Wyman  The Dow Jones U S  Airlines Index grew more than 87 percent during the year  and we ve seen global airline stocks  as measured by the ARCA Global Airlines Index  gain significant ground since 2012 and reach all time highs  Some investors might approach this rosy news with a dash of skepticism  Oil prices have fallen over 50 percent since the summer  after all  and conventional wisdom says that as soon as they start to rise again  airlines will be one of the first industries to be negatively affected  Although it s true that fuel is carriers  top operating expense they collectively spent  48 billion on fuel in 2013 there s more to the industry s recent bull run than the low price of oil  In fact  airlines are in a better position now to manage an increase in oil prices than they have been in recent memory  for a number of reasons  Additional Seating It only makes fiscal sense  The more seats an airline has  the greater the likelihood is of generating more revenue in airfare  The decision to increase seat density has helped carriers significantly lower their cost per available seat mile  CASM   With greater seat density  carriers have had improved success at meeting and surpassing their breakeven load factors  or the necessary number of filled seats for companies to recoup operating costs Currently  the breakeven load factor for large domestic airlines is 79 percent  meaning around three quarters of all available seats on every flight need to be filled  According to the most recent data from the U S  Bureau of Transportation Statistics  the load factor was an exceptional 85 percent in 2014  an increase of 1 2 percentage points from the previous year and 12 percentage points from 10 years ago  As you can see  this has resulted in the industry s best annual performance for the 10 year period  
Ancillary Revenue Another way carriers have managed to beat expectations is through ancillary  or non ticket  fees  Baggage fees  priority boarding  Wi Fi  on board meals and other fees are increasingly responsible for making up a large chunk of airlines  earnings  allowing them to remain profitable in a highly competitive industry  According to airline consulting group IdeaWorks  global ancillary revenue for 2013 was  31 5 billion  That s up from  2 45 billion in 2007  which is about what Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  alone generated in 2013 from such fees  More so than major network carriers  low cost value carriers increasingly depend on non ticket fees to stay in the air  if you compare ancillary revenue as a percentage of total revenue in 2007 and 2013  Ancillary Revenue as a Percentage of Total Revenue

A Growing Middle Class Arguably the most important factor contributing to airlines  recent uptrend is the emergence and expansion of the middle class in the developing world  Air travel demand is strongly correlated with improved incomes  Spots around the world where we re seeing some of the greatest surges in middle class growth are Africa  China  India and Southeast Asia  This has led to advancement in worldwide revenue passenger miles  or the number of miles flown by commercial airlines  The most recent annual data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics shows that over 1 1 billion miles were spent in the air in 2013  a 3 6 percent increase over the previous year  
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD  estimates that the middle class could increase from 1 8 billion people in 2010 to 5 billion in 2030  Owing to a developing middle class as well as increased seat density and non ticket fees  airlines are expected to post a collective profit of around  25 billion this year  up from  20 billion in 2014  according to the International Air Transport Association  Also helping margins expand are low oil prices  which have stayed below  55 per barrel since the end of December  But even when prices do begin to rise  the industry should be in a good position to fly through the turbulence  Disclosure  Past performance does not guarantee future results  Stock markets can be volatile and share prices can fluctuate in response to sector related and other risks as described in the fund prospectus  Foreign and emerging market investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and less public disclosure  as well as economic and political risk  By investing in a specific geographic region  a regional fund s returns and share price may be more volatile than those of a less concentrated portfolio  The Dow Jones U S  Airlines Index measures the performance of the portion of the airline industry which is listed in the U S  equity market  Component companies primarily provide passenger air transport  Airports and airplane manufacturers are not included  The NYSE Arca Global Airlines Index is a modified equal dollar weighted Index designed to measure the performance of highly capitalized and liquid U S  and international passenger airline companies identified as being in the airline industry and listed on developed and emerging global market exchanges  Fund portfolios are actively managed  and holdings may change daily  Holdings are reported as of the most recent quarter end  Holdings in the Holmes Macro Trends Fund and China Region Fund as a percentage of net assets as of 12 31 2014  Delta Air Lines  Inc  1 28  in Holmes Macro Trends Fund  Spirit Airlines 0 00   Wizz Air 0 00   Allegiant Air 0 00   Jet2 com 0 00   Ryanair 0 00   Vueling 0 00   Air Deccan 0 00   easyJet 0 00   All opinions expressed and data provided are subject to change without notice  Some of these opinions may not be appropriate to every investor ",2015-02-12,Frank Holmes,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/global-airline-stocks-soaring,-and-not-just-because-of-low-oil-prices-241808",241808
23975,245490,ALGT,Lower Oil Prices  A Boon For The Airline Industry,opinion,Lower jet fuel prices have been a blessing for the airline industry given the inversely proportional relation between crude prices and the value of stocks  Crude prices have witnessed a downward trend over the last few months due to an over supplied oil market  especially in the face of lackluster global demand  Since fuel costs account for a major chunk of an airline company s operating expenses  the persistent drop in oil prices has significantly boosted the bottom lines of stocks in the airline space  The financial results of most airline stocks in the closing quarter of 2014 benefited from low fuel costs  Going forward  as forecast by the research firm International Air Transport Association  IATA   the industry will continue to see good times in 2015  IATA has projected a rise in the industry s global profit to  25 billion in 2015 from  19 9 billion in 2014  The research firm has also predicted that airline companies will earn  7 08 per passenger in 2015  up 17 6  year over year  The firm holds that oil prices will continue to fall in 2015 with the average price in the year hovering around  85 per barrel  Moreover  according to the IATA forecast  cargo is expected to witness the strongest growth in 2015 since 2010  In fact  Cargo volumes are projected to register growth of 4 5  in 2015  higher than 4 3  witnessed in 2014 Rosy Outlook for North America Carriers in North America are expected to continue their strong performance in 2015 on the back of higher demand for travel  an improving labor market  consolidation and weak oil prices  Per the IATA forecast  2015 net profit  after tax  is estimated to touch  13 2 billion for the region  Net margin is expected to grow to 6  in 2015 from 5 5  recorded in 2014  The other regions  namely Asia Pacific  Europe  Latin America  Middle East and Africa  are expected to generate post tax net profit of  5 billion   4 billion   1 billion   1 6 billion and  0 2 billion  respectively Underlying Factors for a Profitable 2015 There are several catalysts that are poised to trigger handsome profits for the overall airline industry in 2015  These include Passenger   Cargo  The IATA suggests that demand for passenger as well as cargo services will improve in 2015 from 2014 levels on the back of an improving economy  According to the forecast  2015 is expected to see air travel growth of 7   compared with the 5 7  growth witnessed in 2014  Moreover  the projected air travel growth is higher than the trend witnessed in the last 2 decades  according to the IATA report  Capacity is projected to increase by 7 3  in 2015 as opposed to 5 5  in 2014  Customers  on the other hand  will benefit from cheaper air travel  thanks to low oil prices  as one way fares are expected to be slashed by 5 1  this year  A recent report released by the U S  Federal Aviation Administration forecasts an approximate 50  growth in the volume of fliers on U S  airlines in the next two decades  The report states that 1 14 billion fliers are expected to be transported by U S  carriers by 2035  The figure was 756 3 million in 2014 Fuel Price Effect  Airline profits largely depend on fuel prices  For 2015  average jet fuel prices are expected to stay at  99 90 per barrel  well below the  116 60 mark in 2014  The concern of oversupply has dragged oil prices by almost 60  since Jun 2014  Oil price is currently trading below  45 a barrel  This has benefited airline stocks immensely as the cut in oil prices has reduced their operating expenses significantly  thereby aiding the bottom line  Although it is a fact that most carriers hedge at least some of their fuel costs  the majority of them should still continue to benefit considerably from the plunge in oil prices  Notably  carriers use a combination of calls  swaps and collars at varying WTI crude equivalent price levels to hedge fuel costs Fleet Restructuring   Jet Renovation  According to the IATA forecast  2015 will see commercial airline companies taking delivery of more than 1 700 new aircraft  This requires substantial investment  projected to reach approximately  180 billion  In order to expand its fleet  in Feb 2015  Allegiant Travel Company  NASDAQ ALGT     the parent company of Allegiant Air    announced a deal to buy two A320 planes  At present  the aircraft  which has a capacity of 177 seats  is being used by Philippine Airlines  The twin A320 aircraft will join the company s fleet before the end of 2015  Buoyed by their sound financial health  several carriers have voiced their intentions to invest heavily for upgrading overall facilities associated with customer satisfaction  This is likely to result in greater travel demand  improved goodwill and eventually  a higher top line  For instance  premier passenger carrier American Airlines Group  NASDAQ AAL   formed through the merger of American Airlines and U S  Airways Group in Dec 2013  recently announced that it will invest more than  2 billion to renovate airport lounges  modernize ticket counters and deploy satellite based Internet access on its international flights  In the same vein  Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  introduced a new five tiered seating plan from Mar 1  2015  According to Boeing  over the next 20 years  globally  airline companies are expected to invest around  5 2 trillion in fleet development Zacks Industry Rank Within the Zacks Industry classification  airlines are broadly grouped into the Transportation sector  one of the

23976,245491,ALGT,Can Airline Stocks Withstand Higher Crude Oil Prices ,opinion,"Stocks in the airline space have been performing impressively over the last few months thanks to higher demand for travel backed by an improving labor market  consolidation and declining oil prices  Lower jet fuel prices have positively impacted the airline industry given the inversely proportional relation between crude prices and the value of stocks Crude prices have remained weak over the recent past due to an over supplied oil market  especially in the face of lackluster global demand  Since fuel costs account for a major chunk of an airline company s operating expenses  the drop in oil prices has significantly boosted the bottom lines of stocks in the airline space In fact  the financial results of most airline stocks in the closing quarter of 2014 benefited from low fuel costs  Carriers such as Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   Alaska Air Group Inc  NYSE ALK   Southwest Airlines Company  NYSE LUV  and American Airlines Group  NASDAQ AAL  recorded better than expected earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014  Although it is a fact that most carriers hedge at least some of their fuel costs  the majority of them should still continue to benefit considerably from the plunge in oil prices  Notably  carriers use a combination of calls  swaps and collars at varying WTI crude equivalent price levels to hedge fuel costs 
Recent Oil Price Rise Not a ConcernMore lately  airline stocks have fluctuated with respect to price performance  in response to the volatile nature of oil prices  Over the last few weeks  oil prices have been rising albeit not substantially  Crude prices have been hovering around the  50 a barrel mark  This represents a significant decline from the approximately  105 per barrel witnessed in July last year  In fact  oil prices have been fluctuating wildly after hitting a 6 year low of under  44 in Mar 2015 We are not too perturbed by the recent upward movement in oil prices  We believe the adverse impact of the rise on airline stocks is nothing but a short term phenomenon We say this in view of the fundamentals of the industry that remain strong  Thus  stocks in the airline space should gain over the long term  We expect oil prices to continue fluctuating and it is highly unlikely that they will touch the highs of 2014 any time soon  As seen over the recent past  weak oil prices should translate into big gains for airline stocks over the long term This optimism is supported by the rosy outlook for 2015 provided by the International Air Transport Association  IATA   The research firm projects that the industry will continue to see good times in 2015  IATA has projected a rise in the industry s global profit to  25 billion in 2015 from  19 9 billion in 2014 The research firm has also predicted that airline companies will earn  7 08 per passenger in 2015  up 17 6  year over year  The firm further holds that oil prices will continue to fall this year with the average price hovering around  85 per barrel Strong Financial Health Promotes Investment in InfrastructureThe massive savings enjoyed by most airline stocks have naturally turned around their financial health  This has prompted them to invest substantially toward enhancing the flying experience for travelers  in a bid to stay afloat in the competitive airline space  For example  American Airlines announced last year that it will invest in excess of  2 billion to upgrade its flying facilities  In the same vein  Delta Air Lines introduced a new five tiered seating plan from Mar 1  2015  According to Boeing  over the next 20 years  globally  airline companies are expected to invest around  5 2 trillion in fleet development Carriers have been investing heavily toward fleet expansion  For instance  in February  Allegiant Travel Company  NASDAQ ALGT   the parent company of Allegiant Air  announced a deal to buy two A320 planes  At present  the aircraft  which has a capacity of 177 seats  is being used by Philippine Airlines  The twin A320 aircraft will join the company s fleet before the end of 2015 Thus  low oil prices are indeed a blessing for the financial health of airline companies  We expect these good times to continue for quite some time ahead  and so do the carriers  as can be made out by the long term investments planned by them The Bottom LineEven though oil prices are betraying a marginal upward trend  we believe prices are unlikely to touch the highs witnessed early last year  Consequently  airline stocks should continue to gain and the industry as a whole should still witness joyful times  With oil prices expected to remain weak and ticket prices not showing substantial change  airline stocks should appreciate going forward ",2015-04-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-airline-stocks-withstand-higher-crude-oil-prices-247774,247774
23977,245492,ALGT,Deutsche Bank  Airlines To Generate Nearly  25 B In Operating Income,opinion,"A recent Deutsche Bank report projects a total airline industry first quarter pretax profit of  3 5 billion  five times the  700 million pretax profit this time last year a fivefold increase  The bank estimates that nearly 110 percent of the earnings gain will derive from lower fuel prices  It states that  the industry over the past several years has demonstrated its ability to successfully offset most  if not all  of the rise in fuel expense via a combination of cost savings and various revenue initiatives   Looking ahead to the end of the year  Deutsche Bank sees airlines generating  24 7 billion in operating income  or the money that remains after certain operating expenses are paid such as research and development  wages  maintenance and the like  As we all know  oil has fallen nearly 50 percent since last summer  and jet fuel prices have followed closely at its heels  declining to multi year lows  According to the International Air Transport Association  IATA   airlines worldwide are expected to spend  71 billion on fuel in 2015  a savings of  84 billion compared to 2014  Efficiency Leading the Way An important metric Deutsche Bank uses to illustrate that the industry is in expansion mode is operating margin  which measures a company s efficiency in generating revenue  This figure tells you how much of each dollar earned the company keeps as profit after taxes  Generally speaking  the higher the number  the more efficiently the company is being run and the more capital it can use to pay down debt and return to investors in the form of stock buybacks and dividends  Because of fuel cost savings  all 11 of the companies below are expected to increase margins by the end of 2015  The carrier expected to see the greatest increase is Las Vegas based Allegiant Air  the ultra low cost regional carrier that focuses on underserved cities  The company provides a  complete travel experience  that allows customers to book hotel stays and car rentals on top of flights  Claiming the highest margins last year was Spirit Airlines Inc  NASDAQ SAVE   the carrier known for its  Bare Fare  pricing structure  Even though it offers some of the lowest prices in the industry they re 40 percent lower than the competition on average Spirit is able to maintain these margins because of its stripped down  no frills service and experience  Spirit certainly has grounds to justify this highly frugal business model  In a June 2014 survey  close to 1 500 air travelers were asked what they considered first when looking to purchase an airline ticket  Fifty percent of respondents cited price as the most decisive factor  whereas only 3 percent said it was legroom  Earnings SeasonA few airlines have already reported on first quarter earnings  and so far most have beaten analysts  expectations  American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL   which was  to the S P 500  reported a record net profit of  1 2 billion  or  1 73 per share  This is a tripling of the carrier s net profits in the first quarter of last year  American CEO Doug Parker is so bullish on his company that he has asked to be compensated solely in company stock going forward  Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   which we own in our Holmes Macro Trends Fund  reported higher than expected earnings  0 45 per share with an average beat of 5 11 percent over the last four quarters  This marks the company s eighth consecutive quarter of record profits  Alaska Air Group s  NYSE ALK  EPS came in at  1 12  with earnings up 75 percent on a year over year basis  The company reported record first quarter net income of  149 million  a 67 percent increase from last year  During the quarter  the company also bought back  102 million worth of common stock and paid a  0 20 per share dividend  We own Alaska Air in our fund as well  Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  reported record profits of  453 million or  0 66 per share  beating consensus by one penny up from  152 million in the first quarter last year  United Continental Holdings  NYSE UAL  reported record first quarter profits of  582 million  earning  1 52 per share  beating estimates of  1 44  The company paid back  200 million to shareholders in its proposed  1 billion share buyback program

23982,245497,ALGT,Highly Successful CEOs  Show Me The Stock Options  Not The Cash,opinion,"In early March  I made the case that there s  in a company s growth prospects than when its top officers put some skin in the game and buy their own company stock  Among the examples I used were Warren Buffett  who owns millions of shares in Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   Elon Musk  who purchased over  100 million worth of Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  stock in 2013  Another example of how bullish an executive is on his own company is when he chooses to forego a base salary entirely and instead be compensated in company stock  The most recent chief executive officer to receive such compensation is American Airline s Doug Parker  In a letter to employees  Parker wrote 
Going forward  I have asked our Board to restructure my compensation such that I will no longer receive a base salary or an annual bonus  Instead  all of my primary compensation will be paid in American Airlines Group  NASDAQ AAL  stock  This stock will have to be earned over time  and will also have to be earned by performance  I believe this is the right way for my compensation to be set at risk  based entirely on the results achieved  and in the same currency that our shareholders receive  Parker has such confidence in his own company and the industry in general that he s willing to place a huge portion of his financial security in its hands  This  along with American s recent addition to the S P 500 Index  should make investors  ears perk up  He s not the only CEO who s switched to stock  Fellow airline executive Maurice J  Gallagher Jr  of Allegiant Air  NASDAQ ALGT  has also passed on cash  receiving a little over half a million dollars in stock and options in 2013 alone  The late  great Steve Jobs was famously paid  1 a year to serve as CEO of Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  taking his real payment in company shares  In February 2011  a few months before his death  it was reported that Jobs owned about 5 5 million shares in Apple stock  which at the time was worth a little over  2 billion Another notable example is Larry Ellison  co founder and former CEO of computer technology company Oracle  NYSE ORCL   In 2013  Ellison was the most highly compensated CEO out of the 300 who were featured in the Wall Street Journal Hay group CEO Compensation Study  During his final full year of work at Oracle  he received  67 3 million nearly all of it in stock options  Stock has been steadily growing in importance as a form of compensation for the most successful CEOs  Between 2009 and 2013  performance stock for those leading S P 1500 Index companies rose 52 percent  the largest increase of any other type of payment  Compared to all other methods  in fact  performance stock is now the most preferred  according to executive compensation consultancy firm Equilar  Stock isn t just good for executives  it s also good for shareholders  In a 2010 study piece that appeared in the NYU Journal of Law   Business  Villanova University Business Law Professor Richard A  Booth writes that  stock options are indeed the best form of incentive compensation yet devised  for CEOs  His reasoning 

  I t is the supposed duty of the directors and officers to maximize stockholder value  In practice  there are few situations in which that duty is enforced as a matter of law  Options fill the gap  

Although options are a specific type of security  giving the holder the right to buy or sell shares at a later date  they re used here as a proxy for the broader argument that stock helps executives better align their interests with shareholders   
Despite Greece  Investors Still Bullish on Europe
You might have noticed that Greece has been in the headlines a lot lately  Many global investors are anxious to see how the drama unfolds  as the beleaguered Mediterranean country  strapped for cash  is staring down billions of euros in upcoming bailout loan repayments  not to mention salaries and pensions  On May 12  Greece will owe the International Monetary Fund  IMF  0 8 billion euros  and between the end of July and beginning of August  7 billion euros in bond payments become due to the European Central Bank  ECB   according to Wood   Company  Below you can see which countries would be impacted the most were Greece to default on its obligations  Although Germany holds the greatest amount of Greek debt over 84 billion euros  worth Slovenia would be hurt the worst  as 4 percent of its GDP is tied up in the country s debt  Rightfully so  investors are wondering about the implications of a so called  Grexit  from the eurozone  We don t expect this to happen  as it would be too great of an economic  political and psychological blow to Greece  The IMF takes the same position  To be clear  the country is indeed running out of cash  and it won t be able to pay its pensioners and creditors without a deal  Negotiation talks stalled this past weekend  but we re optimistic that a deal can be struck  Despite all of the negative press  global investors  including us  are increasingly bullish on both Greece and the eurozone in general  We closely monitor technical indicators such as credit default swap  CDS  spreads  moving averages and money flow  and we ve seen some promising market moves lately  For instance  Greek banks  five day moving average just crossed above both the 20  and 60 day moving averages  So far this year  investors have added  223 million to a Greek exchange traded fund  ETF   with short interest on the product falling to its lowest level since April 2013  Among 1 280 Bloomberg subscribers  35 percent recently singled out the eurozone as the one market that will offer the best investment opportunities over the next year  an increase of 16 percentage points since January  Disclaimer and Disclosure  Foreign and emerging market investing

24009,245524,ALGT,Allegiant Travel  An Amazing Airline Stock,opinion,The airline industry has been notoriously tricky investing terrain  For one  airlines are victims to volatile jet fuel costs  which have constantly plagued major airlines as United Airlines  NYSE  UAL  and Southwest Airlines  NYSE  LUV  until recently  when jet fuel prices have started to decline  Moreover  low customer satisfaction due to such problems as flight delay  lost baggage  and additional costs has been a thorn in the side for several companies such as U S  Airways  NYSE  LCC  and Delta Airlines  NYSE  DAL   The consistently worst offender in customer satisfaction is ultra low cost carrier Spirit Airlines  NASDAQ  SAVE   which leads the airline industry in piling additional costs on the consumer  it currently  carry on fee The industry is also saturated with competitors that offer hardly differentiated products  making it hard for specific companies to carve out niches in the airline industry  Moreover  the industry has also historically had problems with labor unions  for example  Spirit Airlines was the focus of a major pilot strike and approximately 50  of its workforce in 2011 was composed of union members     Even Warren Buffett notably stated in his  that the airline industry was  the worst sort of business   lamenting that the lack of a durable competitive advantage among the airline companies makes the industry  gruesome   With his signature wittiness  Buffett observed   Indeed  if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk  he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down     However  despite the hostile investing environment of the airline industry  one airline company continues to soar and prosper  Allegiant Travel Company  NASDAQ  ALGT   This moderately large airline  with a market cap of around  1 33B  focuses on providing low cost airfare  The company has already seen its stock increase 31 4  YTD and is barely 1 3  off its 52 week high  indicating strong market demand for the stock  The strength of its stock shows that Allegiant is benefiting from several advantages unique to itself but also from broader economic conditions One of the main advantages of Allegiant s business model is that it doesn t try to do everything and accommodate every passenger  a business strategy bigger airlines such as Delta have adopted  Although this strategy does provide more opportunities to generate revenue  it also comes with a risk of overextending and decreasing profit margins  Instead  Allegiant s strategy is to accommodate leisure travelers in small cities that bigger airlines wouldn t want to touch  Allegiant caters to hundreds of these small cities across the United States through direct flights from these cities to major cities tourist destinations such as Las Vegas  Orlando  and Los Angeles  Despite intense overall competition in the airline industry  Allegiant experiences little to no competition on its flight routes and incredibly  has established a niche in the airline industry Allegiant has the ability to implement a variable flight schedule since its customer base is relatively small and the traveling seasons of its customers are roughly predictable  Depending on demand  Allegiant has the flexibility to add or cut flight routes and even postpone flight times in times of low demand  This flexibility  which is unheard of in the larger airlines  has allowed Allegiant to adapt to rough times in the airline industry and has enhanced its durability as a company  For example  when oil prices skyrocketed in 2007 and most of the airline industry teetered near the brink of collapse  Allegiant was able to turn a profit by simply cutting half of its average daily scheduled flights in just two months  Allegiant has mastered the ability to use its flight schedule flexibility to mitigate losses during times of economic hardship and increase profit in times of economic prosperity  an ability which no other major airline has been able to utilize effectively On top of these unique strategic advantages  Allegiant recently implemented a potentially significant revenue generator in the form of introducing a  35 carry on bag fee  This fee will add additional revenue to what is already an extremely impressive balance sheet  For one  Allegiant  first quarter 2012 EPS of  1 12  which beat estimates by  0 13  and revenue of  237 9M  which beat by  2M and represents a 23  YOY increase  Moreover  this is Allegiant s 37th consecutive profitable quarter  which is proof of a capable management team that has steered the company through economic and company hardships  For the entire year  Allegiant is expected to report a 60 31  YOY increase in earnings  It should also be noted that Allegiant has a completely manageable Debt Equity Ratio of 39      Finally  Allegiant  as well as all of the aforementioned airline companies  will benefit from the recent decreases in jet fuel prices  Fuel is the single largest expense for airlines and accounts for nearly one third of the industry s operating expenses  However  jet fuel prices  more than a 12  tumble in prices  from a February peak of  3 29 a gallon to  2 72 on June 23  To put that into perspective  a savings of 40 cents a gallon amounts to an annualized   5 5 billion windfall for the industry   according to J P  Morgan analyst Jamie Baker  The decline in jet fuel prices will definitely contribute positively to Allegiant s bottom line    Overall  Allegiant is one of the best airlines in the industry  Due to its catering to a specific niche of air travel  smart business strategies  excellent financials  and improving conditions for the airline industry  Allegiant definitely has significant upside potential in the future ,2012-06-24,George Liu,https://www.investing.com/analysis/allegiant-travel:-an-amazing-airline-stock-127450,127450
24010,245525,ALGT,Five Airline Stocks That Continue To Soar,opinion,For those who follow our articles and have read our past articles  you know then that we have been big fans of the airline industry over the course of the past 17 months  More specifically it has been five airline stocks that we have continued to hold and follow and to date it has become one of our top performing sectors with all five airline stocks totaling a combined return of 306 72   Average that out over the five stocks and you get 60 42  each pick  not too bad for just 17 months  The five airline stocks are the following  Allegiant Travel  ALGT   86 13 Boeing  BA   19 21 Delta Air Lines  DAL   104 61 Southwest Airlines  LUV   36 35 UAL Corp  UAL    60 42 Total   306 72  Average   61 34  As you can see  DAL  ALGT  and UAL have been the big winners with LUV recently joining the group after a strong 6 month rally of 30   While it doesn t have the flashy gains like the others  BA has still performed as we had expected a Large Cap Dividend Stock to perform  Our Five Favorite Airline Stocks Section began back in August of 2011 when we first published  Five Airline Stocks Ready to Pop    after a very successful year where we saw all five stocks soar to new heights we decided to reanalyze our positions on July of 2012 in our article  Five Airline Stocks That Have Soared to New Heights    After another strong six month rally we are back at it again  This time pointing out what worked in the past  a look back at our past recommendation  highlighting the key factors we like going forward  and finally giving out 12 month price targets for each pick   Allegiant Travel  7 82  From 2011 to 2012  Allegiant Travel was the big surprise stock rising over 78  in a little over a year  Going forward  it was no question that ALGT was due for a correction and some quiet times  That s not to say that it s still not a great company and a premiere airline stock  While only rising 7 82  since July 24th  we still see lots of potential going forward  ALGT has done an excellent job at growing their business and there still is lots of room to expand as they continue to acquire new loyal customers  In our previous July 24th article we wrote   While this is great and all  some of you out there might want to consider taking a conservative approach and sell off some of your shares  take your profits  and play with the house s money  This time round we don t plan on playing it so conservative  In fact  we think ALGT s a solid buy for several reasons  To start  ALGT has an exceptional PEG ratio of 0 48  not to mention they currently hold over  357 Million in the bank  What most stands out however is that 20 71  of ALGT s Shareholders are Insiders  This is a staggering number to take into account  and it s usually noted that insiders don t take that strong of a position unless they have a reason to back it up  This is a good indicator that good times are still ahead for ALGT  While the surprise factor is no longer there  that s not to stop ALGT from continuing to pump out great earnings along with higher revenue numbers resulting in them beating the street s expectations  If we re looking at a 12 Month Price Target  expect ALGT to be trading around  95 per share  a total yield of 27 5    Boeing  3 55  Boeing has been a safe and steady stock for some time now  After bouncing  40  from 2010 to 2011  shares have been very steady throughout 2011 and 2012  Boeing is one of the major aerospace and defense companies  Boeing s biggest strength is the company as a whole  The fundamentals are strong from top to bottom  Their book of business is great as well  Some numbers that standout to us are there PEG Ratio of 0 20  P S of 0 71  62 75  ROE  and the fact they re holding over  11 Billion in cash  Remember cash is always king and a cash flow positive company is always attractive for that reason  In our previous July 24th article we wrote   Going forward we like Boeing and expect the stock to continue to steadily rise with a strong outlook ahead  bullish analyst coverage and upbeat expectations  We originally pegged it to rise to  95 and we re sticking with that price target  With more huge contracts to come  a solid book of business top to bottom  no cash flow problems  and a great business overall the future looks great for Boeing   While BA didn t quite pan out like we had anticipated rising only 3 55  over the past six months  it doesn t mean we have lost faith in the company overall  We are still firm supporters of BA going forward and the majority of the analysts covering the stock hold this same opinion  Of the 25 analysts covering BA  80  hold a BUY Rating or higher  55  have BA pegged at a STRONG BUY  The 25 analysts breakdown like this  Strong Buy  9 Buy  4 Hold  and 1 Underperform  If we re looking at a 12 Month Price Target  expect BA to finally make its strong push very similar to when they jumped 40  from 2010 to 2011  We expect BA shares to be trading around  100 per share come one year from now  a total yield of 36   Tag on a 2 60  dividend and you have a total net yield of 38 6   Delta Air Lines  48 34  Delta Air Lines has not just been one of the best airline stocks over the past 17 months  they have been one of the best stocks period  After soaring  56  the previous year many expected the stock to slip up or stay situated  heck even we did  In our previous July 24th article we wrote   They are one of the great success stories making such a strong comeback after their shaky past history dealing with bankruptcy and restructuring problems and failing to become relevant  Well they are relevant now  Don t expect the stock to duplicate it s amazing past performance nevertheless we re still confident investors will see nice steady gains   DAL did the complete opposite of what everyone had expected  soaring another 48 34  over the next 6 months making their total net gain of  104  in a 17 month period  The famous trader  Peter Lynch would call this a ten bagger  Going forward you would expect the good times to be over for DAL right  Nope  in fact analysts couldn t be more bullish about the stock as 93  of the analysts currently covering DAL issuing a BUY rating or higher  Breaking it down  of the 15 analysts covering DAL  5 Strong Buy  9 Buy    1 Hold  If that doesn t sell you then maybe this will  DAL holds a PEG Ratio of 0 20  a P S of 0 32  and they have over  3 2 Billion in the bank  After panning out as our trendy pick in 2011  we went away from the fundamentals and as a result it cost us from capitalizing on DAL s second big rally  Luckily we have learned from our mistakes and are fully set to ride out another great run by DAL  If we re looking at a 12 Month Price Target  expect DAL to be trading around  20 per share  a total yield of 44    Southwest Airlines  29 79  Southwest is a proven winner  year in and year out the stock continues to perform  LUV continues to be America s leading discount airline  a title that has made them a revenue machine and a great investment  In our previous July 24th article we wrote   If you currently own the stock we recommend you to hold onto LUV but new investors don t be jumping out to buy this one as we d rather see you invest in Delta Air Lines  Nevertheless expect LUV to rebound and make a strong run   How has LUV performed since we wrote that  Quite well  up 29 79  so for the investors who stayed put they did quite well  When you compare LUV 30  rally to DAL s 48  jump it doesn t look as impressive but LUV still proved to be a solid investment  Going forward we re still holding onto LUV however new investors shouldn t be jumping out to buy new shares unless they drop significantly  We like LUV s 0 42 PEG Ratio  their 0 48 P S  and the fact they have  2 97 Billion in cash  We don t like the fact analysts aren t that bullish about LUV as more analysts have a HOLD rating out for LUV than a BUY  Nevertheless LUV is a great company from top to bottom and if we re looking at a 12 Month Price Target  expect LUB to be trading around  14 50 per share  a total yield of 30    UAL Corp   18 16  After an exceptional run of over 42  in 2011 and 2012  many questioned whether UAL Corp could keep up the trend  Not for one second did we doubt that UAL would continue to deliver steady returns  In our previous July 24th article we

107050,328565,ALGT,Worried About Coronavirus  5 Stocks to Buy With Zero China Exposure,news,"Back when Saturday Night Live was in its heyday  and arguably much funnier  the late Gilda Radner played a character called Rosanne Rosannadanna  who would lament and comment on current situations  both locally and nationally  Her go to phrase was  It s always something   Long time investors are well aware of that  and were reminded last week after the news of the latest coronavirus outbreak in China started to hit the tape 
Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that cause diseases in mammals  including humans  and birds  In humans  the virus causes respiratory infections that are typically mild  but in rare cases they can be lethal  In cows and pigs  they may cause diarrhea  while in chickens it can cause an upper respiratory disease div connatix margin bottom  1 5em   div connatix img  margin  unset  
Due to the spread of the virus  China is all but locked down now  and the government has halted stock trading and extended the lunar new year celebration from January 30 to February 2  Reports have indicated that a lockdown now affects 56 million people  and it may have come too late  which could make the situation worse 
One thing is for sure  investors concerned over the potential fallout may want to move to shares of companies with very little or no exposure to China  We found five that make sense now  and all are rated Buy at Merrill Lynch 
Allegiant Travel
This low cost carrier flies to many cities  but none of those destinations are in China  Allegiant Travel Co   NASDAQ  ALGT  has a unique business strategy  flying where other airlines do not  The company connects 136 city pairs and typically flies each leisure route only a few times a week  using older planes with low capital costs  An early unbundler  the company generates more fees per passenger than any U S  airline  Allegiant s largest market is Las Vegas  followed by Orlando and Phoenix 

The company recently announced the largest service expansion in its history  which includes 44 new nonstop routes  including 14 routes to three new cities  Chicago  Boston and Houston  This major addition to service is driven by Allegiant s goal of connecting leisure travelers in underserved cities to popular destinations around the country  Most of the 44 new routes are non competitive  with no other airline providing service between those airports 
The Merrill Lynch price target is  197 for the shares  while the Wall Street consensus target is slightly higher at  198 78  The stock was last seen trading at  166 69 per share 
American Electric Power
Merrill Lynch recently add this to its US 1 list of top stocks  American Electric Power Co  Inc   NYSE  AEP  is one of the largest electric utilities in the United States  delivering electricity to more than 5 4 million customers in 11 states  It ranks among the nation s largest generators of electricity  owning nearly 38 000 megawatts of generating capacity in the United States  It also owns the nation s largest electricity transmission system  a more than 40 000 mile network that includes more 765 kilovolt extra high voltage transmission lines than all other U S  transmission systems combined 
The addition to the US 1 list was somewhat of a contrarian call as the utility sector as a whole has had a huge run over the past few years  as interest rates have plummeted again  The Federal Reserve went back to cutting rates and using  short term  quantitative easing 
American Electric Power offers shareholders a solid 2 75  dividend  The  106 Merrill Lynch price target compares with the  99 80 consensus price target  as well as the most recent closing share price of  101 78

Thank you  Sherry  and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call  I m happy to report our 68th consecutive profitable quarter  Our operating income increased 50   while earnings per share was up 43  to  14 26  By any standards  this past year has been a terrific year  As I said in our calls the past four quarters  we were in a good place at the end of 2018 after completing our transition  The model is alive and well with our Airbus aircraft  In fact  we  in my mind  are in a better place compared to where we were with the MDs  We said we would generate  6 million of EBITDA this year per aircraft  and we did it and stayed at  6 3 million  a 50  increase over our 2018 results  Again  we led the industry in operating margin for both quarter and the year  And for the airline only in 2019  we had a 21  operating margin and generated almost  16 of EPS  Our other investments in Sunseeker and nonstop are progressing well  While this past year and 2020 will be investment years  the outcomes will justify the investments  Our Allegiant 2 0 implementation is progressing nicely  We have spent the past 18 years developing relationships with our leisure customers  2 0 is focused on providing these customers with enhanced travel experiences by utilizing our direct relationship with them through our enhanced IT tools  Since succinctly  we are focused on bringing together our one to one relationship with our customers through better IT tools  increasing the suite of leisure products  pricing them attractively and wrapping them in our loyalty program  which rewards participation in the Allegiant ecosystem  Critical to this effort is increasing our awareness among our customers  We have had an excellent year in this category  particularly with our efforts on the Allegiant stadium  and our recent announcement of our 44 new routes  As I said in the release  we are truly becoming a national company defined by our leisure business  but we need more products than just our terrific air product  Additional hotel products  particularly in Florida  will be a critical component  We have sold over 7 5 million hotel room nights since the early days of the 2000s  and we are experienced in this effort  The majority of the room nights sold have been here in Las Vegas  but we are experienced in Florida  as well as that is our second largest hotel market  Sunseeker will allow us to focus our customers on our product  selling our rooms  quite profitably  I might add  given we will sell them without intermediaries  This will allow us to generate exceptional EBITDA numbers as we have said in the previous comments  As I said earlier  we had a remarkable year last year  Others will comment on things today as to what we did in some of the specifics  I want to turn my comments to our personnel  our great people  and our management team  We have matured nicely over the past many years  People candidly are core to what you see and hear from us and everything we do  And I can say  categorically  this is the best team I ve been associated within these past 18 years at both the management and the operations level  including our team members who produce our product every day  They are among the best in the industry  Our results verify this claim  We have been No  1 in completion factor  19 of the past 24 months  Our net promoter scores have increased 32 points during this time  ranking us among the top air carriers in the U S   and our bench strength as well in our management group is as deep as I have seen it  And this is just not me saying this  We have independent verification of the support of our team members via the Glassdoor findings  They are the go to online site for people researching a company s culture and quality based on reports from its personnel  This past year  for the first time  we made the top 100 companies in the country to work for  and I believe we are the only company in Nevada in this category  This is indicative of the environment our team has created inside our four walls  This quality environment where our people are both proud and enjoy coming to work is the result of many years of a conscious effort to internally develop our talent and create an environment where they can succeed and grow  And while we ve had a remarkable history of data  I m convinced this team will lead us to better days in the future  Let me close by personally congratulating Scott DeAngelo on his promotion to EVP  Scott has been with us for just short of two years  But during this time  he is having an outsized impact  First and foremost  he is a terrific person  a great leader  and manager  He has been spearheading our Allegiant 2 0 development efforts to date as well  His experience and understanding of data  among other things  and how it works when talking to customers  will be critical building the 2 0 in the coming months and years  We are indeed fortunate to have him on board  Thank you all today  Let me turn it over to John John Redmond    President Well  thank you very much  Maury  and good afternoon  everyone  Of course  I echo Maury s comments when it comes to the wonderful job that our Allegiant team has done this past year  Of course  the release reiterates our Investor Day guidance which demonstrates the continued high expectations we have for this amazing Allegiant team going forward  so thank you to all of our team  I ll give you a quick update on Sunseeker  This project  of course  is still on time and on budget  I ll get into a little bit more detail on that  The budget  of course  is  470 million  no change  As of year end  we had  330 million in commitments  Again  these commitments mean that we have agreements in place including schedules  Again  out of that  470 million   25 million is preopening   4 million of which  of course  was spent in  19  and the balance of that will be spent in  20 and  21  And Greg will give you a little bit more color on that in his comments  So if you take that  470 million  you back out the  25 million in preopening  you have a  445 million budget  So roughly 74  of that budget  the  330 million I referenced is committed  so we re in really good shape where we stand  Of course  if you further reduce that budget by another  45 million that relates to furniture  fixtures  and operating supplies  which  obviously  those orders are always placed toward the back end right before opening  you re down around  400 million  of course   330 million commitments out of  400 million  We re roughly 83  committed  so really good shape  We re happy with how we re progressing and look forward to  21  TPG funding  as we mentioned  we expect that to kick in around August of this year and we also still expect around June or July of this year of our buildings to be all topped off and completely enclosed  In regards to the opening date  we talked about this a little bit in the Investor Day  but it s worth explaining again  We have put inventory out there for sale to the public already  The inventory we put out there is June of  21 through May of  22  We expect to open the building in April  but we have another hurricane season to deal with and I don t want to be selling rooms only to potentially refund money  So while we believe we can open as early as April  well  we are quoting at this point in time a June opening date  As I mentioned before  I will pick a new month  And I expect it to be in the April time frame  We ll pick that new month in the fourth quarter of this year  So once we get through another hurricane season  we ll update you on what the month is that we expect to open  And as I said before  when we get into January of  21  we ll actually pick an opening date  I mentioned we re currently selling rooms  It s very  very soft  We re not in the heavy marketing as we re testing all of our systems that we developed  So we have  to date  26 bookings relating to 27 rooms  Obviously  one person booked two rooms  and the ADR so far  our average daily rate that we ve received to date is right around  297  And again  we modeled  185  but I don t want to have anyone extrapolate just yet  We haven t sold enough rooms to do that  but we re very excited about how things are progressing in the amount of information we re getting in this relatively short period of time  And again  when you look at this  people are booking 18 months to two years out  so we never expected it to be selling like crazy  We just wanted a soft start so we can test all of our systems  I also wanted to mention that we will be filing a site plan for Phase 2 next week  And before anyone gets too excited about it  that Phase 2 that we re going to submit is just a ground level pool and a restaurant  So again  when you submit these types of documents for site plan approval  these don t create an obligation when the county approves it  It just creates an opportunity  So if and when we ever choose to do this project will be a decision for the board to make down the road  but we can t put ourselves in a position to do anything without going through the normal process of submitting these things  I wanted to mention that so it s out there  and it s not something that s misinterpreted when we file  And of course  on that note  I ll turn it over to our recently promoted Executive Vice President Scott DeAngelo Scott DeAngelo    Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Thank you  John  As Maury referenced  in 2019  we leveraged data and technology to lay the commercial foundation for our Allegiant 2 0 vision  a vision that capitalizes on our cost effective  direct to customer distribution model  to achieve not only strong air and ancillary revenue performance  but also pile on top of that by generating revenue beyond the aircraft with our third party hotel and rental car products and our co brand credit card program  Nearly 110 million web users visited allegiant com in 2019  a 10  increase versus the prior year  More importantly  even with this dramatic growth in web visitation  we maintained our internal productivity metric of achieving an average of more than  16 of net revenue per website visitor  which means that despite attracting 10 million more visitors to allegiant com  our ability to convert those visitors into Allegiant customers at comparable transaction sizes remained constant and attracting these web visitors became more cost effective than ever as nearly 75  came to allegiant com without requiring any paid digital advertising helping us achieve this was our email database  which grew by more than 25   A couple of these large and growing digital audiences  with the fact that nearly 85  of our customers say that air is the first purchase they make for their leisure vacations  And we are well positioned to continue growing revenue from our third party products  We see our customers first  and we know where they re traveling to before anyone else  This gives us an unparalleled opportunity to present them with hotel and rental car options  and in the future  even sport and event tickets  In fact  we re already seeing returns from our Allegiant 2 0 approach  We ended 2019 with 20  year over year growth in third party product net revenue  And please remember  this net revenue almost entirely flows through to operating income  Continuing our surgical data driven approach to generating demand for Allegiant Air in new and existing markets while streamlining the direct buying experience at allegiant com to reduce friction  achieve even greater attachment of hotel rooms and rental cars and  of course  continued growth of our Allegiant World MasterCard program remain key commercial focus areas this year for Allegiant 2 0  And lastly  I ll address the announcement we made today as the official airline of the Indianapolis Colts  This arrangement is simply continuing a partnership that we began in 2015 when we entered the Indianapolis market with five routes  Since then  thanks in large part to the Allegiant 2 0 brand awareness driven in conjunction with this partnership  we ve established a base there and now fly to 15 destinations  We also serve three other airports in the state which also benefit from this  Like our other major sports partnership  this one has no incremental impact to our sales and marketing costs  What s more  the Indianapolis Colts are a fixed fee customer of ours  So in that sense  they re not only helping us build awareness  but also contributing to the record setting revenue levels we re experiencing in our fixed fee business  And with that  I ll turn it over to Drew Wells to go deeper into our revenue and network performance Drew Wells    Vice President of Revenue and Planning Great  Thank you  Scott  and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon  I m very pleased to announce the fourth quarter TRASM of plus 2 5  year over year on 8 3  ASM growth  As a reminder  this result is despite a roughly half point onetime benefit we received in the fourth quarter of 2018  We received large contributions from both our air ancillary and third party revenue sources  Air ancillaries surpassed  50 per passenger for the fourth consecutive quarter  And as Scott mentioned  third party revenue improvements doubled ASM growth  On the year  we grew TRASM by 1 6  on plus 8 4  ASMs  Furthermore  fixed fee revenue remains a source of immense strength  setting a record for the full year and a quarterly record for the third time in the last five quarters  This is largely attributable to an increase in Department of Defense flying and continued incredible work by our charter planning group  In October  we released our bundled ancillary products  which we expect to be a boon through 2020  This will have a bit of a ramping period as we learn best practices and had a fairly small impact to 4Q results due to timing of the release in our typical booking curve  But we ll start to pick up in earnest during the first quarter  Shifting toward 2020  lapping the MD 80 retirement date will drive elevated growth through the first quarter  We expect this quarter s ASM growth of plus 14  to 17  to be the highest quarterly increase since 2016  As I talked about extensively at Investor Day  we will accomplish this even with a reduction in fleet utilization that is more pronounced in off peak periods  Looking throughout the year  we will have fairly lumpy growth in order to achieve the plus 10  to 12  annual ASM guidance  and I would like to add some clarity on that cadence  Throughout the second quarter  we will be flat to slightly positive in the first then the front half of the quarter  with gains coming in the back half for total ASM growth in the quarter of plus 6  to 9   That ramp will continue through the summer with third quarter rivaling Q1 for the highest growth in 2020 in the plus 13  to 17  range  Lastly  we are still working to finalize the holiday portion of the 4Q schedule  But we believe the quarter is likely to be 7  to 11  up year over year  While we ve been through the MD 80 retirement for over a year  we are just now beginning to grow aircraft meaningfully versus preretirement levels  This had somewhat constrained our ability to grow the network as we ideally would have  With that final phase of the transition now behind us  we were able to announce the largest slate of new routes in company history  The 44 new routes including the additions of Boston Logan  Chicago Midway  and Houston Hobby are a monumental next step for Allegiant  The ability to expand our footprint to over 500 routes while maintaining all of the elements of our unique business model is an exceptional feat and certainly a very exciting time for the company  So I d like to thank all of our employees and service providers for helping us achieve this huge milestone  It is worth noting that the increase in new market ASMs will certainly put some pressure on unit revenue metrics as our network returns to a higher proportion of developing markets than we ve experienced for a few years  I expect 2Q will be the best quarter of the year from a unit revenue perspective  while the elevated growth  increasing level of developing ASMs  and tougher comps will put some pressure on the back half of the year  Despite global fears about coronavirus  solid demand levels have persisted  Bookings for both new routes and the system as a whole remain strong  and I m encouraged by the current state of demand combined with the power of the Allegiant 2 0 strategy that Scott is putting into action  And with that  I d like to turn it over to Greg Greg Anderson    Chief Financial Officer Thank you  Drew  and hello  everyone  In 2019  the airline completed its 17th consecutive profitable year by delivering  not only an industry leading operating margin of 21 3   but the highest income in our airline s history  This amounts to nearly  300 million of airline operating income  a  130 million increase versus prior year and four consecutive quarters of year over year margin improvement  These results capped what was truly an exceptional year at Allegiant as the airline grew EPS by more than 40  on only 10  of top line growth  These impressive results would not have been possible without the amazing efforts of our team members to support and grow our world class airline  Because of their tireless efforts  I am happy to report for the first time in our history  we beat all of our full year 2019 corporatewide goals  And therefore  our airline employees earn the maximum payout allowable under our airline profit sharing program  This translates to a record  38 million in total profit sharing  a year over year increase of nearly 80  for distribution to our airline team members  I d like to add my personal thanks to all of our team members for their tremendous efforts  We are thrilled with these results and everyone should be proud  While we expect our 42  growth in 2019 EPS will lead the industry  it did not came in on the low end of our latest guide in Q3  primarily due to a spike in the price of fuel during the fourth quarter  Our average cost of fuel during this period was  0 10 higher per gallon than the assumption in our guidance  However  back in January 2019  the midpoint of our initial full year EPS guide was  14  And we continually increased the range during the year  an example of how positive momentum grew for us through the year  As a reminder  our fuel guide is simply based on the price per gallon we pay about a week or so prior to our earnings release  That said  the difference between our 4Q fuel estimate versus actual cost us approximately  0 29 in EPS  We provided additional detail in our recent earnings release  Excluding fuel  airline cost performance for the fourth quarter came in slightly higher than our original expectations  with CASM X down only 1 5  year over year  Although we delivered meaningful improvements in labor productivity during the quarter  costs associated with higher than expected profit sharing drove slightly higher than expected CASM X  I should add  it s a high quality problem when your profit sharing earned by our airline team members come in higher than planned due to a better than expected finish to the year  a further example of strength growing as we move through the year  Full year 2019 airline unit costs  excluding fuel  decreased by 3 3  versus the prior year  However  and not to belabor profit sharing  if you exclude it along with fuel  unit costs would have decreased by 4 4  versus the same metric in 2018  significantly better than the range  Based on our estimates  we are the only U S  carrier in the U S  to report a reduction in CASM X for the full year 2019  another benefit of being through the transition  Our 2019 exceptional cost performance provides a strong foundation for us to build upon in 2020  Our entire team is committed on cost and relentlessly searching for ways to drive the unnecessary ones out of the business  Now turning to the fleet  we ended 2019 with 91 Airbus aircraft in service  two short of the number we had projected  The two additional aircraft are now in service  and we are still on target to reach 105 aircraft by the end of  20  The shift of these two aircraft into 2020 did not impact our 2019 capacity as demonstrated by the 8 3  scheduled ASM growth in the quarter and the 18 5  ASM growth in December  We are pleased with both the operational and economic performance of the Airbus A320 Series aircraft  Flying an all Airbus fleet through 2019 aided us greatly in the airline delivering nearly  540 million in EBITDA  an increase of 40  versus 2018  And on aircraft  on a per aircraft basis  this pencils out to  6 3 million of EBITDA  Our 2019 airline CAPEX came in at  65 million higher than expected  The increase is primarily related to the opportunistic purchase of seven new CFM engines and various spare parts coupled with the better than expected maintenance status on two aircraft acquired during the fourth quarter  Now moving to our 2020 guidance  we are confident in our full year airline CASM X projections of down 2  to flat  It is worth pointing out  we expect unit cost projections to be better in the second half 2020 versus the first half  And we expect the first quarter to outperform the second quarter  This is largely correlated to the growth cadence Drew mentioned  along with a more difficult second quarter comp year over year  Additionally  we are maintaining our 2020 EPS guide of  16 50 to  19 while increasing our full year fuel cost assumption from  2 12 to  2 15 per gallon  which is the only change to our current guide  Including heavy maintenance  our total airline CAPEX for 2020 is expected to be approximately  390 million  Coupling our current run rate of EBITDA per aircraft and the projected aircraft growth during the year  the airline is expected to generate nearly  250 million in free cash flow during 2020  Turning to leverage  strong cash generation is helping us delever quickly  By way of example  we ended 2019 at 2 7 turns debt to EBITDA versus 3 4 turns at the end of 2018  We expect the continued downward trajectory as we grow EBITDA  while quickly amortizing existing aircraft debt  Taking on secured aircraft debt was critical to support the timing of our fleet transition and expansion  If you combine our access to capital from top banks throughout the world and our ability to make money with these aircraft  it has provided us tremendous access to inexpensive financing  We compare this Airbus financing combination in a similar way to the acquisition of our MD 80s  Our all in cash outlay is around the same amount between the two fleet types  primarily since the MD 80 wasn t financeable  Therefore  this type of debt is an efficient tool with a different risk profile and more traditional debt  Aircraft have the ultimate flexibility in capital assets given their mobility  At the end of 2019  we drew on our revolver to provide short term liquidity to help fund the purchase of seven new CFM engines and various spare parts mentioned earlier  We intend to finance most of these engines in early 2020 with use of proceeds to pay down the revolver  Now turning to the nonairline  we remain active in negotiations to sell Teesnap  And given the sensitive nature  we do not intend to comment any further other than    and as a reminder  the sale is not included within our EPS guide  Once the sale is complete  we plan to formally reinstate our nonairline guide  However  we will reconfirm our messaging from our recent Investor Day that our expected 2020 run rate should be similar to 2019 s nonairline results  As a reminder  we still expect Sunseeker to open in the second quarter of 2021 and total project costs remain at  470 million  Included in the  470 million as John mentioned  is  25 million of operating expense  of which we project 60  to 75  will flow through our 2020 nonairline operating loss  Sunseeker CAPEX is expected to pick up in earnest during 2020  and we project over  300 million in gross CAPEX during the year  The first  200 million will be funded by Allegiant and the remaining by TSSP  The remainder of their funding will be drawn during the first quarter of 2021 as we complete construction  We are well positioned for a very strong 2020 as reflected in our full year guide and excited for the growth and continued improvements we expect to see throughout the organization  With that  I would like to turn it over to the operator for questions  Questions   Answers  Operator Operator instructions  I show our first question comes from Savi Syth from Raymond James  Please go ahead Savi Syth    Raymond James    Analyst Hey  Good afternoon  I really appreciate the kind of quarterly color here  Just a little bit  Drew  the 2Q RASM being probably the best makes sense if I look at the capacity growth  But it s my understanding that you had some new markets opened late last year  And then again  you ll have another whole bunch of opening up this year  so wondering if you can talk about the kind of the progression as a percentage of ASMs of new markets and if there s anything kind of peak versus off peak growth that you ll kind of variance that you ll see throughout this year Drew Wells    Vice President of Revenue and Planning Sure  Yes  Thanks for that  Savi  So there were some new routes that went through 2019  I think it s important to stress that it was significantly lower  really  in the back half of  18 into  19 relative to any year really below that  I think I ve mentioned this before  But 4Q  18  we kind of troughed under 4  of our markets being    our ASMs being in developing stage  As we move forward into kind of 2Q  20 when a lot of these new markets    these 44 new routes will open  we ll be up over 11   that will more than double on a year over year basis so there will be significantly more pressure on that front than we saw in 2Q  19 Savi Syth    Raymond James    Analyst OK  Maybe I misunderstood  but you re still expecting 2Q to be the best RASM quarter Drew Wells    Vice President of Revenue and Planning I still expect it to be the best  Some of that  remember the 2Q  19 comp that we re dealing from can t really run away from that  so that s one of the larger emphasis  as well as the lower overall growth rate Savi Syth    Raymond James    Analyst Makes sense  And then if I might ask on the    I know this is a small    very small business  But on the family entertainment center side  just kind of curious how that business is performing versus expectation just from an earnings standpoint but also kind of the secondary reason for it  which is kind of to build loyalty and maybe going to get more email addresses  Just kind of curious if you can provide an update now that they ve been open for a while and the thoughts around that Scott DeAngelo    Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Yes  This is Scott  I can tell you  it was really kind of a reset  It s a new management team in place  We have two stores open  The first one is in Clearfield  which is in Salt Lake  The second one was in Flint  If you look at January  literally  month to date  the profile is similar to how we thought this business would look  Top line through  I think  the 25th was around kind of  575 000 and it s running about a 35  EBITDA margin  As far as emails  there isn t a significant amount of overlap between kind of nonstop versus what was in our Allegiant Air database  It just shows that there are opportunities to kind of cross pollinate there  But no  I think there s a lot of things that we probably didn t do right out of the gate which is why we made some pretty dramatic changes  really stripped a lot of unnecessary costs out  There s a lot of seasonality to FECs  if you can believe it so we think we ve got a good handle  But that s kind of the profile I anticipate going forward  I think it s still going to be a really good business Savi Syth    Raymond James    Analyst All right  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie from Buckingham Research  Please go ahead Dan McKenzie    Buckingham Research    Analsyt Hi  Thanks  A couple of questions here  On the 2020 plan  what s the average daily utilization you ve embedded in the plan  And the reason why I ask is to the extent higher utilization could be just simply a way to drive down cost while you re guiding the CASM X fuel flat to down 2   but I m just trying to put that into context Drew Wells    Vice President of Revenue and Planning Yes  So if utilization will be down for the year  I m pulling up the number right now  I have    the first half number will be down a little more than half an hour per plane  We ll be holding relatively steady in March and June and the peak periods like we expected  But something like in April  we ll come down a full hour so there s quite a bit of flexibility in that  But I would expect about half hour still come out for the year Dan McKenzie    Buckingham Research    Analsyt I see  OK  And then I guess on the sold room nights  just relating to Sunseeker  I m wondering if you can just expand or clarify that a little bit more  What are the total room nights available  What percent have been sold and how do you plan to revenue manage  Or do you plan to revenue manage the remaining inventory John Redmond    President Dan  the room nights sold to date  of course  are a fraction of what the total inventory is  And as I said in my opening comments  we didn t expect people to be booking rooms year and a half to two years out  The fact that we have quite a few people who have done that already the 26 people I was mentioning is amazing to us that people are doing that  Most people    hotels just don t put inventory out that far in advance  but we developed all of our systems internally  So it was important for us to get out there selling as quickly as possible  not do an extensive amount of marketing  just let this traffic trickle in and then allow us to tweak and monitor all of our systems and processes  So we can get those functioning exactly how we want them to  So when we start to heavily market  our expectation is people will start booking in a more significant way about a year out  And of course  I think that starts to ramp up as you get more like six months out  so that s our expectation  The fact that we re getting this traffic now has just been a great surprise to us Dan McKenzie    Buckingham Research    Analsyt Very good  If I could just squeeze one more in here maybe for Scott  I m wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on 2 0  I think Maury talked about it evolving  What capability are you looking to gain  What are you willing to do differently  I guess  is another way to ask that question  As you kind of think about the revenue potential  what kind of revenue potential does that unlock for you Scott DeAngelo    Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer You bet  So in essence  the whole premise of this is the fact that we invest dollars to make people aware of Allegiant and certainly come to our website  And the most accretive thing we can do once they re at that website or  as I like to put it  in our store is to have them put as much in their shopping cart as possible  And that certainly is the premise  So to directly answer your question  the things that requires are a website  and by that  I mean  on mobile and or desktop laptop  that enables all the same flexibility and personalization that an Amazon does  that makes use of all of the frictionless shopping and buying the same way that you use a streaming service that you buy from a leading Internet retailer  And so ultimately  what it unlocks is  today  we know for every one hotel room we sell  there s another nine people that put in their shopping cart  But for the fact that    and list a bunch of reasons  but one of them is they have to pay for it all there versus a conventional way you would pay maybe for one room night and or just make your reservation  and be able to pay at the front desk  These are all technical and or commercial things that we re doing that we think boost the size of that cart in hotel and rental car and other items  The last quick comment is we view the revenue potential not just directly from the customer  people around here have heard it so much  And because they re hot right now  I ll use it again  that Apple got to a  1 trillion market cap not just by selling iPhones and iPads to all of us  but they turned right around and sold us every software developer and media and entertainment company because they were the way that those companies would distribute to the customer  And in a very asset light weight  Apple is happy to do that  and they have their hand out for about 40  of everything they get served through there  In the same way  we believe  and we ve already seen this  hotel partners and rental car partners  other dining establishments are willing to pay to ride along with our website or email marketing  And while this is in its infancy  this becomes a net new revenue stream that doesn t come from the customer but comes from other partners in the ecosystem that not only want to be sold in our store but are willing to pay extra to have top in the sort order and or other advertising opportunities on the site or in our other digital marketing efforts Dan McKenzie    Buckingham Research    Analsyt Very good  now  I appreciate that  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Andrew Didora from Bank of America  Please go ahead Andrew Didora    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst Hi  good afternoon  everyone  John  just a couple of quick questions on Sunseeker  I know it s a very small sample set  But just curious of the bookings that you cited  just curious how you source them  Are they airline customers or not  And just curious what the duration of the stay is like and if that s meeting your expectations or not John Redmond    President All good questions  We even    we re getting a couple of people  actually  book their stay by walking into our previous center  which is right on the site of where the construction is taking place  So we ve had some walk ins  which is great  and of course  the rest of all booked online  The longest stay we booked has been seven days  and of course  the shortest stay has been one  And we booked a seven night stay in the suites  too  which is why you re starting to see a higher rate like that  So while this traffic is slow  it s beyond our expectation that people have booked two years out  so we re very excited by that  We have people that have booked almost about every month we have out there  and the furthest month out is February of  22  We have a couple of bookings that far out  believe it or not  So again  when you start paying real dollars  two years in advance or 18 months in advance  it s significant  it s appreciated  not expected  But we do expect it  of course  as we get much closer to opening  As I said  one year to six months out is when we would start to really see that traffic pick up  And our marketing efforts will be focused around that time frame  too Andrew Didora    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst And make sense  that s all I had  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Helane Becker from Cowen  Please go ahead Helane Becker    Cowen and Company    Analyst Thanks  operator  So I just have maybe two questions  The first one is  does your agreement with Indianapolis Colts preclude you from doing a deal with any other NFL teams Scott DeAngelo    Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer No  Not at all Helane Becker    Cowen and Company    Analyst OK  That was easy  And then my second question is  do you have    given that the MAX is out of service  And it probably will be for the first half of the year  maybe longer  why wouldn t you grow faster Drew Wells    Vice President of Revenue and Planning Sorry  Helane  was the question why don t we grow faster Helane Becker    Cowen and Company    Analyst Yes  Why don t you grow faster to take advantage of the fact that some other airlines can t grow because they don t have the capacity available  So why wouldn t you think about increasing utilization or somehow adding more flights  I don t know how to think about that  But grow faster than your current plan to take advantage of the fact that maybe you can steal some more shares Drew Wells    Vice President of Revenue and Planning Yes  So  Helane  I think the most important part to remember here is  as we have such a unique network and unique business model  we weren t really benefiting from the MAX being gone  All the routes we announced are ones we ve had our eyes on for a while and weren t dictated by the MAX being in or not in service  So I think we re marching to the beat of our own drum and exactly the cadence we want to  Hopping into routes or areas where American or Southwest are trying to expand rapidly doesn t really jive well with where our network is taking up  So I think at 16 or so percent  give or take  one and a half points  I think we re growing at a great rate  one that the entire company can kind of move forward together at  and I think I m very satisfied with where we re at Helane Becker    Cowen and Company    Analyst OK  That s very    that s helpful Greg Anderson    Chief Financial Officer Helane  this is Greg  I was just going to add    I mean  on the MAX  comment that on the fixed fee side  though  we definitely see opportunities to take advantage with the MAX being out  and that s something Drew and his team are hyper focused on and taking advantage of that Helane Becker    Cowen and Company    Analyst OK  That s really super helpful  Thank you Maury Gallagher    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Helane Helane Becker    Cowen and Company    Analyst Of course OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank  Please go ahead Michael Linenberg    Deutsche Bank    Analyst Hey  good afternoon  everyone  I have two questions here  Drew  the announcement to do the 44 city pairs  what is your success rate now  I mean  when you look at some of the launches and all the new city pairs  at the end of the day  maybe after a year of operation  I m sure there s always some pairing and some fine tuning where some markets just maybe they look good on paper but didn t play out  And the reason I ask is that we ve seen over the last few years other carriers make big service announcements  and then we see actually a sizable number drop out  And so I think as you ve grown in size  how has that  call it  success rate  how has that evolved Drew Wells    Vice President of Revenue and Planning Sure  So for a long time  I believe Lukas even quoted this before  we were hunting around 75  success rate as oil kind of came down in the back half of 14  15 there  It actually elevated somewhat  and we re hitting close to 80   85   We probably come back off that just a little bit but still hitting 75  plus at this point Michael Linenberg    Deutsche Bank    Analyst OK  Great  And then just second question to Scott  It was good for the quick update on Allegiant nonstop  You mentioned Clearfield and Flint  For 2020  what are the plans there  I saw news out recently  It looked like you re buying another site  I don t know if it s the third or fourth  What s the plan for expanding that business in 2020  Is it one or two new sites  three sites  How should we think about it Scott DeAngelo    Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Yes  Michael  So a couple of things  I ve mentioned we really spent the back half of the year unwinding some of the decisions that were made  We technically have two other locations that we just  knowing what we know now  were not comfortable moving forward ones  another Utah facility in West Jordan  And there s another one in Fort Wayne  The one in Fort Wayne we own  it s on the market we think we have a potential buyer  But we do plan on opening a new facility in Chesterfield  which is in St  Louis  That should be in the third quarter  So that transaction  purchase is done  and so we re in the throes of developing the space plan  Yes  that one  just knowing what we know now  like I said  we took probably some unnecessary lumps on the front end  So at a minimum  one store  maybe two  there are some other opportunities up in the Michigan area that is attractive as well  But that s kind of the lay of the lands  I m really pleased with kind of how we ended the year but  more importantly  how we re getting started in 2020  As I mentioned  through the majority of January  the profile that we re seeing is similar to what we modeled a year ago Michael Linenberg    Deutsche Bank    Analyst Yes  No  Thanks  35  EBITDA is good  very good Scott DeAngelo    Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Yes Michael Linenberg    Deutsche Bank    Analyst So thanks everyone Maury Gallagher    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Michael OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore  Please go ahead Duane Pfennigwerth    Evercore ISI    Analyst Hey  Thanks for the questions  Drew  you mentioned in your prepared remarks  it s been a while since we ve seen you grow mid to high teens  You guys have done a really nice job of flexing your capacity  shaping it around demand  You mentioned that new market mix was going to pressure RASM in the second half  But I wonder if you could comment  maybe just following up on Savi s question  how it s playing out here into the March quarter  the point being your new markets may not be dilutive to RASM  So do you think you can sustain positive RASM trends into March here Drew Wells    Vice President of Revenue and Planning So obviously not going to comment too much on that  We are not going to guide out any sort of RASM cadence  I ll say this much  obviously  new markets generally have a bit of a maturation curve  It all kind of depends on the type of route you launch  Anything that is connecting the dot between two cities you already operate  which was the predominant percentage of our 2019 market adds  will split up a bit quicker  Anything that has a new city  especially one without G4 presence relatively close  will take a bit longer  So if you think about the type of markets  I think you can kind of glean some information from that  but I think that s as far down the kind of RASM guidance we ll go Duane Pfennigwerth    Evercore ISI    Analyst OK  And then maybe just stepping back  big picture  As you think about fuel as an input to your network plans  I think of Allegiant as one of the better carriers at keeping a fuel tailwind when you get one  Can you talk about  if these lower fuel prices sustain  how these growth projections you have given us could change Drew Wells    Vice President of Revenue and Planning Sure  So within 2020  we are already kind of marching toward the top end of where we said we d like to be long term as kind of an 8  to 12  annual carrier  Some of it will obviously depend on induction and the pipeline in which we re able to acquire planes  If fuel stays lower than this  maybe you can scratch out another couple of points  But I think we re hitting pretty close to the top of where we want to go  We ve learned over time that if you grow too fast  you kind of outpaces some parts of the company  That was a lot of stress  either on the operation or the general infrastructure  So I don t want to get too far ahead of ourselves and start saying  if fuel goes really low  we ll go to 20   because I don t know if that s the right answer for the company as a whole Duane Pfennigwerth    Evercore ISI    Analyst That makes a lot of sense  and just one follow up there  On your airline CAPEX of  285 million at the midpoint  is that deals you hope to complete or do you have line of sight on that  285 million as we sit here today Greg Anderson    Chief Financial Officer Duane  thanks for the question  It s Greg  No  we definitely have line of sight  All the aircraft that are scheduled in that CAPEX or projected in that CAPEX  we already have firm commitments on  And where they re with strong counterparties that we ve done business within the past  then we fully expect that they deliver on a lot of time and that  that CAPEX is kind of in place Duane Pfennigwerth    Evercore ISI    Analyst OK  Thank you very much OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Catherine O Brien of Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead Catherine O Brien    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Hey  Good afternoon  everyone  Thanks for the time  So Drew  maybe one for you  Just on your recent launch  the recent announcement  and launch of service in Boston  Chicago  Houston  can you tell us a little bit more about the decision making process there  Not really your typical type of cities  But should we be viewing these as more destinations than our duration markets and then any concerns on a competitive response Drew Wells    Vice President of Revenue and Planning Yes  Catie  So I think you hit the nail on the head there  These are definitely more destination type cities  If you remember back in 2016  we launched into Newark and BWI  Under very similar pretense  you have either very high fare or completely unserved markets going into both Newark and BWI at that time  and now with Chicago  Houston  and Boston  So there s kind of a small niche in each of these for us to thrive in each of these airports  To serve it as a destination  it s going to be very expensive and very difficult to try to drive a lot of origination traffic from these cities  and that is not at all what we re after here  So within our little niche  we re not concerned about competitive reaction  we ll obviously watch the industry as we do anyway  But it s not something that we expect to rankle others Catherine O Brien    Goldman Sachs    Analyst OK  Gotcha  And then maybe just a follow on to that since you mentioned Baltimore and Newark there  How do those compare maybe like versus system RASM or system margin Drew Wells    Vice President of Revenue and Planning I ll take it at a high level  There s nothing concerning  We re obviously not going to talk about specific margins for cities  But obviously  we ve been there since 2016  Capacity has flexed a little bit  but there s obviously nothing overwhelmingly concerning there for us to continue to be able to put up 20  margins  There s obviously a high hurdle rate you have to clear in order to kind of continue with the schedule so no concern Catherine O Brien    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Got it  I have to give it a shot  Maybe just one more quick one on Teesnap  No question here on the state of negotiation or anything like that  but can you share with us when you re assuming that sale closes just underlying your 2020 EPS guidance  I believe you have a couple of quarters of nonairline expenses associated with Teesnap in that Greg Anderson    Chief Financial Officer Yes  Catherine  Thanks for the question  As far as the guidance  we do have a couple    we don t give guidance on the nonairline cost baked into the budget for Teesnap  We have it in there for the first half of the year  As far as timing  we ve spent a lot of time on it  I d probably prefer not to disclose when we re expecting to close that transaction  We ve been negotiating in earnest with a counterparty for some time  just working through the due diligence  and we re just working through the process  Once we have some clear line of sight on the timing  we ll certainly update you guys  But right now  it s just kind of we re working through it as quickly as possible Catherine O Brien    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Great  Thank you so much OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel  Please go ahead Joseph DeNardi    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst Yes  thanks good evening  Drew  can you just talk about the 44 markets you launched  How many of those were competitive versus noncompetitive  and then where you ended the year for the network in terms of level of competition  and then which way that s going in 2020 Drew Wells    Vice President of Revenue and Planning Sure  So among the 44 routes  11  were competitive  We have some competition into the panhandle of Florida  as well as a couple of the routes out of Nashville and Albuquerque going over to Orlando  so that s where we have the competition there  We ended the year right around between 20  and 25  of market competitive  and it s been trending positively for us in some ways because of our announcements  being more noncompetitive  as well as some actions from competitors  but we ve been heading in a positive direction now for about the last 6 to 12 months Joseph DeNardi    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst Got it  And then  John  not sure if I missed it in your prepared remarks  But the Sunseeker spend in 2019 was below the plan  And I know you said you re still on schedule  but as some of the schedule margin being eaten into  just maybe why it s been so far below plan  And then are    is it    are you planning on continuing to give your    how many rooms booked  Is that something you re going to give every quarter  And if so  what should we expect from that going forward just so there is some level of expectations John Redmond    President Sure  Thanks  Joe  On the spend  that doesn t have any impact on speed  to be honest with you  The commitments are the more relevant or important number  So at the end of the year  I was saying at the end of  19  we ended up with about  330 million in commitments  From a cash management standpoint  if we can delay paying  I mean  that s a great thing to do  So trying to predict pay dates way out like we have to just from a cash management standpoint  it s more art than science  so that s why you ll see it kind of move around  But the opening date  no change to it  No change to the schedules  no change to anything  But if we can delay paying cash  that s a good thing for us  so I think we ended  19    I think as of the end of  19  we had spent about  99 million  roughly  100 million on the project in terms of cash  And again  we had  330 million in commitments  In terms of cadence of bookings  again  I don t expect a significant increase in bookings between  call it  now and the end of the quarter and the first quarter  And I do intend to update everyone every quarter  As I mentioned before  there will be complete transparency on everything we re doing  whether it s construction spend  room nights  occupancy  All of that  we ll be providing you  So  again  we re happy with where we are  We expect to book a handful of more rooms in the quarter  Granted  you d like to see big numbers  but we don t expect them  The expectation  again  we think  is going to start to happen in the back end of the year as opposed to the front part of the year Joseph DeNardi    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst Thanks  John John Redmond    President You re welcome OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research  Please go ahead Hunter Keay    Wolfe Research    Analyst Thank you  Just a quick clarification on    Greg  I think you said you expect to do  250 million in free cash this year  Just to be clear  what CAPEX number are you using in that calculation  I just want to get a sense for like a true gross CAPEX number Greg Anderson    Chief Financial Officer Yes  That would be airline only CAPEX so that would exclude Sunseeker Hunter Keay    Wolfe Research    Analyst OK  And that s not net of any like financing for aircraft  That s like a real gross CAPEX number at least for the airline Greg Anderson    Chief Financial Officer Yes  If you take the run rate  the  6 3 million in EBITDA per aircraft  take it over the average aircraft count that we expect in 2020  that will get you your EBITDA and then just    yes  It s just subtracting out the CAPEX that we re showing  Yes Hunter Keay    Wolfe Research    Analyst It s gross CAPEX  So it s not net of like the proceeds Greg Anderson    Chief Financial Officer Yes  Yes  Yes  Exactly Hunter Keay    Wolfe Research    Analyst All right  All right  OK  And then how many of the 780 000 hotel room nights that you sold through third parties are near Sunseeker or even potentially competitive to Sunseeker in some way  I m just wondering if the Sunseeker sales effort might at all  even marginally cannibalize the third party room nights a little bit geographically  And I asked the question because  obviously  this is  as you said  like  really high margin stuff that just drops straight to the bottom line  so a couple of thousand room nights not sold in exchange for Sunseeker  I m just wondering if there s a little bit of a potential margin disruption impact we should think about John Redmond    President I don t think you ll see any impact there  Hunter  And of course  the numbers that Maury was quoting had to do with gross number of room nights we sold since the inception of the airline  But the number of hotel room nights we sell skews Vegas  We ve always said that in the past  so the concentration of rooms we sell has always been in Vegas  The second market  of course  is in Florida  And the room nights we were selling in Florida are scattered all over  so with a skewing there toward Orlando  the Sanford market  So everything that we re going to see down in Southwest Florida is going to be accretive  We don t see any displacement type traffic or activity that will go on down there Scott DeAngelo    Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Yes  I would add that the more dominant effect you ll see in its opportunity is markets that have become what I refer to as our next gen destinations  Nashville  Savannah  Myrtle Beach  those are markets that  right now  we do virtually no hotel business  And we re scurrying to have the same type of offerings that a Las Vegas or in Orlando have  So in the sense of answering the question  that may swing the other way and represent potential upside as we get those online and start to educate customers to book there  the same way they would here in Las Vegas or down in Orlando Hunter Keay    Wolfe Research    Analyst OK  Thank you  I appreciate it Maury Gallagher    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer You re welcome OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Darryl Genovesi from Vertical Research  Please go ahead Darryl Genovesi    Vertical Research    Analyst Hi  guys  Thanks for the time  Hey  John  On the Phase 2 stuff that you mentioned  I guess  what are the milestones in your Phase 1 plan that you d like to pass before you do take that Phase 2 plan to the board John Redmond    President I don t think we ve established any milestones when it comes to Phase 2  if you will  And the reason being is because Phase 2 doesn t add any additional room capacity  Those are metrics we would be monitoring in Phase 1 before pulling the trigger on doing anything that relates to rooms  These are just    when you look at a great level pool in a restaurant  they just added amenities and added traffic generators and added revenue producers  So the important part of it which is why we were looking at it first  is it finishes off the entire waterfront  So it takes any construction disruption that we would have had and tries to concentrate a lot of that during the current construction process  So again  it s a decision the board will make at some point in time in the future  But in order to be in a position to make that decision  there s all this groundwork that you need to do  So that s what s taking place right now with all that groundwork  But again  it s adding a pool and adding a restaurant  The pool that s currently in the resort project is on the rooftop of one of the buildings  So this would give us a rooftop pool and a grade level pool and be able to create additional charge points to be able to maximize the opportunity with these guests Darryl Genovesi    Vertical Research    Analyst OK  And then just a follow up on Andrew s  I know it s very early days  all the usual caveats  but the  185 baseline that you called out for your expectation  was that associated in some way with the specific mix of rooms and suites and counter routes that were actually booked  Or was that just a more general assumption for everything across the entire year  Again  I know it s not that  But just wondering  if you sort of look at this and conclude that ADR is running ahead adjusted for mix or if you sort of don t John Redmond    President Yes  This is a general one  And again  that s one that we modeled  boy  in the very first financial projections we ve put out there  had to be well over a year ago  maybe even closer to two years ago when we put that information out  We ve always said all along that when we are in a position where the board is making decisions  we wanted to be conservative in those rate assumptions even though the market is much stronger  And I think in the most recent Investor Day we had  we were pointing out just how strong those rates are in the marketplace  So while we re seeing a very strong rate  it is very early  but you could go out there and look at our inventory  I mean  that we ve posted rooms out there  as I said  from June of  21 through May of  22  and there s a complete    every single day and every single room has a posting for rooms and rates  So anyone who wants to go out there and look at it and pick their date  We have purposely priced below the market  which is one of those things that we had mentioned in the Investor Day that would be part of our strategy  It s just the market is so strong  Maury and I have always talked about that  That s what excited us about that market is just how high those room rates are there Darryl Genovesi    Vertical Research    Analyst OK  And then if I could just squeak in a quick third  When did you open booking John Redmond    President I want to say  like  right at the beginning of December  So  call it  either first week  week or two  And we ve been continuing to upgrade the site just based on things we re finding  but we find it s best    or in our best interest to get it out there as soon as we possibly can  It s kind of like soft opening a hotel where you sell just a small number of rooms early on to shake out a room  This gives us some early traffic to the site and allows us to get all of our analytic tools squared away  get all of our tweaking of the site  So we ve done several changes to the site since we launched it  and we have numerous changes that will continue to happen between now and opening and  most assuredly  even just between now and  call it  the end of the first half of this year Scott DeAngelo    Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer John  one quick add on comment that might be good to speak to as well is we certainly are talking about the hotel right now  like we think about the airline with the free and independent traveler  But the reality is there s a strong pipeline of group bookings  and groups  of course  tend to be higher margin business  less price sensitive than the individual will book much further ahead of time  And so I think in subsequent calls  there ll be updates on that  And the group has the ability to take a big chunk of hotel inventory for a set amount of time and start adding up really quickly when we think about the different customer audiences that will be booking Sunseeker John Redmond    President That s a very good point  And I think I mentioned before that we will be providing that level of insight as we go forward here  We have a lot of group leads  but we haven t booked a large group yet  We fully expect that that will happen before the year closes  And we expect to see quite a bit of that activity at the hotel  So that s a very  very lucrative and exciting piece of the business as we move forward Darryl Genovesi    Vertical Research
