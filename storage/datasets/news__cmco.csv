Zacks Investment Research Scoop Up Big Gains with 5 Stocks Enjoying Rising Cash FlowsCrunching profit numbers and evaluating surprises might appear a good option in this final stretch of the current reporting cycle  But looking beyond profits and evaluating a company s cash position can be far more rewarding  This is because  even though profit is a company s goal  cash is its lifeblood for existence and a measure of resiliency In fact  a dearth of cash flow can compel even a profit making company to face bankruptcy while meeting its obligations  However  a healthy cash position indicates that profits are being efficiently channelized to the company s reserves  which not only shield it from market mayhem but also offer flexibility to make decisions  chase potential investments and run its growth engine To find this efficiency  one needs to consider its net cash flow figure  While in any business cash moves in and out  it is net cash flow that explains how much money the company is actually generating If a company is experiencing a positive cash flow then it denotes an increase in its liquid assets  which gives it the means to meet debt obligations  shell out for expenses  reinvest in business  endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company s future growth  To ride on the growth curve  a company must have its cash flow increasing because that indicates management s efficiency in regulating its cash movements and less dependency on outside financing for running its business Therefore  keep yourself abreast with the

22526,244041,CMCO,Will Lower Revenues Hurt QUALCOMM s  QCOM  Q1 Earnings ,opinion,QUALCOMM Incorporated   NASDAQ QCOM   is scheduled to report first quarter fiscal 2019 financial results after the closing bell on Jan 30  In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8 4   Notably  Qualcomm surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  the average beat being 18 5  Headwinds related to Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  are likely to affect the chip maker s revenues in the to be reported quarter  Revenues from Qualcomm CDMA Technologies  QCT   which accounts for the lion s share of total revenues  and Qualcomm Technology Licensing  QTL  segments are estimated to decline year over year  Whether this will weigh on the quarterly earnings remains to be seen Factors at PlayDuring the fiscal first quarter  Qualcomm alongside Nokia  HE NOKIA  achieved over the air  OTA  5G NR data calls in the mmWave and sub 6 GHz spectrum bands  Notably  it was in compliance with the global 3GPP 5G NR Release 15 specification in Non Standalone mode  The successful OTA testing marked an important step for the probable commercial deployment of 5G services in 2019 In addition  Qualcomm unveiled its new processor   Snapdragon 855  This latest generation of mobile phone processor chips is expected to power 5G smartphones in the United States in 2019  The company expects the chip to appear in the first wave of 5G phones as this new platform supports  multi gigabit  download speeds on 5G networks  The key feature of Snapdragon 855 chip is a modem for phones to connect to 5G wireless data networks with mobile data speeds of up to 50 or 100 times faster than current 4G networks  Being the largest supplier of mobile phone chips  Qualcomm maintains a distinctive position in the mobile space  particularly in the United States  This should help it achieve its target of introducing Snapdragon 855 in most major flagship smartphones in 2019 During the quarter  a court in China ruled that Apple manufactured iPhones have infringed on two patents of Qualcomm  The judge issued an embargo on sales of some iPhone models in China  The Fuzhou Intermediate People s Court in China held Apple guilty of twin patent infringement and ordered an immediate ban on sales of older iPhone models  from the 6S through the X in the country Furthermore  Apple was held guilty of patent infringement in a German court  The District Court of Munich ordered a permanent injunction to the sale of some iPhone models in the country as these were found to infringe upon Qualcomm s intellectual property right for power savings in smartphones Top Line ContractionQualcomm expects growth  both on volume and improving mix of devices from its China business in fiscal 2019  particularly in the second half  However  the company s fiscal first quarter results are likely to be affected as Apple asked its contract manufacturers to stop paying royalty payments and decided to use Qualcomm s rival Intel s modem for its latest device  Qualcomm is expected to have shipped 185 million MSM chipsets during the quarter Qualcomm believes that more than 50  of the expected fiscal 2019 headwind related to Apple will be reflected in its fiscal first quarter results  while impacting its QCT business  As the year progresses  this will become less impactful to quarterly results  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the QCT is currently pegged at  3 806 million  It reported  4 651 million in first quarter fiscal 2018  The segment s income before taxes is expected to decline to  534 million from  955 million reported a year ago Revenues from the QTL are expected to decline to  1 051 million from  1 299 million  primarily due to continuity of nonpayment of royalties by Apple and the other licensee  The impact of these nonpayment has largely eliminated the seasonal effects in QTL business  For fiscal first quarter  the company considers the change in its share in Apple from approximately 50  modem share in first quarter fiscal 2018 to zero in the flagship launches in the to be reported quarter  The segment s income before taxes is expected to decline to  582 million from  887 million Consequently  total revenues for the quarter are likely to fall to  4 885 million from  6 068 million reported in the year earlier quarter  Adjusted earnings per share are pegged at  1 08  The company reported earnings of 98 cents a year ago What Our Model SaysDespite the impediments  our proven model shows that Qualcomm is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses both the two key components  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is exactly the case here as you will see below Earnings ESP  Qualcomm s Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  1 33  as the former is pegged at  1 09 and the latter at  1 08  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  QUALCOMM Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise   Zacks Rank  Qualcomm currently has a Zacks Rank  3  This increases the predictive power of ESP and makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Sprint Corporation   NYSE S   has an Earnings ESP of  13 33  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  Columbus McKinnon Corporation   NASDAQ CMCO   has an Earnings ESP of  6 90  and a Zacks Rank  2   ABIOMED  Inc    NASDAQ ABMD   has an Earnings ESP of  2 60  and a Zacks Rank  2 Zacks  Top 10 Stocks

22535,244050,CMCO,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include  ACM  K12  Vapotherm  Equity Commonwealth And Columbus McKinnon,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 5  2019   Stocks in this week s article are ACM Research  Inc    NASDAQ ACMR    K12 Inc    NYSE LRN    Vapotherm  Inc    NYSE VAPO    Equity Commonwealth   NYSE EQC   and Columbus McKinnon Corp    NASDAQ CMCO   New Analyst Coverage Puts the Spotlight on These 5 StocksCoverage initiation on a stock by analyst s  helps in interpreting information pertaining to capital markets  creating value for investors  Lack of information creates inefficiencies that might trigger misinterpretation of stocks  over  or under valued  In fact  coverage initiation usually depicts increased investor inclination  Investors  on their part  often assume that there is something in the stock that has attracted analyst attention  In other words  they believe that the company coming under the microscope definitely has some value Obviously  stocks are not arbitrarily chosen to cover  New coverage on a stock usually reflects an encouraging future envisioned by the analyst s   At times  increased investor focus on a stock motivates analysts to take a closer look at it Notably  the average change in broker recommendation is preferred over a single recommendation change How Does Analyst Coverage Influence Stock Price The price movement of a stock is generally a function of the recommendations on it from new analysts  Stocks typically see an upward price movement with a new analyst coverage compared to what they witness with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage  Positive recommendations   Buy and Strong Buy   generally lead to a significantly more positive price reaction than Hold recommendations  On the contrary  analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation Now  if an analyst gives a new recommendation on a company that has very few or no existing coverage  investors start paying more attention to it  Also  any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock So  it s a good strategy to bet on stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage over the last few weeks For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research may

22568,244083,CMCO,Spotify  Columbus McKinnon  GreenTree  American Outdoor And Entercom Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 27  2019    Spotify  NYSE SPOT  as the Bull of the Day  Columbus McKinnon Corp    NASDAQ CMCO   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on GreenTree Hospitality Group Ltd    NYSE GHG    American Outdoor Brands Corp    NASDAQ AOBC   and Entercom Communications Corp    NYSE ETM   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Shares of Spotify have surged 35  in the last three months and it crushed Q3 Wall Street estimates  posting surprise positive earnings  Spotify has also continued to expand its paid subscriber base in a crowded streaming music market and focused on new ways to grow Spotify s Playlist Spotify helped jump start the paid streaming music space back in 2008 that has helped reinvigorate a music industry that long feared illegal downloads would take over  In fact  streaming represents roughly 80  of recorded music sales  according to industry reports  and Spotify is the world s largest streaming music company Spotify beat Q3 2019 top and bottom line estimates at the end of October and reported adjusted earnings of   0 41 per share  which destroyed our Zacks estimate that called for a loss of   0 40 per share The streaming music powerhouse also posted its 8th consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow  And SPOT saw its total monthly active users jump 30  to 248 million  which outpaced the high end of its own guidance More importantly  the company s vital Premium Subscribers who pay monthly fees for ad free music surged 31  to 113 million  The growth was driven by the continued success of its  14 99 a month Family Plan and the  4 99 month Student Plans  This user expansion has helped curb some of Wall Street s worries that Spotify s much larger tech titan peers  including Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  would make things far harder on the much smaller firm Tech Giant Competition Apple Music has grown in popularity  but luckily for Spotify the iPhone giant hasn t tired to undercut its pricing models with both their individual premium plans coming in at  9 99 per month  Meanwhile  Amazon s premium streaming music service hasn t gained as much steam as Jeff Bezos might have hoped  Meanwhile  Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  and Pandora  owned by Sirius XM  NASDAQ SIRI   are part of a larger group of third tier players Overall  Spotify has been able to grow in the crowded and lucrative streaming music space compared to its rivals  Last quarter  Spotify said   relative to Apple  the publicly available data shows that we are adding roughly twice as many subscribers per month as they are  Additionally  we believe that our monthly engagement is roughly 2x as high and our churn is at half the rate   Spotify boasted similar claims about its superiority to Amazon Investors should also note that Spotify has invested heavily in its podcast business over the last year and it is now the second largest player in the growing market behind only Apple  SPOT plans to increase its podcast unit to help bring in more advertising dollars as the division only accounts for 10  of its ad revenue  It is worth noting that 90  of the company s total revenue currently comes from its non ad supported Premium business But the Stockholm headquartered firm s paid users still hear ads through podcasts that have ads as part of their own separate business model   We continue to see exponential growth in podcast hours streamed  up approximately 39  Q Q  and early indications that podcast engagement is driving a virtuous cycle of increased overall engagement and significantly increased conversion of free to paid users   Spotify wrote in prepared Q3 remarks Other FundamentalsSpotify went public in April of 2018 and found early success  Then SPOT stock fell from August 2018 until near the end of the year  Shares of SPOT are now up 34  in 2019  35  in the last 12 weeks  and 6  in the past month  all of which outpace the S P 500 s average climbs Clearly  Spotify is still a growth stock  with its valuation still pretty out of whack as it spends to expand  But Wall Street seems okay with its focus on expansion in a crowded and growing space  Meanwhile  SPOT holds a  B  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system and it is part of an industry that rests in the top 30  of our more than 250 Zacks industries Outlook   Earnings TrendsSpotify s Q4 fiscal 2019 revenue is projected to jump 22 6  to  2 09 billion  based on our current Zacks estimates  Spotify reports its sales in euros   Looking further ahead  SPOT s full year fiscal 2019 revenue is projected to surge roughly 28  to reach  7 56 billion  with 2020 projected to come in nearly 25  higher at  9 43 billion For reference  Spotify s full year fiscal 2018 revenue climbed 28 5   which shows that the firm s top line growth is expected to churn along at a solid pace At the bottom end of the income statement  the firm s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to tumble from   0 41 per share to   0 48  Plus  Spotify s full year earnings are expected to sink from   0 60 to   0 90 a share as it spends on expansion  Then  peeking ahead  SPOT s fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS figure is projected to improve significantly to a   0 50 loss We can also see just how much more positive Spotify s adjusted earnings outlook appears  The firm s full year fiscal 2019 estimate is up 50  in the last 60 days and 73  over this same stretch for 2020 Bottom LineSpotify s strong upward earnings revision trends help the firm earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  at the moment  SPOT does face tough competition  but growth focused tech investors might want to take a bite out of Spotify because of its ability to thrive in an industry that looks poised to expand for years to come  Columbus McKinnon Corp  fell short of our quarterly estimates last quarter and its CEO will step down after less than three years in the top spot  On top of that  Columbus McKinnon faces a near term downturn in the broader manufacturing and industrial sectors What s Going On Columbus McKinnon is a leading manufacturer of motion control products  technologies  systems  and services that help industrial focused firms of all shapes and sizes  efficiently and ergonomically move  lift  position  and secure materials   Its portfolio includes everything from light rail workstations to hoists The Buffalo  New York based firm is currently divesting some of its less profitable businesses  The company has also closed some of its facilities as part of its  80 20 Process   which aims to simplify its business  reduce its operating footprint  and more This has helped Columbus McKinnon improve its gross margin and management is confident in its longer term outlook  However  the company fell short our Q2 fiscal 2020 estimates in early November and it has been negatively impacted recently by  industrial market headwinds  higher medical costs  tariffs   and more Then  on December 11  the company announced that chief executive Mark Morelli would step down from his role  effective January 10  2020  to take over as CEO of Fortive s NewCo  The news took Wall Street by surprise because its stock tumbled roughly 11  in one day  CMCO s chairman Richard H  Fleming will step in as interim CEO until the company finds a replacement OutlookColumbus McKinnon s Q3 fiscal 2020 revenue is projected to slip 7 5  from the year ago period to reach  201 06 million  based on our current Zacks estimates  Looking further ahead  the firm s full year sales are expected to fall 5 8  in 2020 and another 0 35  in 2021 The company s bottom line is also expected to dip in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020  to the tune of  3 3  and  2 9   respectively  Plus  the charts above and below show investors that Columbus McKinnon s earnings outlook has trended in the wrong direction Bottom LineColumbus McKinnon s negative earnings revision activity helps it hold a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  right now  The firm is also part of an industry that rests in the bottom 10  of our more than 250 Zacks industries Plus  a transition at the top is never easy  but one that comes amid a business overhaul and a near term uncertain economic picture for the manufacturing space is even harder  Despite all of this  CMCO stock is up 32  in 2019 and 14  in the last three months and currently hovers right near its 52 week highs CMCO stock could be one to avoid for now based on its short term uncertainty  With that said  some investors might want to leave Columbus McKinnon on their watch list given some of its fundamentals 3 Beaten Down Consumer Stocks to Bounce Back in 2020The  sector is quite competitive and fragmented with companies vying for a bigger slice of the market on attributes such as price  products and speed to market  Undoubtedly  consumers remain the driving factor of the sector  An improving job scenario  rising wages and spiraling confidence are encouraging consumers to spend more  Falling interest rates have made borrowings cheaper for consumers Recently  the Commerce Department reported that consumer spending rose 0 4  at an annualized rate in November  the best rise since July  In fact  personal income increased 0 5  in November after rising 0 1  in October  Moreover  growth in income was strongest since August Americans continue to splurge  a tell tale sign that the economy is growing at a steady pace  As consumers continue to remain confident about their well being  it seems prudent to invest in stocks that are poised to grow on rising consumer spending However  one cannot ignore some facts  The sector has turned highly competitive  To gain market share  companies are constantly making investments to upgrade themselves and indulging in marketing as well as advertising activities  Again  the imposition of tariffs due to the U S  China trade war might hurt the near term results of some companies in this industry  Any increase in price may compel consumers to hold back their discretionary spending Considering the aforementioned factors  if investors are eager to lap up opportunities in this volatile and speculative sector  a prudent move would be to buy the beaten down stocks with encouraging fundamentals and solid earnings growth prospects  Here we have highlighted three stocks that have lost more than 10  year to date but still look well poised for 2020  These stocks carry a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   You can see  3 Prominent PicksInvestors can count on GreenTree Hospitality Group Ltd   a franchised hotel operator  This Zacks Rank  1 company has a long term earnings

22593,244108,CMCO,U S  Manufacturers To See A Strong Q1  5 Best Buys,opinion,U S  manufactures are expecting to witness a solid first quarter  as the sector is currently growing on the back of improving economic fundamentals  Consecutive upsurge in the major Purchasing Managers  Index  PMI  as well as greater number of jobs offered by manufacturing giants buoys further optimism Manufacturers Optimistic About Growth Prospects  Uptick in the key indices of the PMI in the latest Institute for Supply Management   ISM   report reveals that the manufacturing sector is poised for growth With the U S  economy gaining momentum  manufacturers have become optimistic that the manufacturing sector in first quarter 2018 will put up a stellar show The Conference Board Leading Economic

long awaited  1 5 trillion infrastructure plan provide an impetus to the upside Additionally  economic growth of emerging nations  firmer commodity prices in overseas markets and an uplift in global business confidence on account of a stable political environment are expected to improve U S  manufacturing activities   Manufacturing Activity StrengthensThe latest ISM report reveals that the PMI was pegged at 60 8  in February  an upside of 1 7  from January  The figure also surpassed the uppermost level of expansion recorded since 2004  A higher than 50 reading of the February PMI index reading undoubtedly verified that scale of economic activities is booming in the U S  manufacturing sector The manufacturing upturn is currently backed by growth in production activity  new orders and inventories  with struggling supply side conditions  The February data revealed that ISM s New Orders Index and Production Index were both above 60   signifying that production expansion persists amid

22627,244142,CMCO,Emerson  EMR  To Report Q4 Earnings  Is A Beat In The Cards ,opinion,"Emerson Electric Co    NYSE EMR   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Nov 7  In the quarter to be reported  the company is expected to report strong revenues in Industrial Automation business  which constitutes nearly two third of its total revenues 
Last quarter  the company s adjusted earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents  Ithas a decent earnings surprise history  with an average positive surprise of 5 5  in the trailing four quarters 
We expect Emerson to score an earnings beat in the to be reported quarter 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise  
Our proven model shows that Emerson has the right combination of the two key ingredients  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is perfectly the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Emerson has an Earnings ESP of  0 14  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Emerson Electric Company Price and EPS Surprise
   Zacks Rank  The company carries a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with a positive ESP  makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat 
Conversely  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions 
Factors Driving the Better than Expected Results 
Emerson is now poised to grow on the back of global infrastructure growth  as its core businesses hold dominant positions in markets tied to energy efficiency and infrastructure spending   Moreover  environmental regulations are driving the need for new products  adding to itsstrength  Going forward  Emerson believes telecommunications infrastructure demand will continue to be one of the strongest growth drivers 
The companyremains bullish on its Automation Solutions segment backed byfavorable trends in power and life sciences as well asimproving MRO spending by oil and gas customers  The company s focus on domains like human comfort  connected home  food quality  advancing energy efficiency at home and work and sustainability augur well for its Commercial and Residential Solutions segment  Furthermore  its restructuring efforts  undertaken over the past few quarters  are likely to prove conductive to its upcoming results 
Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Automation Solutions segment in the to be reported quarter currently remains high at  2 874 million compared with third quarter revenues of  2 440 million  This apart  the company s ardent eye for acquisitions is anticipated to be conducive to its core business  going forward  The company is likely to see growth on the recent GeoFields buyout  Other acquisitions including Pentair Valves   Controls  Locus Traxx and PakSense are expected to drive fourth quarter fiscal sales as well 
However  the fact remains that prolonged softness in the oil and gas markets is anticipated to affect both capital spending and operational expenditure of clients  which in turn may hurt Emerson s operations  Furthermore  a strong U S  dollar  volatile industrial spending  along withuncertainties in emerging and mature economies remain concerns 
Other Stocks to Consider
Here are some other companies that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Columbus McKinnon Corporation   NASDAQ CMCO   has an Earnings ESP of  4 76  and a Zacks Rank  1   You can see 
Deere   Company   NYSE DE   has an Earnings ESP of  0 71  and a Zacks Rank  2 
Rockwell Automation  Inc    NYSE ROK   has an Earnings ESP of  1 36  and a Zacks Rank  2

22659,244174,CMCO,Emerson  EMR  Secures Automation Systems   Services Contract,opinion,"Emerson Electric Co    NYSE EMR   recently clinched a  40 million automation systems and services contract for Novo Nordisk s drug manufacturing facility in Clayton  North Carolina  Per the contract  Novo Nordisk s biggest project   2 billion plant  will leverage Emerson s Project Certainty methodologies and automation technologies to fight the global diabetes epidemic    
The Deal
Under the deal  Novo Nordisk  CO NOVOb  will implement elements of Emerson s Project Certainty approach  which would trim down project complexity as well as meet its tight project schedule  The company s integrated portfolio of automation technologies and services  including Syncade manufacturing execution system and DeltaV distributed control system would help to reduce Novo Nordisk s project costs as well as accommodate late stage project changes  This apart  Emerson will also offer smart automation technologies including measurement instrumentation and valves 
Other Notable Contract Wins
Emerson has a solid history of winning valuable contracts in the energy infrastructure field that are conducive to its top line performance  Some notable contracts secured include a  20 million design build contract for an automation project from San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and a contract for Biomass Fueled Plant in United Kingdom  Such contract wins remain a key growth driver for the company 
Existing Business Scenario 
Emerson is well positioned to benefit from global infrastructure growth  as its core businesses hold dominant positions in markets tied to energy efficiency and infrastructure spending   Moreover  environmental regulations are driving the need for new products  adding to its strength  Going forward  Emerson believes telecommunications infrastructure demand will continue to be one of the strongest growth drivers 
Currently  the company remains optimistic about the prospects of Commercial   Residential Solutions segment as it has been witnessing improving trends in the U S  and Asian construction markets  Also  the company remains bullish on its Automation Solutions segment backed by favorable trends in power and life sciences as well as improving MRO spending by oil and gas customers  Furthermore  the company s restructuring efforts  undertaken over the past few quarters  are likely to benefit its upcoming results 
This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company has returned 5 2  in the past six months  outperforming the  s gain of 2 9  

Despite these positives  prolonged softness in the oil and gas markets has affected both capital spending and operational expenditure of clients  which in turn are hurting Emerson s operations  The company s Industrial Automation markets in North America have been extremely challenging and the improvements which Emerson anticipated did not materialize  thereby compunding the challenges 
Stocks to Consider 
Some better ranked stocks from the same space are Columbus McKinnon Corp    NASDAQ CMCO    Kennametal Inc    NYSE KMT   and Alamo Group  Inc    NYSE ALG    While Columbus McKinnon and Kennametal sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Alamo Group carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Columbus McKinnon has surpassed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise of 15 4  
Kennametal has outpaced estimates thrice in the preceding four quarters  with an average earnings surprise of 20 6  
Alamo Group has surpassed estimates twice in the trailing four quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise of 6 1

22661,244176,CMCO,5 Stocks With Recent Price Strength To Boost Your Portfolio,opinion,Investors always seek a winning strategy  However  finding such a strategy is easier said than done  When markets are shaken by widespread global growth concerns  it is difficult for even an insightful investor to come up with a foolproof approach No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are  equity market volatility will always manage to get the better of them  While a few lucky ones rake in the moolah  others fall victim to ad hoc strategies One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  However  even such investment choices bear the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could be stuck in a value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified So  wouldn t it be safer to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further Here s how to execute it One should primarily look for stocks that have recently been witnessing price increase  Actually  stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously moving higher  there must be a good reason for the rise or else it probably would have fallen like the losers  So  looking at stocks that have already won the game and are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set is rational However  recent price strength alone cannot create magic  so you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy Here s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners Screening Parameters Percentage Change in Price  4 Weeks  greater than zero  This criterion shows that the stock has moved higher in the last four weeks Percentage Change Price  12 Weeks  greater than 10 This indicates that the stock has seen momentum over the last three months  This lowers the risk of choosing stocks that may have drawn attention due to the overwhelming performance of the overall market in a very short period Zacks Rank 1 No matter whether market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  have a proven history of outperformance  You can see  Average Broker Rating 1 This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the stock s future performance Current Price greater than 5 The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 Current Price  52 Week High Low Range more than 85   This criterion filters stocks that are trading near their respective 52 week highs  It indicates that these are strong enough in terms of price Here are five of the 11 stocks that made it through this screen Daqo New Energy Corp    NYSE DQ   is engaged in the

22662,244177,CMCO,4 Stocks With Swelling Cash Flows To Boost Your Portfolio,opinion,Cash is most indispensable to any company  It gives a company the flexibility to make decisions  chase potential investments and run its growth engine Obviously  investors flock to companies that earn profits  but even a profitable business can succumb to failure if its cash flow is uneven and eventually file for bankruptcy  However  a company s resilience can be effectively judged by evaluating its efficiency in generating cash flows  as cash not only guards a company from market mayhem but also indicates that profits are being channelized in the right direction  It is  in fact  the indicator of its true financial health To understand efficiency  one needs to consider a company s net cash flow  In any business  cash moves in and out  It is net cash flow that explains how much money the company is actually making  Experiencing a positive cash flow denotes an increase in the company s liquid assets  This provides the means to meet debt obligations  shell out for expenses  reinvest in business  endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  positive cash flow alone is not sufficient to predict a company s future growth  Consistent growth can only be achieved by a company when this positive cash flow is increasing because this improvement indicates management s efficiency in regulating its cash movements and lesser dependency on external financing sources for running its business As a result  while picking stocks  go beyond profits and make sure to look for companies with dependable and increasing cash flows

22664,244179,CMCO,Bet On 4 Leading Stocks With Increasing Cash Flows,opinion,Achieving profit is no doubt a company s goal  but having a healthy cash flow is imperative to its existence  development

cash flow that explains how much money the company is actually making  Experiencing a positive cash flow denotes an increase in the company s liquid assets  This provides the means to meet debt obligations  shell out for expenses  reinvest in business  endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company s future growth  To ride on the growth curve  a company must have its cash flow increasing because that indicates management s efficiency in regulating its cash movements and less dependency on outside financing for running its business As a result  while

22665,244180,CMCO,Zacks com Featured Highlights  SORL Auto Parts  Broadcom  POSCO And Columbus McKinnon,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 14  2017   Stocks in this week s article SORL Auto Parts  Inc    NASDAQ SORL    Broadcom Limited   NASDAQ AVGO    POSCO   NYSE PKX   and Columbus McKinnon Corporation   NASDAQ CMCO   Bet on 4 Leading Stocks with Increasing Cash FlowsAchieving profit is no doubt a company s goal  but having a healthy cash flow is imperative to its existence  development and success  And why not  Even a company generating profits succumbs to failure and faces bankruptcy while meeting its obligations if it has a dearth of cash flow  But one can efficiently tide over any market mayhem if it has the cash to shield it Indeed  cash is the lifeblood of any business and indicates a company s true financial health  It offers the flexibility to make decisions  the means to make potential investments and the fuel to run its growth engine To understand this efficiency  one needs to consider a company s net cash flow  In any business  cash moves in and out  It is net cash flow that explains how much money the company is actually making  Experiencing a positive cash flow denotes an increase in the company s liquid assets  This provides the means to meet debt obligations  shell out for expenses  reinvest in business  endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  having a positive cash flow merely does not secure a company s future growth  To ride on the growth curve  a company must have its cash flow increasing because that indicates management s efficiency in regulating its cash movements and less dependency on outside financing for running its business As a result  while picking stocks  go beyond profits and make sure to look for companies with dependable and increasing cash flows For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research may own or

this week s article include AppFolio  Inc  NASDAQ   NASDAQ APPF       Columbus McKinnon Corporation  NASDAQ   NASDAQ CMCO       Concert Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ   NASDAQ CNCE       Aceto Corporation  NASDAQ   NASDAQ ACET      and Liberty Media Corporation  NASDAQ   NASDAQ FWONA      5 Stocks to Bet on with New Analyst CoverageAs analysts are one of the most important information intermediaries in capital markets  initiation of coverage by them creates value for companies It is to be borne in mind that that the lack of consistency in information creates inefficiencies that might result in the interpretation of stocks  over  or under valued   Thus  initiation of coverage by analysts offers critical information on a stock which is of great value to investors Coverage initiation on a stock by analyst s  usually depicts increased investor inclination  Investors  on their part  often assume that there is something in the stock that has attracted analyst attention  In other words  they believe that the company coming under the radar definitely has some value which can be tapped into Obviously  stocks are not arbitrarily chosen to cover  New coverage on a stock usually reflects an encouraging future envisioned by the analyst s   At times  increased investor focus on a stock motivates analysts to take a closer look at it However  we have noticed that the average change in broker recommendation is preferred over a single recommendation change Analyst Coverage   Price MovementInterestingly  the price movement is generally a function of the recommendations from new analysts  Stocks typically see an upward price movement with a new analyst coverage compared to what they witness with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage  Positive recommendations   Buy and Strong Buy   generally lead to a significantly positive price reaction than Hold recommendations  On the contrary  analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation Now  if an analyst issues a new recommendation on a company that has limited or no existing coverage  investors start paying more attention to it  Also  any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock So  it s a good strategy to bet on stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage over the last few weeks Screening CriteriaNumber of Broker Ratings now greater than the Number of Broker Ratings four weeks ago  This will shortlist stocks that have recent new coverage  Average Broker Rating less than Average Broker Rating four weeks ago   Less than  means  better than  four weeks ago  Increased analyst coverage and improving average rating are the primary criteria of this strategy but one should consider other relevant parameters to make the strategy foolproof Here are the other screening parameters Price greater than or equal to  5  as a stock below  5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors  Average Daily Volume greater than or equal to 100 000 shares  if volume isn t enough  it will not attract individual investors  Here are five of the nine stocks that passed the screen AppFolio  Inc   NASDAQ

file for bankruptcy  However  one can effectively judge a company s resilience by looking at its efficiency in generating cash flows  Because cash not only shields a company from market mayhem but also indicates that profits are being channelized in the right direction To find out the efficiency of a company  one needs to consider its net cash flow  While  in any business  cash moves in and out  it is net cash flow that explains how much money the company is actually generating A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company s liquid assets  which provide the means to meet debt obligations  shell out for expenses  reinvest in business  endure downturns and finally return wealth to shareholders  On the other hand  negative cash flow indicates a decline in the company s liquidity and in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  positive cash flow alone is not sufficient to predict a company s growth  A company can competently grow only when this positive cash flow is rising  because this improvement indicates management s efficiency in regulating its cash movements and lesser dependency on external financing sources for running its business So  while picking stocks  look beyond profits and select companies with dependable and increasing cash flows Screening ParametersTo find stocks that have seen increasing cash flow over time  we ran the screen for those whose cash flow in the latest reported quarter was at least equal to or greater than the 5 year average cash flow per common share  This implies a positive trend and increasing cash over a period of time In addition to this we chose Zacks Rank 1  No matter whether market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  have a proven history of outperformance  You can see  Average Broker Rating 1  This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the company s future performance Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This sieves out low priced stocks  of B or better  This score is also of great assistance in selecting stocks  Importantly  this scoring system helps in picking winning stocks in their individual industry

New Analyst CoverageAs analysts are the most important information intermediaries in capital markets  initiation of coverage by them offers critical information on a stock which is of great value to investors Coverage initiation of a stock by analyst s  usually portrays higher investor inclination  Investors  on their part  often assume there is something special in a stock to attract analysts  attention  In other words  they believe that the company coming under coverage definitely has some value Obviously  stocks are not randomly chosen to cover  New coverage usually reflects a reassuring future envisioned by the analyst s   At times  increased investors  focus on a stock motivates analysts to take a closer look at it  After all  who doesn t love to produce something that is already in demand  Hence  we often find that analysts  ratings on newly added stocks are more favorable than their ratings on continuously covered stocks It is worth mentioning here that the average change in broker recommendation is always preferred over a single recommendation change Impact on Price MovementThe price movement of a stock is the function of the recommendations on it from new analysts  Typically  stocks see an upward price movement on new analyst coverage compared to what was witnessed with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage  Positive recommendations   Buy and Strong Buy   generally lead to a significantly positive price reaction than Hold recommendations  On the contrary  analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation Meanwhile  investors start paying more attention to the stock  that has very few or no existing coverage  on which an analyst provides a new recommendation  Also  any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock Below  we have selected five stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage over the last few weeks Screening CriteriaNumber of Broker Ratings now greater than the Number of Broker Ratings four weeks ago  This will shortlist stocks that have recent new coverage  Average Broker Rating less than Average Broker Rating four weeks ago   Less than  means  better than  four

the other screening parameters Price greater than or equal to  5  as a stock below  5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors  Average Daily Volume greater than or equal to 100

The key drivers leading to the cost reductions include realigning the overall cost structure  consolidating sales offices and call centers  and optimizing the manufacturing footprint  This will lead to an expansion of the operating margin Further  the company s breakthrough Klear Can technology will be a game changer given its edge over traditional metal clans  Additionally  given that demand for a diverse range of finished plastic products is on the rise in many markets  Milacron is well poised to capitalize on this growth considering its strong global presence 
The company has made significant investments in China and India  noting the projected growth rates of the plastic business in these markets  Milacron plans to continue expanding its manufacturing capabilities  while also enhancing technical  marketing and sales efforts On the flipside  In the Advanced Plastic Processing Technologies segment  pricing pressure remains a headwind driven by a combination of the competitive  low growth environment in North America as well as broader commodity deflationary headwinds  The Melt Delivery and Control Systems  MDCS  segment will remain fairly stable sequentially  though the timing of results may be difficult to predict as the business is fairly short cycle and customer deferrals may increase if uncertainty regarding the business cycle mounts Another point of concern is that approximately 50  of Milacron s sales were attributable to operations outside the United States  Thus  considerable changes in the value of the Canadian dollar  Euro  Chinese yuan renminbi and Indian rupee compared to the U S  dollar could have an adverse effect on Milacron s financial condition and operation results Milacron currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the sector include Johnson Controls International plc   NYSE JCI    Columbus McKinnon Corp    NASDAQ CMCO    and ACCO Brands Corp    NYSE ACCO    While Johnson Controls International sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Columbus McKinnon and ACCO Brands carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see Confidential from ZacksBeyond this Analyst Blog  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ",2016-09-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/milacron-(mcrn)-poised-to-grow-despite-segmental-concern-200153821,200153821

22791,244306,CMCO,5 Industrial Stocks To Buy As Output Revs Up,opinion,Industrial production in the U S  climbed at the fastest pace in more than a year in April  led by advances in utilities and factory output  This is a telltale sign that the country s manufacturing slump is probably over and the economy has started the second quarter on a solid note  Even though expansion at the ISM factory index was a bit uninspiring in April  it did show broad based growth that includes almost all types of producers  And let s not forget that this came after the Index s first expansion in six months in March Banking on these positive indications  it will be wise to invest in stocks related to the industrial sector  The sector  which had hit a rough patch at the beginning of the year due to weak commodity prices and a stronger dollar  is in a much better health now  And the reasons are clear   oil prices have rebounded of late and the dollar has largely weakened against a bunch of major currencies Industrial Production Climbs U S  industrial production advanced 0 7  in April after declining in the two preceding months  according to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  This marks the highest climb for a single month since Nov 2014 Output at utilities soared almost 6  in April  driven by higher demand for electricity and natural gas  This increase in utility output last month turned out to be the biggest gain in more than nine years  A return to normal temperature in April following a rather warmer than usual March was cited to be the primary reason behind this surge Factory output also went up 0 3  last month after declining at the same pace in March  This biggest component of overall production and a good measure of the economy s health moved north as demand for big ticket items including machinery and cars picked up in April  Automotive production increased 1 3  in April  in contrast to the 1 4  drop in March  This is very much in line with the industrial data  U S  light vehicle sales increased 3 5  year over year to 1 51 million units in Apr 2016  April sales pulled up SAAR to 17 42 million units from 16 56 million units in Mar 2016 and 16 77 million units in Apr 2015 Both utility and manufacturing output increased 0 4  over the year in April  Meanwhile  capacity utilization that shows how much industries are gaining as a share of potential output also ticked up in April   Capacity utilization rose to 75 4  in April from 74 9  in March ISM Manufacturing Index Continues to ExpandThe ISM manufacturing index did slip a bit in April  but still continued to expand  According to Supply Management  the index of manufacturing activity came in at 50 8 in April  while in March the reading was 51 8  A reading above 50 for two straight months indicates continuous expansion  Moreover  15 of the 18 manufacturing sectors have reported growth last month  the most since Feb 2013  making a strong case for the industrial sector New Orders and the Production index all came in above the 50 mark  Producers of apparel  paper  wood products  plastics and metals said that new orders grew  The measure of production  on the other hand  saw expansion in 15 industries  the most since Sept 2014  Demand for goods also seemed to have increased among overseas customers  The ISM s index of export goods went up in April to touch its highest level since Nov 2014 5 Solid Industrial Stocks to Add to Your PortfolioThe battered U S  factory sector has shown signs of acceleration with industrial production in April jumping the most since Nov 2014  Another major indicator  the ISM factory index  has not only expanded in the last two months  but it also showed that the number of industries reporting an increase in orders and production have more than doubled since the beginning of this year Three month slumps in dollar along with U S  crude hitting a seven month high are also welcome news for the industrial sector  During the start of the year  a stronger dollar had depressed demand for U S  exports  while low oil prices adversely affected energy companies Given that the industrial goods sector is showing signs of life  investing in stocks from this sector will be a prudent choice  We have selected five stocks from the sector that possess a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  and have also gained considerably in
