160491,382007,BBBY,Bed Bath   Beyond s Q3 Was Every Bit as Bad as You Thought it Would Be,news,"Now we know why new Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  CEO Mark Tritton swung a chainsaw through the executive offices last month  The home goods retailer s fiscal third quarter earnings report was a disaster  with sales and earnings coming in even worse than expected 
Not that it was ever looking very good  but Bed Bath   Beyond reporting sales down 9  in the quarter and opening up a huge loss doesn t bode well for the retailer 

A portent of things to come
Almost immediately after taking over the CEO role  Tritton cleaned out the C suite by ousting six executives who were responsible for leading the retailer s turnaround  As it happened right before Christmas  it suggested the holiday period wasn t going well 
It underscored just how bad things were when it announced earlier this week that it was selling half of its real estate to a private equity firm in a bid to raise cash  While it will lease back the property from Oak Street Real Estate Capital under long term leases  Bed Bath   Beyond s sudden need to infuse its financials with  250 million in cash  while at the same time lightening its balance sheet by shedding assets  showed how much it s struggling 
A very ugly quarter
That was borne out by its earnings report that saw net sales fall 9  to  2 76 billion as comparable store sales plunged 8 3  in the quarter  It marks the fifth consecutive year third quarter comps have fallen    the last time Bed Bath   Beyond saw positive comps for the period was back in 2014    and worse for the retailer  the declines are now accelerating  with each succeeding quarter getting progressively worse 
Comps were down 6 7  in the second quarter and 6 6  in the first  A year ago they were down just 1 8   so it seems things are spiraling out of control now  and even on the digital front sales were down by mid single digit percentages 
The quarter s net loss was  38 6 million  or  0 31 per share  and that included a benefit it received from having marked down the value of inventory it held  In comparison  last year it reported a profit of  24 4 million  or  0 18 per share  though that also had a one off benefit baked in from the sale of a building  
Eliminating both of those one time events  Bed Bath   Beyond reported losses of  0 38 per share versus a profit of  0 02 per share a year ago 
Big ideas on the horizon
While the new CEO is still getting his sea legs for the wildly listing retailer  the plan discussed during the earnings conference call to get the ship righted again doesn t offer much more than platitudes to fixing the business 
Tritton outlined five broad  pillars  that would be tackled  but it was more catchy phrasing and alliteration than anything an investor could focus on  He told analysts Bed Bath   Beyond would be focusing on product  pricing  promise  place  and people  and said more details would follow in the spring 
Although Tritton said the previous turnaround plan was solid  assurances that it was making progress obviously were premature  so he will need some time to put his own stamp on the company  Still  without anything definitive to go on  investors shouldn t count on these broad ideas to make a difference 
The retailer is certainly not hopeful change will happen soon and said the pressures it s faced so far will continue at least through the fiscal fourth quarter  But things were so bad  and because big changes need to be made  it has withdrawn its full year outlook 
But first  more pain to come
As Tritton noted  Bed Bath   Beyond still has substantial brand value  and it owns incredible mind share with consumers  The problem is that the retailer is no longer relevant to how customers shop  and between mass merchandisers and online retailers both targeting the space  there has been nothing to allow Bed Bath   Beyond to stand out 
That he recognizes this and wants to make big changes in how the retailer responds is notable and worthwhile  but whether Bed Bath   Beyond has taken on too much water at this point is the big question  
We ll likely see more real estate sold off  and there are store closings coming  though 20 less than originally planned as the company wants to use those locations to get rid of inventory over the first half of the coming year  They ll likely be put back on the chopping block once they serve their purpose 
That means there is still a lot of air below Bed Bath   Beyond  and the big drop its stock suffered after the markets closed following the earnings report is probably not where we will see the retailer finally settle ",2020-01-11,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pgtl7,2057437
160492,382008,BBBY,Bed Bath   Beyond Proves It s Still a Value Trap  Not a Value,news,"The 2019 holiday shopping season is a wrap  and early indications are that the American consumer is not only alive and well but spending generously  Through November  the U S  Census Bureau reported a 3 2  rise in retail sales over 2018  and initial reports from the likes of Amazon indicate that the busy post Thanksgiving period could set new records  
There is no such cheer at Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY   though  and it isn t just an inability to get the right formula of digital and brick and mortar store presence that s the problem  Though it was late to the e commerce party when it got serious about pursuing that channel a few years ago  it has made strides in modernizing its selling methods  Rather  it would seem in an ever competitive retail world  shoppers are opting for merchandisers with a broader assortment of items    both online and in store  The company s fiscal 2019 third quarter report proves once again this is no value stock waiting to make a quick turnaround 
There s this one concession    
First  though  it s worth noting that Bed Bath   Beyond shares had rallied almost 140  at one point from the lows hit in the late summer of 2019  There s been optimism that new CEO Mark Tritton    former chief merchandise officer at resurgent Target    will be able to right the ship  Plus  until just recently  the home goods store was still profitable  

That has changed  however  as even Target s former rock star isn t going to provide a quick fix  Third quarter sales fell 9  year over year  and operating losses steepened to  29 8 million compared with operating income of  49 5 million a year ago  While the results for 2019 to date are somewhat muddied by total impairment charges of  441 million taken so far  results are nevertheless trending in the wrong direction   

 Excluding  441 million of impairment charges  PP   percentage point  Data source  Bed Bath   Beyond   
Further clouding the situation is the withdrawal of full year 2019 guidance  It s a necessary move  given the changes Tritton is making and the uncertainty of the holiday sales picture after the weak lead up to that important period  Tritton s plan for the future will be forthcoming in the next few months  However necessary  though  stock markets hate the unknown  
Buyers beware
At this point  with shares having retreated about 15  after the third quarter report card  Bed Bath   Beyond may appear cheap  Shares trade for just 6 6 times trailing 12 month free cash flow  and just 10 8 times one year forward earnings  But that forward metric would imply there are earnings to be had  a prospect that is looking increasingly unlikely in the near term  
Not even a 4 2  dividend yield should be enough at this point  As I ve said for some time  money spent on dividends and share repurchases are probably better spent on fixing the slide in operations  And what is that fix  For one thing  differentiation as a hybrid physical digital home goods store specialty company  and less of an assortment that makes Bed Bath   Beyond a quasi department store  According to the U S  Census Bureau  the department store segment of retail is down again this year    this time falling 5 4  compared with 2018   
Until it can distance itself from the current situation  the stock still looks like a value trap to me  As the saying goes  things will get worse before they can get better  That s likely to be true for Bed Bath   Beyond if it s to make a real turnaround ",2020-01-12,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pg-6t,2057536
160493,382009,BBBY,Can Bed Bath   Beyond Solve its Problems by Selling its Stores ,news,"Bed Bath   Beyond s  NASDAQ BBBY  stock recently plunged after the retailer delivered dismal third quarter numbers  Its revenue fell 9  annually to  2 76 billion  missing estimates by  90 million  as its comparable store sales slid 8 3   Its adjusted net loss widened from  2 7 million to  46 9 million  or  0 38 per share    which missed expectations by a whopping  0 40  It also withdrew its prior full year guidance and didn t provide updated figures  claiming that CEO Mark Tritton    who took the top job last November    needed more time to  assess the business and finalize the details  of its new strategies and the  extensive senior leadership changes  over the past month 

Tritton s long term turnaround plans include clearing out the retailer s excess inventories with mass promotions instead of coupons  replacing those products with new ones to regain market share in home goods  expanding its e commerce platform  and selling roughly half its real estate portfolio to a private equity firm 
Let s take a closer look at Tritton s real estate strategy  which could generate the most visible near term effects  and whether or not it can solve Bed Bath   Beyond s bigger issues 
What did Bed Bath   Beyond sell 
Bed Bath   Beyond sold approximately 2 1 million square feet of commercial space  including an unspecified number of retail stores  a distribution facility  and corporate office space  to an affiliate of Oak Street Real Estate Capital for over  250 million 
Bed Bath   Beyond won t abandon those properties  instead  it will continue occupying them with long term leases  This strategy  which we ve seen employed by other struggling retailers like Macy s and J C  Penney before  frees up cash for Bed Bath   Beyond s other turnaround plans 
That cash won t appear on Bed Bath   Beyond s balance sheet until its fourth quarter report  Its cash and investments fell 8  annually to  920 million in the third quarter  while its long term debt stood nearly unchanged at  1 49 billion    so  250 million in fresh cash would certainly give it more breathing room 
However  selling and leasing back properties is a double edged sword  It injects some quick cash  but it also burdens the retailer with recurring lease expenses which could offset any gains generated by its turnaround plans 

What does the management believe 
During last quarter s conference call  Tritton stated that the sale marked  the first step toward unlocking valuable capital in our business  which can  amplify our plans to build a stronger and more efficient company to support revenue growth  financial stability  and shareholder value  
Tritton stated that the proceeds would be reinvested in the company s core business to drive growth  fund share buybacks  or reduce its outstanding debt    but noted that the specifics  remain under review   Tritton also noted that the company  continues to evaluate  potential ways to monetize its remaining real estate 
Out of those strategies  pursuing growth will likely take precedence over buybacks or reducing debt  Bed Bath   Beyond s comps declines worsened over the past year  and its gross margins are still being throttled by aggressive promotions 

Source  Bed Bath   Beyond quarterly reports 
Buybacks will likely be the lowest priority  since Bed Bath   Beyond caught falling knives with its previous buyback plans  It only spent  1 2 million on buybacks during the third quarter  and it should repurchase even fewer shares until its outlook improves 
Buying some time    but not any solutions
Bed Bath   Beyond s real estate sales don t solve any problems on their own  They merely buy the retailer more time and breathing room for its turnaround efforts 
For now  many of its core problems remain  It faces brutal competition from Amazon  IKEA  Walmart and Tritton s former employer Target  Its stores are too large  its inventories are too high  and it s running its Beyond  membership plan at a loss 
A few flickers of life appeared in the third quarter  including 7 1  comps growth during the five day holiday shopping week between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday  but most of that growth was driven by margin crushing promotions  Selling its stores will unlock some capital  but I m not convinced that it s enough cash to fund a full blown turnaround yet ",2020-01-14,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/phw0k,2059038
160495,382011,BBBY,Bed Bath   Beyond Outlines Its Path Forward,news,"Investors were bracing for bad earnings news from Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  but were still shocked by Wednesday s reporting  The specialty retailer announced weak third quarter sales and a  30 million operating loss  The executive team  which just recently stepped in to lead the company  asked for investor patience as it completes its transformation plan over the next few months  Yet shareholders were stunned to hear the chain withdraw its 2019 outlook while it works on that rebound 
In a conference call with Wall Street analysts  new CEO Mark Tritton and his team explained the challenge ahead while maintaining that a full recovery is possible  Below are some highlights from that presentation 

Not going according to plan

These results are unsatisfactory and underscore the imperative for change and strengthen our sense of priorities and purpose 
  Tritton

The consumer company noted customer traffic strength during the core shopping period encompassing Black Friday  The calendar shift around the holidays resulted in a difficult comparison with the prior year period  too  After this move is adjusted for  the reported 8  decline in comparable store sales turns into a more modest 4  slump 
Yet management was clear that demand weakness during the wider third quarter period was worse than expected  Tritton said the chain s poor showing  including its falling traffic and 1 percentage point decline in adjusted gross profit margin  demonstrated that major changes are required to put the business on a path to achieving any kind of stable long term earnings growth 
The foundation for growth

We have a clear mandate to reestablish our authority as the preferred omni channel home destination 
  Tritton

Citing consumer research results that show a strong awareness of and affinity for the Bed Bath   Beyond brand  executives said the chain has a  tremendous opportunity  to grow in the massive home goods retailing category  That s not happening today  for several reasons including competitive encroachment by mass retailers like Walmart and Target 
In fact  without naming these companies specifically  Tritton suggested that Bed Bath   Beyond s best path back to growth involves mimicking their successful transitions into multichannel selling   We will be leaning into the digital space to make it easier and more convenient for our customers to shop with us   he explained   including quickly evolving     to a full  buy online  pick up in store  model during the first half of fiscal 2020  
Steps forward

We re experiencing short term pain  some of which has been self inflicted 
  Tritton

Executives believe market share losses and earnings pressure will continue at least into the fourth quarter  in part due to execution issues around inventory management and the lack of robust digital shopping options  That cloudy operating situation is occurring at the same time as major upheaval at the top ranks of the business tied to last month s departure of six senior level executives  Together  these issues threaten Bed Bath   Beyond s short term trends so significantly that management decided to pull its 2019 financial guidance 
That s a drastic step that implies more difficult sales and earnings results over the next few months  meaning shareholders won t have much good news to cling to between now and the company s scheduled update on its transformation plan  set for some time in the spring ",2020-01-14,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/phy1e,2059174
160496,382012,BBBY,Can Bed Bath   Beyond Orchestrate a Turnaround Any Time Soon ,news,"Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  reported another dismal quarter  There was everything to dislike about the latest results    a 9 0  year over year fall in revenue and bottom line losses for the quarter  Adjusted comparable sales declined 3 6  year over year  while the company s long term debt remained stubbornly high at  1 49 billion  despite the  250 million cash infusion from a recent real estate sale and leaseback transaction 
The company s share price has also tumbled from a high of  73 per share back in Jan  2015 to around  15 as of this writing  However  the question is  Are investors throwing out the baby along with the bathwater  Could there be latent value in Bed Bath   Beyond s brand and reputation 
Recognizing the need to stem the bleeding  the company appointed a new CEO  Mark Tritton  last November to realign the business and restart its growth engine  Tritton comes with strong credentials  As former Chief Merchandising Officer at Target  he was instrumental in helping the retailer regain its footing with a focus on private label offerings  But the task at hand seems daunting as Bed Bath   Beyond faces a severe crisis  Tritton himself admitted that the company has a persistent lack of purpose and has not been able to connect with younger consumers in its various product categories 
With such a challenge ahead  can Bed Bath   Beyond pull off a turnaround 

Five pillar strategy
Tritton has wasted no time articulating his  go forward  strategy for improving performance at the company  It revolves around five pillars  product  price  promise  place  and people 
For product  the aim is to refine the company s massive catalogue and inventory list  focusing on what people actually desire  Many organizations need such curation in order to figure out what s important  rather than letting inventory just pile up  This may mean more near term headaches in the coming months  though  with almost  200 million of inventory writedowns recorded in the fiscal second quarter and another  350 million worth of inventory removed from stores before the holiday season 
As for price  the company needs to define what constitutes value at a given price point and make it compelling for the customer  Poor pricing decisions commonly result in lost sales and missed opportunities 
Management s promise comes in the form of deepening relationships with customers in order to strengthen loyalty and encourage repeat purchases  The company s Beyond Plus membership program now has 1 4 million members and growing this will be key to improving sales over time  though it comes at the cost of an unfavorable impact on gross margin 
To address place  the company will work on building up its digital capabilities in order to become an  omni always  retailer  And in terms of people  Mark is currently searching for suitable candidates to take over key roles after shaking up five key management positions 
Turnarounds need patience and time
The five pillar strategy sounds comprehensive as it covers many critical aspects of what s gone wrong with the company  However  investors need to know that for any turnaround strategy to work  time and patience are necessary  Management will have to execute its plans  collate the data  and tweak initiatives in case they re not working 
Tritton has also shared that more details of each pillar will be revealed at an upcoming investor day in Spring 2020  As he has just taken the reins in November  perhaps investors are expecting too much in too short a time  After all  proper turnarounds from such a weak position often take at least two to three years  if not more 
There are several bright spots  though  amid the raft of bad numbers  A recent brand health tracker study still places Bed Bath   Beyond in the No  1 position in terms of brand awareness for the housewares and home goods category  An impressive 79  of customers continue to have a favorable impression of the brand  suggesting strong potential for sales growth if the company manages to connect with this group 
And though comparable sales were down in the fiscal third quarter overall  they were up 7 1  year over year for the five day period from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday  In fact  both the physical and digital channels were up over 5  and 13   respectively 
So a turnaround is possible as Bed Bath   Beyond s mindshare remains high  but the going will be tough in the coming quarters  and investors who hold faith in the new leadership should buckle up for a rough ride ahead ",2020-01-17,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pj9qb,2061875

So with that in mind  let s start with the Semiconductor ETF  NYSE SMH   After a doji week last week  this week we had a bearish engulfing pattern 
That means that after squeaking out a new all time high  SMH closed in the lower end of the trading range for the week  A move under 139 77  this  ast week s low  should be duly noted as possible exhaustion 
2  Transportation

3  Small Caps
The Russell 2000 ETF  NYSE IWM  appears more like a gentle correction than a top  need I remind you that it continues to lag way behind the S P 500 
4  Retail
After news of Macy s  NYSE M   Pier 1  NYSE PIR  closing stores along with Bed Bath   Beyond s  NASDAQ BBBY  earnings woes  brick and mortar is our weakest link   Until Retail ETF  NYSE XRT  can make a stand over 46 00  we look at this as the slowing economy broadcast 
5  Biotechnology
The weekly chart for Biotechnology ETF  NASDAQ IBB  shows a classic middle finger formation  Unless it clears 122  that could mean lower levels  Furthermore  it could signal the coming end of the market euphoria

As equities have become hot enough to start a forest fire  with this correction  we may have smoked out the bears from hibernation  Nevertheless  bears ought to take heed so they do not get burned again

160499,382015,BBBY,Bed Bath   Beyond s Turnaround Plan Is More Than Mere Buzzwords,news,"There s an old adage within business circles   A goal without a plan is just a wish   It s a poke at business leaders who fall into the trap of painting a compelling picture of the future with powerful words but fail to lay out the specific steps needed to reach those lofty goals 
It s possible this stumbling block was a contributing factor to the 20  plunge Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  shares dished out a week ago following its earnings report  Yes  same store sales fell 8 3  year over year  and the retailer swung from a per share profit of  0 02 last year to a loss of  0 38 for the quarter in question  It may have been the lack of clarity regarding new CEO Mark Tritton s turnaround plan  however  that did much of the damage 
In short  the company is going to focus on  product  price  promise  place  and people  going forward  which is smart but obvious  As Envista s retail consulting director Zac Zalowitz put it to RetailWire   This is a  yeah  duh  approach  
There s more to Bed Bath   Beyond s plan than a catchy slogan  however  even if Tritton didn t detail it  much  during the conference call  One just has to connect the dots and read between the lines to see it 

What Tritton actually said
Bed Bath   Beyond s CEO fleshed out the company s  five pillars  in more than five words during the third quarter earnings call but admittedly still didn t provide much in the way of detail  From the transcript 

Regarding our go forward strategy  we ll be grounded in the following five pillars  First  our product  We ll refine and amplify an exciting omnichannel assortment that rebuilds authority and preference for Bed Bath   Beyond and creates energy through differentiation and curation  Second  our price  We ll invest in and clarify compelling value through more choice at opening price points  relevant own brands  and clear price communications       Third is our promise  We will clarify and deepen our relationship with our customers by connecting  engaging  and motivating them to strengthen loyalty and lifetime value  Fourth is our place  We will accelerate and optimize connecting with  inspiring  and energizing our customer by becoming a truly omni always retailer       And lastly but critically important is our people who create and sustain a talent engine and culture that attracts  retains  and develops high performing teams who consistently deliver operational excellence and business results 

You get the idea    lots of action and buzzwords  but in practical terms  what does any of that really mean  We may already have our answers  even if they weren t part of his discussion 
Three of the five pillars don t require much in the way of exploring  The people in question start  and largely end  with replacing the six executives removed in December who presumably had been standing in the way of a turnaround  As for price  that also speaks for itself  By  opening price points   Tritton meant consumers can expect more value minded options that compete with options found online  The promise piece of the plan is an acknowledgement that the company s prime customers had slowly been alienated 
The two others    product and place    are arguably the most important pillars of the turnaround plan  Each deserves a deeper look 
Product
It s noteworthy that Tritton made a point of mentioning  relevant own brands  and  differentiation and curation  as part of the company s strategy going forward  Simply put  it s another indication that Bed Bath   Beyond is looking to introduce more private label goods into its product mix 
Tritton s the right man to lead that charge  launching more than a couple of dozen private label lines as the head of merchandising operations for Target  including home goods brands Made by Design and Opalhouse  And it matters  Homegrown products can cost up to 50  less than nationally branded products to procure  and they ve helped propel Target s growth by rounding out its inventory mix 
Even beyond Target s own brands  though  Tritton acknowledges the importance of not selling the exact same goods easily available elsewhere  including online 
Place
There s also little doubt what Tritton meant by  omni always retailer   Bed Bath   Beyond mostly missed the e commerce boat that proved a boon for other consumer goods companies  In fact  the company s unwillingness to invest on this front was a big reason activist investors began an effort early last year that would ultimately end with the ouster of then CEO Steven Temares  Now it s playing catch up but not just with a better e commerce machine  It s employing better retailing tech 
The irony is  much of that work was under way before Tritton even came into the picture  It was promising  too  For the few stores that were part of the company s Next Generation Lab experiment a year ago    which used technology to change product prices  optimize the placement of products in stores  and manage inventories    things improved  Sales improved more than 2  compared to similar stores  and profit margins expanded an average of 50 basis points 
Tritton could simply take that ball and run with it in addition to smarter use of the web  and he seems willing to do so 
At this price  worth a shot
Bed Bath   Beyond shares have partially bounced back since last week s tumble  suggesting investors realized they may have overreacted to the retailer s results and the retraction of previous guidance  and underreacted to its plausible future 
This is a stock  however  still priced at a modest 11 5 times forward earnings estimates  Bed Bath   Beyond sports a market cap of less than  2 billion versus revenue of more than  11 billion for the past four quarters  Yes  it needs help  but it s getting it    and a little help could go a long way given its unusually low valuation measures ",2020-01-19,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pjy77,2062750

Meet Group is lining up as a buy with momentum from its latest earning  Upwardly adjusted EPS estimates have propelled these shares into a Zacks Rank  1  Buy   MEET lost almost all of its value when the dotcom bubble burst in 2000  but the company has since restructured  The firm has acquired various global dating and interactive apps that have thrown this company back into profitable growth 
In this technological age  people are interacting increasingly through a digital filter  Meet Group is improving the way people interact and meet through an online medium  The company operates platforms that are meant to connect people in this digitalizing age  The apps include MeetMe  LOVOO  Skout  Tagged  and GROWLr 
The online dating application space is quite saturated  but The Meet Group is still able to bring unique value to the table  This company has leveraged live video streaming on its platforms  which has brought in more revenue per user quarterly  Video revenue grew 156  year over year in the first 3 reported quarters of 2019 
The Meet Group has grown its MAU s to 18 7 million  10  year over year growth   The company s ability to appreciate its monetization of each user is its most significant driver  Its average revenue per daily user grew 20  year over year in Q3  and this metric for video users grew 93  
These quickly saturating tech spaces need to consolidate as market share and economies of scale become essential to compete  Meet has made 4 critical acquisitions in the past 3 years  which have substantially grown the attractiveness of this investment 
Meet has had growing reliable free cash flows and a sizable cash pile of  27 million that gives this firm a fair amount of financial flexibility for continued investment in core competencies 
This stock is being valued at a forward P E of 8 5x  which is less than half of what the broader market s 18 9x and a fraction of its biggest competitor  Match Group  NASDAQ MTCH   is being valued at  The appealing valuation makes MEET attractive to both retail investors as well as potential acquirers 
Meet has recently been approached by German investment group NuCom an arm of ProSibenSat 1 Media  Germany s largest TV Network  Analysts are projecting that these shares would sell for at least  7 in an acquisition scenario  which would represent a  32  upside of the shares are trading at today  At MEETs current valuation  the firm looks ripe for a buyout  whether it s NuCom or another acquirer 
MEET has seen a lot of volatility over the past 52 weeks  coming down over 40  then back up to flat 
Take Away
MEET is seemingly trading at a discount  and its small cap characteristics combined with low coverage creates a savory mix for a value opportunity  This tech company is still expected to grow its topline by double digit percentages for the next couple years and its EPS growth and margins look even better  4 out of 5 sell side analysts covering this stock are calling these shares a buy right now 
 
Bed Bath   Beyond has lost 80  of its value over the past 5 years  and I don t see this toxic equity rallying back to highs anytime soon  BBBY began to bounce back from its  7 30 lows in August  but following a very disappointing earnings last week  these shares are again on a downward trajectory  Analysts have sizably dropped EPS expectations  and BBBY is now sitting at a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
BBBY is another product of the retail apocalypse  Its inability to adapt to the changing commerce landscape has been its downfall  The company has been shaving down its profitability at an accelerating rate since 2014  and today Bed Bath   Beyond s bottom line is just a fraction of what it was 6 or 7 years ago  It is expected to have declining revenues for the next 3 years  
The once strong free cash flows are turning negative  and the company has had to raise more debt to keep its liquid capital balanced  Gross margins are deteriorating quickly due to promotions  price matching  and other incentives to get people in the door  but unfortunately  it has not been enough 
Bed Bath   Beyond was forced to close 40 locations in 2019 and 20 more closures that were delayed until fiscal 2020  This is not the same massive scale of closures that other retailers had seen  Gymboree  which was recently purchased by Children s Place  closed 800 locations in 2019  Chico s is in the process of closing at least 250 stores  and GAP is beginning its closure of around 230 stores  I expect that Bed Bath   Beyond will continue to see an accelerating number of closure if significant systemic changes aren t made 
Bed Bath   Beyond is trading at richer multiples than I think are warranted  Despite the company s deteriorating financials  BBBY is still being valued on the high end of its 5 year trailing twelve month P E valuation 
Take Away
This is one of those toxic retail assets that I would stay away from  There is definitely a further downside to this falling knife  and unless management can leverage a compelling omnichannel product offering that is consistent with the needs wants of this new generation  I don t see this firm staying afloat for much longer  Look for systemic changes in Bed Bath   Beyond s strategy for clue into the company s long term trajectory

160507,382023,BBBY,Why Bed Bath   Beyond Dropped 7  Thursday Afternoon,news,"What happened
Shares of Bed Bath   Beyond Inc   NASDAQ BBBY   an omnichannel retailer of home furnishings and assorted products  are down over 7  Thursday afternoon after Moody s Investors Service downgraded Bed Bath   Beyond Inc  s senior unsecured rating 
So what
Moody s downgraded the retailer two levels from Baa3 to Ba2  with a stable outlook  which completes the review of Bed Bath   Beyond that began Oct  28  2019   The two notch downgrade reflects the acceleration of declines in same store sales and further erosion of EBITDA that will cause debt EBITDA and EBIT interest metrics to fall below previous estimates   stated Moody s analyst Peggy Holloway  in a press release 
 The transformation will likely take another two years to fully implement and is occurring at a time of softness in the homewares sector  and so Bed Bath remains vulnerable to continued market share loss to competitors who have adjusted more quickly to the changing retail environment   added Holloway 

Now what
Concerned investors should take a breath  and try to put those ratings into simpler terms  In its simplest form  the move from Baa3 to Ba2 moves Bed Bath   Beyond s rating from the low end of investment grade  to the higher end of non investment grade speculative  More specifically  that moves the retailer from being  adequately  capable to meet its financial commitments to being  less vulnerable  than other low rated entities  but acknowledges the company faces significant uncertainties and exposure to outside conditions that could hurt its ability to meet financial commitments 
In other words  this doesn t tell us much we don t already know  except that the company could pay more to finance its debt  But we already know that Bed Bath   Beyond is embarking on a massive turnaround and that market demand and competition  potential economic downturns  and perhaps even trade uncertainty could simply be more headaches and add to the risk already facing investors 
Here s the bottom line  New CEO Mark Tritton has already made management changes and announced a number of moves to get Bed Bath   Beyond s turnaround moving in the right direction  If you believe management s efforts will put the company back on track long term  this downgrade isn t a development you should concern yourself about  despite today s decline ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pp4jt,2072312

Shares of Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY   an omnichannel retailer offering home furnishings products  plunged nearly 19  Thursday morning after the company released disappointing fiscal 2019 third quarter results  Here are the financial details  a guidance surprise  and a silver lining for investors 
So what
Let s start with the top  and bottom line misses  Revenue declined 9  to  2 76 billion  compared to the prior year  falling short of analysts  estimates calling for  2 85 billion  Adjusted earnings per share checked in with a loss of  0 38  which was a stunning miss compared to analysts  estimates for a profit of  0 02 per share  The top line decline was driven by a 8 3  decline in comparable sales during the fiscal third quarter  but that was partially due to an unfortunate calendar impact  More specifically  the fiscal third quarter ended Nov  30  2019 and therefore didn t fully absorb the critical five day shopping period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday  When adjusted to include that stretch in both periods  comparable sales for the fiscal 2019 third quarter declined a more modest 3 6   

 Our performance in the third quarter was unsatisfactory and underscores the imperative for change and strengthens our sense of priorities and purpose  We must respond to the challenges we face as a business  including pressured sales and profitability  and reconstruct a modern  durable model for long term profitable growth   stated Mark J  Tritton  Bed Bath   Beyond s president and CEO  in a press release 
Now what
There are a couple more developments for investors to consider as Bed Bath   Beyond s stock plunges  Management decided to pull its full year outlook and guidance because it expects strong pressures to remain during the company s fourth quarter  which is likely why many investors are hitting the panic button Thursday  Tritton also noted in the conference call that  achieving our objective will not be linear   That means investors can expect large pops and drops when quarterly results are released in the near term  due to wildly swinging financial results  The silver lining for investors is that despite those pops and drops  Tritton has valuable experience from his former position at Target and  as a newly appointed CEO of Bed Bath   Beyond  also has the support and understanding to make critical long term decisions to turn the company s business around  On a day when the stock is down 20  and the retail landscape can be challenging to invest in  that s a bright side for long term investors ",2020-01-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pf-gx,2056184

160526,382042,BBBY,5 Best Value Picks To Grab On Discounted PEG,opinion,Value investing is gaining popularity by the day  The success of value investors like Warren Buffett further underscores this  According to an article by Rajiv Bhuva  Buffett and his business partner Charlie Munger managed to drive 20 9  compound annual growth in the market value of Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  from 1965 to 2017  Book value per share witnessed CAGR of 19 1   from  19 to  211 750  in these 53 years However  while searching for a suitable investment option  value investors with varied risk appetite are unlikely to consider price earnings to growth  PEG  ratio among a number of other popular metrics like price earnings  P E   price sales  P S  or price book value  P B  This is because they often find this ratio complicated  considering the limitations in calculating the future earnings growth potential of a stock  Yardsticks such as dividend yield  P E or P B are most commonly used to single out stocks trading at a discount However  these ratios  while not taking into account the future growth potential of a stock  may end up convincing us to invest in stocks that are at a discount just because of their poor show  This may often lead to  value traps    a situation when these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems  which once pulled down the share price  turn out to be persistent In such a case  even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value  you might still end up paying more  And here comes the importance of this not so popular but crucial value investing metric  the PEG ratio The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings  Earnings Growth RateA low PEG ratio is always better for value investors While P E alone fails to identify a true value stock  PEG helps to find the intrinsic value of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such

160529,382045,BBBY,Stock Market News  Beyond Meat Sizzles  Bad News for Bed Bath   Beyond,news,"Thursday morning brought investors new enthusiasm about the stock market as the tension between the U S  and Iran continued to wane  The imminent arrival of earnings season has market participants starting to focus more on the prospects for the broader economy  and signs of a healthy holiday season have many people excited about how strong corporate financial results could be  As of 11 30 a m  EST  the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJINDICES  DJI  had climbed 198 points to 28 943  The S P 500  SNPINDEX  GSPC  gained 19 points to 3 272  and the Nasdaq Composite  NASDAQINDEX  IXIC  picked up 73 points to 9 201 
Plant based food specialist Beyond Meat  NASDAQ BYND  has regained some upward momentum in the past few days after a rough ride in the second half of 2019  and investors see a lot of potential for the company to make strategic deals with major restaurant operators  Meanwhile  Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  dealt with ugly results for its latest quarter  raising doubts about what the future looks like for the home goods retailer 
Beyond Meat keeps cooking
Shares of Beyond Meat were up 6  on Thursday morning  adding to their gains from earlier in the week  The plant based food specialist has gotten a lot of attention since its initial public offering last year  and despite extreme turbulence in the stock  many investors believe that the company is just now starting to hit its stride 

Much of the movement in Beyond Meat shares this week has stemmed from speculation about major restaurant chains coming up with distribution partnerships for meatless products  Comments from rival Impossible Foods about supply constraints brought into question its ability to compete for business from McDonald s  potentially leaving the field open for Beyond Meat if it can more effectively serve the fast food giant 
Many different food industry players are jumping into plant based products  and that puts Beyond Meat in a strong position  Yet the big question is how much Beyond Meat can capitalize on that demand quickly    before competitors choose to build out their own capacity to serve the new market 
Even with today s gains  Beyond Meat shares still trade for just over a third of their peak price last year  That leaves the company with a lot of work to do to catch up    but with huge gains possible if it succeeds 
A big drop for Bed Bath   Beyond
Meanwhile  shares of Bed Bath   Beyond plunged almost 20  following the company s fiscal third quarter financial report Wednesday night  The latest numbers from the home goods retailer weren t encouraging  instead adding to the pessimism surrounding the company 
Bed Bath   Beyond s numbers weren t pretty  The retailer reversed a year ago profit by posting a significant net loss  and revenue fell more than 9  year over year  Comparable sales were down 8 3   and even after taking out the impact of the shift in the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday  a 3 6  drop in adjusted comps wasn t encouraging 
New CEO Mark Tritton wasn t happy about the results  saying simply that  our performance in the third quarter was unsatisfactory and underscores the imperative for change   The CEO kept a positive attitude about Bed Bath   Beyond s long term prospects  but the company will need a few more months to finalize a strategic plan and start moving forward again 
Investors weren t happy with Bed Bath   Beyond s decision to take away its guidance for the full fiscal year  Some fear that could mean an ugly holiday period for the retailer    and that would mark just another challenge that could prove difficult to overcome ",2020-01-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pf-y9,2056217

A reshaping of BBBY s sourcing and merchandising capabilities that should lead to much higher margins and a stabilization in sales
Significant cost cutting opportunities after years of inefficiencies
Upgrades to omni channel capabilities to make BBBY more competitive with other large box retailers
A rationalization of non core segments
A reengagement in share buybacks

The firm still sees the potential other big positive catalysts  Earlier this week  Bed Bath   Beyond announced that it had completed an over  250 million sale leaseback transaction involving 2 1 million in owned real estate  With 2 4 million square feet of real estate remaining on the books  as well as several non core operating segments that could be sold  Merrill Lynch sees more opportunity for capital inflow that could be used for capital return  Also  announcements on the hiring of strong new executives to join CEO Tritton s team are expected sooner rather than later Shares of Bed Bath   Beyond were last seen down about 20  at  13 38  in a 52 week range of  7 31 to  19 57  The consensus price target is  14 89

160532,382048,BBBY,Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  Stock Down On Q3 Loss  Sales Miss,opinion,Bed Bath   Beyond Inc    NASDAQ BBBY   reported dismal third quarter fiscal 2019 results  wherein the company incurred loss per share  Moreover  the top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined on a year over year basis Results were mainly hurt by the calendar shift of the Thanksgiving holiday in 2019  Apart from this  the company s business was challenged with certain self inflicted issues such as noncompetitive pricing and dearth of convenient shopping choices  Management stated that sales and profitability are likely to be under pressure in fiscal fourth quarter Following the quarterly earnings release  shares of Bed Bath   Beyond lost approximately 10  during the after market trading session on Jan 8 Q3 in DetailBed Bath   Beyond reported adjusted loss of 38 cents per share in fiscal third quarter  against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of an earnings of 3 cents  Also  the reported figure compared unfavorably with adjusted earnings of 2 cents in the year ago quarter Bed Bath   Beyond Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise     Net sales fell nearly 9  to  2 759 3 million and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 859 million  The downside was caused by comparable sales  comps  decline of 8 3   Comps fell due to lower store transactions  somewhat offset by a rise in the average transaction amount  In fact  comps in stores fell in high single digit percentage range  while the metric at the company s digital channel fell in mid single digit percentage range Notably  quarterly sales were significantly hurt by calendar shift of the Thanksgiving holiday  which fell short of one week compared with the year ago period  Adjusting for this shift  including Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday weeks  comps fell 3 6  in the reported quarter  The decline of 3 6  resulted from a fall of 6 5  in store sales  somewhat offset by a rise of 9 4  in digital sales  Nevertheless  comps on a shifted basis increased 7 1  during the five day shopping period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday Further  gross profit declined nearly 9  to  913 8 million in the reported quarter  Also  adjusted gross margin contracted 80 basis points  bps  to 32 3   mainly driven by lower merchandise margins on increased promotional activity and partly offset by a decline in net direct to customer shipping expense Adjusted SG A expenses dropped 2 3  to  931 8 million  driven by gains from its cost structure and optimization efforts  As a percentage of net sales  SG A increased 140 bps to 33 8  mainly owing to higher occupancy  advertising and technology related costs  Further  the company incurred operating loss of  29 8 million against income of  49 5 million in the year ago quarter

160537,382053,BBBY,Should Value Investors Pick Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Bed Bath   Beyond Inc    NASDAQ BBBY   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Bed Bath   Beyond has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7 31  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 47  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Bed Bath   Beyond s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 8 14 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  However  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Retail Wholesale Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 29 07  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Bed Bath   Beyond has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 8 72  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Bed Bath   Beyond has a P S ratio of about 0 15  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 54 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Bed Bath   Beyond currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Bed Bath   Beyond a solid choice for value investors For example  the PEG ratio for Bed Bath   Beyond is just 1 35  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 45  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Also  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 1 96  which is better than the industry average of 6 07  Clearly  BBBY is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Bed Bath   Beyond might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and Momentum Score of B  This gives BBBY a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate declined 0 52  in the past two months  whereas the full year estimate fell 0 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Bed Bath   Beyond Inc  Price and Consensus   Owing to such bearish estimate trends  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBed Bath   Beyond is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  the company carrying a Zacks Rank  3 makes us cautious about the broader factors  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand picked

160540,382056,BBBY,4 Takeaways From Bed Bath   Beyond s Third Quarter,news,"The third quarter of 2019 was another bleak one for the struggling company  but the CEO laid out a plan for future growth  Here are some of the highlights 
When you re so low  the only way to go is up
At least that s what managers and investors are hoping  If nothing had changed  the company would still be in an emergency  This quarter marked the 11th consecutive quarter of declines for Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY   and a net loss of  0 31 per share represented a significant reversal from the prior year period s  0 18 of earnings  Those weak results were accompanied by a management shake up in late 2019 that only added to the uncertainty for shareholders 

Customers love the company
According to research the company quoted  79  of customers have a favorable impression of the company  and 75  want to shop there  It s also the top home goods company for brand recognition 
Bed Bath   Beyond is in a unique position  People really like the company  but revenue is falling  That s a silver lining  because it implies that the challenges the company is facing are less a brand problem and have more to do with poor management  With new and capable management sitting at the table  a turnaround  though difficult  should be eminently achievable 
One bright spot in the third quarter numbers was that adjusted comps for the five day Black Friday period from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday increased 5  in stores and 13  in digital  With the right plan  new CEO Mark Tritton and his team could gear up to lead the company to a real resurgence 
There are always more opportunities than meets the eye
Tritton mentioned a variety of ways Bed Bath   Beyond could improve future sales as well as increase efficiency from the inside out  The meat of the turnaround plan is a process that Tritton called the  five pillars   and it runs the gamut of operations 

Curating a more compelling product assortment
Refining value and price point
Focusing on client connection and engagement
Optimizing an omni channel experience
Developing a high performing team

Specifically  he mentioned a slew of minor goals on the way to reaching these objectives  One in particular is  harvesting our own brand opportunities   something that has been extremely successful at Target  NYSE TGT   where Tritton was merchandising chief prior to landing at Bed Bath   Beyond 
In fact  a lot of this sounds like another Target makeover  That company completed its own turnaround in 2017 that has propelled it into a position as one of the best performing retail chains in the U S  and a top stock  It s not for nothing that the activist investors who unseated the previous CEO had their eyes on Tritton  Target s script is definitely a good one for Bed Bath   Beyond to follow  as the company functions in a similar capacity  a huge product assortment with high name recognition at mass pricing 
Some of the other opportunities the company is working on include selling off real estate to fund the changes  the first portion of which already went through earlier this year  in addition to reworking the Beyond Plus loyalty program  which awards customers with 20  off every single purchase and free shipping for an annual fee of  29 
The company has what it takes

160557,382073,BBBY,Black Friday Couldn t Save Bed Bath   Beyond s Dreadful 3rd Quarter,news,"Home goods retailer Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  reported third quarter results after Wednesday s closing bell  Sales fell 9  year over year  and the year ago period s profits swung to a net loss  The results fell far short of Wall Street s expectations  and Bed Bath   Beyond s stock fell as much as 22  in after hours trading 
Bed Bath   Beyond s third quarter results by the numbers

Data source  Bed Bath   Beyond  GAAP   generally accepted accounting principles 
Calendar oddities
The company s third quarter ended on Nov  30 last year and Dec  1 in 2018  This calendar quirk pushed the meat of the post Thanksgiving shopping week    including Cyber Monday    into the fourth quarter rather than the third 
This shift made a significant difference to Bed Bath   Beyond s results  As reported  comparable sales fell 8 3  in the third quarter  If you include the Cyber Monday week in the year over year comps calculation on both sides  the slide stopped at just 3 6   Breaking that adjusted metric down a bit further  in store sales fell 6 5  while online sales increased by 9 4  
Zooming in on just the five day period between Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday  comps rose 7 1  thanks to a 5  increase in physical locations and more than 13  higher digital sales  So Bed Bath   Beyond managed the prime post Thanksgiving shopping period in style  but that wasn t enough to overcome slower sales in the retail chain s routine  non holiday business 
The first step of fixing a problem is admitting that you have one
In the earnings call  Bed Bath   Beyond s management made it clear that it s working on improving the company s weak spots 
 Our business remains challenged with some self inflicted issues  including poor inventory management  non competitive pricing  and a lack of convenient shopping options  and we are working to address these issues   said CFO Robyn D Elia   We also engaged in new promotional activity during the holiday period  including special in store and online sales events and the launch of our first ever national Black Friday advertising campaign  Overall  these are positive steps  but we know we have a lot more work to do to stabilize our top line and margins  
CEO Mark Tritton expanded on this rueful theme 
 It s clear that we have some heavy lifting to do against the emerging plan and clear goals   Tritton said  He continued 

We re experiencing short term pain  some of which has been self inflicted  We are making bold and broad based changes to modernize our business  We have a solid balance sheet  We will have a relentless focus on our customer  We will act as a true omnichannel retailer 

These steps will take time  and they won t always be easy  Bed Bath   Beyond is in need of a deep overhaul right now  and that s what Tritton hopes to achieve  He s been on the job only since October  brought in to repeat the turnaround effort he executed with great success at Target  NYSE TGT   Tritton already implemented some dramatic changes  replacing six VP level executives in December and going back to the ace card that saved Target    private label merchandise brands that can set the company apart from competitors while also improving the financial returns of each item sold 
It s a proven strategy  but also an expensive one  Bed Bath   Beyond didn t have a whole lot of experience or established infrastructure for private label goods when Tritton came in  so it makes sense to see some pain triggered by the early going 

The stock just got a lot cheaper  Isn t it a good buy now 
Fellow Fool Adam Levine Weinberg wasn t convinced that Tritton would be able to fix what s ailing Bed Bath   Beyond three months ago  and this blunt third quarter report isn t exactly inspiring me  either  It s not obvious to me that the private label focus and ordinary cost cutting measures will be able to heal the cracks in this traditional retailer s crumbling foundation 
Tritton calls it  short term pain  some of which was self inflicted   I call it an addiction to outdated business concepts  where the best defense might be to lean heavily on online sales  with or without a basket of new in house brands  I m often quick to point out buy in opportunities when high quality businesses have their share prices punched down for shortsighted or poorly supported reasons 
That s not the case here  and I ll gladly stay on the sidelines until Mark Tritton starts to prove me wrong ",2020-01-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfxd6,2055960

160560,382076,BBBY,Analysts Estimate Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended November 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 8  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This home goods retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 03 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  83 3  
Revenues are expected to be  2 86 billion  down 5 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 34  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Bed Bath   Beyond 
For Bed Bath   Beyond  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Bed Bath   Beyond will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Bed Bath   Beyond would post earnings of  0 26 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 34  delivering a surprise of  30 77  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Bed Bath   Beyond doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-bed-bath--beyond-bbby-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200495832,200495832

2   Canopy Growth  Corp  NYSE CGC  jumped 2 64  or 14   to 21 29  on 19 million shares  It appears to have an inverse head and shoulders that s developing  or at least a V bottom with a right hand extension  Monday was significant for this stock  Why  Because of the little breakaway gap  a run through the declining topsline and 50 day moving average  and a move up to test resistance right at the 21 56 area  creating as high as 21 49  If it gaps or pops and runs above 22 1 2 on Tuesday  I think this stock could get to 25 pretty quickly  The secondary target on a swing is 29  This stock has come down a long way  folks  but this is the bottom pattern  in my opinion 
3   Clovis Oncology  Inc  NASDAQ CLVS  popped 1 10  or 11 45   to 10 71  with a high of 10 87  on 14 million shares on Monday  After a nasty decline at the beginning of the month  it s been up two days in a row  I liked the way it acted during the day  but I m not happy with the lack of volume  So  be careful with this one  I do think it has higher potential  but I also this there s big resistance near the 11 90 to the 12 range  If it gets through that  it could rocket  especially if the volume increases strongly  I am looking for a test of 13 and 15 1 2 for starters  but anything below 8 70 and you need to stop  Period 
4  Dynavax Technologies Corporation  NASDAQ DVAX  swing trade is working  It did really good on Monday  popping 89 cents  or 15 6   to 6 59  with a high of 6 69  on 3 1 million shares traded  with a breakaway out of a wedge  That s big volume for this stock  the biggest since the breakaway back in Aug  It s near the top of the channel  and my targets are 8 and 10 going forward 
5   Owens   Minor Inc   NYSE OMI  may be breaking out of its coil  It s been up five days in a row  and on Monday it moved up 16 cents  or 2 12   to 7 70  with a high of 7 75  on 1 3 million shares traded  This is a swing  The first swing target is 8 40  50  The second target is 10 10 25
6  Pacific Gas   Electric Co  NYSE PCG   had a breakaway pop on Monday as it soared on a deal with wildfire victims  taking it up another 1 53  or 15 8   to 11 18  with a high of 11 58  on 46 million shares  I think it might extend  but it has to get through 12 in order to do that  If it does get through 12  the next target is 13 1 2 
7  Sorrento Therapeutics  NASDAQ SRNE  was up 29 cents  or 824   to 3 81  with a high of 3 87  on 7 85 million shares on Monday  We recently put a swing on it  and it popped  pulled back  and popped again  I love this look  I think it has a shot at 5 3 4 and 6 1 4 going forward  There may be a takeover 
8  Wrap Technologies Inc  NASDAQ WRTC  swing is looking great  It had a narrow day on Monday  but it was up 19 cents  or 3 33   to 5 89  with a high of 6 04  on 383 151 shares traded  The volume remains heavy for this stock  It looks like it s about to accelerate and pop to 6 05  and then run up into the 6 1 2 3 4  maybe even the 7 range

Summary
We want to be right most if not all the time  Our egos are tied into how we are perceived by others  Investing and trading can be a humbling business because what we expect to happen  no what we  know  will happen  often does not  The reality  however  is that nobody has a crystal ball  Nobody on CNBC is more clairvoyant that anyone on Bloomberg or anyone watching at home for that matter  Fortunately  successful investing doesn t require us to be right all the time but instead to be able to find a repeatable process compatible with our personality  While intuition comes with experience  wishing something will happen is a dangerous place from which to invest  Holding onto losing positions that you  know  will come back is a difficult position to overcome with rational thought  After all  thinking you  know  what will happen in the future is anything but rational  In Ben Carlson s article   he discusses the length of bull markets throughout history 
  what we can learn from history is that bull markets tend to run for much longer than most investors would ever think is possible  
This is the most disliked bull market in my career  I  knew  it was over in 2015  yet fortunately stuck to a process that keeps me invested despite what I wish would ve happened at the time

Review  Asking  Why   Can be a Big Mistake

Our previous Stock Exchange discussed separating the news from what s happening in the markets Asking  Why   Can be a Big Mistake  Successful long term investing and trading often requires us to ignore the news and instead focus on the process and the price action of the instruments in our portfolio  Understanding the reason why a stock is rising or falling can be counterproductive and only obvious after the fact 
This Week 
In the same vein  following the longest bull market in modern US History one would expect the most severe bear market in modern US History  Once again  logic and what one  knows  to be true is often not the case in investing  Carlson goes on
 When you experience above average returns like that you should expect below average returns to follow  That s plain common sense  But bull markets don t follow the rules of common sense  They re built on momentum  emotion and the fear of missing out  
The most successful investors invest with their process and disregard their desires and what they  wish  their positions would do  As they know for certain  the markets do not care 
Expert Picks from The Models

Holmes  I bought shares of Lendingtree Inc  NASDAQ TREE  on December 11th at  299 10 and sold them on December 12th for  303 52 






TT  How do you feel about the trade 
Holmes  I purchased for technical reasons  Specifically  I am a dip buyer  and I like to buy attractive pullbacks  as you can see in the chart above  It earned over 1 5  in a day which are the objectives of the program 
TT  I see the pullback you re talking about 






Holmes  As a technical trader  with a holding period of a few days to a few weeks  I don t care too much about long term fundamentals  I m already out of the trade 
TT  I principally care about an attractive price chart and a stock trading near recent highs  Anyway  thanks for sharing this trade  Holmes  And how about you  Athena any trades to share this week 

Athena  I bought shares of Bed Bath   Beyond Inc  NASDAQ BBBY  on December 13th 






TT  Looks like a sharp rally from a V shaped bottom 
Athena  I look for stocks having strong positive trends and then select only those with the very strongest trends   king of the hill    constantly replacing the ones with weaker trends  It should not surprise anyone that I bought Bed Bath and Beyond Inc  A quick look at the chart should make the strength of the trend obvious  And I generally continue to hold my positions until either the strength of the trend abates or a stock with an even higher trend strength comes along  I don t have a set  holding period  for a position  I will exit only when either a stronger stock comes along or if market conditions dictate a strong potential for loss   capital preservation remains the key driver in all situations 
Jeff  This idea has support from the fundamentals  The FASTgraphs chart does not look like a Wile E  Coyote rerun 






TT  The stock has certainly been strong since the Summer  thanks for sharing  And how about you  Road Runner

TT  Okay  I think this trade has potential  Thanks for sharing  And how about you  Emerald Bay any trades to share this week 

Emerald Bay  I bought shares of  Qorvo Inc   NASDAQ QRVO  on December 11th

EB  I seek exposure to the highest momentum names in our large cap equity universe  adjusted for volatility  Specifically  I like to base my position sizes on volatility with more capital invested in the less volatile stocks 
TT  You ve been doing quite well since purchasing this position and I suspect you ll hold it until the trend changes  Thank you for sharing 
Jeff  Are you concerned about the dependence on 5G and possible trade war effects

160574,382090,BBBY,All You Need To Know About Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  Rating Upgrade To Buy,opinion,"Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Bed Bath   Beyond is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Bed Bath   Beyond  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Bed Bath   Beyond
For the fiscal year ending February  2020  this home goods retailer is expected to earn  1 92 per share  which is a change of  6 3  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Bed Bath   Beyond  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 7  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term 
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here    
The upgrade of Bed Bath   Beyond to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-12-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/all-you-need-to-know-about-bed-bath--beyond-bbby-rating-upgrade-to-buy-200493522,200493522

I will now turn the call over to Mark 
Mark J  Tritton    President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you  Janet  and good afternoon  everyone  I am delighted to be here today during my very first earnings call as Bed Bath   Beyond s President and CEO  For many years  I ve watched and admired this company as a competitor  as well as a customer  reflecting on my own family s back to college experiences  I m excited for the opportunity to reconstruct  renovate and restore this iconic retailer  For almost half a century  Bed Bath   Beyond has helped millions of people make it easy to feel at home  and I firmly believe our company remains uniquely placed to play an essential role in our customers  lives  To do so  we need to make the business we call home as special as our customers make theirs 
Since arriving in New Jersey just 66 days ago  I have been fully immersed in the business to assess our operations  our portfolio  our capabilities and our culture  My initial enthusiasm for coming to Bed Bath   Beyond has been affirmed  We have a highly recognizable and beloved brand with passionate associates and customers  As a business  we have substantial scale with over 1 000 stores across the US and in Canada  strong brand awareness among our customers and a business model that s supported by a strong balance sheet and significant cash flow generation 
From day one  I received such a warm welcome from our associates across our company and an open invitation from the team to create and lead change  During my store visits  I have witnessed the passion of our associates as they serve our customers and their implicit desire to win  I ve also seen our customers engaging with the brand and have listened and responded directly to many customer concerns 
Turning to our recent quarterly performance  we reported sales of  2 8 billion  an 8 3  comp sales decline  and an adjusted loss of  0 38 in an adjusted diluted earnings per share  The business was challenged by pre and post of Thanksgiving holiday period  despite favorable results on a shifted basis during the five day holiday shopping period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday 
Let me be clear  these results are unsatisfactory and underscore the imperative for change and strengthen our sense of priorities and purpose  We must respond to the challenges we face as a business  including pressured sales and profitability and reconstruct a modern durable model for long term profitable growth  A path to achieving our objective will not be linear as evidenced by our third quarter results  but we will move quickly to course correct and drive the business forward 
Now  let me discuss our preliminary approach to lead our company into the future  We ll provide a further detailed plan in the coming months  but today  I want to share some high level insights into where we are heading  First is a deeper understanding of our customer and our market opportunity  Let s start with some data here  Based on results of a recent brand health tracker study and NPD consumer tracking data  Bed Bath   Beyond is number one in brand awareness for the housewares and home goods category and is a strong leader in consideration for bedding and bath  Overall  79  of our customers have a favorable impression of our brand and 75  of customers want to buy from our top categories such as home textiles and housewares  This data demonstrates that Bed Bath   Beyond is still a beloved well known brand with tremendous opportunity to grow share within a  51 billion US market for the home related categories we offer  We can and will be more competitive in our categories to win back share  to build stronger authority and performance 
The data also speaks to our challenges  including a lack of clarity around purpose and value and a softer  Phonetic  connection with Gen Z and millennial customers in our product categories  In addition  we know in our industry that 80  of traffic is influenced by digital touch point  reinforcing that our digital business is a gateway to our customer and that we need to drastically improve our digital platform  There are also general market pressures such as increased investment in home categories from mass retailers  new competition from direct consumer brands  increased customer expectations across store  digital and delivery experiences  and the reality that the next generation of customers are not just digitally savvy but shop digital first  As such  we will be leaning into the digital space to make it easier and more convenient for our customers to shop with us  including quickly evolving our strong performing reserve online pickup in store offering to a full buy online pickup in store or BOPIS model during the first half of fiscal 2020 
We have a clear mandate to reestablish our authority as the preferred omni channel home destination  In doing so  we need to clarify the meaning of value to our customers  Our future will be framed by customer and market insights to define our market opportunity and inform the development of a winning customer value proposition  one that we can bring to life for our customers across all our retail channels  customer segments  demographics and occasions  As such  we recently entered into a partnership with the NPD Group to assess their extensive retail market data and customized reporting and other data driven services  which will enable us to more clearly review pricing  share and white space opportunities  Later this year  to build upon this partnership  we will also work with NPD to roll out a vendor collaboration program to further refine our assortments and strategies 
Regarding our go forward strategy  we ll be grounded in the following five pillars  First  our product  We ll refine and amplify an exciting omni channel assortment that rebuilds authority and preference for Bed Bath   Beyond and creates energy through differentiation and curation  Second  our price  We ll invest in and clarify compelling value through more choice at opening price points  relevant own brands and clear price communications to sharpen our value for quality proposition and to both acquire and win back customers 
Third is our promise  We will clarify and deepen our relationship with our customers by connecting  engaging and motivating them to strengthen loyalty and lifetime value  Fourth is our place  We will accelerate and optimize connecting with  inspiring and energizing our customer by becoming a truly omni always retailer to serve their preferred shopping needs  And lastly but critically important is our people who create and sustain a talent engine and culture that attracts  retains and develops high performing teams who consistently deliver operational excellence and business results 
With these five pillars as our guide  we re embracing a commitment to reconstruct and modernize our operating model to drive efficiency and effectiveness  charting a new course for our company  We look forward to sharing more details on these five strategic pillars and expectations for future performance over the next few months  We plan to host an investor event in the spring of 2020  And we thank you in advance for your patience and support while we finalize these plans 
In the meantime  our teams remain focused on accelerating our extensive transformation efforts and driving against our near term priorities to generate savings and reinvest for the future growth  We ve been reviewing and optimizing the Company s asset base  including the portfolio of retail banners  as a key source of further funds to potentially redeploy and reinvest  We ve been reviewing and resetting the cost structure  modernizing for growth and refining our organization  which is expected to result in significant savings in both cost of sales and SG A  including reducing overhead  improving sourcing  increasing private label penetration and optimizing our supply chain  We also have been more definitively analyzing our sales and share in an effort to improve our sales trend and top line growth in line with our future goals 
While our top line still remains challenged  we ve made tangible progress on many of these priorities  One action we ve taken includes the announcement earlier this week of the completion of a real estate sales leaseback transaction which generated net proceeds of over  250 million  This deal includes commercial space including retail stores  a distribution facility and our corporate office in Union  New Jersey  which will be continued to be occupied under the long term leases  This activity marks the first step toward unlocking valuable capital in our business that can be put to work to amplify our plans to build a stronger and more efficient company to support revenue growth  financial stability and shareholder value 
While the specifics of our capital allocation strategy remain under review as the Board and management team evaluate future capital investments required to accelerate the Company s ongoing business transformation  the net proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction and other potential cash generating transactions could be used to reinvest in the Company s core business operations to drive growth  fund share repurchases  reduce the Company s outstanding debt or some combination of these 
While we cannot find any specifics at this time  we are still actively pursuing other potential portfolio adjustments and working through the process with our outside advisors  In connection with this process  the Company continues to evaluate certain remaining owned real estate  Whether we engage in any such future action and the associated timing will be based on a careful assessment of each asset and how to best optimize its value for the business on a go forward basis  I look forward to updating you on our progress in due course 
As we reconstruct and modernize our operating model  we need to embed the right leadership capabilities and accountability measures to ensure the business operates efficiently and effectively  A rethink of the Company s leadership team was necessary to propel Bed Bath   Beyond forward  Last month  I announced extensive changes to our leadership team  including the departure of six senior members  We ll be putting a team in place that will not only have the right talent and expertise to execute our new vision and inject new ideas  but also the right organizational structure to facilitate more streamlined decision making  to accelerate the pace of transformation and to reestablish Bed Bath   Beyond s authority in the home space 
Balancing our existing expertise with fresh perspectives from new innovative leaders of change will help us to better anticipate and support our customers in their life journeys and shopping needs  During this period of transition  I am grateful to our leaders who have stepped up to provide key interim leadership in merchandising  digital  marketing  own brand and legal  I have been buoyed by the immediate positive change that the engagement of these key leadership teams has provided  I ll be also leaning in during this transition period and personally overseeing the work of several teams as we solidify our strategy and plans together  In connection with the leadership announcement  I have been active in the recruitment process for these roles already  The volume of inbound interest has been extremely high  and I m confident that we will recruit top talent for these positions 
In other activity  as part of our strategic focus  we ve been further evaluating our product assortment  We are taking aggressive steps to rationalize the assortment and better manage inventory as we start a journey in building our offering of own brands  balanced with a powerful arsenal of core national brands  More to come on this soon  These are among  Phonetic  the early accelerated actions we are taking to lay the foundation to create a new vision for our company  one in which we work together to build a better business every day and a place where we make it easy for our millions of customers to feel at home 
With respect to our sales stabilization efforts  we did see some positive signs of growth during the recent Thanksgiving sales period  benefiting from less stores being open on Thanksgiving Day this year  new promotional activities and new pricing models  Comparing these five days from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday 2019 versus 2018  comp sales actually increased by 7 1   supported by growth in physical stores of about 5  and strong growth from our digital channels in excess of 13   These results begin to demonstrate that when we think and act differently  we can create meaningful positive outcomes  While the strong promotional activity during this holiday period is not preferred  we will be sharpening our value for quality proposition in an effort to not only win back customers but also attract new one 
As I said earlier  our third quarter results were unsatisfactory  To some extent  our performance was impacted by self inflicted issues such as poor inventory management  non competitive pricing and a lack of convenient shopping options like BOPIS  which I do know can be rectified going forward  In the near term  we will be focused on these issues and our operating model  And while improved performance will not be linear  we will continue to lay the foundation of our transformation as we work to address the internal and external headwinds that are impacting on our business currently 
In short  my mission is to ensure that Bed Bath   Beyond is well positioned for the long term success  We have a highly recognizable and beloved brand with passionate associates and customers  I truly believe this is one of the last iconic retailer turnarounds in this country  and I m excited about the future of our business 
I ll now turn the call over to Robyn to review our quarterly financials  and then afterwards  I will make some closing remarks  Robyn 
Robyn D Elia    Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Thank you  Mark  Let s start with a review of our GAAP results  We reported a net loss per diluted share of  0 31 for the third quarter of fiscal 2019  compared to net income per diluted share of  0 18 in the prior year period  which included a benefit of  0 16 from a gain on the sale of a building  Our reported net loss this quarter include the net benefit of  0 07 per diluted share for special items  which include a favorable adjustment of  24 million to the Company s previously established incremental reserve for future markdowns that was partially offset by a non cash charge of  12 million for the impairment of certain store level assets 
On an adjusted basis  our non GAAP net loss per diluted share was  0 38  To better represent the year over year performance of the business during the comparative quarters and consistent with our disclosures during previous earnings calls in fiscal 2019  my review of our quarterly results will be on a non GAAP basis  excluding the adjustment to the inventory reserve and the store impairment charge  as well as last year s gain from the building sale  As a reminder  our third quarter this year consisted of the 13 weeks ending November 30th and included Black Friday and the Saturday after Thanksgiving  while our third quarter last year consisted of the 13 weeks ending December 1st and included Black Friday and Cyber Monday week 
Net sales in the quarter were  2 8 billion  a decrease of 9  from the third quarter of last year  Comp sales for the quarter decreased 8 3  and reflected a decrease in the number of transactions  partially offset by an increase in the average transaction amount  On a directional basis  comp sales from our stores declined in the high single digit percentage range  while comp sales from our digital channel declined in the mid single digit percentage range 
Sales for the third quarter were significantly impacted by the calendar shift of the Thanksgiving holiday  This year  there was one less week of holiday sales compared to the prior year period  Adjusting for this calendar shift to include Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday weeks in both periods  our comp sales declined only 3 6  with a decline in store sales of 6 5  and growth in digital sales of 9 4  
During the like for like comparable period covering the five days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday  our performance showed comp sales growth of 7 1   including growth in stores of over 5  and digital growth in excess of 13   Despite the calendar shift  our business remains challenged with some self inflicted issues including poor inventory management  non competitive pricing and a lack of convenient shopping options  and we are working to address these issues 
To create a noticeably different shopping experience for our customers  we executed a rapid refresh of 156 of our highest volume and most profitable Bed Bath   Beyond stores  including basic improvements to store entryways and checkout  We also engaged in new promotional activity during the holiday period  including special in store and online sales events and the launch of our first ever national Black Friday advertising campaign  Overall  these are positive steps  but we know we have a lot more work to do to stabilize our top line and margins 
Moving now to the gross margin  our adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 32 3  of net sales as compared to 33 1  in the third quarter of last year  This 80 basis point decline is primarily due to the decrease in merchandise margin  driven by a higher level of promotional activity in the quarter and was partially offset by a decrease in net direct to customer shipping expense  Our Beyond Plus membership program continues to grow and now stands at about 1 4 million members  While the Beyond Plus customer spends more and visits more often  the program continues to unfavorably impact our gross margin  including by about 35 basis points during the fiscal 2019 third quarter  which is similar to the prior year impact 
Moving to SG A  adjusted SG A expense for the quarter was  931 8 million or 33 8  of net sales  as compared to  982 5 million or 32 4  of net sales in the prior year period  This  51 million decrease reflects our progress in resetting our cost structure  including lower payroll and payroll related expenses from several actions taken this year to reduce overhead costs  and lower occupancy expenses resulting from our ongoing comprehensive real estate optimization effort  partially offset by higher management consulting expenses associated with some of our strategic initiatives  As a percentage of net sales  the 140 basis point increase in SG A was primarily due to the effect of our fixed costs such as occupancy and technology related expenses including depreciation on a lower sales base  as well as from higher advertising expenses 
On an adjusted basis  our effective tax rate was 20 6  and includes  2 8 million of net after tax costs due to distinct events occurring during the quarter 
Now  looking to our balance sheet  we ended the quarter with  920 million in cash and investments  Retail inventories of  2 7 billion at cost reflected a reduction of 10  or  289 million at cost during the quarter compared to the end of the prior year period excluding the impact of the incremental reserve for future markdowns  This 10  reduction in inventory is despite our quarterly sales decline of 9  
Let me now briefly give an update on our inventory reduction initiative and the adjustment to the reserve I referenced earlier  As we disclosed last quarter  we initiated a plan to aggressively reduce up to  1 billion of inventory at retail over the next 18 months as part of our near term priority to review and optimize our asset base  This included the removal of approximately  350 million of inventory at retail before the holiday  In conjunction with this decision  we took an incremental reserve for future markdowns of  194 million in the second quarter  We have subsequently refined our plan  And as a result  we now estimate our recovery rate will be higher than originally planned  and therefore  we recorded a  24 million favorable adjustment to our reserve for future markdowns in the third quarter  This adjustment is reflected in our reconciliation for adjusted gross profit included in our financial disclosures 
Moving to capex  our capital expenditures for the first nine months were  188 million with nearly 50  related to technology projects  primarily focused on logistics  digital capabilities and analytics  The remaining capex was primarily related to investments in stores  including remodels and new store openings 
During the third quarter  we closed 14 stores across all concepts and opened four stores  We now plan to close approximately 40 total stores  including about 20 Bed Bath   Beyond stores  We had previously planned to close 60 total stores  including about 40 Bed Bath   Beyond stores  We ve decided to delay the closing of 20 of the 40 Bed Bath   Beyond stores that were scheduled to close to utilize these stores during the first half of fiscal 2020 to better facilitate the clearance and sell through of the merchandise associated with the inventory reduction initiative  We are still on target to open approximately 10 total stores  including about two Bed Bath stores during fiscal 2019 
Regarding share repurchase activity  we had a low level of engagement in the market  repurchasing  1 2 million or 87 000 shares during the quarter  And as Mark stated earlier  our capital allocation strategy remains under review as the Board and management evaluate future capital investments required to accelerate the Company s ongoing business transformation  Today  our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of  0 17 per share to be paid on April 14  2020 to shareholders of record as of March 13  2020 
Similar to our third quarter results  we expect our sales and profitability to remain pressured during the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter  Considering these headwinds and Mark s ongoing work to assess the business and finalize the details of our go forward strategic plan  as well as the extensive senior leadership changes within the past month  we believe it is appropriate to withdraw our fiscal 2019 full year financial guidance 
Before I conclude  I d like to provide a few additional pieces of information  First  our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter pre tax earnings will include the following items  Approximately  11 million of severance expense associated with the extensive leadership changes announced in December and approximately  33 million of the loss related to the sale leaseback transaction  Second  our fiscal 2019 capital expenditures are now planned to be lower at approximately  275 million to  300 million  compared to our previous estimate of between  350 million to  375 million  This lower estimate is primarily due to the timing of projects  And finally  in connection with the recently completed sale leaseback transaction  we will incur annual incremental pre tax net occupancy costs of  11 million  which began with the closing of the transaction in late December  Our balance sheet will include roughly  190 million of incremental lease assets and liabilities from this transaction  The transaction generated net proceeds of more than  250 million and included about 2 1 million of our nearly 4 million square feet of owned real estate and consisted of 12 retail locations  one distribution facility and our corporate campus in New Jersey  And the lease terms on these properties generally range from 12 to 18 years 
I will now turn the call back over to Mark for some closing remarks 
Mark J  Tritton    President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you  Robyn  It s clear that we have some heavy lifting to do against the emerging plan and clear goals  I believe that to change the trajectory of our current results  we must first identify and understand where the customer needs and the marketplace are headed and then invest quickly and consistently to ensure our core business can serve those needs competitively  The approach we are taking to set the future strategy is very much aligned to fulfill this vision 
So today  I want to be clear on where we stand and where we are going  We re experiencing short term pain  some of which has been self inflicted  We are making bold and broad based changes to modernize our business  We have a solid balance sheet  We will have a relentless focus on our customer  We will act as a true omni channel retailer  We will be agile and take a measured approach  And as such  these results will be accomplished over a period of quarters and years to create a stronger authority in our market and a sustainable durable business model 
One of the advantages of my more than 30 years of experience in different retail environments is seeing other cultures  different structures and different models during turnaround situations and growth recovery  Through the lens of these experiences  I can see our company s fundamental advantages  challenges and opportunities much more clearly  It s this perspective that s helping me to look objectively at the business and make bold pivots to reconstruct  renovate and restore Bed Bath   Beyond  We have plenty of options and a healthy balance sheet  as I said  to get to work and accomplish our goals  As I said before  our path to achieving our objective will not be linear  as evidenced by our third quarter results  but we will move quickly to course correct and drive the business forward 
In closing  I want to say once again how delighted I am to have the opportunity to lead this iconic company  Our entire team of more than 60 000 associates and I recognize that we have work to do to get Bed Bath   Beyond to master the fundamentals and strengthen our execution  We will work together to finalize the details of our strategy and will share these plans with you over the coming months  We appreciate your patience as we embark and pursue on this journey to position Bed Bath   Beyond to deliver long term sustainable growth  We are all dedicated to advancing our company for the benefit of our customers  our vendor partners and our shareholders 
With that  I d like to open the call to your questions

Thank you   Operator Instructions  And our first question comes from Curt Nagle from Bank of America  Your line is open 
Curtis Nagle    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst
All right  Good morning  Thanks    or I should say  good evening  Thanks very much for taking the    my question  So  I guess the first one    both for you  Mark  would be  look  I know it s very early on but    and there s a lot of work to do  but what would be perhaps a reasonable time frame for you  I guess  to start seeing comp stabilization  And then as a follow up to that  I guess any more thoughts you could share in terms of the extent and maybe the timeline of  I guess  putting forward the new or refreshed Bed Bath in terms of what operating segments you think you ll hold on to 
Mark J  Tritton    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  thanks  Curt  So in terms of the time frame  again  we re still in the process of evaluation  and I want to be really clear here  continuing to accelerate the existing transformation work that was put in place  which was really solid and we ve been able to double down on that since we coming on board  and just looking to get a clarity on our priorities  our investments and our capex  And we still have a few balls in the air there that we re looking to solidify so we can help prioritize and build that plan  That s why I m sharing that I ll come back in the spring to be really clear on the 2020 plans and the pagination of those goals 
So it s more work to be done but work in flight  so stay tuned on that  So the timeline on the operating model will be commensurate with that  But there is some individual efforts that are already taking shape  and we see us of doubling down on those  Today  they re mostly focused on operational strength and excellence and reconciliation  I m looking to drive more of the growth initiatives against those same pyramids of transformation and opportunity  And so again  that s going to be built into our plan

Good evening  everybody  I appreciate you taking my questions  And Mark  welcome to Bed Bath   Beyond 
Mark J  Tritton    President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks  Bobby 
Bobby Griffin    Raymond James    Analyst
My first question is to you  Mark  and I appreciate some of the early details on kind of the five pillars  but can you maybe talk about your view of couponing and how that fits into those pillars and your customers  And then my follow up question is  just on the remaining real estate that s left  can you give a little color on what type of properties those are  Is it distribution centers  stores  other types of properties that we might not  Phonetic  be thinking of 
Mark J  Tritton    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  So  let s start with couponing  So I think what    the key word that comes to mind here is really balance  So we know that the coupon is part of our heritage and our DNA  and we want to maintain that in our mix as part of our tools that we can reach out to customers with  But we do see that there is an opportunity to readjust our value proposition directly with the customer  And our research shows that we can sometimes be ambiguous or unclear about what that first price is when they are searching online  which is a primary vehicle for research  So really rebalancing our opening price points  price right daily  as well as meaningful promotions and coupon usage is going to be our structure going forward  We are already analyzing where our coupon has strength and where it has opportunities to be morphed into other opportunities such as promos or through regular price well priced business  and that work is currently in flight 
Regarding the real estate  we continue to look at all our options on the table  equivalent to what we ve seen now  stores  warehousing and other assets  But again  we re still in the process of valuing that with outside support  We ve made a bold first move with that  We ll see if there s other opportunities  and I look forward to sharing more as we evaluate

And our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley  Your line is open 
Josh Kamboj    Morgan Stanley    Analyst
Hi  This is Josh Kamboj on for Simeon  Thanks for taking our questions  Mark  improving the digital offering is clearly in focus  Can you share some examples of what functions you think need the most work  as well as some of the time frames and level of investments involved in making those fixes 
Mark J  Tritton    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  I think that it s one of the areas we can be the most agile because of the rapid change and the cost associated  So I think everything from the speed and accuracy that our customer can move through our website compared to our competition is being reviewed  how we tell stories to our customer and involve them for consideration as well as purchase  Thinking about digital being a Trojan Horse of the total experience and the true digital touch point as opposed to an independent silo  so enterprise thinking really here as    digital as gateway  So everything from how we feature on our website  how we represent value  how we celebrate key moment and missions and occasions for our customer  as well as the key brands and categories they want to look at is really up for grabs  And we started that work and we ve got support in analyzing that and looking at considerations like speed  agility and how we profile brands  price points and storytelling and key promotions  So all of that is being looked at and we re deep in that at the moment  So we hope to get some traction on that very quickly in half one and be established and ready for the all important second half 
Josh Kamboj    Morgan Stanley    Analyst

And our next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS  Your line is open 
Atul Maheshwari    UBS    Analyst
This is Atul Maheshwari on for Michael Lasser  Thanks a lot for taking our questions  So Mark  based on your initial assessment of the Company s cost structure  where do you think are the key opportunities to cut costs  what are the biggest buckets and how much do you think of the cost savings realized that you will have to reinvest back into the business  And then along those lines  can you provide your initial assessment of which areas of the business need the most investments  Thank you 
Mark J  Tritton    President and Chief Executive Officer
Right  So I think that as we look at the buckets  we definitely see improvement in our COGS and we re deep in negotiation process to revise our costs and work with our vendor base  as well as we look to the more long term proposition of how we build out our own brand capabilities and invest in better price points and therefore better margins  so COGS is going to be one of those considerations  I think the across the board  we ve seen and then pre identified through the transformation programs opportunities to create efficiency and effectiveness in how we work  And when we think more than enterprise and work more    with more agility  we can actually reduce some of these costs 
We ve looked at all the buckets and I m not going to specify which ones at this point because we re still work in flight  Phonetic   Where we see investing is really going to be  where I talked about in those five pillars  We invest in our experience through our place  in our people through our team and our product and our promise  And so  we re going to reach out value  And clearly from what I ve stated  digital will be one of the key areas  but the physical touch point of the stores and the digital touch point in tandem being reconstructed and renovated is going to be a key focus

And your next question comes from Brad Thomas from KeyBanc Capital  Your line is open 
Brad Thomas    KeyBanc Capital    Analyst
Yes  hi  Thanks for taking my question  And welcome to Bed Bath   Beyond  Mark 
Mark J  Tritton    President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi  Brad 
Brad Thomas    KeyBanc Capital    Analyst
I wanted to first ask kind of a high level question with the fourth quarter  I guess at a high level  Mark  I was hoping you could help us think about the near term opportunities to improve merchandising and sourcing and costs that do seem to be pretty tremendous as we look at the Company from the outside  and just your willingness to try to harvest them and flow them through to the bottom line in the shorter term versus that opportunity  maybe reinvest in the business for the longer term  and just how you re thinking about balancing those two  And then just as it relates to the fourth quarter  I was hoping you could give us a little more color around how December played out and if we should be thinking of that versus the negative 8  comp that you reported or the negative 3 6  adjusted  just as we try to calibrate our models for the fourth quarter  Any more color you can provide would be helpful 
Mark J  Tritton    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes  So  Brad  let me take the first piece  which is harvesting the merchandising benefit  As I expressed little earlier  we re knee deep in that at the moment  I m really pleased with the pace and what change looks like there in terms of harvesting better COGS and really looking to curate our assortment  I think one of the real strengths of the season when we re under pressure is that we re able to maintain our inventories and always look at that mix of sales growth versus inventory growth  and the team has done a great job in terms of keeping the lid on inventory and really culling through that aged and excess inventory side of the business  So  that s a real strength  It help set us up for 2020 in a really positive way 
As I mentioned earlier  the ideas around harvesting our own brand opportunities is one that needs a deep portfolio review and I ve already conducted that  and we ve begun the process of that  but that s not an overnight sensation  and we want to get it right  But we will reconstruct our offer with a definitive mix of own brand curated with national brand to create an unique and differentiated home authority  And so that s clearly on the agenda  Time of harvest  size of harvest  stay tuned  I m going to come back when we    in spring  outline our overall plan and that s what we re very actively working on at the moment 
In terms of Q4  we re still in the middle of that and we re not going to be declaring any numbers there  but we have said that we continue to remain under pressure  and we re working through how we re performing there and we have a number of balls in the air on what our options are and how we are going to come out 
So again  not offering that at the moment  but thanks for your question

And your next question comes from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse  Your line is open 
Seth Sigman    Credit Suisse    Analyst
Hey guys  thanks for taking the question  So I m curious on the holiday performance  you talked about that 7 1  comp over the five day holiday period  You also mentioned that this was the first Black Friday campaign you ve had  So I assume that helped  Anything else you would highlight that drove that positive comp  And if you could give us some perspective on how that exact period performed in prior years  maybe just last year to put it in context  that would be helpful 
Mark J  Tritton    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  So  I can give you an overview and Robyn can add some color to the actual numbers  You know  I think  Seth  the issue for us was in the    sum  Phonetic  of the quarter  the Thanksgiving came in the closing days and it came with a bang  but our lead in was relatively soft and we did    we did lack great traffic  enough to compensate and balance out our full quarter and that s a huge learning for us and we won t repeat that in 2020 
But what we did see is  not only being open  Phonetic  an extra day  but we started entering into the Thanksgiving period and we saw real pressure on sales and we realized that some of our activity in digital by trying to remain independently profitable in that space and not thinking about the gateway experience on the Thanksgiving period was distorting our true price of value equation and what we could mean to the customer at that time 
We made really sharp pivot and I was really proud of the team  and we instantly saw key items were winning share back  We were watching it hour by hour  And we re able to do that digital first  of course  because of our agility  they are having a stronger presence in store  signage and offers and we think that s something we can still move more assertively on next year and combining that 360 experience  They all lend itself to a much stronger period 
Again  late in the quarter and only a small part of our overall performance  but they did give us green shoots of opportunity to say when we act and think differently  we can win and our customers loves us and trust us  We ve just got to let them in the door 
Robyn D Elia    Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
And just regarding    regarding the numbers  we were pleased that when we made those changes we were able to deliver positive results  although in that window in that five day window between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday  having a positive over 5  comp in stores and a positive over 13  in digital is a very different trajectory than what we thought

And our next question comes from Oliver Wintermantel from Evercore  Your line is open 
Oliver Wintermantel    Evercore ISI    Analyst
Yeah  thanks  I had a    Mark  you mentioned five pillars  So I just want to focus on two of those  One  you mentioned omni channel and multi channel investments and the other one was price investments in your prepared remarks  So I don t want to put words in your mouth  but is it fair to assume that in this transition period are you focusing more on top line growth than on margins to get    get the top line going and maybe invest in margins  Is that the fair assumption 
Mark J  Tritton    President and Chief Executive Officer
I think that s a little too general  I mean I think we re looking in a very balanced way between sales and gross margin  What we are recognizing now Oliver is the need to ensure that in this new digital world and new retail environment that we are ensuring that traffic flows in the right way  and that we re in the consideration pool appropriately for our customer  So competitively priced  and realistically priced in the market becomes the investment that we need to make  I am not a stranger of this  I ve been through it before  converting promotional sales or clearance sales to regular price sales and it can be meaningful to our business in terms of our overall sales and stabilize gross margin 
So we re looking at the balance of those two  It s a word that I m using frequently here  and it s quite deliberate  We re not just driving top line sales at the sacrifice of 
Oliver Wintermantel    Evercore ISI    Analyst
Got it  thanks  And for    just as a follow up  you mentioned that the real estate strategy and that s under review  Have you    have you talked about the different    the different brands that you own what the strategy is there 
Mark J  Tritton    President and Chief Executive Officer

And our next question comes from Steve Forbes from Guggenheim  Your line is open 
Steven Forbes    Guggenheim Securities LLC    Analyst
Good evening  I wanted to start with a follow up on the promotional plans you discussed  And maybe to start on that  maybe if you can sort of give us some color and expand on the decision during the quarter or I guess over the past four  Phonetic  months to    do the 25  off the entire purchase multiple times  And the reason I ask right is just looking for some insight into the customer response  And then  also just maybe how that relates to your initial take mark on the value proposition of the Beyond Plus membership program  given that there is some inherent value right with those member s abilities to utilize coupons all the time and the frequency    increase in the frequency and the depth of the coupon for everyone  sort of the distorts the value  So just love to hear how you re sort of balancing promotional efforts with the Beyond Plus membership program 
Mark J  Tritton    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  So  in terms of the Thanksgiving period  this was the first time that we actually deployed an active mass promotional strategy  not a coupon strategy  And I think that  what we did inside there is we distracted  so there was an absolute  And I think it talked clearly and resonated fairly with the customer about value  And that s a really tight microcosm of time with its hyper focus on price and value and discounts in the market 
So  it s not a long running opportunity and not a massively repeatable one  But what we see that we can strike with a simple effective promotion and they won t be as steep as we ve shown here  This was the    as I said in the time and place  Phonetic   we ll balance that out with the portfolio of regular coupon and meaningful promotions 
So  we re currently reviewing the results that we ve had and helping to shape how that becomes more meaningful effort throughout our 2020 plans  So more to follow on that 
So the other part of your question  can you just repeat that for me 
Steven Forbes    Guggenheim Securities LLC    Analyst
Maybe just your initial perception right of the value proposition of the Beyond Plus membership program 
Mark J  Tritton    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah 
Steven Forbes    Guggenheim Securities LLC    Analyst
Yes  Because    Obviously  part of that is that 20  off coupon every day  every item  If there is going to be a change in the promotional plan here  it distorts the value  So  just love to hear your initial perception 
Mark J  Tritton    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  I mean I think we are kind of putting it out for a total review across the Board  I think what we see is that we have a guest who is incredibly loyal and how do we reward them  but how do we engage them  And I think they re looking for both  And so  I think the Beyond Plus 20  off is one strategy and one offer that we ve used  and I think there is probably several more notes that we can add into that to play it a different way 
But again  it s about a major response between the action and co reaction of each of those pieces promo  Beyond Plus coupon and regular price  And so  we are reviewing those in real time at the moment  It s definitely an area of focus for us

Thanks Jon 
Jonathan Matuszewski    Jefferies    Analyst
Appreciate that we ll be    Yeah  of course  Appreciate we ll be getting more color on the timing of potential divestitures in a few months with a broader vision  but what are the parameters you will be using to prioritize in deciding which concepts you deem is core and which you deem as less important to the new Bed Bath 
Mark J  Tritton    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  It s a great question  I think the great spot that we re in is  we    the criteria isn t necessarily cash because we are so cash rich and we can add to that to invest in that business and do another    a number of different things  The criteria really is around what do we see is fundamentally connected to our core and that we can build sustainable growth and really build equity in over time and also to what is an addition to our current workload or a subtraction to our current workload and our focus  So our portfolio is wide  They re all strong and they are all great assets  But who do we want to be in    you know  one  two  three years time  I think we want to see ourselves as a core nucleus of brands and businesses that are inter related and that can support one another and create true economies of scale  So that s part of the criteria that we re using as we assess 
Jonathan Matuszewski    Jefferies    Analyst
That s helpful  And just a quick follow up  You mentioned the vendor collaboration program  I think slated for later this year  Maybe just if you could just share kind of your vision for what that will become and what Bed Bath is seeking to achieve there 
Mark J  Tritton    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  I think overall  I see vendors as a major key to the door  in terms of our future success that vested in us  and we work as key partners  And I think we can double down on the partnership  And that really stems from a level of data  understanding our customer and their needs  and really tapping into our vendors for their strength  And I think that that s an opportunity for us to be more symbiotic in the way that we work and transferring of information and opportunity between us  It is  I think  one of the hallmarks of how I ve operated in the past  I really want to double down on that here at Bed Bath   Beyond 
As I said  I ve only been here 66 days and we ve been doing a lot of things  One of the things I look forward to with my new team is really establishing a much deeper and closer relationship with our vendor partners along with more intuitive data to be able to make real time business decisions  meet our customer needs and all of this prosper

My first question is around omni channel  You suggested a key piece of your turnaround plan is to build a true omni channel retailer  Which retailers do you view as best in class in this regard  Phonetic  already  and will you use these retailers as a road map for your transformation 
Mark J  Tritton    President and Chief Executive Officer
You know  great questions  I mean I think that I m    we are looking at the total marketplace and really trying to understand the customer  how the customer has learnt new ways of shopping and new ways of interacting and really looking at all those best practices across the board  And the key elements of those are really around a digital first strategy  what we re calling on omni always and really thinking about digital as a gateway experience like we ve seen some great statistics within the quarter that saw how mobile conversion outpaced our desktop conversion for the very first time and that s with the app playing a great role and we think that it can be even more prevalent in the way that we interact with the customer 
We see that even convenience is a very important part of our business and I think that the last 12 months  two years has really seen a renaissance in the interconnection between digital and physical especially around both this way  there has been a lot of growth  And I don t think we ve been geared effectively for that and I think we ve been missing out on that opportunity  We ve seen some really great double digit comp growth in our robust business  but that is reserve online  buy on store  which is still creating friction for the guests to have to go through the actual purchase at the store 
We re going to move to frictionless purchasing in early 2020 as we move into a BOPIS environment  which we see a competition already flourishing in that 
So we have big eyes and ears and really looking at that competition and seeing how they re succeeding  but also how they re influencing future guest behavior  And we re looking to more quickly come on board with that  We know that we have been behind in that  And that s everything from assortment  pricing  how we represent online and in store  how we make it easier for customers to shop  All these are highly emulatable  But  we also want to make sure that during that process  we are creating an unique and differentiated model from other retailers  So influence  Yes  Copying  No 
And we have a great opportunity being a single authority in the home space to create a really unique 360 omni always environment that I look forward to fast tracking and sharing with you guys

I guess    well  jeez  one and a follow up here  I ll start with the    just the private brand strategy  because obviously that s something that you come with very fresh and a lot of experience in  I m just curious what the    what the infrastructure needs are and what needs to be put in place for you to kind of push that initiative at the level  I assume you want to push it  Is it in place already  Is there a lot of investment has to take place  Just curious  your thoughts around on that in terms of private brands 
Mark J  Tritton    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  And so creating an owned brand stable really does take two things  I mean  it takes a talented team  it takes a clear strategy  but also takes great partners  And we re cultivating all three at the moment  We have an existing team who are very strong  We re currently deepening our partnership work  Our team has been out in Asia working through that in the December period to fast track that  We see tons of upside in terms of our COGS assessment by converting discretionary labeled into a more meaningful owned brand portfolio and that s high on our agenda 
There will be some infrastructure investments to get even greater talent to add to our team  to get the job done  But this is why we are currently in  Indecipherable  looking at our overall SG A to make sure that we can really recut  Phonetic  our operations to self fund and drive these businesses  We see setting up this team in full  but still creating operational efficiencies and cost savings to our SG A  as a result  But we re really excited to build off that team and build a portfolio and a staged set of events as I ve done in prior companies around the introduction of owned and defendable brands that you can only find in Bed Bath   Beyond and in our portfolio  It s not as we have to design  source  create brands move forward  That s not an overnight sensation but I m really excited about what I m seeing as the early footprint of what we re going to be doing there

Yeah  Actually  we were just reviewing some data around that yesterday and some really    some very positive signs there  I think that that s been a tougher market for everyone in total  but particularly in our baby business  we ve been gaining market share as a result of our registry and we re building deeper trust and engagement with our customers  And I think that it s a way that we can reignite our engagement even further  We ve seen some declines in our overall sales in registry  while still maintaining a very high share penetration in the registry space  We are known for this  I think it s something we won t ignore and we ll find ways to ignite  Phonetic  it inside our strategic plan  If you kind of think about the combination of really unique product offerings through our brand and the power of registry and the power of BOPIS and the power of digital  you start to really get a new frontier and the way that we can drive our business

160609,382125,BBBY,4 Lessons Bed Bath   Beyond Can Take From Williams Sonoma,news,"When I got married  the registry of choice for most of my crowd was Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY   for its huge selection and cash back policy for returned gifts 
Today  better options have arisen  I find Bed Bath   Beyond s store layout large and confusing and the product line outdated  This sentiment is corroborated by a growing string of revenue declines  and the company is finally taking action by hiring a new CEO and executive lineup to turn the tide 
Williams Sonoma  NYSE WSM   on the other hand  is an upscale brand that has managed to reach a mass audience while retaining an upmarket image and improving sales  Here are four ways the kitchen and home connoisseur has achieved this  and the lessons Bed Bath   Beyond can learn as it embarks on an overhaul 

1  Use a smaller store format
While Bed Bath   Beyond has mega size stores  with products piled high in every direction  Williams Sonoma has smaller stores where customers can find what they need and feel connected to the staff  It was never meant to be a superstore  its goal is to create connection and engagement  This is one of its keys to success 
Bed Bath   Beyond was a hit in the mega store generation  and its total revenue  including all store brands  was  12 billion for fiscal year 2018  versus  5 7 billion for Williams Sonoma for the same time period  But shrinking stores is an approach many other large retailers are implementing as more shopping moves online  Customers are utilizing features such as buy online  pickup in store to make purchases more easily  and oversized stores are hard to navigate while offering fewer benefits  such as client engagement  


Bed Bath   Beyond s new CEO  Mark Tritton  came over from Target  which has been working with a small store format that s been a growth driver  Hopefully  he can turn some of that know how into a source of positive change for the company 
Target s small format stores  at an average of 40 000 square feet  are similar in size to standard Bed Bath   Beyond stores  but they carry a greater mix of products  The success of these stores highlights the value in curating the right product assortment and showcasing it in a smaller and more easily navigable space 

2  Be a digital first company
Williams Sonoma is aggressively pursuing online growth  where the greatest opportunities lie  While Bed Bath   Beyond was slow to adopt technology  Williams Sonoma was putting all of its catalogs online and forging a multichannel strategy  It has zeroed in on how its customers want to shop and responded appropriately 
Williams Sonoma was a catalog company well before the digital revolution  so it already had stocked warehouses and fully equipped shipping operations when online shopping became a part of retail  This gave it a leg up  and transitioning to the e commerce era was more seamless than it might have been for a company like Bed Bath   Beyond 
Bed Bath   Beyond has also had good reason to move cautiously in the e commerce arena  as it serves a cheaper price point than Williams Sonoma  This makes the logistics of shipping more challenging  While Williams Sonoma can afford the cost of shipping for its high priced products  Bed Bath   Beyond is competing against the likes of Amazon and Target and needs to offer similar shipping options and prices  However  25 years is enough time for Bed Bath   Beyond to have figured things out in e commerce  and that s what it will need to do to survive 

3  Give customers what they want  instead of everything
Williams Sonoma positions itself as a  multichannel specialty retailer of high quality products for the home   It has several distinct brands designed to appeal to different customers  instead of trying to be everything to everyone  Still  each brand has the Williams Sonoma image  with varying product lines at different price points  In fact  the company considers West Elm  its budget brand  as its biggest growth opportunity  This is an important point for Bed Bath   Beyond  since it doesn t have the same exclusive image that Williams Sonoma has 
There are a few ways Bed Bath   Beyond can implement this type of strategy  One would be to break out different brands to reach different market segments 
The better way to do this would be to simply stop offering numerous  indistinguishable options for the same product  Doing so would help control inventory and allow the company to easily decrease store size without sacrificing name recognition and value  Activist investors made this point in their appeal to overthrow the executive team last year  proposing that the company  supply a compelling  well curated assortment of products   

4  Create an experience
A unique customer experience is another factor that keeps Williams Sonoma from falling victim to Amazon  Its customers aren t looking for a deal  they want a specialty shop that provides an experience they can only find in store  and they ll pay a premium for it 
CEO Laura Alber calls Williams Sonoma the  poignant intersection of superior lifestyle merchandising and state of the art analytics   If the store sells several types of olive oil  a staff member might offer a taste test and recommendations for how to best use each one  Or the store might feature a demonstration of cookware  so customers can decide which pots best fit their needs  This was another recommendation the Bed Bath   Beyond activist investors made  to  recapture space for experiential customer engagement  
Williams Sonoma may have a different image than Bed Bath   Beyond  but the latter consumer discretionary company seems to be aimless right now  Finding its position  whatever it might be  will help the company mold itself into a leaner  more productive entity  That might mean a reduction in sales while it improves its condition  but either way  it will result in a better managed company with enhanced long term prospects ",2020-01-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pew5x,2054006
160610,382126,BBBY,Why is Bed Bath   Beyond Selling Half Its Real Estate ,news,"It s obvious things are bad at Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY   but were they so bad it needed to sell its headquarters and half its real estate  Well  yes  actually  For a business that once regularly touted how well it was able to generate cash  more recently the home goods retailer has been left scrounging in the couch cushions trying to dig up change 
But it just came up with a fistful of coins  and an odd assortment of hair clips  some old Cheerios  and a couple of dust bunnies  as it announced it sold 2 1 million square feet of commercial space in a sale leaseback arrangement with private equity that will net it about  250 million 
The deal includes its executive offices  a distribution center  and a whole bunch of its retail stores  but the quick infusion of cash gives it some breathing space as it readies a third quarter earnings report that s expected to be terrible 

From landlord to tenant
Bed Bath   Beyond has hinted strongly it needs to take action to unlock the value squirreled away on its balance sheet  whether it s the real estate it owns or the multitude of businesses it runs  While much of the speculation has centered on the latter  management told investors last quarter there was actually a lot of interest in its property and it was mulling over the offers  Then interim CEO Mary Winston said the sale leaseback  could generate significant cash for the company  
The retailer sold the real estate to Oak Street Real Estate Capital  but will continue to occupy the properties under long term leases 
A sale leaseback can be a cheaper option than owning the real estate outright  Instead of being a landowner  which isn t the business Bed Bath   Beyond is in  it will become a tenant  with the resulting capital freed up for use in the business  But it also turns what is an asset on its balance sheet into a liability  which could increase its costs and restrict its ability to finance its needs  
Cash is still king
While the  250 million is a sizable amount  generating cash has never really been a problem for Bed Bath   Beyond and it even ended the second quarter with almost  900 million in cash and equivalents  But where it used to be able to generate  1 billion or more in free cash flow  or the money left over after it pays its bills that it can use to invest in its business or return to shareholders  that has been greatly reduced 
At the end of the last quarter  it had generated just  270 million worth of free cash flow over the prior 12 months  about a third of what it produced two years ago  It indicates just how far Bed Bath   Beyond s business has fallen and why new CEO Mark Tritton cleaned out the C suite of holdover executives 
A full plate
The fiscal third quarter is probably not going to be a good one  It had a substantial amount of inventory it needed to clear out    some  1 billion worth over the next 18 months  It took a charge of  194 million related to that inventory  and while Bed Bath   Beyond believes that is all the writedowns it will need to take  that s still a lot of inventory it needs to work through that will be a drag on earnings and margins 
Bed Bath   Beyond said it s going to use the proceeds from the sale leaseback deal to reinvest in the business  buy back stock  and pay down debt  Share repurchases would seem to be a use of cash that it shouldn t bother with right now as it has more pressing matters than propping up earnings for investors  
It still needs to figure out a way to get people shopping its brand again  whether it s at its physical stores or online  It s said it has targeted  350 million to  375 million in capital expenditures for 2019  with at least half going to technology  which is important  because much of what it sells can be found online at Amazon com  Walmart  and elsewhere and it needs to differentiate itself to consumers to stand out 
Quick action is needed
Tritton is taking a lot of bold actions since moving over from Target and taking control of the home goods retailer  and while the shot of cash Bed Bath   Beyond gets from the deal gives it some breathing space  it s essentially a one time infusion that will quickly mean little if it can t get its business fixed 
Pursuing strategies that result in a short term boost to earnings without addressing the underlying problem of why its business was deteriorating in the first place only ensures that Bed Bath   Beyond will eventually be back where it began ",2020-01-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pexjf,2054079

160625,382141,BBBY,Stock Charts To Watch,opinion,"Bed Bath   Beyond Inc    NASDAQ BBBY   a new swing for us  made an announcement on Thursday that they have a new CEO in house  That stock exploded on the news  jumping nearly 52 million shares  up 2 15  or 21 58   to 12 09  on a breakaway gap  It had been in a downtrend since May  then ran up  platformed  and broke out  I think we re going to see 14  16  and 18 going forward 
Golar LNG Limited  NASDAQ GLNG  broke out of a new head and shoulder s type bottom on Thursday  through the 50 day  on 1 15  or 8 74  to 14 31  on 2 2 million shares  That s the biggest volume in a month  I think that this stock will accelerate  and  perhaps  retest the 15 16 zone  If it gets through there  we re looking at 18 1 2 as the next target 
NovoCure Limited  NASDAQ NVCR  jumped 2 97  or 4 1   to 75 49  on 1 1 million shares on Thursday  It has multiple waves up and a beautiful  long term trend  After getting up to 99  and change  it came down  but in the last sixty days it has held the 72 range three times  I would stop under that  but if you see it get up to 77 1 4  then  I think  it might make a quick run to 83  92 and 99

160626,382142,BBBY,Rally Hats On  But Game Far From Over On Trade,opinion," Friday  Market Open  Like a playoff baseball game with lots of twists and turns  we ll probably have to go inning by inning as news trickles out today on trade talks  Whether the last at bat is a strikeout or a solid base hit  a home run seems unlikely  could help determine whether this early rally in stock futures is justified 
It seems like a long time since Monday s selloff when trade hopes dimmed  Now the base coach appears to be waving runners on as expectations climb for some sort of progress  Stocks are on track for their third straight day of rallying 
All this backs up what we said here on Monday about the chance of something positive coming out of this week even if a full deal seems unlikely  Back then  we discussed how it doesn t seem prudent to get too optimistic or pessimistic  because a lot can still happen and it s unlikely this week s negotiations will be the ultimate word  
If the two countries can agree on some minor steps  like a possible delay in the U S  tariff increase set for Oct  15  some news outlets say that s a possible outcome   maybe that would put the market in a better mood and perhaps help lower volatility levels  On the other hand  if things go south today always a possibility sentiment could head down faster than the Chicago Cubs  2019 playoff hopes 
Positive comments yesterday from President Trump and confirmation he d meet today with China s vice premier are two reasons for optimism  What s really interesting is that for apparently the first time  there are signs China might agree to some things beyond buying more U S  products 
China s securities regulator announced on Friday a timetable for scrapping foreign ownership limits in futures  securities and mutual fund companies  Reuters reported  That looks like a real example of solid progress in the talks  If anything gets announced today  it s going to be important for that to be included  
Several Fed speakers are on the prowl today  so that s another thing to keep an eye on other than trade talks  Also  Michigan sentiment is due later this morning  see more below   Earnings season starts next week with six major banks set to report 
Commitment to Upside Still Seems LackingThe mood definitely improved Thursday  especially in trade sensitive sectors like Materials  Industrials  and Technology  but with a sense that many people are holding back  There s plenty of muscle memory about how often markets climbed on positive trade tidings only to fall again on the next negative tweet  That could help explain why despite the rally over the last two days  the S P 500 Index  SPX  didn t really push too hard toward recent highs  It finished yesterday just on the green side of its 50 day moving average now near 2935 To see where sentiment really improved  it s arguably better to look at the bond market  After falling to near three year lows down around 1 5  earlier this week  the 10 year yield has stormed back to 1 71  by early today  That s below recent highs of around 1 9   but enough to have some analysts talking about a potential double bottom for yields  A  double bottom  in technical terms can sometimes mean the lows are in  though there s no guarantee  Also  a double bottom hasn t been established yet on the daily charts There definitely aren t any guarantees as long as the bond market stays hyper focused on trade  If the Chinese and Americans go back to their corners with no decision this week  or if economic data start to flag  those yields could turn lower again  It s arguably way too soon to use the words  bottom  and  yields  in the same sentence  Still  the move this week looks constructive  Gold fell yesterday  too  perhaps on trade optimism One other possible reason bonds and gold got sold off yesterday could have been weekly jobless claims  A few weeks ago we pointed out that many analysts are giving the weekly claims number each Thursday a bit more attention than they used to  because this number could be a possible early sign of any softness in demand for workers  Claims of 210 000 came in below the average Wall Street estimate of 218 000  Behind the Scenes  Key Technology Downgrade Worth Monitoring
One thing you might not want to lose in the shuffle as hopes build for some sort of temporary trade deal is a downgrade of Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  by Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  yesterday  There s no need to go over all the analyst s specific points  which you can find in the online news coverage  What really stood out is that the analyst based his downgrade in part on the chance of deteriorating enterprise spending  If that s actually the trend  it could be a big deal in coming months not just for CSCO  but for others in the sector  too  including semiconductor companies 
CSCO is seen as a barometer of the worldwide economy overall because it sells so many enterprise products that underpin the Technology industry  like switches  routers  and wireless  Yesterday s GS note said spending on enterprise products has fallen recently 
It probably goes back to the tariff situation  In a world where things are undefined  companies often won t spend on infrastructure  Even if the trade situation is settled by spring  that means two or three more quarterly earnings cycles where companies can t discuss the infrastructure situation and risk getting further behind the eight ball  If companies can t plan  that hurts suppliers like CSCO 
All this puts more focus on CSCO s earnings call expected in mid November  Not many companies have a better sense of the worldwide picture  so it might be interesting to hear what CSCO executives have to say about the economic slowdown in Europe and Asia  and to see their guidance  That s probably a month away  though  In the meantime  semiconductor companies reporting later this month might give an earlier look at the state of the Technology sector 
In other sector and company news  shares of Bed  Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  shot up more than 20  yesterday after the company announced a new CEO  That was quite the welcome

		          2x    
FIGURE 1  DOUBLING DOWN ON 10 YEAR  This six month chart of the 10 year Treasury yield  TNX   has some market watchers suggesting the possibility of a  double bottom   From a technical perspective  this week s quick recovery from recent lows looks like it could signal a trend reversal  but remember some analysts earlier this year thought the 10 year yield made a double bottom above 2   That one didn t hold and it looked more like the classic double bottom  Data Source  Cboe Global Markets  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results   
Zero Point Zero  That s the state of the Consumer Price Index  CPI  in September  Flat  Zero  The news was arguably even more negative earlier this week on the Producer Price Index  PPI  side  where the headline number actually fell 0 3  in September  On a positive note  core CPI did rise 2 4  year over year  which does presumably reflect at least some inflation in the economy 
While it might be nice to pay lower prices for gas and other items  flat or falling inflation doesn t paint the most glowing picture  and it s going to be interesting to see whether those weak inflation readings get reflected in today s October consumer sentiment report from the University of Michigan  The report  due later this morning  could get a closer look than usual due in part not just to weak inflation  but also the soft manufacturing data last week  slowing jobs growth  and other signs of weakness like auto sales  The housing market has improved lately  so that s one positive the report might pick up  Last time out  headline sentiment was 93 2  but analysts expect a drop to 89 9 for this one  It was 100 as recently as May 
Big Bank Bonanza Next Week  The focus on trade that s had markets in an iron grip over the last week or two might finally get some competition when Tuesday arrives  That s when earnings season informally begins  with Q3 results on the way from six of the most closely watched banks   Citigroup   NYSE C   JP Morgan  NYSE JPM   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   and  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  all start things off Tuesday morning before the open  so expect a lot of headlines and maybe some confusion and volatility that morning as investors try to make sense of all the numbers  You might remember that during Q2 earnings season  Financial sector results helped renew investor confidence in the U S  consumer  The question heading into Q3 is whether banking executives still see the same kind of strength  and if they think it can continue amid trade wars  Brexit  and signs of weakness in the U S  economy 
If you re keeping score at home  the emphasis with banks this time around might be less on the actual earnings results which are expected to fall slightly from a year ago for the sector  according to FactSet but on how the executives frame last quarter and the coming months  If you re going to only have time to listen to a handful of earnings conference calls  maybe consider the Financial ones  because these executives have a 20 000 foot view of most aspects of business and consumer trends and moods 
Pump Down the Volume  We talked a bit yesterday about how confusing all these headlines on the trade talks can be  Well  it looks like some people are just giving up and staying on the sidelines  Market volume sank mid week  and Briefing com said this might reflect that  participants have no idea what side they should be on at the moment   It s not a bad idea  necessarily  to restrain from trading when the market is see sawing this way  When the major indices are down 1  on one day and up 1  the next day all due to headline noise  it s often a good idea to stop watching all the minute by minute clicks  stop checking your portfolio gains and losses  and remind yourself why you ve invested in the first place 
October tends to be a volatile month  and this one is living up to its reputation  The CBOE Volatility Index flirted with 20 earlier this week from below 13 back in mid summer  Despite all the back and forth  the S P 500 Index  SPX  just hasn t moved much  It s up just 1 2  over the last year  So we ve had a lot of noise and bumps on a trip that took us basically nowhere  despite what you might think if you were watching every tick

160642,382158,BBBY,U S  SEC charges Shopin blockchain startup CEO with coin offering fraud,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK  Reuters    The chief executive of Shopin was charged on Wednesday by the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission with defrauding investors in a  42 5 million initial coin offering by falsely telling them that his blockchain startup had close ties to major retailers and a Silicon Valley entrepreneur 
Eran Eyal  44  a dual citizen of South Africa and Israel who lives in Brooklyn  New York  also pleaded guilty to criminal charges brought by the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James  the SEC said 
A lawyer for Eyal and Shopin did not immediately respond to requests for comment  Neither the SEC nor James  office responded to similar requests  The SEC did not describe the criminal charges 
In its civil complaint against Eyal and Shopin  the SEC said Eyal promised investors who bought digital tokens that their money would go toward creating  universal shopper profiles  that would track customer purchases across online retailers and recommend products 
The regulator said Eyal falsely claimed that the platform had been tested successfully at Bed Bath   Beyond  O BBBY  and Ermenegildo Zegna  and that Shopin received steady monthly payments through partnerships with several retailers 
It also said Shopin listed the Silicon Valley entrepreneur as an adviser for about four months after he asked them to stop 
Eyal  meanwhile  misappropriated some funds to pay for personal expenses such as rent  shopping  entertainment and a dating service  the SEC said 
The SEC is seeking to recoup ill gotten gains and obtain other remedies  It did not identify the Silicon Valley entrepreneur 
According to the complaint  Shopin s offering was conducted between August 2017 and April 2018 through a  pre sale  of tokens to wealthy and other investors  and an initial coin offering to the general public 
Shopin s legal name is UnitedData Inc  the SEC said 
The case was announced one day after SEC Chairman Jay Clayton told a U S  Senate committee that the regulator is devoting  significant  resources to digital assets  in a approach meant to foster innovation and capital formation while protecting investors and markets 
In April  the SEC issued an  investor alert  warning people to beware of claims it had  approved  initial coin offerings ",2019-12-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-sec-charges-shopin-blockchain-startup-ceo-with-coin-offering-fraud-2039478,2039478
160643,382159,BBBY,Does Bed Bath   Beyond s Clean Sweep Signal Tough Times Ahead ,news,"It didn t take Mark Tritton  the new CEO at Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY   very long to get everyone s attention  Just two months into his new job  the massive purge of a half dozen executives has shown everyone it s no longer business as usual at the home goods retailer 
Yet as Bed Bath   Beyond heads into its fiscal third quarter earnings report next week  the wholesale elimination of the C suite suggests that Tritton  a former Target executive  saw the pending results as an indication the holidays were going to woefully underperform expectations  If he wanted to salvage the retailer  he needed to start fresh 

Even the best laid plans go awry
Net sales at Bed Bath   Beyond are down 7  through the first six months of the fiscal year  and it is running a cumulative loss of almost  510 million  or over  4 per share  as the impact of firing employees  before the executive purge  and large inventory writedowns have taken their toll 
After second quarter earnings  then interim CEO Mary Winston had said she was confident the retailer s plans to stabilize sales were working and that the results would manifest themselves in the back half of the year 
Bed Bath   Beyond was refreshing 160 of its highest volume  most profitable stores to improve traffic  and providing store managers with new incentives to hit their sales targets  The retailer was also targeting its Beyond Plus loyalty program members with new marketing because they tend to shop twice as frequently as nonmembers while spending four times as much 
Perhaps most notable was Bed Bath   Beyond s plan to cut back on its ubiquitous coupons that have been a source of frustration for the retailer  While they typically drive traffic to the stores  they also cut into the bottom line 
Instead  Bed Bath   Beyond was going to plow the savings from that program into new marketing initiatives in digital channels  including video  paid social media  and display advertising  It wasn t doing away completely with the coupons  but they would be used more sparingly 
Subverting expectations
But the latest housecleaning    which saw the retailer s chief merchandising officer  chief marketing officer  chief digital officer  chief legal officer  chief brand officer  and chief administrative officer all get the boot    suggests the plans weren t working 
The retailer hasn t reported a single quarter of higher same store sales in almost three years  and the changes being implemented might not have changed that trajectory  Worse  they might not have even slowed the decline 
Analysts had been looking forward to the store resets  new marketing around the holidays  and other initiatives  But despite needing a killer Black Friday and Christmas holiday  it increasingly looks as if that might not be the case 
It was probably unwise to expect much change in such a short time  as altering consumer discretionary spending habits isn t easy  and Bed Bath   Beyond s business has been deteriorating for years  But there was probably hope that the strategies would impede the worst aspects of the decline 
A lump of coal for Christmas
It s also why investors will probably be disappointed when results are reported on Jan  8  
Since Tritton s appointment in October  shares of Bed Bath   Beyond are up over 40   and they ve more than doubled from the lows they hit back in August  A lot of the gains were predicated on the potential Tritton brings to the position  but it s likely the retailer s stock has gotten well ahead of itself 
Analysts are looking for a 6  decline in revenue in the fiscal third quarter to  2 86 billion  down from  3 03 billion a year ago  Earnings are forecast to come in at  0 03 per share  an 84  plunge from last year s third quarter results of  0 18 per share 
Bed Bath   Beyond didn t provide quarterly guidance  but did reiterate its full year outlook for sales of  11 4 billion  which would be down 5  year over year  and earnings in a range of  2 08 to  2 13 per share  a 2 7  increase at the midpoint 
With the CEO cleaning house as he has  it wouldn t be surprising to see the retailer reset expectations lower  and that may cause the stock to take a tumble ",2020-01-02,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pccsp,2051186

160646,382162,BBBY,Will Bed Bath   Beyond Disappoint Investors With Its Latest Earnings Report ,news,"Investors sent Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  shares on a roller coaster ride in 2019 due to pessimism around a sharp sales decline coupled with rising confidence in management s turnaround plan  The stock had been down as much as 30  at one point in the year but rallied to a yearly gain of over 50  in the final weeks of 2019 
That rally raises the stakes for the retailer when it announces its quarterly earnings on Jan  8  Let s look at a few metrics that might determine whether Bed Bath   Beyond s rally continues into 2020 

Fixing those growth trends
The chain s previous earnings report contained plenty of bad news on the growth front  The company said in early October that sales fell 7  in the quarter  with traffic falling both in stores and in its online selling channel  Those results translate into continued market share losses across its home goods selling categories 
Management is aiming to stabilize sales over the next few quarters  with declines ideally moderating over the holiday shopping period  Investors will know whether that plan is on track by watching the chain s traffic trends and following its outlook updates  As it stands today  Bed Bath   Beyond is predicting that full year sales will land at about  11 4 billion thanks to slightly improving growth trends over the second half of the fiscal year  That prediction could change this week  though  depending on how customers responded to its latest merchandising plan  The company is reporting on its fiscal third quarter  which does not include the full holiday shopping season 
Financial wins
Bed Bath   Beyond s finances have been a bright spot in recent quarters  Sure  the company took a large inventory writedown charge   194 million  heading into the holiday season  Yet its gross profit margin inched higher in the fiscal second quarter as the retailer scaled back on promotions and cut many of its low margin products  Those successes have raised expectations for potentially healthy earnings results for the year even as the company behind the consumer stock deals with major pressures such as tariff charges and a declining sales base 
If Bed Bath   Beyond can navigate through these issues and defend its operating profit margin  it could win some solid momentum for the last few months of its fiscal year 
Management comments
Comments from CEO Mark Tritton on the rebound strategy will likely play a big role in how investors respond to this week s earnings report  The former Target executive has taken an aggressive approach since taking over in November  one that has resulted in the departure of six senior members of the management team 
The good news is that the moves have convinced investors that Bed Bath   Beyond is taking a completely new direction  with everything from real estate moves to major brand divestments on the table  The big question now is whether the company can make progress while stabilizing the business 
The stock price rally to date reflects the hope that Tritton and his new executive team will turn things around  Now comes the hard part  when investors will demand evidence that Bed Bath   Beyond is executing on its aggressively optimistic goals ",2020-01-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pe6-6,2052925

and soft comparable sales  comps   Consequently  the company s stock is losing investor s confidence  Shares of the company have declined 57 8  in a year against the  s growth of 3 7  The company is battling margin pressures for 12 straight quarters now  Higher expenses  including SG A  due to escalated technology related costs coupled with lower merchandise margin have been hurting its margins  In first quarter fiscal 2019  gross margin contracted 50 basis points  bps   Moreover  the company incurred operating loss of  406 8 million against income of  81 2 million in the prior year quarter  This has been denting its bottom line growth  clear from an earnings decline of 68 4  reported in the fiscal first quarter  despite beating estimates  In addition  Bed Bath   Beyond is witnessing soft comps for the last few quarters primarily due to a fall in the number of store transactions  Comps dipped 6 6  in the fiscal first quarter  driven by a decline in comps at stores in a high single digit percentage range  slightly offset by higher comps at customer facing digital channels  Soft comps trend is weighing on the company s top line  which lagged estimates for four straight quarters

resulted in roughly 7  reduction of corporate staff  including vice presidents  directors  managers and professional staff  For fiscal 2019  pre tax net savings are expected to be about  18 9 million  owing to the timing of these changes Additionally  the company continues to target reaching mid and long term revenue growth  near term gross margin expansion  near term SG A improvements  and sustainable outstanding operational support  It expects to boost revenue growth by focusing on portfolio strategy alignment   including product assortment  customer engagement  learnings from Next Generation Lab stores and expanding online experience  Margins are likely to improve through changes in assortment mix to increase sales  supply chain  and modifications in pricing and coupon strategy  Improvements in store labor model  marketing initiatives and lower occupancy expenses are expected to optimize SG A  Furthermore  the company will focus on spending on human capital  data  process

160657,382173,BBBY,Earnings Preview  Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended August 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This home goods retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 29 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  19 4  
Revenues are expected to be  2 77 billion  down 5 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Bed Bath   Beyond 
For Bed Bath   Beyond  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  30 56  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Bed Bath   Beyond will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Bed Bath   Beyond would post earnings of  0 08 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 12  delivering a surprise of  50  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

1  U S  Private Jobs in Focus
Ahead of Friday s nonfarm payrolls due Friday  traders will look to ADP s measure of private sector employment for a readthrough on the labor market 
The report comes at 8 15 AM ET  12 15 GMT  
Economists  on average  expect that private nonfarm payrolls rose by 140 000 last month  down from a gain of 195 000 in August 
Fed speak is also on the calendar with Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker set to deliver a speech at 9 AM ET 
2  Crude Inventories to Build for Third Straight Week 
The Energy Information Administration  EIA  releases its petroleum report on Wednesday  with economists expecting a third consecutive build in domestic crude supplies 
The EIA is expected to report a build in crude stockpiles of about 1 57 million barrels 
Crude oil futures gave up gains to settle at  53 62 a barrel  down 0 8  despite reports that production in the U S  and Russia declined during the third quarter 
Many analysts have downplayed expectations for a ramp up in oil prices  as Saudi Arabia has restored capacity following the Sept  14 attack  which reportedly forced the kingdom to shut down half of its crude production  or roughly 5 7 million barrels a day 
3  Bed Bath   Beyond   Lennar  Earnings in Focus
Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  is set to report earnings after markets close on Wednesday  The company has rung the changes at both board and management level amid pressure from activist investors  There s speculation a new CEO could be announced tomorrow as well

Wedbush said it expects earnings to stabilize  or even grow  over the next two years as the company implements a host of changes  including store remodels  private label brand launches and the sale of non core assets and real estate 
 Second quarter results are likely to fall short of consensus expectations that are not aligned with company guidance  and 2019 guidance could be withdrawn as the company clears inventory  digests list 4 tariffs  the fourth list of good from China subject to tariffs  and gives the new CEO time to evaluate the business   Wedbush said 
The company is expected to report earnings of 29 cents on revenue of  2 76 billion  according to consensus estimates from Investing com 
In the housing sector   Lennar   NYSE LEN  will report earnings before the market opens  with analysts expecting earnings of  1 32 on revenue of  5 48 billion

 This is a bad number  fitting in with the world s manufacturing recession   Jim Bianco  head of Bianco Research in Chicago  said of the ISM report   I think the market is right to be concerned  but we will have to see whether other manufacturing numbers in the U S  bear that out  not the least of which being the manufacturing payroll numbers on Friday

160726,382242,BBBY,Earnings Preview  Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended May 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 10  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This home goods retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 08 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  75  
Revenues are expected to be  2 58 billion  down 6 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Bed Bath   Beyond 
For Bed Bath   Beyond  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Bed Bath   Beyond will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Bed Bath   Beyond would post earnings of  1 11 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 20  delivering a surprise of  8 11  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Bed Bath   Beyond doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-bed-bath--beyond-bbby-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200436819,200436819

11  to  3 307 9 million and also came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 333 million  This downside can be primarily attributed to one less week in the fiscal fourth quarter versus the year ago period  Also  a shift in the calendar negatively impacted the top line Soft comparable sales  comps   which dipped roughly 1 4  mainly due to mid single digit decrease in sales from stores  were probably the reason for the decline  Moreover  soft comps impacted the company s overall sales  which fell short of the estimates and also declined year over year Nevertheless  robust sales at the

million  gross profit margin also contracted 120 basis points  bps  to 34 7   Decline in gross margin was mainly due to lower merchandise margin coupled with higher coupon expenses  Rise in coupon expenses was on account of increased average coupon amount  partly negated by fall in the number of redemptions However  SG A expenses fell 6 3  to  933 7 million in the quarter  As a percentage of net sales  SG A increased 140 bps to 28 2  mainly owing to higher technology related costs  Further  the company reported adjusted operating profit of  213 2 million that tumbled nearly 49 6

reported first quarter 2019 results  Further  total sales marginally came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate after missing the same in the preceding quarter  However  both the top and bottom line

year quarter The company generated total sales of  2 769 million that marginally beat the consensus mark of  2 763 million but declined 2  year over year owing to lower sales in CompuCom and Retail

16   Comparable store sales dropped 4  owing to fall in store traffic  partly offset by rise in conversion rates and surge of 16  in buy on line  pick up in store sales Segment operating income came in at  67 million  down from  72 million in the prior year quarter  The year over year decline can be attributed to deleverage related to closure of outlets  lower sales  and investments in additional service delivery capabilities  Operating margin shrunk 10 bps to 5 7  Total store count at the division was 1 359 at the quarter end  During the reported quarter  the company shuttered two outlets CompuCom Division generated sales of  247 million in the quarter  down 4  year over year on account of weaker than anticipated revenues from existing customer projects  The segment reported operating loss of  15 million compared with operating income of  5 million in the year ago period  This can be attributed to lower sales and less than proportionate fall in related expenses Other Financial

160816,382332,BBBY,Bed Bath   Beyond  Why Bulls Should Wait To Buy,opinion,"Summary 

Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  soared 21  on Tuesday after activist investors announced plans to replace the board and management 
While we do see further upside later in the year  there is likely a better buying opportunity coming 

Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  Stock Weekly Chart 
A group of three activist investors announced their intention to lead an effort to elect a board in favor of reform  The objective is to sell underperforming assets  The group who collectively owns a 5  stake is composed of Ancora Advisors  Legion Partners  and Macellum Advisors 
Bed Bath   Beyond explained in a statement that   We asked on several occasions for ideas for improving our business but they instead they chose to attack and provide their intent to nominate directors to take over the full Board  
In analyzing the market cycles for BBBY  the stock now appears to be late in the rising phase of its current cycle  The current upside move has improved the patterns  overall  with a base being built  We believe the bulls would be better served by waiting for the next cyclical corrective phase to complete  giving a more favorable entry in the May time frame ",2019-03-27,Steve Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bed-bath-and-beyond-wakes-up--but-better-to-stay-put-until-midyear-200401351,200401351
160817,382333,BBBY,Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"The market expects Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended February 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 10  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This home goods retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 11 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  25  
Revenues are expected to be  3 33 billion  down 10 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 08  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Bed Bath   Beyond 
For Bed Bath   Beyond  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 17  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Bed Bath   Beyond will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Bed Bath   Beyond would post earnings of  0 17 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 18  delivering a surprise of  5 88  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Bed Bath   Beyond appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bed-bath--beyond-bbby-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200403588,200403588
160819,382335,BBBY,Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  Upgraded To Buy  Here s What You Should Know,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Bed Bath   Beyond is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Bed Bath   Beyond imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Bed Bath   Beyond
This home goods retailer is expected to earn  1 98 per share for the fiscal year ending February  2019  which represents a year over year change of  36 5  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Bed Bath   Beyond  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 10 2  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

160842,382358,BBBY,Things You Need To Know Before DSW s  DSW  Q4 Earnings,opinion,"DSW Inc    NYSE DSW   is likely to register a decline in the bottom line when this renowned footwear and accessories retailer reports fourth quarter fiscal 2018 numbers  This is in sharp contrast with its prior quarters  Notably  this Ohio based company had reported higher earnings in the preceding four quarters and also comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate during those periods 
Drawing focus back on the to be reported fourth quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter stands at 3 cents  which reflects a significant decline from 38 cents reported in the year ago period  We also note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has gone down by 3 cents in the past 60 days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is  849 million  up approximately 17 9  from  720 million in the year ago quarter  
DSW Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
 
   Factors Aiding the Stock
DSW has been witnessing healthy comparable sales  comps  for quite some time now  Notably  comps rose 10  and 7  in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2018  Further  the company remains focussed on its digital marketing efforts along with its VIP rewards program which are likely to drive traffic  We believe that these customer centric strategies will aid the company s top line in the to be reported quarter 
Going into fiscal 2019  DSW revenues are expected to increase 12 14   while  comps are projected to rise in the mid to high single digit range However  during the fourth quarter fiscal 2018 comps might be affected by calendar shift although it is expected to remain decent in the said period  We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for comps for US Retail and ABG segments are pegged at growth of 5 4  and 3  in the fourth quarter  respectively  
Moreover  with the addition of Camuto Group  DSW is touted to become one of the largest footwear companies in North America  Further  the deal is expected to boost DSW s revenues by providing it with a larger market  On the flip side  the acquisition is expected to reduce fourth quarter earnings by 5 10 cents  The company anticipates bottom line to range between a loss of 9 cents to earnings of 6 cents per share in the fourth quarter  Adjusted earnings for fiscal 2018 is projected to be  1 70  1 85 per share 
Zacks Model
Our proven model doesn t show that DSW is likely to beat bottom line estimates this quarter  For this to happen  a stock needs to have a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Bed Bath   Beyond due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  Bed Bath   Beyond Q3 Earnings Top  Sales LagBed Bath   Beyond reported mixed third quarter fiscal 2018 results  wherein the bottom line outpaced estimates while the top line missed the mark  With this  the company s earnings reverted to a positive trend  after recording a miss in the last reported quarter  whereas sales lagged for the second straight time  Further  management updated sales and earnings guidance for fiscal 2018 Management stated that the company is well ahead of its plan on achieving long term financial goals that include moderating the operating profit and net earnings per share decline in fiscal 2018 and 2019  However  it expects to witness net earnings per share growth by fiscal 2020 Q3 in DetailBed Bath   Beyond reported earnings of 18 cents per share in the fiscal third quarter  which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  Further  earnings were in line with the company s model but declined 59 1  from the year ago quarter Net sales rose 2 6  to  3 032 2 million but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 041 million  Moreover  comparable sales  comps  dipped roughly 1 8  in the reported quarter due to a mid single digit decrease in sales from stores  somewhat offset by robust sales at the company s customer facing digital networks While gross profit fell 3 6  to  1 003 7 million  gross profit margin contracted 210 basis points  bps  to 33 1   This downside was mainly due to lower merchandise margin coupled with higher coupon expenses  Rise in coupon expenses was on account of increased average coupon amount  partly negated by fall in the number of redemptions  Gross margin contraction  coupled with 2 3  rise in SG A expenses  caused operating profit to tumble nearly 54 3  to  49 5 million  Additionally  operating margin shrank 300 bps from the prior year quarter to 1 6  Financial PositionBed Bath   Beyond ended the quarter under review with cash and investments of roughly  1 billion  Moreover  long term debt totaled  1 492 4 million and total shareholders  equity was  2 903 3 million as of Dec 1  2018

In fiscal 2018  management intends to open about 20 stores  mainly of buybuy BABY and Cost Plus World Market brands  Simultaneously  it expects to close down nearly 40 stores  including mostly flagship ones OutlookFollowing the company s mixed quarterly results  management updated guidance for fiscal 2018  which  unlike fiscal 2017  has 52 weeks  Consolidated net sales are projected to decrease in a low single digit  with decline in comps of about 1  in fiscal 2018  Further  the company is wary of a decline in net sales in a low double digit percentage range for the fiscal fourth quarter due to the fiscal calendar shift from the 53rd week Bed Bath   Beyond continues to project gross margin deleverage in fiscal 2018  mainly due to investments in the customer value proposition and digital channels  SG A is estimated to increase on account of spending on transformational efforts  However  the company still anticipates witnessing operating margin contraction  albeit lower than the fiscal 2017 level  Depreciation expenses are predicted to be  325  335 million compared with  320  330 million mentioned earlier  Furthermore  it expects the tax rate to be roughly 24  for fiscal 2018 Considering all these factors  management now envisions fiscal 2018 earnings per share to be about  2 compared with the earlier guidance  which was assumed to be at the lower end of  2  In fiscal 2017  Bed Bath   Beyond delivered adjusted earnings per share of  3 12 For fiscal 2019  management estimates comps to dwindle in a low single digit  attributable to declining store traffic  Moreover  operating margin is projected to match the fiscal 2018 figure  driven by the company s ongoing efforts and analysis of its overall expenses  including efficiencies in stores and corporate functions  Further  earnings per share and capital expenditure are forecasted to remain similar to the fiscal 2018 level

Specifically  Trade Alert puts the implied earnings deviation for BBBY at 22 5     almost double the 12 2  next day move the stock has averaged over the last eight quarters  The bulk of this action has occurred to the downside  with the shares closing lower in seven of the past eight quarters  including the past six in a row  though not one of these earnings reactions was large enough to exceed what the options market is pricing in this time around

160914,382430,BBBY,Analysts Estimate Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended November 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 19  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This home goods retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 17 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  61 4  
Revenues are expected to be  3 04 billion  up 2 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Bed Bath   Beyond 
For Bed Bath   Beyond  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Bed Bath   Beyond will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Bed Bath   Beyond would post earnings of  0 49 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 36  delivering a surprise of  26 53  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Bed Bath   Beyond doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-12-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-bed-bath--beyond-bbby-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200367449,200367449

160928,382444,BBBY,Wall Street braces for grim third quarter earnings season,news,"By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK  Reuters    Wall Street is bracing for a grim earnings season  with little improvement expected anytime soon      Analysts have been cutting projections for the third quarter  which ends on Wednesday  and beyond  If the declining projections are realized  already costly stocks could become pricier and equity investors could become even more skittish      Forecasts for third quarter S P 500 earnings now call for a 3 9 percent decline from a year ago  based on Thomson Reuters data  with half of the S P sectors estimated to post lower profits thanks to falling oil prices  a strong U S  dollar and weak global demand      Expectations for future quarters are falling as well  A rolling 12 month forward earnings per share forecast now stands near negative 2 percent  the lowest since late 2009  when it was down 10 1 percent  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S data       That s further reason for stock investors to worry since market multiples are still above historic levels despite the recent sell off  Investors are inclined to pay more for companies that are showing growth in earnings and revenue      The weak forecasts have some strategists talking about an  earnings recession   meaning two quarterly profit declines in a row  as opposed to an economic recession  in which gross domestic product falls for two straight quarters       Earnings recessions aren t good things  I don t care what the state of the economy is or anything else   said Michael Mullaney  chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co in Boston      The S P 500 is down about 9 percent from its May 21 closing high  dragged down by concern over the effect of slower Chinese growth on global demand and the uncertain interest rate outlook  The low earnings outlook adds another burden      China s weaker demand outlook has also pressured commodity prices  particularly

chief financial officer  said in the earnings report      On the other hand  among early reporters for the third quarter season   Nike   NYSE NKE  shares hit a record high after it reported upbeat

showed       How can we drive the market higher when all of these signals aren t showing a lot of prosperity   said Daniel Morgan  senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta  Georgia  who cited earnings growth as one of the drivers of the market      To be sure  the vast majority of companies usually exceed their earnings forecasts when they report real numbers   This part in the earnings cycle is typically the low point for estimates   said Greg Harrison  Thomson Reuters  senior research analyst  In the first two quarters of 2015  companies went into their reporting season with analysts predicting a profit decline for the S P 500  and in both quarters  they eked out gains instead  In the last two weeks  analysts have dropped their third quarter earnings predictions by about 0 3 percentage point  There was no change in estimates in the final weeks of the quarter in the first two quarters of 2015      And companies may be snapping their streak of squeezing profits out of dismal revenues  For the first time since the second quarter of 2011  sales  seen down 3 2 percent in the third quarter from a year ago  are not projected to fall as fast as earnings  Companies have been bolstering their earnings per share figures by buying back their own shares and thus reducing their share counts  and that may happen again this quarter           COSTLY SHARES      Even with the recent selloff  stocks are still expensive by some gauges  The S P 500 index is selling at roughly 16 times its expected earnings for the next 12 months  lower than this year s peak of 17 8 but higher than the historic mean of about 15  The index would have to drop to about 1 800 to bring valuations back to the long term range  The S P 500 closed at 1 931 34 on Friday      Moreover  forward and trailing price to earnings ratios for the S P 500 are converging  another sign of collapsing growth expectations  The trailing P E stands at about 16 5  Thomson Reuters data shows  Last year at this time  the forward P E was also 16 but the trailing was 17 6       The last period of convergence was in 2009 when earnings were declining following the financial crisis     The 3 9 percent estimated decline in third quarter profits   down sharply from a July 1 forecast for a 0 4 percent dip   would be the first quarterly profit decline for the S P 500 since the third quarter of 2009      Energy again is expected to drag down the S P 500 third quarter forecast the most  with an expected 64 7 percent decrease in the sector  Without the energy sector  the forecast for third quarter earnings shows a gain of 3 7 percent

160936,382452,BBBY,S P 500 Still Reasonably Valued,opinion,"What the title of today s post doesn t tell you is that valuation is a slippery slope  Some of the seemingly cheapest stocks in the S P 500 are not really attractive values  but more  value traps  which like the Sirens of Greek mythology fame  lure investors in  only to see themselves dashed on the rocks  Ford  NYSE F   General Motors  NYSE GM  and Bed Bath  NASDAQ BBBY  all come to mind  All very cheap on a valuation basis  all adept at destroying investor capital   Long GM  a little Ford  
That being said  the market s valuation  i e the S P 500  is always used by both bulls and bears to make their respective cases 
Here is the updated spreadsheet on S P 500 valuation using JP Morgan s Guide to the Market template  which is one of the few S P 500 valuation tables  that I know of  that incorporates cash flow valuation for the S P 500 

 Source  JP Morgan s Guide to the Market   apologies for the small print 
What s fascinating to me is that since January 1  17  using the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  performance data on Morningstar Premium  the S P 500 is up roughly 26 5   in terms of total return over that 22 months  while the valuation metrics like PE  Div yield  P B  P CF  price to cash flow  remain unchanged 
Only Shiller s P E has managed to elevate a little 
The S P 500 s P E  is actually a little lower than early  17 due to the corporate income tax rate reduction 
Summary   conclusion  CNBC s Friday night show featured Carter Worth  again  who is a pretty good technician  and he pointed out that the brief move over January  18 s high was a  bull trap   The technicians   for good reason   seem to think the risk in the S P 500 today is a trade down to the February  18 lows of 2 532 69  That was pretty close to the 200 day moving average in February  18  On Friday  October 12th  2018 the S P 500 closed just one point above the current 200 day moving average 2 767 13 
Fast Money was only brought up because a number of technicians read over the weekend noted the 2018 lows and the failure at the January  18 highs  hence Carter gets the shout out 
Personally  I don t think the S P 500 s valuation at current levels are all that unreasonable  or even extended  but sharply rising interest rates and trade issues can  compress  valuation  and ultimately slow growth 
Note the market P E  and the price to cash flow relative to this year s mid 20  S P 500 EPS growth rate of mid 20   or even next year s expected 10  S P 500 EPS growth rate 
The S P 500 s valuation still seems pretty reasonable 
 Here are some other S P 500 valuation posts that were written in the last few years  here  here and here  ",2018-10-15,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sp-500-still-reasonablyvalued-200348353,200348353

BBBY stock has had a double digit negative earnings reaction in three straight quarters  In the last two years overall  the equity has averaged a 7  move the day after earnings  regardless of direction  This time around  the options market is pricing in a much larger than usual 15 3  one day move  per  
A move of such magnitude to the downside would put the stock at the  17 level for the first time since late 2008  Looking closer at the charts  Bed Bath   Beyond stock has given back 47  in the last 12 months  and has been stuck in a tight channel of lower highs and lows since December

year ago quarter Net sales of this home furnishing retailer came in at  3 716 3 million  which grew 5 2  from the prior year quarter  The reported figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of

Bath   Beyond Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Gross profit slipped 0 7  to  1 333 3 million  while gross profit margin contracted 210 basis points  bps  to 35 9   Lower margin can be attributed to higher net direct to customer shipping expenses  lower merchandise margin  rise in coupon expenses on account of increased redemptions  and increase in average coupon amounts  This

Bed Bath   Beyond is a retailer offering a wide selection of domestics merchandise and home furnishings  The company s mission is to be trusted by its customers as the expert for the home and heart related life events  These include certain life events that evoke strong emotional connections such as getting married  moving to a new home  having a baby  going to college and decorating a room  which the company supports through its wedding and baby registries  new mover and student life programs  and its design consultation services  The company operates a robust ecommerce platform consisting of various websites and applications  The company also operates an established retail store base under the names of Bed Bath   Beyond  Christmas Tree Shops  Harmon  Harmon Face Values or Face Values  buybuy BABY  World Market  Cost Plus World Market or Cost Plus  The company s strategy is based on building and delivering a strong foundation of differentiated products  and services and solutions 
We have yet another retailer here  part of our big trend for 2018  Our models like this stock  but the street has not lately  They just reported Q4 2017 earnings last week  and investors were not pleased 
For the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter  the company reported net earnings of  1 41 per diluted share   194 0 million   which included a net unfavorable  10 5 million tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017  Excluding the net unfavorable impact from the Tax Act  net earnings per diluted share in the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter would have been  1 48  Net earnings for the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter were  1 84 per diluted share   268 7 million

In response to the latest numbers  the stock hit a 52 week low  The big problem was the company s guidance moving forward  They have a negative outlook until 2020 
And what is the company best known for  The ubiquitous coupons that provide 20  off to anyone with a pulse  While these giveaways are loved by the store s hard core fans  they are not helpful to the bottom line  Giving away profits just to get bodies into the store has not been a successful business model for retailers of home goods in the past 
And yet again  we see the specter of Amazon  haunting a brick and mortar retailer  Does this company have what it takes to compete with that juggernaut  Can you even buy things from Bed  Bath   Beyond via the internet

160984,382500,BBBY,RPT Wall St Wk Ahead  Market rally faces first New Year tests,news," Repeating column that initially moved on Friday 
 By Deepa Seetharaman
 NEW YORK  Jan 4  Reuters    Wall Street s bid to rally from
its worst year since the 1930s will be tested this week by the
new year s first wave of likely dismal corporate news and
possible roadblocks to President elect Barack Obama s stimulus
plan 
 Investors will also contend with a spate of economic news
also expected to be grim  including unemployment figures 
 Still  analysts were cautiously optimistic that stocks
might extend their three day rally on hopes that the stimulus
package would pass quickly in Congress  despite Republican
concerns over its price tag 
 The end of hedge fund redemptions and tax related selling
pressure on stocks could help the market  they said 
  There s hope that a change in government leadership to
President elect Obama will mean things will be different for
the economy as well   said Michael James  senior trader at
regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles 
 But he warned   The economic backdrop is still too
negative  
 Last week closed out a brutal year for stocks  pockmarked
by a string of financial disasters and the destruction of more
than  5 trillion in market value on the S P 500 index 
 The week  however  ended on an uptick as stocks gained for
three straight trading days on optimism about 2009  despite the
continuing bleak economic outlook  Volume was light during the
holiday shortened week 
 For the week  the Dow was up 6 1 percent  the S P 500
gained 6 8 percent and the Nasdaq rose 6 7 percent 
 Outlooks from companies including Chevron Inc could pose a
possible stumbling block for stocks this week  ahead of
earnings from some of the world s biggest companies 
 Traders and analysts expect pre announcements from
companies revising their earnings downward to reflect a dismal
fourth quarter 
  A lot of companies have been really quite quiet about how
their quarter is shaping up   said Marc Pado  U S  market
strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald   Co   We re likely to see
earnings that are going to contain big write downs  especially
from financials  We re bracing for it  
 Chevron  a Dow component and a bellwether of the powerful
energy sector  will report interim fourth quarter forecast on
Thursday 
 Other companies expected to report earnings this week
include retailer Bed Bath   Beyond Inc and Monsanto Co  the
agricultural products maker 
 Investors will also be watching out for prospects for
Obama s proposed stimulus plan that he hopes will create or
save up to 3 million jobs 
 Obama plans to meet congressional leaders on Monday  a day
before the newly elected Congress is due to be sworn in 
 Democrats hope to put a bill on Obama s desk by Jan  20
when he takes office  but some Republicans could stand in the
way over concerns that it could grow to up to  1 trillion 
 Pado dismissed the Republicans  stance as  talking tough 
and said   Right now everybody knows we need a stimulus plan 
We know we need jobs  
 Investors will get a clearer picture of just how many jobs
the United States will need this week after reports on the
labor market on Wednesday  Thursday and Friday  when the
closely watched monthly payrolls figures for December are due 
 Other key data will be total vehicle sales and a retail
sales report  both for December  already one of the worst
holiday shopping seasons in recent memory 
 According to Reuters estimates  car sales will fall to 10
million on an annualized rate  down from 10 3 million in
November  The lower end of analysts  forecasts anticipate a
drop to 8 9 million 
 Investors will also hone in on developments of a rescue of
beleaguered automaker Chrysler LLC  which is still in talks
with the U S  Treasury to finalize its  4 billion loan
agreement  Chrysler s fate is important for auto parts makers 
which got a boost from a rescue loan for General Motors Corp 
 Retail same store sales  an industry benchmark  due out on
Thursday are expected to fall 1 1 percent  the second weakest
result since at least 2000  according to economists polled by
Reuters 
  Trends on these macro factors are not likely to change
abruptly   said Bart Geer  portfolio manager of the  2 8
billion Putnam Equity Income Fund   Employment continues to get
worse  construction spending continues to be weak  pending home
sales aren t going to be any good 
  But I would say a lot of economic statistics are lagging
indicators  The fact that some of these numbers are not going
to be good is not surprising

include  Cosan Limited   NYSE CZZ    ArcelorMittal   NYSE MT    Legg Mason  Inc    NYSE LM    Bed Bath   Beyond Inc    NASDAQ BBBY   and General Motors Company   NYSE GM   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Buy 5 Low P CF Stocks to Sail Through Market VolatilityThe prevailing volatility in Wall Street has rattled even the most ardent of investors  who started taking stock of their portfolio  overlooking the impressive earnings display by corporates for a while  Nevertheless  the market for now seems to have somewhat settled trying to accommodate rising bond yields and a possible uptick in inflation  with the backdrop dominated by the latest tax reform and healthy economic growth What s the Optimum Strategy Warren Buffett once said  It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price    The strategy is very simple   find stocks that are trading below their inherent worth Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices  In value investing  investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound  So chances are high that these stocks will allow investors to book profits when the market trends upward There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential  Each ratio helps an investor to understand a particular aspect of the company s business  One such ratio  Price to Cash Flow  or P CF   can work wonders in stock picking  if used prudently  This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better Why Price to Cash Flow You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price Earnings  or P E   Well  one of the important factors that makes P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  Then again  cash flow is quite reliable  Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company s liquid assets  This gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder friendly moves  On the other hand  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and take into account price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the remaining stocks on the list and start

prospects than individual investors  To attain their objective  they go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations  Broker opinion should thus act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding their course of action  buy  sell or hold  on a particular stock Direction of Earnings Estimates  A Winning PointerSince brokers meticulously follow the stocks in their coverage  they revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company  The estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock For example  an earnings outperformance by a company generally leads to upward estimate revisions with prices moving north  Similarly  lackluster earnings often lead to stock price depreciation  Investors tend to be guided by the direction of estimate revisions and stock price while formulating their investment strategy Making the Most of Broker OpinionsThe above write up clearly suggests that by following broker actions  one can arrive at a winning portfolio of stocks  Keeping this in mind  we have designed

161015,382531,BBBY,Can Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  Strategies Help It Turnaround ,opinion,Bed Bath   Beyond Inc    NASDAQ BBBY   has been reeling under persistently sluggish mall traffic  This has significantly impacted the company s stock performance  which declined significantly year to date Bed Bath   Beyond s shares have declined 43 6  year to date  significantly wider than the  s fall of 10 3   Further  the stock has declined 6 7  since third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results  reported on Dec 20   Though the company beat on both top and bottom line estimates in the quarter  earnings declined year over year while sales remained flat  Further  a bleak comparable store sales  comps  and earnings outlook for fiscal 2017 remain concerns  Nonetheless  the company s transformation plan  shareholder friendly moves and strategic expansion of stores bode well  That said  let s analyze the pros and cons of the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company What s Troubling Bed Bath   Beyond Earnings Continue to Decline  Comps Remain SoftThough the company s top  and bottom line surpassed estimates in the third quarter  earnings declined year over year  This marked the company s first earnings and sales beat after two consecutive misses  Though sales gained from prudent marketing spend and increased promotional offerings  this led to higher advertising costs and lower margins which impacted the bottom line  Further  results were hurt by soft comps due to lower average transactions in stores  somewhat mitigated by greater average transaction amount  Comps at stores fell at a low single digit percentage rate  while comps from customer facing digital networks improved Soft FY17 Outlook Mars EstimatesDriven by comps performance so far in the fourth quarter and expectations for the rest of the year  the company issued a bleak comps and earnings outlook for fiscal 2017  It expects comps to decline in the low single digit percentage range  Further  the company continues to envision fiscal 2017 earnings per share of roughly  3 00  which reflects a decline of more than 30  from the year ago period Consequently  the company s estimates witnessed a downtrend over the last seven days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 moved down by 3 cents and 1 cent  respectively  to  1 38 per share and  3 00 per share  Moreover  estimates for fiscal 2018 moved north by 3 cents to  2 59 per share Margin Pressures to Persist Bed Bath   Beyond has been grappling with soft gross and operating margins for six quarters now  While the gross margin contracted 180 basis points  bps  in third quarter fiscal 2017  operating margin dipped 340 bps  Strained margins trend is attributed to higher shipping and coupon expenses as well as rise in SG A expenses  Further  the company continues to anticipate the gross margin to decline in fiscal 2017  alongside expecting SG A deleverage on account of higher payroll and payroll related costs  advertising expenses  restructuring charges associated with store management incurred in the second quarter and expenses related to Hurricane Harvey and Maira Will Strategic Initiatives Drive Growth Transformation PlanThe company remains on track with various transformation efforts to become customers  first preference  Firstly  the company focuses on improving operational efficiency  which includes transformation of information technology group and related business processes to meet consumers  evolving demand  It has also set up a strategic portfolio management office  SPMO  to allocate resources toward more profitable areas Secondly  the company is undertaking several customer centric plans like enriching product assortment and improving services that in turn will continue to boost online sales  driving the company s growth Store ExpansionsBed Bath   Beyond is  expanding its store count strategically  while increasing the productivity of existing stores  Evidently  the company targets opening 25 new stores in fiscal 2017  which pertains to all store concepts   including new formats and underpenetrated markets  In the long run  it expects to operate over 1 300 stores across the United States and Canada  and also plans to expand other concepts from coast to coast  Moreover  the company remains focused on expanding  renovating and relocating stores to adapt to the changing market conditions Capital Allocation  Boosting Omni channel CapabilitiesBed Bath   Beyond continually reviews and prioritizes its capital needs  The company incurred  264 million as capital expenditure in the nine months of fiscal 2017  and anticipates deploying about   350  400 million in fiscal 2017  Looking ahead  the company expects to allocate more than half of the capital spending

161034,382550,BBBY,What s George Soros Investing In  Top 5 Undervalued Holdings And More,opinion,"George Soros solidified his status in the investing Hall of Fame in 1992 with  that gave him the title  the man who broke the Bank of England   Taking on a major federal reserve bank and winning while making over  1 billion personally will do that for you 
Now at age 87 and with a   he stands as the 19th richest person in the United States and 29th richest in the world  His philanthropic organization  the Open Society Foundations  supports democracy and human rights in more than 100 countries 
Theory of Reflexivity
George Soros has often attributed much of his investing success to his Theory of Reflexivity  The key idea behind the theory is that markets are battling two realities  Objective Realities and Subjective realities  Markets reflect beliefs that directly affect the underlying fundamentals and fundamentals  in turn  form the basis for beliefs  This feedback loop sometimes causes prices and expectations to diverge from reality drastically 
 Markets are constantly in a state of uncertainty and flux and money is made by discounting the obvious and betting on the unexpected  
The Open Society Foundation posted a series of lectures on his theory and its applications in the financial markets as well as a public policy driven philanthropist  You can find the videos starting  
Soros Fund Management LLC s Latest Form 13F Filing
On August 14th  2017  Soros  firm Soros Fund Management LLC filed its quarterly   In this post  I share my findings after reviewing his latest 13F filing that lists holdings in his multi billion dollar portfolio 
Portfolio Overview and Statistics
Soros Fund s reported holdings totaling over  5 6 billion  Since I was mostly interested in reviewing his filing for his current equity strategy  I excluded his bond holdings such as the  233 million Note in FireEye  1  coupon due 2035  and the  184 million Nuance Communications bond  2 75  Note due November 2031   I also excluded stocks like Reynolds American Inc  NYSE RAI  and Kate Spade   Co which have since been delisted or acquired 
Excluding these positions  Soros portfolio holdings totaled just over  4 4 billion  The fund had over  1 billion of holdings in the Consumer Discretionary sector and owned over 50 stocks worth around  700 million in the Information Technology sector 
Soros Fund s Largest Stock Holdings
The Ideas section of finbox io tracks top investors and trending investment themes  You can get the latest data on the holdings discussed below   The following table summarizes Soros Fund Management LLC s largest stock holdings reported in the last filing It was interesting to find his largest holding is also a new position in the PowerShares NASDAQ 100 Index ETF  NASDAQ QQQ   He also added  152 2 million to his stake in SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   the popular S P 500 ETF  Altaba  the investment company  left behind after Verizon s acquisition of Yahoo  Inc s internet business was also a big new addition of  138 7 million 
Recent Price Pullbacks
To find stocks in his portfolio that may be unpopular at the moment and trading at cheap valuations  I ranked his holdings by price pullbacks  The ranking table below lists the stocks in Soros s portfolio by stock price performance over the last 30 days Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  made the list which has been a polarizing stock  That said  I found the stock in David Dreman  Jeremy Grantham  and Ray Dalio s portfolios as well  I would love to hear if you think it s a buy in the comments section below  It s a profitable retailer trading at 0 4x Price   LTM Sales  Are the Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  fears overblown 
Best Dividend Yields
The next ranking table lists the stocks in Soros s portfolio with the best dividend yields  Dividend seekers can appreciate stocks that earn upwards of 6  excluding price appreciation and are also backed by a prominent investor To determine which stocks are trading below their intrinsic value  aka  fair value  I used the finbox io   The finbox io fair value is derived by applying valuation and risk models like Discounted Cash Flow Analysis  Dividend Discount Model  Earnings Power Value and more 
I also wanted to blend in some indication of which stocks might be ready to make a move up soon because they re popular with Wall Street analysts  Therefore I calculated an average using the finbox io fair value upside and analyst upside to create a blended upside which I then used to rank the most undervalued holdings 
Here are the Top 5 stocks based on my calculations 
 1  Identiv  Inc   NASDAQ INVE Identive is security technology company that secures and manages access to physical places  things  and information worldwide  Over the last twelve months  the company has grown revenue to 58 million  up 3 9  year over year  The company recently launched the Hirsch Mx 1 Controller to bring low cost  government grade access control to commercial and institutional environments  Growth is expected to pick up  Identive s forecasted to deliver 65 million   15 0   in revenue for fiscal year ending Dec 31   17 and 74 million   14 6   for the fiscal year ending Dec 31   18 
 2  Intercept Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ ICPT Intercept Pharma is a biopharma company that develops synthetic bile acid analogs to treat chronic liver diseases  The company s growth is accelerating   revenue has grown at least 7 4  for the last three years straight  Growth is expected to continue  ICPT s forecasted revenue for the next two years is 133 million   433 8   and 217 million   62 7    Management is expected to report earnings on November 1  2017  about 28 days from today 
 3  Calix  Inc  NYSE CALX Calix supplies service providers with telecom access equipment  Calix s price to book multiple of 1 6x is below the median multiple for a stock in the Information Technology sector  3 2x   Management has led the company to grow revenue at a 5 9  five year compounded annual growth rate  CAGR

 5  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  NYSE TEVA Teva is the largest generic drug manufacturer in the world based in Israel  Soros has a sizable  19 9 million position in Teva  Teva s stock dropped nearly 15  on October 4th after news broke that the FDA had approved a generic version of its multiple sclerosis treatment Copaxone  Competitor Mylan s  NASDAQ MYL  shares up around 16   Teva is looking cheap trading at a 0 7x price to book multiple below its five year average of 1 3x  Teva pays a dividend of 1 10 share  At the last trading price of 16 08 share the implied dividend yield is a high 6 8

Conclusion  Leverage All Available Resources
As I recently highlighted in my   doing thorough research on the thousands of stocks listed on U S  exchanges is likely impossible for smaller investors  It is wise to leverage the resources from large Wall Street hedge funds in order to help narrow down a watch list

161058,382574,BBBY,Bed Bath And Beyond  It s A Blood Bath After Earnings Report,opinion,"Bed Bath   Beyond Inc   NASDAQ  NASDAQ BBBY 
Bed Bath   Beyond  who reported their quarterly earnings after the bell closed on September 19th  2017 have seen their shares fall 33  since January of 2017  And now  after the earnings were released shares look to be taking a huge hit in the after hours trading session due to missed earnings expectations 
The company reported an adjusted net income of  0 75 cents per share  However this was sharply lower than what analysts had been expecting which was   0 95 per share  Revenues came in at about  2 94 billion dollars which was much lower than the  3 01 billion dollar estimate 
One interesting note is that as recent as September 14th of this year  UBS Securities had taken a neutral stance on their opinion of the share price  Perhaps they saw chinks in the armor showing up during their fundamental analysis and weren t ready to put a buy recommendation on the shares 
BBBY Price Action
Shares have traded in a 52 week Range of a low at  26 54 to a high of  48 83  During the regular trading session on Tuesday  shares closed at  27 03 which was down  0 27 on the day 
However  after the close of the after hours trading session shares closed at  23 58 which was down  12 76  or down   3 45 as of 8 p m  Eastern Daylight Time 
One positive about the company s financials is that they pay a fairly hefty dividend of 2 09  annually  This should keep some investors in the stock at least for the generous dividend 
Fundamental Analyst s Comments Statements
 It s current Price Book of 1 89 is about median in its peer group 
 We classify BBBY MX as Harvesting because of the market s relatively low growth expectations despite its relatively high returns 
 BBBY has relatively high profit margins while operating with median asset turns  Change in the company s annual revenues seems to be coming at the expense of earnings 
 BBBY return on assets currently and over the past five years suggest that its relatively high operating returns are sustainable 
 The company s relatively high pre tax margin suggests tight control on operating costs versus peers
 While BBBY revenue growth in recent years has been above the peer median  the stock s P E ratio is less than the peer median suggesting that the company s earnings may be peaking and the market expects a decline in its growth expectations 
 The company s level of capital investment seems appropriate to support the company s growth 
BBBY has additional debt capacity

The above price chart shows the 5 minute action during the regular trading session on the left and the after hours trading session on the right in the shaded area  It is easy to see exactly when the earnings were announced and the share price dropped enormously  Shares didn t even attempt a rally and basically flatlined afterward

161091,382607,BBBY,Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  Q1 Earnings   Sales Lag  Stock Dips,opinion,After making a short lived comeback in the last quarter  Bed Bath   Beyond Inc    NASDAQ BBBY   reverted to a dismal surprise trend in first quarter fiscal 2017  Both the top and bottom line fell short of our estimates in the first quarter and the latter also declined year over year  The disappointing results weighed on investors  sentiment  as shares of the company declined 7 4  in the after market trading session yesterday In fact  owing to its unimpressive past performance  the Bed Bath   Beyond stock has underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the last one year  Evidently  this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock slumped 21 1  in the past one year  wider than the industry s fall of 6  Results continued to be hurt by sluggish store traffic  which intensified this quarter  Also  results were dented by increased net direct to consumer shipping costs  and higher coupon and advertising costs  This was somewhat compensated by continued strength witnessed across the company s customer facing digital network Q1 in DetailThe company s quarterly adjusted earnings of 58 cents per share declined 27 5  year over year and also came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 66 cents  Including the 5 cents adverse impact from the adoption of new accounting standard  earnings plunged 33 8  to 53 cents per share The home furnishing retailer s net sales inched up marginally by 0 1  to  2 742 1 million  while it fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 798 million  Sales primarily gained from a 2 1  rise in non comp sales including PMall  One Kings Lane and new stores  largely countered by a 2  fall in comparable store sales  comps  The decrease in comps was a result of lower transactions in stores  somewhat compensated by greater average transaction amount  While comps from customer facing digital networks improved over 20   comps at stores fell at a mid single digit rate Bed  Bath   Beyond s gross profit dipped 2 3  to  1 000 1 million in the reported quarter  with the gross profit margin contracting 90 basis points  bps  to 36 5   The fall in gross margin stemmed from higher direct to customer shipping expenses  alongside rise in coupon expense on account of increased redemptions The decline in gross profit  along with a rise in selling  general and administrative expenses led the operating profit to deteriorate nearly 31  to  147 million  Likewise  the operating profit margin contracted about 240 bps from the prior year quarter to 5 4   Bed Bath   Beyond Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise     Financial PositionBed Bath   Beyond ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of about  469 3 million  long term debt of  1 491 7 million  and total shareholders  equity of roughly  2 672 6 million In the first quarter  the company generated cash flow of about  204 6 million from operating activities  while deploying  80 8 million toward capital expenditure Share Buyback   DividendDuring the fiscal first quarter  the company bought back 3 3 million shares for nearly  127 million  under the current buyback plan of  2 5 billion  As of May 27  Bed Bath   Beyond had shares worth  1 6 billion remaining under its existing program  which is likely to conclude in fiscal 2020 Further  the company declared a quarterly cash dividend of 15 cents per share  which is payable on Oct 17 to shareholders on record as of Sep 15 Store UpdateDuring the first quarter  Bed  Bath   Beyond introduced one Harmon Face Values store  alongside shutting down a namesake store  The company ended the first quarter with 1 546 stores  including 1 022 namesake stores across 50 states  the District of Columbia  Puerto Rico and Canada  276 stores under the labels   World Market  Cost Plus World Market or Cost Plus  113 buybuy BABY stores  80 stores under the labels   Christmas Tree Shops  Christmas Tree Shops andThat  or andThat   and 55 stores under Harmon  Harmon Face Values or Face Values names Looking AheadWhile the first quarter usually records the smallest part of the company s annual sales and earnings  Bed  Bath   Beyond faced excess sluggishness in store transactions  along with greater costs  However  the company remains unsure if these challenges were specific to  or more prominent in this quarter   owing to soft sales and delayed start to the summer selling period  As the company expects better visibility into fiscal 2017 after the second quarter  it kept its previously issued outlook unchanged Old Guidance RevisitedIn its fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings conference call  the company had stated that fiscal 2017 is likely to benefit from the additional 53rd week in the fiscal  Considering the additional week  Bed Bath   Beyond projects net sales for fiscal 2017 to increase in the low to mid single digit percentage range  While the company anticipates comps to improve in fiscal 2017  the range is likely to be between relatively flat and slightly positive  Further  the company anticipates the strong comps growth in the customer facing digital channels to persist Moreover  management expects gross margin to decline in fiscal 2017 owing to rise in shipping and coupon expenses  However  the rate of decline in the fiscal is expected to be less than the fiscal 2016 level  Also  selling  general and administrative expense deleverage is anticipated in fiscal 2017 due to payroll and payroll related expenses as well as technology expenses including depreciation and the impact of current expense structures of One Kings and PMall  Depreciation expense is likely to be in the range of  310  320 million  while interest expense is anticipated at about  80 million Considering all factors  the company envisions fiscal 2017 earnings per share to decline in the range of low single digits percentage to 10  Additionally  the company projected capital expenditure for fiscal 2017 to be relatively flat with fiscal 2016 level  with cash flows expected to remain positive  Management also stated that it targets opening 30 new stores and closing nearly 15 to 20 stores  in fiscal 2017  Its store opening plans

161154,382670,BBBY,Why Bed Bath   Beyond Has Big Upside Potential,opinion,"Bed Bath   Beyond Inc  NASDAQ BBBY  is expected to report earnings on Wednesday after the market closes  Shares are trading near their three year low and for good reason  The retailer has reported disappointing earnings ten out of the last twelve quarters 
In the face of a coupon focused consumer  the company has struggled to price its merchandise at a premium  something its been able to do historically   As a result  Bed Bath   Beyond s EBITDA margins have steadily fallen over the last eleven quarters and the stock has followed suit 
However  positive trends have been manifesting in the residential real estate market which may potentially increase demand going forward 
Bed Bath   Beyond s stock also looks attractive purely on a fundamental basis  Finbox io s intrinsic value estimate of  48 76 implies that the stock is nearly 25  undervalued  The estimate is calculated by applying Wall Street projections to seven separate valuation analyses 
A Rising Residential Housing Market
Multiple reports released this week indicate that the US residential housing market is stronger than it has been in years  Last Tuesday  3 28   the S P Case Schiller home price index showed that  in the 12 months through January  the fastest annual rate since mid 2014 
Then on Wednesday  3 29   the  reported that US  pending  home sales hit its second highest level since 2006  These new developments indicate a rising US residential housing market 
Demographics will also play a pivotal role going forward as Millennials have recently overtaken Baby Boomers as   Millennials have often been referred to as  Generation Rent  but this will likely change as the oldest Millennials are just now reaching their mid 30s  Meaning that their attitudes will likely change toward a more settled life and therefor  may prefer to buy a home 
Although an improving housing market may not directly or immediately impact Bed Bath   Beyond  it is a positive sign that could potentially increase demand for its merchandise over the next few years  Many of these new home owners will inevitably look to retailers like Bed Bath   Beyond for furnishings 
BBBY May Have Hit Its Bottom
Bed Bath   Beyond s shares have been hammered over the last few years due to its inability to materially grow it s top line while margins continue to fall 
However  these headwinds appear to be fully priced in  This Earnings Power Value analysis shows that if the company can simply sustain its current earnings into perpetuity  the stock is 12  undervalued  using a 10  cost of capital  
Furthermore  Morningstar just released this article that gave BBBY a 5 star rating and assigned a  64 fair value estimate 
In order for the stock to reverse its downward trajectory  the retailer will need to show investors its ability to increase profitability on earnings day  But overall  there is more long term upside than downside while shares trade near the  40 range ",2017-03-30,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-bed-bath---beyond-has-big-upside-potential-200180730,200180730
161155,382671,BBBY,Will Bed Bath   Beyond Be Able To Revive Lost Momentum ,opinion,Home furnishing retailer  Bed Bath   Beyond Inc    NASDAQ BBBY   is distinctly positioned in the market backed by strong countrywide network  as well as strategic efforts to align merchandise with regional climate and demographics  The company remains committed toward driving long term growth driven by strategic investments  omni channel development and enhancement of product assortments through innovation The fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 marked a comeback for Bed Bath   Beyond  which reported positive earnings and sales surprise in the quarter  This performance came after top line and bottom line misses recorded in the trailing three quarters  Following the earnings announcement  shares of the company have risen nearly 5  However  the Bed Bath   Beyond stock showcased a dismal performance in the last six months as the sluggish mall traffic plagued results  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell

first quarter  reflecting nearly 2 8  growth from the year ago quarter Bed Bath   Beyond Inc  Price and Consensus    What s Behind the Slump Bed Bath   Beyond has been reeling under sluggish mall traffic  with increasing shift toward online shopping  This has largely offset the growth in online sales in the past few quarters While the company reported better than expected earnings and sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  earnings per share declined marginally year over year  Coming to comparable store sales  comps   though comps from customer facing digital networks improved more than 20  in the fiscal fourth quarter  comps at stores fell at a low single digit rate Further  gross margin remained pressurized owing to higher direct to customer shipping expenses  as well as a rise in coupon costs  The company also witnessed a rise in selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses on account of higher payroll and payroll related expenses  as well as an increase in technology expenses The company anticipates these factors to linger as evident in its bleak outlook for fiscal 2017  Bed Bath   Beyond projects net sales for fiscal 2017 to increase in the low to mid single digit percentage range  While the company anticipates comps to improve in fiscal 2017  the range is likely to be between relatively flat and slightly positive  Additionally  the company expects gross margin and SG A expense deleverage given the persistence of the aforementioned factors in fiscal 2017  Consequently  the company envisions fiscal 2017 earnings per share to decline in the range of low single digits percentage to 10  Furthermore  the company s exposure in international markets makes it vulnerable to the adverse currency fluctuations  which is a serious threat Bottom LineWe remain encouraged by the company s long term prospects driven by strategic initiatives  capital allocation strategy and shareholder friendly moves  However  its near term view is strained by soft in store performance and the likely fall in margins Further  the company s  of  F  justifies our view that the stock will continue to lose momentum going ahead Key PicksMeanwhile  investors may consider

161177,382693,BBBY,Danger Zone  Overstock s Profits Are On the Decline,opinion,"Online retail is widely regarded as the biggest threat to brick and mortar stores  What about the threat that online retail is to other online retail  Going up against the likes of Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   with its impressive scale and pricing power  has proven difficult for bricks and mortar as well as other online retail firms  With negative profitability  rising costs  and an overvalued stock price  Overstock  OSTK   15 share  is on  list and is in the Danger Zone this week  Could Overstockcom Inc  NASDAQ OSTK  be the next victim of the retail market 
Overstock s Profits Are On the Decline
Overstock s after tax profit  NOPAT  has declined from  18 million in 2013 to  2 million in 2015  and even further  to   6 million over the last twelve months  TTM   The company s NOPAT margin has fallen from 1 4  in 2013 to  0 4  TTM  per Figure 1  The deterioration in Overstock s profitability comes despite revenue growing 13  compounded annually from 2013 2015 
Figure 1  Overstock s Growing Losses

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Overstock s return on invested capital    has fallen from a once impressive 58  in 2013 to a bottom quintile  4  TTM  It s clear that Overstock s business is showing significant signs of deterioration across multiple key metrics 
Compensation Plan Misaligns Executive Interests
Overstock s executive compensation plan is weighted heavily towards equity incentive awards with a smaller focus on annual cash bonuses  The criteria for earning equity awards appear largely subjective  as Overstock s proxy statement states that  the number of awards are determined by the compensation committee on the basis of management s recommendation and the comp committee s subjective views of the relative ability of key employees to make positive contributions to the company  
Annual cash bonuses are paid out through a company wide bonus pool  of which the pool s total value is determined as a percentage of a  measurement amount   In 2015  this  measurement amount  was adjusted net income  which removed stock based compensation  development project expenses  and general   administrative expenses  among others from net income  No bonuses are paid out unless the  measurement amount  exceeds a target level  With significant leeway in the calculation of this  measurement amount   one must question whether executive interests are correctly aligned with that of shareholder interests 
In either case  executives are incentivized by metrics that do little to create shareholder value and investors should be wary of heavy use of stock price as an incentive  We would much rather see executive compensation tied to ROIC  as there is a clear correlation between ROIC and shareholder value  Currently  OSTK s executive compensation plan has done little to create shareholder value  as its economic earnings  the true cash flows of the business  have declined from  16 million in 2013 to   16 million TTM 
Non GAAP Metric Ignores Economic Reality
Overstock doesn t represent the most egregious abuse of non GAAP metrics we ve come across in our  picks  but its use of  contribution  still distracts from the economic realities of the business  Overstock s  contribution  is calculated from gross profit and removes the effect of sales and marketing expense and Club O Rewards   gift card breakage  The issue with  contribution  is management claims it provides additional insight into the firm s operations while it actually diverges significantly from economic earnings  See the dangers of non GAAP metrics for more details on how companies can abuse non GAAP 
Per Figure 2  Overstock s  contribution  has increased from  172 million in 2014 to  187 million over the last twelve months  Meanwhile  economic earnings have declined from  7 million to   17 million over the same time  Investors following  contribution  would believe Overstock s business to be in much better condition than those calculating the true cash flows of the business

Negative Profitability In The Cutthroat Retail Industry
Overstock s business  an online retailer of home goods  jewelry  apparel  electronics  and more  places it in one of the most competitive industries in the world  Retailers across the globe compete with one another in terms of product offering  pricing  availability  delivery time  and even ease of use  At the same time  Overstock is not only competing against Internet retailers such as Amazon  AMZN   Etsy Inc  NASDAQ ETSY   Wayfair Inc  NYSE W   eBay  EBAY   or Alibaba  NYSE BABA   but also thousands of brick and mortar stores operating across the country such as Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY   Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   and Williams Sonoma Inc  NYSE WSM  
Originally  Amazon s practice of cutting prices to grow market share was believed to be one of the most significant threats to traditional retailers  However  online retailers are just as susceptible to this competition  Overstock included  Per Figure 3  Overstock earns an ROIC and NOPAT margin well below its main Internet and traditional retail competition  In fact  the only company with lower profitability is Wayfair  a   With negative profitability  Overstock s ability to compete on price is diminished  and with increased discounting across the sector  the costs to acquire customers are increased  an issue we ll touch on later 
Figure 3  Overstock s Profitability Lags Nearly All Competition

Bull Hopes Ignore Deteriorating Economics
In online retail  the bull case generally centers on a firm s ability to attract traditionally brick and mortar shoppers to its online offering  Retailers can take many approaches to reach this goal  including under pricing the competition  providing a niche offering unavailable elsewhere  or even customer loyalty programs  The problem with many of these approaches is that they can be costly to a retailer s margins  as noted above  and greatly undermine the firm s ability to market to new customers while maintaining profitability 
We see this scenario playing out at Overstock  as the firm has increased coupons  sales  and customer rewards programs in an attempt to grow the business  However  the cost per unique customer is continually rising  making each customer worth less to the firm  Per Figure 4  Overstock s cost per customer has grown from  12 52 in 2Q13 to  18 36 in 2Q16 
Figure 4  Cost Per Customer Threatens Future Profitability

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
At the same time  the company s cost of good sold and sales   marketing expenses are growing equal to or faster than the revenue generated by new and existing customers  Since 2011  revenue has grown 9  compounded annually  the same as cost of goods sold  Sales   marketing expenses have grown 15  compounded annually over the same time frame 
Meanwhile  the executive team at Overstock is expanding its interest in side businesses such as blockchain software and bitcoin currency  with claims that it can revolutionize the market and business as a whole  We feel these non core operations are more of a smokescreen to distract from the growing issues at the business  namely the consistently growing cost to acquire a new customer  Without significant cost controls  the business will be unable to meet the expectations embedded in its stock price 
The largest risk to the bear case is what we call  stupid money risk   which is higher in today s low  organic  growth environment  Another firm could step in and acquire OSTK at a value that is much higher than the current market price  However  we only see an acquisition situation possible if an acquiring firm is willing to destroy shareholder value 
Is OSTK Worth Acquiring 
The biggest risk to any bear thesis is that an outside firm acquires OSTK at a value at or above today s price  If the negative profitability  weak competitive position  and costly customer acquisition noted above are not enough  we ll show below that OSTK is not an attractive acquisition target unless a buyer is willing to destroy shareholder value 
To begin  OSTK has liabilities of which investors may not be aware that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers suggest 
 45 million in off balance sheet operating leases  12  of market cap 
After adjusting for this liability we can model multiple purchase price scenarios  Even in the most optimistic of scenarios  OSTK is worth no more than the current share price 
Figures 5 and 6 show what we think Wal Mart should pay for Overstocks to ensure it does not destroy shareholder value  Wal Mart has a long history of acquiring online retailers in an effort to spur its e commerce growth  and Overstock could present another target  However  Wal Mart s success in these acquisitions is checkered at best  and WMT must not overpay for OSTK or the company will risk investor backlash  Furthermore  there are limits on how much WMT would pay for OSTK to earn a proper return  given the NOPAT of free cash flows being acquired 
Each implied price is based on a  goal ROIC  assuming different levels of revenue growth  In each scenario  the estimated revenue growth rate in year one and two equals the consensus estimate for 2016  6   and 2017  7    For the subsequent years  we use 7  in scenario one because it represents a continuation of 2017 expectations  We use 10  in scenario two because it assumes a merger with Wal Mart could create revenue growth through increased advertising efforts and exposure to Wal Mart s large customer base 
We conservatively assume that Wal Mart can grow OSTK s revenue and NOPAT without spending on working capital or fixed assets  We also assume OSTK achieves a 0 6  NOPAT margin  the average of the past five years  For reference  Overstock s TTM NOPAT margin is  0 4   so this assumption implies immediate improvement and allows the creation of a truly best case scenario 
Figure 5  Implied Acquisition Prices For WMT To Achieve 5  ROIC

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  
Figure 5 shows the  goal ROIC  for WMT as its weighted average cost of capital  WACC  or 5   Even if Overstock can grow revenue by 9  compounded annually with nearly a 1  NOPAT margin for the next five years  the firm is not worth more than its current price of  15 share  It s worth noting that any deal that only achieves a 5  ROIC would be only value neutral and not accretive  as the return on the deal would equal WMT s WACC 
Figure 6  Implied Acquisition Prices For WMT To Achieve 10  ROIC

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  
Figure 6 shows the next  goal ROIC  of 10   which is WMT s current ROIC  Acquisitions completed at these prices would be truly accretive to WMT shareholders  Even in the best case growth scenario  the most WMT should pay for OSTK is  4 36 share  70  downside   Even assuming this best case scenario  WMT would destroy  302 million by purchasing OSTK at its current valuation  Any scenario assuming less than 9  CAGR in revenue would result in further capital destruction for WMT 
Standalone Valuation   Priced for Perfection
Despite a rollercoaster ride over the past few years  OSTK is up nearly 20  year to date  This significant price increase coupled with the continued deterioration of business fundamentals leaves OSTK significantly overvalued  To justify the current price of  15 share  OSTK must immediately achieve 1 4  pretax margins  highest ever achieved in 2013  compared to  0 6  TTM  and grow NOPAT by 30  compounded annually for the next 12 years  This scenario assumes Overstock can grow revenue by 9  compounded annually  but with the large increase in margins  NOPAT growth significantly outpaces revenue on a compounded annual basis  In this scenario  Overstock would be generating nearly  4 9 billion in revenue  12 years from now   which is greater than Wayfair and Pier 1 Imports last fiscal year revenue combined  and nearly equal to home goods retailer Williams Sonoma s 2016 revenue 
Even if we assume OSTK can immediately achieve slightly lower 1  pretax margin and grow NOPAT by 27  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is only worth  7 share today   a 53  downside  This scenario assumes Overstocks can grow revenue by 7  compounded annually  2017 consensus estimate  but with the increase in margins  NOPAT growth significantly outpaces revenue on a compounded annual basis 
Each of these scenarios also assumes the company is able to grow revenue and NOPAT free cash flow without spending on working capital or fixed assets  This assumption is unlikely but allows us to create a very optimistic scenario  For reference  Overstock s invested capital has grown on average  2 million   1  of 2015 revenue  per year over the last five years 
Market Tires of Overstock s Lack of Focus
We ve seen Overstock s price move upwards of 20  on numerous occasions over the past few years  often in relation to earnings surprises  However  one of the key sticking points recently is Overstock s lack of focus on its core retail operations  Instead  executives are more interested in non core operations such as crypto currency  i e  bitcoin  or blockchain software  These ventures not only cost money  but also take time away from fixing the issues within the retail business  Most recently  OSTK jumped 26  in February when Overstock s CEO noted the blockchain software could be spun off into its own entity  Clearly investors are excited at the prospects of Overstock focusing solely on its struggling retail operations 
However  with this announcement  Overstock is left in a tough situation  If the software gets spun off  the economics of Overstock s retail operations do not leave the firm in a position that warrants investment  With fast growing customer acquisition cost  sales   marketing costs  and cost of goods sold  the viability of the business in the retail sector remains in question  If there is no spin off  the focus between managing an online retail firm in a competitive market gets split between the non core operations  and losses could continue to grow larger 
At the end of the day  without a significant increase in margins  along with impressive revenue growth  Overstock simply cannot meet the expectations baked into its stock price  An earnings miss  particularly in regards to margins  could be all that is needed to send shares to a more rational level as investors wake up to the poor economics of this business 
Insider Action and Short Interest Are Low 
Over the past 12 months  85 thousand insider shares have been purchased and 109 thousand have been sold for a net effect of 24 thousand insider shares sold  These sales represent less than 1  of shares outstanding  Additionally  there are 934 thousand shares sold short  or just under 4  of shares outstanding 
Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic Accounting
In order to derive the true recurring cash flows  an accurate invested capital  and a real shareholder value  we made the following adjustments to OSTK s 2015 10 K 
Income Statement  we made  13 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing  1 million in non operating income   1  of revenue   We remove  7 million related to non operating income and  6 million related to non operating expenses  See all the adjustments made to OSTK s income statement here 
Balance Sheet  we made  261 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of  127 million  The most notable adjustment was  64 million  38  of net assets  related to deferred tax assets  See all adjustments to OSTK s balance sheet here 
Valuation  we made  138 million of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by  40 million  The most notable adjustment was  45 million related to off balance sheet operating leases  This adjustment represents 12  of OSTK s market cap

161189,382705,BBBY,Bed Bath   Beyond Shares Plunge On Weak Q3 Results And Forecast,opinion,"Home goods retailer Bed Bath   Beyond Inc  NASDAQ BBBY  late Wednesday posted much worse than expected third quarter earnings and noted its full year results could miss estimates as well 
The Union  NJ based company reported Q3 EPS of  0 85  which was  0 13 worse than the  0 98 that Wall Street had expected  Revenues rose just 0 1  from last year to  2 96 billion  also missing analysts  view of  3 01 billion 
Comparable sales in Q3 fell by  1 4   falling well short of the  0 5  estimate that Bed Bath   Beyond had made earlier this  That sales momentum was also down from last year s  0 4  gain in Q3  Comparable store sales  also known simply as  comps   are considering a key indicator of a retailer s health 
The company noted that digital channel sales saw strong growth of 20   while comparable sales from physical retail stores declined in the low single digit percentage range 
Looking ahead  BBBY forecast full year EPS to come in at the low end of its previously announce outlook of  4 50 to  5 00  which could miss Wall Street s  4 71 estimate 
The company provided an update to its buyback program via press release 

During the third quarter of fiscal 2016  the Company repurchased approximately  76 million of its common stock  representing approximately 1 8 million shares  under its existing  2 5 billion share repurchase program  As of November 26  2016  the program had a remaining balance of approximately  1 9 billion  and is expected to be completed sometime in fiscal 2020

This stock has been facing sharply downwards since last Thursday  and there is no reason to expect this to change any time soon  since we are dealing with a large  young downtrend here In the medium trend of the hourly chart  on the other hand  we see an intact upward trend that is currently running rapidly back into the green correction zone  Since the large  red correction zone is far away  one could venture a short term long trade 
Anyone who is sure of themselves and has their nerves and their money management under control can cut off a piece for themselves here and hazard an entry at  44 00  The target should be located at point 2 at  46 81  for there we can then expect a reversal in the southerly direction  Alternatively  we could also anticipate a more considerable correction  In this case  the area from  56 to  61 50 would then be the target  before the superior downward trend then continues on once more 

Rheinmetall AG  DE RHMG  
When it comes to the venerable defense company Rheinmetall  founded back in the year 1889  with its headquarters in D sseldorf  we are talking about a current market capitalization of 2 78 billion euros surrounding a medium size  internationally oriented German enterprise  Accordingly  the group   which  alongside its focus on the defense industry  also covers the field of automotive supplier with the corporate division  KSPG   Rheinmetall Automotive since 05 09 2016    is listed in the German Mid Cap Index MDAX  Nevertheless  an in depth observation made by the classic Dow Theory oriented trader with a short to mid term time horizon should not be skipped 
The primary principle of the Dow Theory states that as far as possible  all 3 trends in the intended trading timeframe  as well as the directly superior trend in the higher timeframe located directly above  here the small trend in the daily basis   should be pointing in the same direction  For an intended trade in the 1H chart  this would mean that not only the small  but also the medium and large trend should be going long  in alignment with the existing LONG trend in the small trend level in the daily chart 
Although all trends in the hour are in an upwards movement in the specific case of the Rheinmetall stock  the small and medium trend  which are significant when taking reasonable risk and money management into consideration  are already in the 8th and 7th correction arm  which reduces the probability of a favorable long trade for us almost to a minimum  The 20 location point line from the hour  which is already falling steeply  also argues against a long trade  The small upward facing trend in the daily basis  which is only in its 2nd correction  and the medium  not yet valid long trend do nothing here to change the fact that the telling Relative Strength Index  RSI  is showing strongly declining momentum with accompanying strong negative divergences that are already visible to the naked eye  This means that the RSI is no longer depicting the last upward movement in the chart  but is dropping away  To sum up the whole situation  in order not to put unnecessary strain on the trading account   Hands off this value at the moment  

Infineon Technologies AG NA O N   DE IFXGn  is Germany s largest and Europe s second largest semiconductor enterprise  Their headquarters is located in Neubiberg near Munich  The company was founded on the 1st April 1999 
This DAX listed company is on the edge of a new upswing to the top  If one observes the picture in the large trend of the hourly chart  one sees a very young upward trend  whereby the price has already gone deep into the green correction zone here and is now getting ready to start the next upward movement  With an entry at approx   14 70  one can speculate on a trend continuation  The stop should be located beneath the green correction zone  the first target is located at about  15 56

Shares haven t traded this low since late 2010  but we should see some support come in at  40 and  36  while resistance will be met at  41 25   42 and  43 
Looking at the daily chart you will see that shares are down on the year and have had a hard time gaining any momentum  as they haven t even been able to breach the 200 day moving average once this year

The subdued fiscal first quarter performance was largely due to short term operational problems  Restoration Hardware launched a new line of modern furniture last fall which is undergoing production delays resulting in increased cost and lower revenues  The company s new paid membership program  which marks a shift from the discount offering promotional model  is also hurting revenues  In addition  market headwinds such as volatility in the energy market  unfavorable currency translations and an overall slowdown in the luxury consumer market are also impacting the company s top and bottom lines  These issues are unlikely to be resolved any time soon  In fact  management does not expect any improvement before the fourth quarter of 2016 or early 2017 

Retail Stocks Hurt by Restoration Hardware s Slump

Had the impact of Restoration Hardware s weak results remained confined at its own stock level  it would have pinched less  But the company s sluggish performance took a toll on other retail stocks  as investors remained on tenterhooks 

Following disappointment at Restoration Hardware  shares of Williams Sonoma Inc       a multi channel specialty retailer of various products for home  dropped 5 5  yesterday  Last month  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company came up with first quarter fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings of 53 cents a share that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents 

Bed Bath   Beyond Inc      also felt the heat as it shares tumbled 3 4   This Zacks Rank  4 retailer is scheduled to report first quarter fiscal 2016 results on Jun 22  This seller of a range of domestics merchandise and home furnishings had posted better than expected results for fourth quarter fiscal 2015  Quarterly earnings had fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 1  

Shares of Pier 1 Imports  Inc      which is engaged in the retail sale of decorative accessories  furniture  candles and housewares  plunged 8   This Zacks Rank  3 company delivered fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings of 23 cents that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents  The company is slated to release first quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jun 29 

Were Investors Too Hasty 

The dull performance of Restoration Hardware has rung an alarm for Bed Bath   Beyond and Pier 1 Imports which are about to report their quarterly results this month  Investors have punished these stocks without even having an inkling of their results  with Restoration Hardware pressing the panic button

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of 85 cents on  2 77 billion in revenue  right in line with Wall Street
Bed Bath   Beyond s acquisition of One Kings Lane positions them to expand in the growing e commerce space
Stores sales continue to struggle while comparable online sales have boasted double digit gains
What are you expecting for   
Speciality retailer  Bed Bath   Beyond is scheduled to report first quarter earnings tomorrow after the market closes  Lately the retail sector has been dominated by Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  while everyone else plays catchup to expand their omni channel capabilities 
The move to a more online centric business has come at the cost of near term earnings growth and share price growth  For Bed Bath and Beyond this has been no different  seeing shares of its stock fall nearly 40  in the past 12 months on flat growth 
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of 85 cents on  2 77 billion in revenue  right in line with Wall Street  Compared to a year earlier this represents an 8  decline on the bottom line and 1  increase on the top  BBBY is typically a negative mover during earnings season  seeing its biggest drops through and 30 days following a report 
Unfortunately  another troubling report will likely drop the stock even further 

Despite a weak holiday season  Bed Bath   Beyond delivered positive growth in its fourth quarter report  The company reported 3  growth on the bottom line and 2  on the top  driven by strong digital sales  Comparable sales increased by 1 7  on a 25  increase in digital channels while sales from stores were relatively flat during the quarter  Unfortunately  on the year the company saw net cash from operating and investing activities fall with its cash position weakening 
Bed Bath   Beyond is still expected to expand on its growth strategy by lowering its free shipping threshold and by continuing its acquisition strategy  On the heels of its report  the company agreed to acquire One Kings Lane at a fraction of its  1 billion valuation 
The deal positions Bed Bath   Beyond to grow in the ecommerce space  but additional investments will put pressure on earnings in the near term

161291,382807,BBBY,5 Huge Misunderstandings About The Current Market Environment,opinion,"Over the weekend  the Denver Broncos beat the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship  Popular football analysts had   across the board  it seemed   believed the Patriots were a  shoe in   They were wrong  Peyton Manning could still throw deep passes to score touchdowns  And Denver s defense rattled Tom Brady on nearly every Patriot possession 
In a similar vein  an overwhelming majority of analysts believed that the ending of QE3 in December of 2014 and the 0 25  rate hike in December of 2015 would not adversely affect risk assets  They were wrong  Fed monetary policy involves so much more than short term overnight lending rates  policy affects corporate bonds  foreign bonds  exchange rates and risk preferences  Indeed  since the end of 2014  the dollar has rocketed 20   the S P 500 has lost roughly 7  and junk bond yields are the highest that they ve been since 2009 
In truth  many analysts and many investors have held onto a variety of misunderstandings about the current investing environment  Here are five of them 
1  Lower Oil Prices Are Great For The Economy  Scores of analysts have steadfastly maintained that lower oil prices are a net benefit for the economy  They consistently talk up how consumers are free to spend more because they have more money in their pockets 
However  the analysis misses the mark on several fronts  If you saved  50 at the Shell  L RDSa  station last month  you may have decided to spend all of those dollars at Bed  Bath and Beyond  O BBBY   Yet you did not spend additional dollars to benefit the overall economy  rather  you spent the same amount  but you spent it on pillowcases instead of gasoline  In the same vein  even if you spend all of the  50 from your gas pump savings  producers would likely cut back on their spending by a similar amount  In other words  the consumer who has  50 more per month to spend would be offset by the producer who has  50 per month less to spend  That s a net wash 
In fact  assuming that lower oil prices represent a net wash for the economy may be too generous  The primary way that producers survive the loss of revenue is to lay off workers  Through October of 2015  roughly 250 000 employees around the world  100 000 in the U S   have already lost their employment  New layoffs have been announced regularly since last October  With displaced workers from the high paying oil and gas sector more likely to find their way into the lower paying service sector  those folks have less money from their wages to spend than they did before 
Consumption  then  may be hampered by persistently low oil prices  In fact  the correlation between oil prices and stocks soars during recessionary pressure  The correlation spiked to more than 0 8 during the financial collapse in 2008  Similarly  the 50 day relationship between stock prices and oil prices today is at 0 9  The United States Oil Fund  N USO  and the S P 500 SPDR Trust N SPY  are moving in the same direction almost every single trading session 

2  No Recession  No Bear Market  The origins of some myths are difficult to pinpoint  When it comes to double digit percentage declines with the dubious distinction as stock bear markets  however  there have been five non recession occasions dating back to 1939 1940  There have also been two borderline bears   the Asian Currency Crisis in 1998 and the Euro Zone Debt Crisis in 2011   where massive central bank bailouts rescued risk assets from worldwide contagion  In other words  44  of non recession corrections in the S P 500 had bearish implications 

There are a number of additional issues with the  no recession  no bear market  discussion  For one thing  the average U S  large cap  mid cap and small cap has already fallen far more than the requisite 20   Using the Dow or the S P 500 as the only proxy for stock performance in the United States is myopic  Second  we already have a profit recession with three consecutive quarters of year over year declines in corporate profits as well as a manufacturing recession  Profit recessions themselves typically result in sharp  20  plus  losses for the S P 500 

3  Manufacturing Does Not Matter  The U S  is a service oriented economy  Approximately two thirds of gross domestic product  GDP  is attributable to consumption  not production  And only 12  of GDP comes from manufacturer activity  Fair enough  But why do scores of analysts subsequently declare that manufacturing is irrelevant 
Let us consider additional facts about the impact of manufacturing  First  approximately half of corporate profits come from overseas  where  making stuff  has a super sized impact on respective economies around the globe  When global trade volumes have faltered in the 21st century  U S  recessions  and 50  stock market depreciation  were not far behind 

Secondly  according to Ruchir Sharma of Morgan Stanley  manufacturing accounts for 60  of S P 500 profits  That s a substantial role in financial markets  is it not  In fact  we can readily see this relationship between contraction in the Institute for Supply Management s manufacturing sector and contraction in S P 500 company profits 

4  Steady Growth For S P 500 Profits  Excluding Energy  According to FactSet  the blended earnings decline for Q4 2015 is  6 0   This will mark the first time that the benchmark witnessed three consecutive quarters of year over year earnings declines since 2009 
Blame it all on the energy segment  right  The investment community has a short memory  as  ex technology  had been floated in 2000 2001 and  ex financials  had been touted in 2007 2008  Unfortunately  six of the 10 sectors are expected to report year over year declines in earnings  including energy  materials  industrials  technology  utilities and consumer staples  And for Q1  2016  financials may make it seven out of 10 
Can profit growth in segments like health care and telecom save the day  Well  if the financial markets are forward looking  fewer and fewer are willing to pay up for the growth sectors  Both the S P 500 SPDR Select Sector Health Care Fund  N XLV  and the iShares Telecom Fund  N IYZ  are trading at lower prices today than they were trading 12 months earlier 

5  Stocks Are Cheap Now  With the S P 500 trading near 1900  the Forward P E Ratio is 15 1  The 35 Year Average  13 0  With forward 12 month EPS estimates of  125 50  the index would need to fall to 1630 for stocks to be trading at an average multiple 
The S P 500 hit an all time nominal record of 2130 last May  where a 500 point price drop to 1630 would correspond to 23 5  bearish depreciation  The problem  For one thing  earnings estimates are likely to deteriorate further such that prices would have to fall even lower for the S P 500 to trade at an average multiple of 13x  For another  bear markets are rarely kind enough to push prices down to average P E ratios  On the contrary  Stock bears push prices to cheaper and cheaper levels such that price to book  P B  ratios often move below 1 0 
Granted  the Federal Reserve may soon determine that the debt binges of foreign developed nations  emerging market countries  global corporations and U S  energy companies threaten the stability of the global financial system  again  If so    looking to instill confidence through a fourth iteration of quantitative easing  QE4  or negative interest rates or a yet to be determined arrow in its quiver  That said  the S P 500 will not be a genuine bargain until and unless central banks allow prices to find their own floor

161314,382830,BBBY,Is BBBY Looking At Another Miss ,opinion,"Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  will report its FQ1 15 on Wednesday  after slow revenue growth over the last year  Estimize is predicting an EPS figure of   95 and Wall Street is forecasting   94  both above the company guidance of   93  In terms of revenue  Estimize predicts  2 744B  and Wall Street is forecasting a markedly higher figure of  2 746B  It should be noted  however  that Bed  Bath and Beyond has been significantly underperforming both Estimize and Wall Street s predictions for the last two quarters  In this case  the company guidance is way below the two other predictions  at  2 724B 

FQ1 is habitually the weaker quarter for Bed  Bath and Beyond  which has expectedly led to negative QoQ EPS   growth figures  However  the industry as a whole has been dealing with minimal growth rates this year  Some contributing factors include margin pressure due to competition with online retailers  coupon expenses  and direct to consumer shipping costs  Moreover  there have been ongoing foreign currency headwinds  influencing domestic revenues  Also harmful this year was the West Coast port slowdown and frigid weather hitting many regions in February  Although Bed  Bath and Beyond was able to discover alternative shipping routes  the two additional factors caused a significant decline in company sales 
Not only is Bed  Bath and Beyond influenced by the several industry barriers  but there are also company specific earnings impediments  For one  currency fluctuations in Canada have undermined the company s sales progress  and it continues to have an unfavorable effect on sales this quarter  Furthermore  returning to the industry competition of online retailers  Bed  Bath and Beyond has too invested in online retail  which has been an added company expense due to increased technology costs  Moreover  the company could still be coping with the unfavorable impact of last year s credit card litigation settlement fee 
The upcoming report should shed some light on how the company is coping with these external pressures  We recommend watching BBBY s result closely  as investors and analysts could be very disappointed by continued underperformance  On the other hand  the announcement could also be a catalyst for the stock  leading to a positive turnaround that the company greatly needs

161356,382872,BBBY,Will Bed Bath And Beyond Turn Around Its 6 Month Slump On Wednesday ,opinion,"Bed Bath   Beyond Inc   NASDAQ BBBY  is set to report FQ1 2015 earnings after the market closes on Wednesday  June 25th   Bed Bath   Beyond is one of the largest chain retailers of household goods  The home goods company has missed analyst forecasts 2 quarters in a row and will be hoping that Spring sales can turn things around  This quarter Wall Street is expecting modest gains relative to the comparable quarter of last year  with EPS improving by 2 cents per share and revenue increasing by 3  on a year over year basis  However  BBBY shares have been on a slide and investors are not as optimistic as Wall Street about the prospects for growth this quarter  
The information below is derived from data submitted to the platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Bed Bath   Beyonds to report 95c EPS and  2 691B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 10 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 95c EPS and  2 676B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Bed Bath   Beyond to report in line with the Wall Street consensus on EPS  but come up slightly short on sales 
By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time 
More importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  Here we are seeing a smaller than usual differential between the two groups  expectations  

The distribution of earnings estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 93c to  1 01 per share and from  2 602B to  2 700B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a relatively small range of estimates on Bed Bath   Beyond s EPS compared to previous quarters 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A narrow range of earnings estimates signals more agreement in the market  which could mean less volatility post earnings 

Over the past 3 months the Wall Street consensus fell from  1 03 to 95c while the Estimize consensus declined from 98c to 95c  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue forecast sank from  2 733B to  2 691B while the Estimize sales consensus dropped to a low of  2 661B before climbing to  2 676B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and the directionality of analyst revisions at the end of the quarter are often a leading indicator  In this case we see mostly flat analyst revisions going into the report 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is turbinecity who projects 96c EPS and  2 700B in revenue  turbinecity was our Winter 2014 season winner and is  overall among over 4 550 contributing analysts  This season turbinecity has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 60  and 51  of the time respectively throughout a massive 1 173 estimates 
Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case turbinecity is expecting Bed Bath   Beyond to beat the Estimize consensus on both EPS and revenue 

Bed Bath   Beyond stock has been struggling over the past 6 months after missing the earnings consensus from Estimize 2 quarters in a row  The graph above from ChartIQ Visual Earnings shows how sharply shares fell after the surprising earnings miss in January  This quarter contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform have lowered their expectations and are predicting that Bed Bath   Beyond will report in line with the Wall Street EPS consensus  but miss the sales projection by a relatively small margin of  15 million

161357,382873,BBBY,Bed Bath   Beyond Below Critical MA,opinion,"Shares of home furnishing retailer Bed Bath   Beyond Inc  Bed Bath   Beyond Inc  NASDAQ BBBY  are getting slammed lower after reporting lower than expected quarterly results  The popular retail stock is declining lower by  5 61 to  55 50 a share  Traders and investors should note that the stock is now trading below its important 50 week moving average  Anytime a stock falls below this critical moving average it is generally a sign of sharp institutional distribution 
Next Support
Traders will now have to look at the chart to find the next near term support area for the stock  In December 2012  Bed Bath   Beyond traded as low as  54 33 before reversing and trading to new all time highs earlier this year  This tells us that the  54 area will be the next near term support level for the stock  If that support fails to hold  BBBY will have more support around the  48 35 level  which was a break out point in 2011 

Just remember that past breakout points often serve as excellent support levels when retested ",2014-06-26,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bed-bath---beyond-below-critical-ma-217562,217562
161358,382874,BBBY,The Safest Names  The Best Returns,opinion,"The earnings are beginning to flow and it s a total mixed bag out there again 
Carnival Corporation  NYSE CCL  beat the Street with its second quarter numbers  with cruise line sales growing four percent over the second quarter of 2013 
Guidance  however  was mediocre and the position sold off on its earnings results 
Walgreen Co   NYSE WAG  has been very strong on the stock market over the last 12 months  The drugstore chain produced a six percent gain in sales to  19 4 billion  and a 16  gain in earnings to  722 million 
But the company is getting squeezed both by health insurers and pharmaceutical manufacturers  so its business model is getting pressured 
Walgreen is considering reincorporating overseas to reduce its tax burden  but it won t have details on any potential plan until later in the summer  The stock went up on the news 
Second quarter earnings results were actually a bit better than expected and once we get into blue chip numbers  I think the market will be a bit more appeased 
It is important to remember where stocks are coming from  It s been an exceptionally good last few years for equities  2013 was outstanding 
The first quarter was a tough one  both due to the weather and general business cycle conditions  The market isn t expecting second quarter numbers to be strong  and that goes for both gross domestic product  GDP  and corporate earnings 
All that corporations have to do is meet or beat on one financial metric and either affirm or improve existing full year guidance  With this backdrop  institutional investors will keep buying 
Monsanto Company  NYSE MON  soared to a record 52 week high after releasing a modest earnings report  but the company announced a new  10 0 billion share repurchase program and slightly improved guidance for the future 
Herman Miller  Inc   NASDAQ MLHR  is a manufacturer of office furniture and related items  The company s earnings beat consensus but missed on revenues  still producing a six percent gain  and near term guidance was lowered below consensus 
The stock sold off on the news  and one might view the company as a benchmark play for office furniture systems  It still produced growth  however  just not up to what Wall Street was looking for  This doesn t mean this isn t still a growth business 
Bed Bath   Beyond Inc   NASDAQ BBBY  announced flat earnings per share on a 1 7  gain in comparable quarterly sales  The stock took a beating and has actually been having a very difficult time since the beginning of the year  it didn t recover like the broader market 
Of course  it s very early days in the current earnings season and the second calendar quarter isn t over just yet 
Earnings have not been uniform for a number of quarters now and it s part of the reason why institutional investors have been so interested in buying dividend paying blue chips  The safest names offer the safest earnings and also some of the best reliability in terms of corporate outlooks 
While I expect this earnings season to be decent  the same old trend should continue to prevail  Blue chips should continue to be the market s favorites and existing winners should continue to produce relative outperformance

161359,382875,BBBY,Finding Value In The Retail Sector,opinion,"Signs of economic improvement continue  On Friday  nonfarm payroll data in the United States showed that the economy added 288 000 jobs in the month of June  This represents four consecutive months of job gains in excess of 200 000  Said another way  997 000 total jobs were created over the past 120 odd days  Compare this to 3 years ago when 417 000 jobs were created between March and June 2011 
While the S P 500 has appreciated close to 7 4  since the start of 2014  not all stocks have participated in the rally  The retail sector in particular has offered investors lackluster returns  Stocks including Bed Bath   Beyond Inc  NASDAQ BBBY   Best Buy  NYSE BBY   Staples  NASDAQ SPLS  and Sears  NASDAQ SHLD  are all down between 15  and 30  since the start of the year 
There are several reasons for the decline  Aside from the frigid winter that kept consumers indoors  Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  continues to build its footprint  Revenue at the company increased 23  year over year in its first quarter that ended in March  These two factors alone have caused retailers to discount their products and offer free shipping to keep up with evolving consumer trends 
Differentiating a value trap from an undervalued stock requires a thorough analysis of the business  Bed Bath   Beyond is undoubtedly a value investment  Though the stock is not accompanied by a dividend  shareholders can take comfort in the stock s 10x forward P E  9  free cash flow yield  and debt free balance sheet  Since the start of the year  the share price is down 26 1  due to lower than forecasted same store sales results and earnings that marginally fell short of analyst estimates 
Unlike many of its retail peers  however  BBBY has posted reasonable results  For example  compare the company to another retailer  Staples  Despite similar 25  share price declines since the start of the year  earnings per share at BBBY continue to expand while SPLS s bottom line continues to weaken  In fact  Staples  earnings per share will contract 16  this year and 1  next year  Compare this with BBBY whose earnings will appreciate 4  this year and another 8  next  Furthermore  SPLS s same store sales in North America contracted 4  in its most recent quarter while BBBY s increased by a modest 0 4  
While investors wait for consumer spending to pick up  BBBY continue to aggressively buy back its own shares  a sign that the board feels strongly that the share price is undervalued  In the last three fiscal years  the company bought back 17  of its shares outstanding  In its first quarter of this fiscal year  the company bought back another 2 9   At this rate  there won t be anything left to buy in 15 years 
A second look at retail is warranted following this week s news that activist investor Jana Partners took a 9 9  stake in PetSmart  NASDAQ PETM   another retailer that has faced the same headwinds as its peers in the sector  The hedge fund stated that it will not only improve capital allocation but will also urge the sale of the company  Investors lauded the move  sending shares up 13  on Thursday  The position is unsurprising  given that PETM has posted attractive metrics  Interestingly  BBBY and PETM both share the same share buyback history and earnings per share growth characteristics  While PETM s same store sales have slowed due to competition   0 6  year over year in its most recent quarter   the company has bought back 13  of its shares outstanding over the past 3 years  Furthermore  its earnings per share will grow 7  this year and 9  next 
Given BBBY s strong operating results relative to its peers  the 26 1  share price decline in 2014  and the recent activist stake in Petsmart  a company with similar characteristics to BBBY  Bed Bath   Beyond is a value investment that will arguably accompany future share price appreciation for its shareholders ",2014-07-07,Baskin Financial Blog,https://www.investing.com/analysis/finding-value-in-the-retail-sector-218510,218510
161390,382906,BBBY,Will Bed Bath   Beyond Recover From January Earnings Miss ,opinion,"Bed Bath   Beyond Inc  NASDAQ BBBY  is set to report FQ4 2014 earnings after the market closes Wednesday  April 9th  Bed Bath   Beyond is one of the largest chain retailers of household goods  In January BBBY shares dropped 12 5  after the company missed quarterly expectations  Frigid temperatures and heavy snowfall have played a big part in hindering retail sales this winter  This quarter Wall Street has lowered its expectations for Bed Bath   Beyond and its expecting year over year EPS decline of 4 8  and a yoy revenue decrease of 5 3   Here s what investors expect from BBBY on Wednesday 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 
The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Bed Bath   Beyond to report  1 60 EPS and  3 223B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 14 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is  1 60 EPS and  3 221B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Bed Bath   Beyond to report in line with the Street s EPS projection but come up a couple million dollars short on sales 
By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing almost no difference between the two groups  expectations 
The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from  1 57 to  1 62 EPS and from  3 175B to  3 275B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a smaller than normal distribution of estimates on Bed Bath   Beyond  
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A narrower distribution of estimates signaling more agreement in the market  which could mean less volatility post earnings  
Over the past 4 months the Wall Street EPS consensus fell from  1 78 to  1 60 while the Estimize consensus dropped from  1 86 to  1 60  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue forecast declined from  3 340B to  3 223B before the report while the Estimize forecast also slipped from  3 357B to  3 221B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and downward analyst revisions at the end of the quarter are often a bearish Indicator 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is kc who projects  1 62 EPS and  3 236B in revenue  kc is rated as the top analyst so far in the spring earnings season and is ranked 31st overall among over 4 000 contributing analysts  Over the past 6 months kc has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 58  and 50  of the time respectively throughout over 250 estimates  Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case kc disagrees with the Estimize community and is making a bullish call expecting Bed Bath   Beyond to beat the community s expectations on both the top and bottom line 
Bed Bath   Beyond stock has performed poorly over the past 3 months  mostly due to a shocking earnings miss last quarter  The harsh winter weather will come into play again this quarter and contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform have lowered their estimates accordingly  This quarter the Estimize community has established its expectations slightly below the bar set by Wall Street

161400,382916,BBBY,Is Bed Bath   Beyond A Good Buy Now ,opinion,Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  has been expanding  In 2012  it purchased Linen Holdings and Cost Plus World Markets  It estimated 41 new store openings in the fiscal year 2012  Still the stock today can be purchased at 13 times multiple  which is in the low range of the historical multiple its shares have commanded  This may be a great time to initiate a position in BBBY if you have been considering this stock to provide a steady appreciation over a period of 5   10 years or more  Current Valuation Bed Bath and Beyond is not a very cheap stock based on its book value  even though the current price to book ratio of 3 34 is at the low end of its historical valuation  The stock traded as high as 6 7 times book in 2002  However  it is important to keep in mind that as a company grows and scales  the focus shifts towards earnings power  unless the business is capital intensive and the balance sheet is heavy with tangible assets    Profitability is a bit different and as the company continues to enhance its foot print  either by opening new stores  creating new concepts or acquiring other retailers  the multiple investors are willing to pay should remain consistent IF the company consistently executes and sustains or grows its return on equity  gaining scale   In practice things are not so clear cut and as you can see with the two charts below  even though Bed Bath and Beyond has continued to reward its shareholders with consistent ROI  the P E multiple on its stock has decline  The business has been growing on the top line although the margins have declined slightly that the company ascribes to increased coupon usage   From a balance sheet perspective  the company has  785 million in cash and a current ratio of 2 2 which is acceptable as a measure of liquidity  The company also operates at zero debt levels and that is something that concerns me a little  Pure equity as a source of capital is more expensive then debt and some leverage  specially in this climate of low cost debt  is advisable to improve the returns for the shareholders  Future Expansion On the other hand  organic expansion using cash from the business shows conservative management and a great execution  The company continues to open new stores and concepts and is opening 2 Home and More stores in Mexico City  joint venture   Additionally  by acquiring Cost Plus  and with the bankruptcy of Linens and Things  the competitive climate for Bed Bath and Beyond has eased  BBBY is also stepping into the B2B segment with its acquisition of Linen Holdings  a business to business distributor of a variety of textile products  amenities and other goods to customers in the hospitality  cruise line  food service  healthcare and other industries   For the next five years  the company is expected to grow by 12  which is par for the industry  Other Factors The company is aggressively repurchasing its own stock  Its Board has authorized another tranche of  2 5 B in stock buybacks so clearly the company believes that the stock is undervalued  The stock does currently trade at historically low valuations  The retail environment is now improving in the US that should help the top line and the bottom line  However  if you buy this stock  you are not buying it for its history and going forward given its position in the industry and the industry growth rates  it appears to me that the stock is currently fairly value   We can talk numbers and multiples all day but at this level of valuation the question becomes whether the company has a competitive position in the market that is defensible  It is able to differentiate its offering compared to a Walmart or Target and that helps it generate 2 3 times the operating margin of these companies  but unless the company embarks on a major expansion this advantage will erode  Its recent acquisitions are a good step towards this but are probably not enough  And given that the management is buying back stock  it clearly feels that there is no other better use of the shareholder capital in front of them   Absence of a significant growth initiative  Bed Bath and Beyond is a neutral stock today  If you buy it  you will probably match the market returns over long term ,2013-02-15,Shailesh Kumar,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-bed-bath---beyond-a-good-buy-now-155403,155403
