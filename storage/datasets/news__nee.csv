138525,360040,NEE,NextEra Energy Generates High End Results to End 2019,news,"NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  delivered another strong year operationally as well as financially in 2019  Overall  the clean energy focused utility grew its adjusted earnings per share by 8 7  versus 2018  which was above the top end of its 6  to 8  guidance range  That gave the company the power to generate a high end total return of 43   which outpaced both the S P 500 Utility Index as well as the broader S P 500  
Digging into the numbers

Data source  NextEra Energy  YOY   year over year 
While NextEra s earnings slipped slightly against the year ago period  they were enough to push its full year total to  4 06 billion  or  8 37 per share  which came in above its guidance  Overall  the company generated solid results across its three operating segments 

Earnings within Florida Power   Light  which is the largest rate regulated electric utility in the country  declined slightly versus the year ago period  due mainly to storm restoration costs  The segment s full year earnings  meanwhile  rose 7 5  thanks to the roughly  5 8 billion the company spent to expand those operations  which helped it add 100 000 new customers during the fourth quarter 
Gulf Power  which the company acquired last year  generated solid results during the quarter  pushing its full year adjusted earnings to  200 million  up 25  versus 2018  The company made excellent progress in integrating that business  which helped reduce its operating and maintenance costs by 20  during the year 
Finally  the company s energy resource segment produced solid results as earnings rose slightly to  326 million  For the full year  the renewable energy and gas pipeline business generated  1 7 billion  or  3 49 per share  of adjusted earnings  up 11  on a per share basis  Powering that growth was the 2 700 megawatts  MW  of renewable energy projects the company completed last year 

A look at what s ahead
NextEra s strong showing in 2019 gave it the confidence to reaffirm its long term outlook of growing its adjusted earnings by 6  to 8  per year through 2022  CEO Jim Robo stated in the earnings release that he would  be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in 2020  2021 and 2022  while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings  
For 2020  NextEra expects earnings growth in that 6  to 8  range  plus an additional  0 15 per share of accretion from Gulf Power as it benefits from its cost savings  That implies adjusted earnings should be between  8 70 and  9 20 per share this year  
One of the factors powering the company s optimism is the rate at which it s securing new renewable energy investments  Its energy resources segment added more than 5 800 MW of wind and solar projects during the year  including 1 609 MW since late October  The annual total more than replaced the 2 700 MW of projects it commissioned 
It s also worth noting that NextEra continues to secure solar projects backed by battery storage  It added 770 MW of new solar in the last couple of months  along with 340 MW of battery storage backing solar  compared with about 500 MW of wind  That lines up with its outlook for a quickening pace of new solar development thanks to the falling costs of energy storage 
A utility stock for the long haul
NextEra continues to deliver on its strategy to build one of the cleanest utilities in the world by focusing on developing renewable energy projects  With a large backlog of growth ahead  NextEra has the power to continue generating high end results  That should enable the company to keep growing its dividend as well as shareholder value ",2020-01-24,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmhd-,2067317

I will turn the call over to Jim James L  Robo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Matt  and good morning everyone  2019 was a terrific year for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners  NextEra Energy s performance was strong  both financially and operationally  and we had outstanding execution on our initiatives to continue to drive future growth across the Company  By successfully executing on our plans  NextEra Energy extended its long track record of delivering value for shareholders with adjusted earnings per share of  8 37  up 8 7  from 2018  Over the past 15 years  we ve now delivered compound annual growth in adjusted EPS of nearly 8 5   which is the highest among all Top 10 power companies who have achieved on average compound annual growth of less than 4  over the same period Amidst the significant growth  the Company has maintained one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry  In 2019  we delivered a total shareholder return of approximately 43   significantly outperforming both the S P 500 and the S P 500 Utilities Index and continuing to outperform both indices in terms of total shareholder return on a one  three  five  seven  and 10 year basis  Over the past 15 years  we have outperformed all of the other companies in the S P Utilities Index and 85  of the companies in the S P 500  while more than tripling the total shareholder return of both indices Although we are proud of our long term track record of creating shareholder value  we remain utterly focused on the future and committed to continuing that track record going forward During 2019  FPL successfully executed on its ongoing capital plan  including placing the highly efficient Okeechobee Clean Energy Center and an additional 300 megawatts of cost effective solar in service on time and on budget  Smart capital investments such as these help FPL improve its already best in class customer value proposition despite customer bills that were already nearly 30  below the national average and among the lowest of all 54 electric providers in the state of Florida  Earlier this month  the typical FPL residential customer bill decreased by nearly  4 or roughly 4   FPL had continued success with its cost savings initiatives  reducing its already best in class dollar per retail megawatt hour non fuel O M costs by more than 5  year over year These ongoing cost savings combined with the flexibility afforded by FPL s current settlement agreement enabled FPL to avoid a customer surcharge for the roughly  260 million of storm restoration costs related to Hurricane Dorian  In addition to low bills  FPL delivered its best ever service reliability performance in 2019 and was recognized for the fourth time in five years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation Finally  last quarter  we were pleased that following an extensive and thorough 18 month review  the Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted Turkey Point units 3 and 4 their second 20 year license extensions  These units are the first nuclear power plants in the United States to achieve this milestone and this decision supports the continued production of clean  zero emission  reliable and affordable nuclear power in Florida for many years to come Beyond executing on its strategic initiatives  during 2019  FPL positioned itself well for continued long term growth  Early in the year  FPL announced its groundbreaking 30 by 30 plan  which is one of the world s largest solar expansions and will result in roughly 10 000 megawatts of incremental solar capacity on FPL s solar system    FPL system This solar expansion  combined with low cost battery storage solutions such as the Manatee Energy Storage Center that was announced during 2019  represent the next phase of FPL s generation modernization efforts  and are expected to further reduce FPL s CO2 emissions rates  which is already among the lowest in the nation and has declined more than 30  since 2005  In addition to the terrific progress in generation  during the year  Florida past the Public Utility Storm Protection Plans law that allows for clause recovery of storm hardening investments  including undergrounding  This new law supports continued hardening of FPL s already storm resilient energy grid and allows FPL to pursue these investments in a programmatic manner over the course of decades  while deploying billions of dollars of incremental capital for the benefit of customers  We expect the final rules related to the new law to take effect later this quarter and that FPL will seek to begin clause recovery of its storm hardening investments beginning in 2021 With terrific visibility into significant investment programs such as these  we remain as confident as ever about FPL s ability to sustain its long term growth trajectory  while further improving our customers  value proposition  The Energy Resources team also continued its long track record of strong execution in 2019  The renewables origination success remained particularly strong  with the team adding more than 5 800 megawatts to our backlog over the past year  as we continue operating in what we believe to be the best renewables development environment in our history Our ongoing renewables origination success results from our ability to leverage Energy Resources  competitive advantages  including our best in class development skills  large pipeline of sites and interconnection queue positions  strong customer relationships  purchasing power  best in class construction expertise  resource assessment capabilities  strong access to and cost of capital advantages  and world class operations capability More than 50  of the solar megawatts that were added to our backlog in 2019 including a battery storage component  and the current backlog is more than 2 000 megawatts of trifecta projects that combined wind  solar  and battery storage together  We also increasingly see storage as an important stand alone business in its own right  as we were viewing a number of opportunities to add storage to our existing solar sites to take advantage of the ITC and enhance the value of our existing projects for customers This highlights the rapid transition to the next phase of renewables development that pairs low cost wind and solar energy with a low cost battery storage solution as well as Energy Resources  unique skills to combine the three technologies into integrated near firm low cost products  Energy Resources  significant competitive advantages position it well to capitalize on the enormous disruption that is occurring to the nation s generation fleet  We continue to expect that by the middle of this decade  without incentives  new near firm wind is going to be a  20 to  30 per megawatt hour product and new near firm solar is going to be a  30 to  40 per megawatt hour product  At these prices  new near firm renewables will be cheaper than the operating costs of most existing coal  nuclear  less efficient oil and gas fire generation units We were pleased by the 60  PTC extension that was passed in 2019 and we expect that will support incremental wind demand in 2023 and 2024  Our confidence in renewables being the low cost generation alternative in the middle of this decade remains stronger than ever  We expect the disruptive nature of renewables to be terrific for customers  terrific for the environment  and terrific for shareholders by helping to drive tremendous growth for this Company over the next decade Let me now turn to Gulf Power and highlight how we executed in 2019 against some of the long term objectives that we outlined at last year  As we ve often discussed  two of the key hallmarks of the NextEra Energy playbook are reduced operating costs and using those savings to fund smart capital investments for our customers  After one year of ownership  we are well on our way to executing this strategy at Gulf Power  In 2019  we reduced Gulf Power s O M costs by approximately 20  year over year  In addition to lowering costs  we ve also identified smart investment opportunities to benefit customers  In 2019  Gulf Power invested approximately  730 million or roughly 2 5 times Gulf Power s average capital investment amount over the past five years and was able to grow regulatory capital employed at roughly 11  year over year Beyond realizing operating efficiencies and deploying smart capital  in the past year  Gulf Power was able to meaningfully improve its customer value proposition  Gulf Power achieved its best ever service reliability year  which was approximately 20  better than its 2018 results  Customer service was also better with notable improvements in speed of answer in Florida Public Service Commission complaints There is nothing more important in our Company than the safety of our employees  We made significant improvements in this area in 2019 as well  with an approximately 40  reduction in our OSHA rate at Gulf Power versus 2018  As the major capital investments that we advanced during 2019 come into service in 2020 and beyond  they will help achieve the other key objectives that we have outlined at Gulf Power such as meaningful emissions reductions and  perhaps most importantly  a significant reduction in customer bills in real terms In addition to creating tremendous customer value  we expect that execution of the plans we laid out at Gulf Power will also generate great outcomes for our shareholders as well  In our first year of ownership  Gulf Power s adjusted earnings increased by 25  year over year  This outcome was even better than our plan at the start of the year and positions us well to deliver on the financial growth objectives that we outlined when we announced the acquisition  This high level performance across the board would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of all Gulf Power employees  While we are pleased with the results that we ve achieved at Gulf Power during 2019  we remain focused on the significant execution ahead of us here to deliver even greater value to our customers and our shareholders Finally  we were once again honored to be named for the 13th time in 14 years Number 1 in the electric and gas utilities industry on Fortune s list of Most Admired Companies  as well as ranked among the Top 10 companies worldwide across all industries for social responsibility During 2019 alone  NextEra Energy made approximately  13 billion in capital investments in American energy infrastructure  making us one of the top capital investors in the U S  in any industry  None of these recognitions nor our track record of success would be possible without the hard work and commitment to excellence of our people  who live our core value of doing the right thing every day  In the last year  there has been an increasing focus on the ESG on the part of many of our stakeholders  The fact is  our Company has been focused on all of the elements of ESG for more than 25 years  We are proud of our track record here  but there is still so much more to do in this country to decarbonize the electric transportation in industrial sectors NextEra Energy is living proof that you can be clean and low cost and financially successful all at the same time  We will be at the vanguard of building a sustainable energy era  that is both clean and affordable  and we are driving very hard to continue to be at the forefront of the disruption that is occurring within the energy sector  We expect that the execution of our strategy will drive meaningful CO2 emissions reductions across the country  while simultaneously lowering generation cost for customers  And our continued investments in clean energy will help advance NextEra Energy toward its goal of reducing its CO2 emissions rate by 67  by 2025 from a 2005 baseline In summary  I continue to remain as enthusiastic as ever about NextEra Energy s long term growth prospects  In 2019  we extended our long term track record of executing for the benefit of customers and shareholders and further developed our best in class organic growth prospects  Based on the strength and diversity of our underlying businesses  I will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in 2020  2021  and 2022  while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings  We remain intensely focused on execution and continuing to drive shareholder value over the coming years Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners  which also had a terrific year of execution in 2019  In the more than five years since the IPO  NextEra Energy Partners has consistently delivered on its commitments  That execute    that history of execution is supported by NextEra Energy Partners  outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets  which grew significantly and was further diversified in 2019  During the year  NextEra Energy Partners  acquired a portfolio of more than 600 megawatts of wind and solar assets from Energy Resources  Additionally  during the fourth quarter  NextEra Energy Partners closed down the acquisition of Meade Pipeline Company  which owns an approximately 40  aggregate interest in Central Penn Line  an intrastate natural gas pipeline in Pennsylvania that is backed by a minimum 14 year contract with a high credit quality customer and no volumetric risk Finally  during the year  NextEra Energy Partners advanced an additional organic growth opportunity  announcing the repowering of 275 megawatts of wind projects  We are proud that 2019 is the first year that NextEra Energy Partners successfully executed on all of the three ways it can grow  Organically acquiring assets from third parties and acquiring assets from Energy Resources portfolio  highlighting the clear flexibility and visibility into growth going forward  To support the ongoing growth investments and optimize the capital structure for the benefit of LP unitholders  NextEra Energy Partners completed a number of financings and refinancings in 2019 as well At the start of the year  NextEra Energy Partners faced headwinds related to the PG E bankruptcy  The team immediately focused on managing and mitigating the negative impacts of this event  and we ended 2019 having favorably addressed many of the challenges  The Energy Resources portfolio acquisition and associated financing that we announced last March allowed NextEra Energy Partners to complete its original 2019 growth objectives  even after excluding PG E related project cash flows During the year  NextEra Energy Partners also purchased all of the outstanding holding company and operating company notes at our Genesis Project  In addition to resulting in an increase in run rate cash available for distribution through the removal of project level debt service as a result of the purchase of the debt  NextEra Energy Partners received approximately  128 million of distributions that had been or were expected to be restricted at the project  The release of this cash was used to partially fund the debt repurchase  I remain confident about a long term favorable resolution for our PG E related assets In addition to growing LP distributions by 15  year over year and achieving a run rate adjusted EBITDA range in excess of what was originally expected  NextEra Energy Partners year end 2019 run rate cash available for distribution expectations  assuming full contributions from PG E related projects  represents approximately 60  growth from the comparable year end 2018 run rate range  With this strong year over year growth in cash available for distribution  NextEra Energy Partners expects to be able to achieve its long term distribution growth expectations without the need for additional asset acquisitions until 2021  As of year end 2020  we expect to have achieved NextEra Energy Partners  distribution growth objectives  while maintaining a trailing 12 month payout ratio in the mid 70s range  even after excluding cash distributions from our Desert Sunlight projects NEP delivered an attractive total unitholder return of approximately 28  in 2019  further advancing its history of value creation since the IPO  I continue to believe that the combination of NEP s clean energy portfolio  growth visibility and flexibility to finance that growth offer LP unitholders an attractive investor value proposition  As with NextEra Energy  we remain focused on continuing to execute and delivering that unitholder value over the coming years I ll now turn the call over to Rebecca  who will review the 2019 results in more detail Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Jim  and good morning everyone  Let s now turn to the detailed results  beginning with FPL  For the fourth quarter of 2019  FPL reported net income of  400 million or  0 81 per share  down  0 04 per share year over year  For the full year 2019  FPL reported net income of  2 33 billion or  4 81 per share  an increase of  0 26 per share versus 2018  Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 8 3  for 2019 and was the principal driver of FPL s net income growth of roughly 8  for the full year During the fourth quarter  growth from new investments was offset by a number of factors  including a contribution to our charitable foundation that should fund its operations for the next several years  FPL s capital expenditures were approximately  2 billion in the fourth quarter  bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly  5 8 billion  FPL s reported ROE for regulatory purposes was 11 6  for the 12 months ending December 31  2019  which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9 6  to 11 6  under our current rate agreement During the fourth quarter  we utilized a total of  18 million of reserve amortization  including the approximately  260 million that was utilized to offset Hurricane Dorian storm restoration costs  leaving FPL with a year end 2019 balance of  893 million  We continue to expect that FPL will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of reserve amortization to operate under the current base rate settlement agreement for one additional year  and as a result  expect to file a base rate case in the first quarter of 2021 for new rates that are effective in January of 2022  While we have not made a final decision  based on our review  we expect that the merging of FPL and Gulf Power and making a single rate case filing will result in customer benefits  and we therefore see this as a likely approach for the filing at this time All of our major capital projects at FPL are progressing well  The 10 solar sites  totaling nearly 750 megawatts of combined capacity that are currently being built across FPL s service territory  are all on track and on budget to begin providing cost effective energy to FPL customers in early 2020  To support the significant solar expansion that FPL is leading across Florida  we have secured sites that could support 10 gigawatts of future projects Earlier this month  Florida Public Service Commission held hearings on FPL s proposed Solar Together program  We continue to expect a decision about the proposed program at the end of the first quarter  Beyond solar  construction on the highly efficient roughly 1 200 megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and on budget  as it continues to advance toward its projected commercial operations date in 2022  We continue to expect that FPL s ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate of regulatory capital employed of approximately 9  from 2018 through 2022  while further enhancing our best in class customer value proposition Let me now turn to Gulf Power  which reported fourth quarter 2019 GAAP and adjusted earnings of  23 million and  26 million respectively or  0 05 per share  For the full year  Gulf Power reported GAAP earnings of  180 million or  0 37 per share and adjusted earnings of  200 million or  0 41 per share  As a reminder  during the first 12 months following the closing of the acquisition  we excluded one time acquisition integration costs from adjusted earnings  Additionally  interest expense to finance the acquisition is reflected in Corporate and Other  Gulf Power s reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 10 8  for the 12 months ending December 2019  which is in the upper half of the allowed band of 9 25  to 11 25  under its current rate agreement  For the full year 2020  we expect to target a regulatory ROE near the upper end of its allowed band  assuming normal weather and operating conditions As Jim discussed  the overall execution of Gulf Power s capital program is advancing well  Gulf Power s first solar development project  the roughly 75 megawatt Blue Indigo Solar Energy Center is expected to go into service later this quarter and generate significant customer savings over its lifetime  All of the other major capital investments  including the North Florida Resiliency Connection and the Plant Crist coal to natural gas conversion continue to remain on track The Florida economy remains healthy as Florida s population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the nation  According to recent IRS data  Florida attracted a net gain of roughly  16 billion in personal taxable income in 2018  by far the highest of any state in the country and the fastest rate of growth as well  which is a reflection of the attraction of Florida s low tax pro business policies  Florida s most recent seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 3 1   below the national average  and at the lowest level in the decade  Florida has now added nearly 2 million private sector jobs over the last 10 years  Leading indicators in the real estate sector have remained at a stable pace  reflecting continued strength of the Florida housing market  Other positive economic data across the state include continued strength in retail taxable sales as well as the consumer confidence index  which remains near 10 year highs During the quarter  FPL s average number of customers increased by approximately 100 000 from the comparable prior year quarter  driven by continued solid underlying growth and the addition of Vero Beach s roughly 35 000 customers late last year  For 2019  FPL s retail sales increased 1 7  from the prior year  driven primarily by a favorable weather comparison  On a weather normalized basis  FPL s retail sales declined by 0 6   as customer growth was more than offset by a reduction in underlying usage per customer  The decline in underlying usage was a reversal from the trend that FPL experienced in 2018  when underlying usage increased by 1 7   As we previously noted  usage per customer tends to exhibit significant volatility  which can be more pronounced during periods of particularly strong weather conditions  similar to those experienced during 2019  which makes distinguishing between underlying usage changes and weather impacts challenging For Gulf Power  the average number of customers increased slightly versus the comparable prior year quarter  as it moves beyond the impacts of Hurricane Michael in 2018  For 2019  Gulf Power s retail sales declined slightly  due to unfavorable weather and a small decline in underlying usage per customer Let me now turn to Energy Resources  beginning with a reporting change in our segments  Given the Trans Bay Cable acquisition during 2019  we have reevaluated our operating segments and made a change to reflect the overall scale of our competitive transmission business and the management of these projects within our Company  Our reporting for Energy Resources now includes the results of our NextEra Energy Transmission projects formerly reported in Corporate and Other segment  Our 2018 results have been adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes  resulting in increase in Energy Resources full year 2018 adjusted EPS of  0 09 per share Incorporating the reporting change  Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of  433 million or  0 88 per share  Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were  326 million or  0 66 per share  Energy Resources  contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter decreased  0 01 versus the prior year comparable period  as strong underlying growth from new and existing investments was more than offset by a number of    number of items  including the negative  0 14 adjusted EPS impact of our refinancing activities  which were primarily related to financing breakage costs associated with several wind repowerings as well as Energy Resources  share of cost associated with the acquisition of the outstanding Genesis debt  As a reminder  while these financing    refinancing activities created a reduction in fourth quarter adjusted earnings  they are expected to translate to favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders For the full year  Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of  1 81 billion or  3 72 per share and adjusted earnings of  1 7 billion or  3 49 per share  Energy Resources full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased  0 35 or approximately 11  versus 2018  For the full year  growth was driven by continued additions to our renewables portfolio  as contributions from new investments increased by  0 55 per share  Contributions from our gas infrastructure business  including existing pipelines  increased by  0 13 versus the prior year  Also contributing favorably were the customer supply and trading business  where our contributions increased by  0 05 versus 2018  and NextEra Energy Transmission  which increased results  0 04 year over year  primarily as a result of the Trans Bay Cable acquisition that closed in the middle of 2019  These favorable results were partially offset by higher interest expense  reflecting the negative  0 14 adjusted EPS impact in the fourth quarter refinancing activities  as well as growth in the business and lower contributions from the existing generation assets  In 2019  wind resource was 96  of the long term average  down from 97  a year earlier  Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide In 2019  Energy Resources continued to advance its position as the leading developer and operator of wind  solar  and battery storage projects  commissioning approximately 2 700 megawatts of renewables projects in the US  including repowering  Since the call    we    since the last call  we have added 1 609 megawatts renewables projects to our backlog  including approximately 500 megawatts of combined new wind and repowering 700 megawatts of solar and 340 megawatts of battery storage  all of which will be paired with new solar projects  Energy Resources has now placed a total of approximately 3 700 megawatts of repowering projects in service since 2017  which represents approximately one third of its operating wind portfolio as of year end 2016  We expect that by the end of 2020  more than 60  of Energy Resources operating wind projects will have been originally commissioned or repowered within the last five years  highlighting the young age of the overall fleet and the expected long date future value creation of the portfolio Following the terrific origination year in 2019 and with nearly three years remaining in the period  we are now within the 2019 to 2022 renewables development ranges that we introduced in the middle of last year  For the post 2022 period  our backlog is already more than 2 400 megawatts  placing us far ahead of our historical origination activity at this early stage  The accompanying slide provides additional detail on where our renewables development program now stands Beyond renewables  as of year end 2019  the Mountain Valley Pipeline was approximately 90  complete  We have been working with our project partners to resolve all of the outstanding permit issues for the pipeline and we continue to make good progress on these efforts  We expect that the issues related to MVP s biological opinion and Nationwide 12 Permit will be resolved in the spring  allowing construction work along much of the route to resume  We also remain hopeful that the Supreme Court will overturn the Fourth Circuit Court s original decision on Atlantic Coast Pipeline s case related to its Appalachian Trail crossing authorization  resolving similar challenges for MVP  We continue to target a full in service date for the pipeline during 2020 and an overall project cost estimate of approximately  5 4 billion Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy  For the fourth quarter of 2019  GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was  975 million or  1 99 per share  NextEra Energy s fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were  706 million or  1 44 per share  respectively  For the full year 2019  GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was  3 77 billion or  7 76 per share  Adjusted earnings were  4 06 billion or  8 37 per share For the Corporate and Other segment  adjusted earnings for the full year decreased  0 35 per share compared to the 2018 prior comparable period  primarily as a result of higher interest expense related to the Gulf Power acquisition financing  NextEra Energy also delivered strong operating cash flow growth  which increased at a faster rate than the adjusted EPS growth rate As expected  during 2019  we also maintained our strong credit position  Based on the S P methodology  we estimate that we ended the year at a 22 5  FFO to debt level versus our current downgrade threshold of 21   For Moody s  we expect 2019 CFO pre working capital to debt was 19 6  versus our current downgrade threshold of 18   NextEra Energy s cushion versus our credit metrics reflects the continued strength of our balance sheet and supports the record roughly  14 billion of capital investments that we expect to make in 2020 The financial expectations that we extended last year through 2022 remain unchanged  We continue to expect that NextEra Energy s adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6  to 8  through 2021 off of the 2018 adjusted EPS of  7 70  plus the accretion of  0 15 and  0 20 in 2020 and 2021 respectively from the Florida acquisitions  For 2020  we continue to expect our adjusted EPS to be in the range of  8 70 to  9 20  And as Jim highlighted  we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of this range  This year  we do expect that our adjusted EPS growth will be more weighted toward the second half of the year For 2022  we expect to grow adjusted EPS in the range of 6  to 8  off 2021 adjusted EPS  translating to a range of  10 00 to  10 75 per share  From 2018 to 2022  we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range  As always  all of our expectations are subject to the usual caveats  including but not limited to  normal weather and operating conditions Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners  which also had a strong year of operational and financial performance in 2019  Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was  280 million and cash available for distribution was  101 million  an increase of 70  and 130  respectively  This strong growth was driven primarily by the significant year over year growth in NextEra Energy Partners portfolio  including the 2019 acquisitions of the Energy Resources assets and the Meade Pipeline Company  as well as the full quarter s contribution from the portfolio of projects that were acquired in late 2018 For the full year 2019  adjusted EBITDA was  1 1 billion  up 25  year over year  Cash available for distribution  excluding all contributions from our Desert Sunlight projects  was  366 million  an increase of 8  from the prior year  Including full contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects  NextEra Energy Partners achieve CAFD growth of 20  versus 2018  Similar to the quarterly results  full year growth in both adjusted EBITDA and CAFD was primarily driven by portfolio growth  The benefit from new projects was partially offset by the divestiture of Canadian assets during 2018 Cash available for distribution was also reduced by higher corporate level interest expense  As a reminder  these results include the impact of IDR fees  which we treat as an operating expense  Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide  Yesterday  the NextEra Energy Partners  Board declared a quarterly distribution of  0 535 per common unit or  2 14 per unit on an annualized basis  up 15  from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2019 As Jim mentioned  during 2019  NextEra Energy Partners executed several financing for the benefit of LP unitholders  In addition to raising approximately  1 2 billion of unsecured holding company notes  which priced at some of the lowest spreads ever in the sector  NextEra Energy Partners also raised  1 4 billion of low cost project finance debt and executed  1 3 billion revolver extension  NextEra Energy Partners also raised  1 8 billion through three convertible equity portfolio financings  With low initial coupons  the convertible equity portfolio financings provide more cash to LP unitholders  allowing NextEra Energy Partners to acquire fewer assets to achieve the same level of future distribution growth  which will also as a result lower future financing needs  In addition to reduced future asset and equity needs  these financings provide NextEra Partners the flexibility to convert into common units at no discount over a long period of time  This should be accretive to LP unitholders who retain all of the unit price upside as NextEra Energy Partners executes on its expected distribution growth objectives  These attributes  combined with the significant flexibility that NextEra Partners retains those financings  including the timing of conversion  option to convert at any price  option to pay the buyout in cash rather than units  and the option to deploy the buyout amount into other assets  should generate significant value to LP unitholders  while also providing significant downside protection Finally  last quarter  following the achievement of certain NextEra Energy Partners unit trading thresholds  we converted the second tranche of the convertible preferred securities that we issued in 2017 into additionally    an additional roughly 4 7 million NextEra Energy Partners  common units  further supporting our ongoing goal of using low cost financing products to layer in equity over time  The NextEra Energy Partners portfolio at year end 2019 supports the revised adjusted EBITDA and CAFD December 31  2019 run rate expectations that we announced at the time of the Meade acquisition  Since NextEra Energy Partners long term distribution growth expectations are supported without the need of additional asset acquisitions until 2021  The December 31  2020 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and CAFD remain unchanged at the same levels as the year end 2019 run rate expectations  Including full contributions from the PG E related projects  year end 2020 run rate cash available for distribution is expected to be in a range of  560 million to  640 million  reflecting calendar year 2021 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2020 and assuming normal weather and operating conditions Excluding all contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects  NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect a year end 2020 run rate for CAFD in the range of  505 million to  585 million  Year end 2020 run rate adjusted EBITDA expectations  which assume full contributions from PG E related projects as revenue is expected to continue to be recognized  are  1 225 billion to  1 4 billion As a reminder  all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense  From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2019 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of  2 14  we continue to see 12  to 15  growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024  We expect that the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2020 distribution that is payable in February of 2021 to be in the range of  2 40 to  2 46 per common unit In summary  we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have excellent prospects for growth  FPL  Gulf Power  Energy Resources  and NextEra Energy Partners each have an outstanding set of opportunities across the board  The progress we made in 2019 reinforces our long term growth prospects  And while we have a lot to execute on in 2020  we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year That concludes our prepared remarks  and with that  we ll open up the line for questions Questions and Answers OperatorLadies and gentlemen  at this time  we ll begin the question and answer session   Operator Instructions  Our first question today comes from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI  Please go ahead with your question Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystThanks  Congratulations on another very  very consistent year performance Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Greg  Good morning Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystCouple of questions for you  Based on my back of the envelope math  it doesn t look like you earned at the maximum allowable ROE at Florida Power   Light this year  Can you tell us what    where you landed on a return on equity basis for fiscal year  19 Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Greg  from a reported regulatory ROE standpoint  so what ultimately goes to the Florida Public Service Commission  we did earn the 11 6  ROE as allowed under our settlement agreement  You are right  we did have some below the line expenses  which is typical  but those below the line expenses are excluded from that regulatory ROE calculation Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystGot you  Understood  And then when you    you point out in your slide deck that the majority of your    the majority of your PTCs are now being allocated through tax equity  There is a very clear slide in the appendix on that  That means that we should be looking at NCI on the balance sheet flowing through the income statement as the way that that s flowing through earnings now  Is that correct Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes  that s correct Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  And the average amortization of a tax equity deal for a wind project is what approximately 10 years  is that    is that right Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  The earnings recognition is roughly coincident with the 10 year PTC range that are for all of our wind projects that are in PTCs Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystRight  And for solar deal  that would be slightly faster Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  It s typically relates to the recognition of the ITC period  So  for many tax equity structures  that s over five years  Certain tax equity partners prefer a seven year structure  And so  then it would be over seven years as opposed to five Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystRight  And as you guys gear up for preparing for rate case in 2021  are there any milestones this year or will the majority of the activity be happening in early  21 Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial OfficerAs you certainly appreciate there is a ton of milestones that are largely internal for our teams as they get ready for any rate proceeding and many of those preparation efforts started well before this year and are ongoing and we have the incremental work this year of doing all the analysis of thinking about bringing FPL and Gulf together  But as I highlighted in the prepared remarks  based on what we know today  our expectation is that we would file a rate case in early  21 for the new rates effective in 2022  and you know the first start of that would be the filing of the test year letter  which we would expect to file in early  21 Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystGreat  My last question is the battery storage backlog is obviously continuing to ramp  are you buying battery storage sort of from    are you buying the product from another vendor or are you buying the components from different OEMs and building your own bespoke battery storage product  In other words  are you using a vendor like Fluence or one of the other sort of total product companies or are you sourcing components and building your own battery units Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial OfficerIt s much more of the latter  Greg  We see tremendous amount of value and are being able to have some nimbleness in where we procure the battery packs  But then we also are procuring separately as you suggested the things like the containers and the other equipment that you would ultimately use to assemble the battery facility and then also we re designing our own management systems  We ultimately believe that some of the real value add that we re going to be able to add to customers that will likely differentiate us from others is that battery system management  because we ve talked about with you guys and with others over time that there is probably not one value stream that creates the value for batteries  it s usually a couple of different applications within the same system and that management system and optimizing that is going to be part of the secret sauce of batteries So we ve invested a lot of time and energy and thinking through that not only on the Energy Resources deployments  but also for the deployments that we ve had at FPL  and we ve learned a tremendous amount and we re really excited as we highlighted in the prepared remarks about batteries as a terrific supplement to further renewables deployment  certainly in the middle part of the next decade and thereafter as renewables become a significant component of the generation stack in the U S  power markets Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystThanks a lot Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research  Please go ahead with your question Steve Fleishman    Wolfe Research    AnalystYeah  Hi  good morning  Just a question first  if you could update us on the Santee Cooper situation and your interest there  And then secondly  with JEA now gone and stock obviously doing very well  just kind of overall thought process on M A strategy and opportunities right now  Thanks James L  Robo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo Steve  this is Jim  I ll take that  Obviously  we re pretty limited in what we can say about the Santee Cooper situation other than what I ve said previously  which is we remain very interested in Santee Cooper and we think South Carolina is a terrific place to do business and that s probably all I can say about that On the JEA front  I would say we re disappointed that the sale process has been terminated  We think we could have brought enormous value to the customers of    and the citizens of Jacksonville and we think it s unfortunate that it s been terminated  but it is    that is what it is  And in terms of terms of future M A activity  I will repeat what I ve been pretty consistent in terms of what our strategy is on that front  which is we    in terms of what we like  we have been very focused  First of all  I don t think there is a utility in the country that wouldn t benefit from the application of our playbook  That said  we have been focused on opportunities in the Southeast  in the Midwest  as well as FERC regulated opportunities  Those are the  from a regulatory standpoint and other opportunities  what we think are the best fit for us and that remains our focus  And we continue to be very interested in trying to do something That said  M A is always hard and there are a lot of hurdles to get over and we will as always be extraordinarily financially disciplined  You will never see us announce a deal that we say is strategic and has no accretion  So anything that we do  will have significant accretion associated with it  So I think it s probably the sum total what I could say on that Steve Fleishman    Wolfe Research    AnalystOkay  One quick technical question  just    is there a quick and easy way you can quantify the balance sheet capacity available for these FFO to debt and metrics at Moody s and S P in terms of dollars Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  we re probably not going to quantify it exactly  Steve  As you ve heard us say quite a number of times over the years  a strong balance sheet is incredibly important to us  We clearly have some room from our downgrade threshold  which is certainly terrific  and it s important to us as we think about how do we make sure that we re prepared for making investments that we want to make in the future  including especially this year  Setting aside the comments that just    Jim just made on M A  just for our organic growth prospects alone  we have  14 billion of planned capital investment in our business and having a strong balance sheet as we start to make those investments is incredibly important Steve Fleishman    Wolfe Research    AnalystGreat  thank you OperatorOur next question comes from Julien Dumoulin Smith from Bank of America  Please go with your question Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America    AnalystHey  good morning  Can you hear me Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  We can hear you just fine Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America    AnalystExcellent  So  thanks again for all the commentary  So perhaps kicking it off on the repowering front  would just be curious on your thoughts on the 24  Phonetic  opportunity now given the PTC extension  How does that shift your thinking and logic around incremental repower  And I know you provided already some fairly detailed remarks on repowering already  but I want to dig in on that specific opportunity  especially given that that s a year already after the timeline for the solar ITC here  if you can elaborate Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial OfficerSure  of course  As we highlighted in our development expectations that we laid out this summer for the 2019 through 2022 time frame  you ll note that the repowering opportunities that we saw were heavily and at that time exclusively in the 2019 to 2020 time frame  We ve continued to work on opportunities to repower our assets at both in 80  PTC and a 60  PTC  So  first  we ll focus on the 80  before we even think about the extensions of the    if anything that s possible in 60  But remember  there s always a trade off in making these investment opportunities  Part of the economic value of that is getting the new set of PTCs and so there is a balance of the cost of the investment that you need to make in that equipment and also ensuring that you can meet the IRS test of the 80 20 valuation and as the PTC value goes down  it gets a little bit harder to justify those    in both of those requirements So again  we thought it was a terrific program to create a huge amount of shareholder value  really highlights the option value embedded in our portfolio and we ll continue to be creative and work toward creating more opportunities like that where things that are analogous to it in the future Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America    AnalystGot it  Excellent  And just clarifying the last question a little bit  You mentioned FERC regulated opportunities  Jim  Can you elaborate a little bit further on thought process there  Obviously  this transmission ROE question has been kind of lingering across the sectors  Just want to make sure we heard you right  just how you re thinking about various FERC asset classes James L  Robo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So obviously  we did the Trans Bay acquisition that s not in the Midwest or the Southeast  And we do on a long term basis  like FERC regulated assets  notwithstanding the recent ROE decision on the MISO transmission owners  Listen  I think there has been    obviously  that s an open docket at FERC right now  I probably can t comment on what I think the outcomes are going to be there  but other than to say  I do believe FERC regulation will be constructive in the long term and we think in the long term  it s a good place for us to deploy capital Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America    AnalystAnd maybe Jim  if I can one more quickly on ESG  as you think about establishing targets and becoming a perhaps more prescriptive and being a leader on this front  how do you think about being more specific on carbon  I know this come up a little bit  but I m curious on thought process there  I know it s also a complicated too James L  Robo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSure  You know  I think we have been  I think  pretty specific about what our 2025 goal is  which is    remember there    all of these discussions are about percent reductions  We started at an enormously lower level than the rest of the industry on just base CO2 emissions per megawatt hour generated  right  And so  any of the goals that we lay out  which    our goal is a 67  reduction off our 2005 base by 2025  I think if you went back and you looked at the 2005 average    U S  average that    and compare to our NextEra rate in 2025 to that 2005 average  I m going to give you a number and everyone is going to go check me on it  It s going to be    that would be an 85  or 90  reduction relative to the 2005 U S  average CO2 emissions rate So  we have a    we re going to significantly decarbonize our Company and our emissions  And I m really excited about the goals we set  I think they re very doable  And what I m most excited about is the role that we can play both in Florida and in the rest of the country in terms of leading the way to decarbonize not just the electric    not just the electric sector  but the transportation sector  So we have    there s lots more to do  As I said in my prepared remarks  I think the country has a lot more to do and the great news for the country and the economy is  you can be clean and low cost at the same time and whatever we do will be for the benefit of customers and it would drive    it will drive good economics  better GDP growth for the country  lower costs  and obviously a better environmental profile Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America    AnalystThank you  guys for the time  I appreciate it OperatorOur next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners  Please go ahead with your question Shahriar Pourreza    Guggenheim Partners    AnalystHey  good morning guys James L  Robo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Shahriar Pourreza    Guggenheim Partners    AnalystGood morning  So just on near backlog  it s obviously very strong again  So I m just trying to get a sense  Rebecca  on sort of how much of that backlog increase mainly on the wind side was attributed to a pull forward of projects with the modest PTC extension versus a    versus like actual incremental opportunities you re seeing  as we think about modeling forward Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I don t think it s very much  I think it s early    obviously  the PTC extension happened very  very late in 2019  So I don t think we ve seen any impacts from it whatsoever  coupled with the fact that it s quite a number of years down the road and it doesn t affect the profile of the PTC in the next three years  which is really what was driving a lot of our customers  actions In terms of the overall demand and how that s reflected  as we ve said in the past  we saw 2020 was going to be a significant development year  clearly it is for wind and that 2021 is more likely than not to be roughly comparable with where we were in 2019  And we continue to see really strong interest from our customers about wind in the long term  as they should be  As Jim highlighted the cost of wind and solar projects out in the mid 2020s  assuming there are not any meaningful extensions of the incentives  which is an assumption at this point that should be checked  but assuming those incentives are not extended  a very competitive versus existing coal  nuclear plants and some less efficient gas fired plants  So economic should continue to drive decisions for our customers for many  many years to come Shahriar Pourreza    Guggenheim Partners    AnalystGot it  And then just lastly  thanks for the incremental disclosures around Gulf  Is there anything you can like maybe provide directionally on sort of the base assumptions you re assuming in  22 as we re thinking about your EPS guidance  i e   may be from a regulatory construct or even addition to spending opportunities like the extension of SoBRA  Is there anything you can provide directionally on how you re thinking about this Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial OfficerNot much beyond what we ve already talked about in terms of everything that s built into our expectations for 2020 through 2022  And as you recall from the investor conference materials  we did lay out a lot of the detail for both businesses through 2021 and of course more detail for Energy Resources out in  22  But the fundamentals are very consistent with what we ve been doing for a long time on the regulated businesses  again focusing on good capital investment that adds value for our customers and taking cost out of the business to ensure that we have very thoughtful views on customer bills and in the case of Gulf Power targeting a meaningful decline in the bills out to the mid 2020s  So  keep doing what we re doing  and we couldn t be more excited about the growth opportunities for all of the businesses that lay out in front of us Shahriar Pourreza    Guggenheim Partners    AnalystGot it  So stay tuned around the cap structure and the reserve amortization  now you re thinking about chewing up between the two utilities Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial OfficerAbsolutely Shahriar Pourreza    Guggenheim Partners    AnalystOkay  great  Congrats  guys Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse  Please go ahead with your question Maheep Mandloi    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  this is Maheep here on behalf of Mike  Thanks for taking the questions  Just touching on the battery growth you re talking about  can you talk about these reductions you re seeing on the battery systems for the projects in the pipe  And would it be possible to quantify the scale of opportunity for retrofits on existing sites either at near or at NEP Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial OfficerIn terms of battery costs  we ve laid out some of our thoughts and expectations  I think most recently in our EEI investor presentation  We haven t broken that out between    broken out a lot of the detail between battery pack and rest of the balance of system costs  But everything that we ve laid out in terms of where we ve seen the market declines coming from in aggregate has really started to materialize  and whereas two years ago we were surprised at how much faster costs were coming down  we ve gotten more aggressive with our assumptions and now they re roughly consistent with what we were thinking We continue to be very optimistic longer term about batteries and is    the whole industry has talked about  It s really not about the power sector  it s being driven much more by the electric vehicle sector and those drivers appear to be pretty clear for quite a number of years down the road  which is really driving the manufacturing efficiencies and scale that we re seeing on the battery pack side  So really excited and optimistic about where that business is headed Maheep Mandloi    Credit Suisse    AnalystGot it  And could you just touch upon the retrofit opportunity for either NEER or NEP for batteries  And would it be possible to get the tax credits on adding storage to an existing solar project Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYes  It could obviously be a significant opportunity  coincident with the significant deployment of renewables  particularly where the penetration is high  adding batteries to existing solar sites could be very advantageous to the extent that they ve elected the ITC and ultimately our charge    are being used to charge the battery system  yes  they would qualify for ITCs as long as we meet certain conditions  So it s a terrific opportunity for the team  but it s really consistent with what we ve been thinking about for the overall market opportunity and what we ve been highlighting for quite some time now to investors Maheep Mandloi    Credit Suisse    AnalystGot it  And just one last question from me  If you could talk about the impact on interest rates on NEP s ability to execute the convertible refinancings  Thank you Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial OfficerIt s been terrific  Low interest rate environment is obviously terrific for both of our businesses  We love low cost of capital to be able to deploy these solutions as economically as possible for both our customers on the energy resources side as well as our regulated utilities and of course also for NextEra Energy Partners  So  it s been terrific Maheep Mandloi    Credit Suisse    AnalystThanks Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  65

James L  Robo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you  Matt  and good morning everyone  2019 was a terrific year for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners  NextEra Energy s performance was strong  both financially and operationally  and we had outstanding execution on our initiatives to continue to drive future growth across the Company  By successfully executing on our plans  NextEra Energy extended its long track record of delivering value for shareholders with adjusted earnings per share of  8 37  up 8 7  from 2018  Over the past 15 years  we ve now delivered compound annual growth in adjusted EPS of nearly 8 5   which is the highest among all Top 10 power companies who have achieved on average compound annual growth of less than 4  over the same period 
Amidst the significant growth  the Company has maintained one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry  In 2019  we delivered a total shareholder return of approximately 43   significantly outperforming both the S P 500 and the S P 500 Utilities Index and continuing to outperform both indices in terms of total shareholder return on a one  three  five  seven  and 10 year basis  Over the past 15 years  we have outperformed all of the other companies in the S P Utilities Index and 85  of the companies in the S P 500  while more than tripling the total shareholder return of both indices 
Although we are proud of our long term track record of creating shareholder value  we remain utterly focused on the future and committed to continuing that track record going forward 
During 2019  FPL successfully executed on its ongoing capital plan  including placing the highly efficient Okeechobee Clean Energy Center and an additional 300 megawatts of cost effective solar in service on time and on budget  Smart capital investments such as these help FPL improve its already best in class customer value proposition despite customer bills that were already nearly 30  below the national average and among the lowest of all 54 electric providers in the state of Florida  Earlier this month  the typical FPL residential customer bill decreased by nearly  4 or roughly 4   FPL had continued success with its cost savings initiatives  reducing its already best in class dollar per retail megawatt hour non fuel O M costs by more than 5  year over year 
These ongoing cost savings combined with the flexibility afforded by FPL s current settlement agreement enabled FPL to avoid a customer surcharge for the roughly  260 million of storm restoration costs related to Hurricane Dorian  In addition to low bills  FPL delivered its best ever service reliability performance in 2019 and was recognized for the fourth time in five years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation 
Finally  last quarter  we were pleased that following an extensive and thorough 18 month review  the Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted Turkey Point units 3 and 4 their second 20 year license extensions  These units are the first nuclear power plants in the United States to achieve this milestone and this decision supports the continued production of clean  zero emission  reliable and affordable nuclear power in Florida for many years to come 
Beyond executing on its strategic initiatives  during 2019  FPL positioned itself well for continued long term growth  Early in the year  FPL announced its groundbreaking 30 by 30 plan  which is one of the world s largest solar expansions and will result in roughly 10 000 megawatts of incremental solar capacity on FPL s solar system    FPL system 
This solar expansion  combined with low cost battery storage solutions such as the Manatee Energy Storage Center that was announced during 2019  represent the next phase of FPL s generation modernization efforts  and are expected to further reduce FPL s CO2 emissions rates  which is already among the lowest in the nation and has declined more than 30  since 2005  In addition to the terrific progress in generation  during the year  Florida past the Public Utility Storm Protection Plans law that allows for clause recovery of storm hardening investments  including undergrounding  This new law supports continued hardening of FPL s already storm resilient energy grid and allows FPL to pursue these investments in a programmatic manner over the course of decades  while deploying billions of dollars of incremental capital for the benefit of customers  We expect the final rules related to the new law to take effect later this quarter and that FPL will seek to begin clause recovery of its storm hardening investments beginning in 2021 
With terrific visibility into significant investment programs such as these  we remain as confident as ever about FPL s ability to sustain its long term growth trajectory  while further improving our customers  value proposition  The Energy Resources team also continued its long track record of strong execution in 2019  The renewables origination success remained particularly strong  with the team adding more than 5 800 megawatts to our backlog over the past year  as we continue operating in what we believe to be the best renewables development environment in our history 
Our ongoing renewables origination success results from our ability to leverage Energy Resources  competitive advantages  including our best in class development skills  large pipeline of sites and interconnection queue positions  strong customer relationships  purchasing power  best in class construction expertise  resource assessment capabilities  strong access to and cost of capital advantages  and world class operations capability 
More than 50  of the solar megawatts that were added to our backlog in 2019 including a battery storage component  and the current backlog is more than 2 000 megawatts of trifecta projects that combined wind  solar  and battery storage together  We also increasingly see storage as an important stand alone business in its own right  as we were viewing a number of opportunities to add storage to our existing solar sites to take advantage of the ITC and enhance the value of our existing projects for customers 
This highlights the rapid transition to the next phase of renewables development that pairs low cost wind and solar energy with a low cost battery storage solution as well as Energy Resources  unique skills to combine the three technologies into integrated near firm low cost products  Energy Resources  significant competitive advantages position it well to capitalize on the enormous disruption that is occurring to the nation s generation fleet  We continue to expect that by the middle of this decade  without incentives  new near firm wind is going to be a  20 to  30 per megawatt hour product and new near firm solar is going to be a  30 to  40 per megawatt hour product  At these prices  new near firm renewables will be cheaper than the operating costs of most existing coal  nuclear  less efficient oil and gas fire generation units 
We were pleased by the 60  PTC extension that was passed in 2019 and we expect that will support incremental wind demand in 2023 and 2024  Our confidence in renewables being the low cost generation alternative in the middle of this decade remains stronger than ever  We expect the disruptive nature of renewables to be terrific for customers  terrific for the environment  and terrific for shareholders by helping to drive tremendous growth for this Company over the next decade 
Let me now turn to Gulf Power and highlight how we executed in 2019 against some of the long term objectives that we outlined at last year  As we ve often discussed  two of the key hallmarks of the NextEra Energy playbook are reduced operating costs and using those savings to fund smart capital investments for our customers  After one year of ownership  we are well on our way to executing this strategy at Gulf Power  In 2019  we reduced Gulf Power s O M costs by approximately 20  year over year  In addition to lowering costs  we ve also identified smart investment opportunities to benefit customers  In 2019  Gulf Power invested approximately  730 million or roughly 2 5 times Gulf Power s average capital investment amount over the past five years and was able to grow regulatory capital employed at roughly 11  year over year 
Beyond realizing operating efficiencies and deploying smart capital  in the past year  Gulf Power was able to meaningfully improve its customer value proposition  Gulf Power achieved its best ever service reliability year  which was approximately 20  better than its 2018 results  Customer service was also better with notable improvements in speed of answer in Florida Public Service Commission complaints 
There is nothing more important in our Company than the safety of our employees  We made significant improvements in this area in 2019 as well  with an approximately 40  reduction in our OSHA rate at Gulf Power versus 2018  As the major capital investments that we advanced during 2019 come into service in 2020 and beyond  they will help achieve the other key objectives that we have outlined at Gulf Power such as meaningful emissions reductions and  perhaps most importantly  a significant reduction in customer bills in real terms 
In addition to creating tremendous customer value  we expect that execution of the plans we laid out at Gulf Power will also generate great outcomes for our shareholders as well  In our first year of ownership  Gulf Power s adjusted earnings increased by 25  year over year  This outcome was even better than our plan at the start of the year and positions us well to deliver on the financial growth objectives that we outlined when we announced the acquisition  This high level performance across the board would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of all Gulf Power employees  While we are pleased with the results that we ve achieved at Gulf Power during 2019  we remain focused on the significant execution ahead of us here to deliver even greater value to our customers and our shareholders 
Finally  we were once again honored to be named for the 13th time in 14 years Number 1 in the electric and gas utilities industry on Fortune s list of Most Admired Companies  as well as ranked among the Top 10 companies worldwide across all industries for social responsibility 
During 2019 alone  NextEra Energy made approximately  13 billion in capital investments in American energy infrastructure  making us one of the top capital investors in the U S  in any industry  None of these recognitions nor our track record of success would be possible without the hard work and commitment to excellence of our people  who live our core value of doing the right thing every day  In the last year  there has been an increasing focus on the ESG on the part of many of our stakeholders  The fact is  our Company has been focused on all of the elements of ESG for more than 25 years  We are proud of our track record here  but there is still so much more to do in this country to decarbonize the electric transportation in industrial sectors 
NextEra Energy is living proof that you can be clean and low cost and financially successful all at the same time  We will be at the vanguard of building a sustainable energy era  that is both clean and affordable  and we are driving very hard to continue to be at the forefront of the disruption that is occurring within the energy sector  We expect that the execution of our strategy will drive meaningful CO2 emissions reductions across the country  while simultaneously lowering generation cost for customers  And our continued investments in clean energy will help advance NextEra Energy toward its goal of reducing its CO2 emissions rate by 67  by 2025 from a 2005 baseline 
In summary  I continue to remain as enthusiastic as ever about NextEra Energy s long term growth prospects  In 2019  we extended our long term track record of executing for the benefit of customers and shareholders and further developed our best in class organic growth prospects  Based on the strength and diversity of our underlying businesses  I will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in 2020  2021  and 2022  while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings  We remain intensely focused on execution and continuing to drive shareholder value over the coming years 
Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners  which also had a terrific year of execution in 2019  In the more than five years since the IPO  NextEra Energy Partners has consistently delivered on its commitments  That execute    that history of execution is supported by NextEra Energy Partners  outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets  which grew significantly and was further diversified in 2019  During the year  NextEra Energy Partners  acquired a portfolio of more than 600 megawatts of wind and solar assets from Energy Resources  Additionally  during the fourth quarter  NextEra Energy Partners closed down the acquisition of Meade Pipeline Company  which owns an approximately 40  aggregate interest in Central Penn Line  an intrastate natural gas pipeline in Pennsylvania that is backed by a minimum 14 year contract with a high credit quality customer and no volumetric risk 
Finally  during the year  NextEra Energy Partners advanced an additional organic growth opportunity  announcing the repowering of 275 megawatts of wind projects  We are proud that 2019 is the first year that NextEra Energy Partners successfully executed on all of the three ways it can grow  Organically acquiring assets from third parties and acquiring assets from Energy Resources portfolio  highlighting the clear flexibility and visibility into growth going forward  To support the ongoing growth investments and optimize the capital structure for the benefit of LP unitholders  NextEra Energy Partners completed a number of financings and refinancings in 2019 as well 
At the start of the year  NextEra Energy Partners faced headwinds related to the PG E bankruptcy  The team immediately focused on managing and mitigating the negative impacts of this event  and we ended 2019 having favorably addressed many of the challenges  The Energy Resources portfolio acquisition and associated financing that we announced last March allowed NextEra Energy Partners to complete its original 2019 growth objectives  even after excluding PG E related project cash flows 
During the year  NextEra Energy Partners also purchased all of the outstanding holding company and operating company notes at our Genesis Project  In addition to resulting in an increase in run rate cash available for distribution through the removal of project level debt service as a result of the purchase of the debt  NextEra Energy Partners received approximately  128 million of distributions that had been or were expected to be restricted at the project  The release of this cash was used to partially fund the debt repurchase  I remain confident about a long term favorable resolution for our PG E related assets 
In addition to growing LP distributions by 15  year over year and achieving a run rate adjusted EBITDA range in excess of what was originally expected  NextEra Energy Partners year end 2019 run rate cash available for distribution expectations  assuming full contributions from PG E related projects  represents approximately 60  growth from the comparable year end 2018 run rate range  With this strong year over year growth in cash available for distribution  NextEra Energy Partners expects to be able to achieve its long term distribution growth expectations without the need for additional asset acquisitions until 2021  As of year end 2020  we expect to have achieved NextEra Energy Partners  distribution growth objectives  while maintaining a trailing 12 month payout ratio in the mid 70s range  even after excluding cash distributions from our Desert Sunlight projects 
NEP delivered an attractive total unitholder return of approximately 28  in 2019  further advancing its history of value creation since the IPO  I continue to believe that the combination of NEP s clean energy portfolio  growth visibility and flexibility to finance that growth offer LP unitholders an attractive investor value proposition  As with NextEra Energy  we remain focused on continuing to execute and delivering that unitholder value over the coming years 
I ll now turn the call over to Rebecca  who will review the 2019 results in more detail 
Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you  Jim  and good morning everyone  Let s now turn to the detailed results  beginning with FPL  For the fourth quarter of 2019  FPL reported net income of  400 million or  0 81 per share  down  0 04 per share year over year  For the full year 2019  FPL reported net income of  2 33 billion or  4 81 per share  an increase of  0 26 per share versus 2018  Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 8 3  for 2019 and was the principal driver of FPL s net income growth of roughly 8  for the full year 
During the fourth quarter  growth from new investments was offset by a number of factors  including a contribution to our charitable foundation that should fund its operations for the next several years  FPL s capital expenditures were approximately  2 billion in the fourth quarter  bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly  5 8 billion  FPL s reported ROE for regulatory purposes was 11 6  for the 12 months ending December 31  2019  which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9 6  to 11 6  under our current rate agreement 
During the fourth quarter  we utilized a total of  18 million of reserve amortization  including the approximately  260 million that was utilized to offset Hurricane Dorian storm restoration costs  leaving FPL with a year end 2019 balance of  893 million  We continue to expect that FPL will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of reserve amortization to operate under the current base rate settlement agreement for one additional year  and as a result  expect to file a base rate case in the first quarter of 2021 for new rates that are effective in January of 2022  While we have not made a final decision  based on our review  we expect that the merging of FPL and Gulf Power and making a single rate case filing will result in customer benefits  and we therefore see this as a likely approach for the filing at this time 
All of our major capital projects at FPL are progressing well  The 10 solar sites  totaling nearly 750 megawatts of combined capacity that are currently being built across FPL s service territory  are all on track and on budget to begin providing cost effective energy to FPL customers in early 2020  To support the significant solar expansion that FPL is leading across Florida  we have secured sites that could support 10 gigawatts of future projects 
Earlier this month  Florida Public Service Commission held hearings on FPL s proposed Solar Together program  We continue to expect a decision about the proposed program at the end of the first quarter  Beyond solar  construction on the highly efficient roughly 1 200 megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and on budget  as it continues to advance toward its projected commercial operations date in 2022  We continue to expect that FPL s ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate of regulatory capital employed of approximately 9  from 2018 through 2022  while further enhancing our best in class customer value proposition 
Let me now turn to Gulf Power  which reported fourth quarter 2019 GAAP and adjusted earnings of  23 million and  26 million respectively or  0 05 per share  For the full year  Gulf Power reported GAAP earnings of  180 million or  0 37 per share and adjusted earnings of  200 million or  0 41 per share  As a reminder  during the first 12 months following the closing of the acquisition  we excluded one time acquisition integration costs from adjusted earnings  Additionally  interest expense to finance the acquisition is reflected in Corporate and Other  Gulf Power s reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 10 8  for the 12 months ending December 2019  which is in the upper half of the allowed band of 9 25  to 11 25  under its current rate agreement  For the full year 2020  we expect to target a regulatory ROE near the upper end of its allowed band  assuming normal weather and operating conditions 
As Jim discussed  the overall execution of Gulf Power s capital program is advancing well  Gulf Power s first solar development project  the roughly 75 megawatt Blue Indigo Solar Energy Center is expected to go into service later this quarter and generate significant customer savings over its lifetime  All of the other major capital investments  including the North Florida Resiliency Connection and the Plant Crist coal to natural gas conversion continue to remain on track 
The Florida economy remains healthy as Florida s population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the nation  According to recent IRS data  Florida attracted a net gain of roughly  16 billion in personal taxable income in 2018  by far the highest of any state in the country and the fastest rate of growth as well  which is a reflection of the attraction of Florida s low tax pro business policies  Florida s most recent seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 3 1   below the national average  and at the lowest level in the decade  Florida has now added nearly 2 million private sector jobs over the last 10 years  Leading indicators in the real estate sector have remained at a stable pace  reflecting continued strength of the Florida housing market  Other positive economic data across the state include continued strength in retail taxable sales as well as the consumer confidence index  which remains near 10 year highs 
During the quarter  FPL s average number of customers increased by approximately 100 000 from the comparable prior year quarter  driven by continued solid underlying growth and the addition of Vero Beach s roughly 35 000 customers late last year  For 2019  FPL s retail sales increased 1 7  from the prior year  driven primarily by a favorable weather comparison  On a weather normalized basis  FPL s retail sales declined by 0 6   as customer growth was more than offset by a reduction in underlying usage per customer  The decline in underlying usage was a reversal from the trend that FPL experienced in 2018  when underlying usage increased by 1 7   As we previously noted  usage per customer tends to exhibit significant volatility  which can be more pronounced during periods of particularly strong weather conditions  similar to those experienced during 2019  which makes distinguishing between underlying usage changes and weather impacts challenging 
For Gulf Power  the average number of customers increased slightly versus the comparable prior year quarter  as it moves beyond the impacts of Hurricane Michael in 2018  For 2019  Gulf Power s retail sales declined slightly  due to unfavorable weather and a small decline in underlying usage per customer 
Let me now turn to Energy Resources  beginning with a reporting change in our segments  Given the Trans Bay Cable acquisition during 2019  we have reevaluated our operating segments and made a change to reflect the overall scale of our competitive transmission business and the management of these projects within our Company  Our reporting for Energy Resources now includes the results of our NextEra Energy Transmission projects formerly reported in Corporate and Other segment  Our 2018 results have been adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes  resulting in increase in Energy Resources full year 2018 adjusted EPS of  0 09 per share 
Incorporating the reporting change  Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of  433 million or  0 88 per share  Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were  326 million or  0 66 per share  Energy Resources  contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter decreased  0 01 versus the prior year comparable period  as strong underlying growth from new and existing investments was more than offset by a number of    number of items  including the negative  0 14 adjusted EPS impact of our refinancing activities  which were primarily related to financing breakage costs associated with several wind repowerings as well as Energy Resources  share of cost associated with the acquisition of the outstanding Genesis debt  As a reminder  while these financing    refinancing activities created a reduction in fourth quarter adjusted earnings  they are expected to translate to favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders 
For the full year  Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of  1 81 billion or  3 72 per share and adjusted earnings of  1 7 billion or  3 49 per share  Energy Resources full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased  0 35 or approximately 11  versus 2018  For the full year  growth was driven by continued additions to our renewables portfolio  as contributions from new investments increased by  0 55 per share  Contributions from our gas infrastructure business  including existing pipelines  increased by  0 13 versus the prior year  Also contributing favorably were the customer supply and trading business  where our contributions increased by  0 05 versus 2018  and NextEra Energy Transmission  which increased results  0 04 year over year  primarily as a result of the Trans Bay Cable acquisition that closed in the middle of 2019  These favorable results were partially offset by higher interest expense  reflecting the negative  0 14 adjusted EPS impact in the fourth quarter refinancing activities  as well as growth in the business and lower contributions from the existing generation assets  In 2019  wind resource was 96  of the long term average  down from 97  a year earlier  Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide 
In 2019  Energy Resources continued to advance its position as the leading developer and operator of wind  solar  and battery storage projects  commissioning approximately 2 700 megawatts of renewables projects in the US  including repowering  Since the call    we    since the last call  we have added 1 609 megawatts renewables projects to our backlog  including approximately 500 megawatts of combined new wind and repowering 700 megawatts of solar and 340 megawatts of battery storage  all of which will be paired with new solar projects  Energy Resources has now placed a total of approximately 3 700 megawatts of repowering projects in service since 2017  which represents approximately one third of its operating wind portfolio as of year end 2016  We expect that by the end of 2020  more than 60  of Energy Resources operating wind projects will have been originally commissioned or repowered within the last five years  highlighting the young age of the overall fleet and the expected long date future value creation of the portfolio 
Following the terrific origination year in 2019 and with nearly three years remaining in the period  we are now within the 2019 to 2022 renewables development ranges that we introduced in the middle of last year  For the post 2022 period  our backlog is already more than 2 400 megawatts  placing us far ahead of our historical origination activity at this early stage  The accompanying slide provides additional detail on where our renewables development program now stands 
Beyond renewables  as of year end 2019  the Mountain Valley Pipeline was approximately 90  complete  We have been working with our project partners to resolve all of the outstanding permit issues for the pipeline and we continue to make good progress on these efforts  We expect that the issues related to MVP s biological opinion and Nationwide 12 Permit will be resolved in the spring  allowing construction work along much of the route to resume  We also remain hopeful that the Supreme Court will overturn the Fourth Circuit Court s original decision on Atlantic Coast Pipeline s case related to its Appalachian Trail crossing authorization  resolving similar challenges for MVP  We continue to target a full in service date for the pipeline during 2020 and an overall project cost estimate of approximately  5 4 billion 
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy  For the fourth quarter of 2019  GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was  975 million or  1 99 per share  NextEra Energy s fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were  706 million or  1 44 per share  respectively  For the full year 2019  GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was  3 77 billion or  7 76 per share  Adjusted earnings were  4 06 billion or  8 37 per share 
For the Corporate and Other segment  adjusted earnings for the full year decreased  0 35 per share compared to the 2018 prior comparable period  primarily as a result of higher interest expense related to the Gulf Power acquisition financing  NextEra Energy also delivered strong operating cash flow growth  which increased at a faster rate than the adjusted EPS growth rate 
As expected  during 2019  we also maintained our strong credit position  Based on the S P methodology  we estimate that we ended the year at a 22 5  FFO to debt level versus our current downgrade threshold of 21   For Moody s  we expect 2019 CFO pre working capital to debt was 19 6  versus our current downgrade threshold of 18   NextEra Energy s cushion versus our credit metrics reflects the continued strength of our balance sheet and supports the record roughly  14 billion of capital investments that we expect to make in 2020 
The financial expectations that we extended last year through 2022 remain unchanged  We continue to expect that NextEra Energy s adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6  to 8  through 2021 off of the 2018 adjusted EPS of  7 70  plus the accretion of  0 15 and  0 20 in 2020 and 2021 respectively from the Florida acquisitions  For 2020  we continue to expect our adjusted EPS to be in the range of  8 70 to  9 20  And as Jim highlighted  we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of this range  This year  we do expect that our adjusted EPS growth will be more weighted toward the second half of the year 
For 2022  we expect to grow adjusted EPS in the range of 6  to 8  off 2021 adjusted EPS  translating to a range of  10 00 to  10 75 per share  From 2018 to 2022  we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range  As always  all of our expectations are subject to the usual caveats  including but not limited to  normal weather and operating conditions 
Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners  which also had a strong year of operational and financial performance in 2019  Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was  280 million and cash available for distribution was  101 million  an increase of 70  and 130  respectively  This strong growth was driven primarily by the significant year over year growth in NextEra Energy Partners portfolio  including the 2019 acquisitions of the Energy Resources assets and the Meade Pipeline Company  as well as the full quarter s contribution from the portfolio of projects that were acquired in late 2018 
For the full year 2019  adjusted EBITDA was  1 1 billion  up 25  year over year  Cash available for distribution  excluding all contributions from our Desert Sunlight projects  was  366 million  an increase of 8  from the prior year  Including full contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects  NextEra Energy Partners achieve CAFD growth of 20  versus 2018  Similar to the quarterly results  full year growth in both adjusted EBITDA and CAFD was primarily driven by portfolio growth  The benefit from new projects was partially offset by the divestiture of Canadian assets during 2018 
Cash available for distribution was also reduced by higher corporate level interest expense  As a reminder  these results include the impact of IDR fees  which we treat as an operating expense  Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide  Yesterday  the NextEra Energy Partners  Board declared a quarterly distribution of  0 535 per common unit or  2 14 per unit on an annualized basis  up 15  from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2019 
As Jim mentioned  during 2019  NextEra Energy Partners executed several financing for the benefit of LP unitholders  In addition to raising approximately  1 2 billion of unsecured holding company notes  which priced at some of the lowest spreads ever in the sector  NextEra Energy Partners also raised  1 4 billion of low cost project finance debt and executed  1 3 billion revolver extension  NextEra Energy Partners also raised  1 8 billion through three convertible equity portfolio financings  With low initial coupons  the convertible equity portfolio financings provide more cash to LP unitholders  allowing NextEra Energy Partners to acquire fewer assets to achieve the same level of future distribution growth  which will also as a result lower future financing needs  In addition to reduced future asset and equity needs  these financings provide NextEra Partners the flexibility to convert into common units at no discount over a long period of time  This should be accretive to LP unitholders who retain all of the unit price upside as NextEra Energy Partners executes on its expected distribution growth objectives  These attributes  combined with the significant flexibility that NextEra Partners retains those financings  including the timing of conversion  option to convert at any price  option to pay the buyout in cash rather than units  and the option to deploy the buyout amount into other assets  should generate significant value to LP unitholders  while also providing significant downside protection 
Finally  last quarter  following the achievement of certain NextEra Energy Partners unit trading thresholds  we converted the second tranche of the convertible preferred securities that we issued in 2017 into additionally    an additional roughly 4 7 million NextEra Energy Partners  common units  further supporting our ongoing goal of using low cost financing products to layer in equity over time  The NextEra Energy Partners portfolio at year end 2019 supports the revised adjusted EBITDA and CAFD December 31  2019 run rate expectations that we announced at the time of the Meade acquisition  Since NextEra Energy Partners long term distribution growth expectations are supported without the need of additional asset acquisitions until 2021  The December 31  2020 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and CAFD remain unchanged at the same levels as the year end 2019 run rate expectations  Including full contributions from the PG E related projects  year end 2020 run rate cash available for distribution is expected to be in a range of  560 million to  640 million  reflecting calendar year 2021 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2020 and assuming normal weather and operating conditions 
Excluding all contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects  NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect a year end 2020 run rate for CAFD in the range of  505 million to  585 million  Year end 2020 run rate adjusted EBITDA expectations  which assume full contributions from PG E related projects as revenue is expected to continue to be recognized  are  1 225 billion to  1 4 billion 
As a reminder  all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense  From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2019 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of  2 14  we continue to see 12  to 15  growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024  We expect that the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2020 distribution that is payable in February of 2021 to be in the range of  2 40 to  2 46 per common unit 
In summary  we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have excellent prospects for growth  FPL  Gulf Power  Energy Resources  and NextEra Energy Partners each have an outstanding set of opportunities across the board  The progress we made in 2019 reinforces our long term growth prospects  And while we have a lot to execute on in 2020  we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year 
That concludes our prepared remarks  and with that  we ll open up the line for questions 
Questions and Answers 
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen  at this time  we ll begin the question and answer session   Operator Instructions  Our first question today comes from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI  Please go ahead with your question 
Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    Analyst
Thanks  Congratulations on another very  very consistent year performance 
Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks  Greg  Good morning 
Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    Analyst
Couple of questions for you  Based on my back of the envelope math  it doesn t look like you earned at the maximum allowable ROE at Florida Power   Light this year  Can you tell us what    where you landed on a return on equity basis for fiscal year  19 
Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  Greg  from a reported regulatory ROE standpoint  so what ultimately goes to the Florida Public Service Commission  we did earn the 11 6  ROE as allowed under our settlement agreement  You are right  we did have some below the line expenses  which is typical  but those below the line expenses are excluded from that regulatory ROE calculation 
Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    Analyst
Got you  Understood  And then when you    you point out in your slide deck that the majority of your    the majority of your PTCs are now being allocated through tax equity  There is a very clear slide in the appendix on that  That means that we should be looking at NCI on the balance sheet flowing through the income statement as the way that that s flowing through earnings now  Is that correct 
Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  that s correct 
Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    Analyst
Okay  And the average amortization of a tax equity deal for a wind project is what approximately 10 years  is that    is that right 
Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  The earnings recognition is roughly coincident with the 10 year PTC range that are for all of our wind projects that are in PTCs 
Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    Analyst
Right  And for solar deal  that would be slightly faster 
Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  It s typically relates to the recognition of the ITC period  So  for many tax equity structures  that s over five years  Certain tax equity partners prefer a seven year structure  And so  then it would be over seven years as opposed to five

Right  And as you guys gear up for preparing for rate case in 2021  are there any milestones this year or will the majority of the activity be happening in early  21 
Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial Officer
As you certainly appreciate there is a ton of milestones that are largely internal for our teams as they get ready for any rate proceeding and many of those preparation efforts started well before this year and are ongoing and we have the incremental work this year of doing all the analysis of thinking about bringing FPL and Gulf together  But as I highlighted in the prepared remarks  based on what we know today  our expectation is that we would file a rate case in early  21 for the new rates effective in 2022  and you know the first start of that would be the filing of the test year letter  which we would expect to file in early  21 
Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    Analyst
Great  My last question is the battery storage backlog is obviously continuing to ramp  are you buying battery storage sort of from    are you buying the product from another vendor or are you buying the components from different OEMs and building your own bespoke battery storage product  In other words  are you using a vendor like Fluence or one of the other sort of total product companies or are you sourcing components and building your own battery units 
Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial Officer
It s much more of the latter  Greg  We see tremendous amount of value and are being able to have some nimbleness in where we procure the battery packs  But then we also are procuring separately as you suggested the things like the containers and the other equipment that you would ultimately use to assemble the battery facility and then also we re designing our own management systems  We ultimately believe that some of the real value add that we re going to be able to add to customers that will likely differentiate us from others is that battery system management  because we ve talked about with you guys and with others over time that there is probably not one value stream that creates the value for batteries  it s usually a couple of different applications within the same system and that management system and optimizing that is going to be part of the secret sauce of batteries 
So we ve invested a lot of time and energy and thinking through that not only on the Energy Resources deployments  but also for the deployments that we ve had at FPL  and we ve learned a tremendous amount and we re really excited as we highlighted in the prepared remarks about batteries as a terrific supplement to further renewables deployment  certainly in the middle part of the next decade and thereafter as renewables become a significant component of the generation stack in the U S  power markets

Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research  Please go ahead with your question 
Steve Fleishman    Wolfe Research    Analyst
Yeah  Hi  good morning  Just a question first  if you could update us on the Santee Cooper situation and your interest there  And then secondly  with JEA now gone and stock obviously doing very well  just kind of overall thought process on M A strategy and opportunities right now  Thanks 
James L  Robo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
So Steve  this is Jim  I ll take that  Obviously  we re pretty limited in what we can say about the Santee Cooper situation other than what I ve said previously  which is we remain very interested in Santee Cooper and we think South Carolina is a terrific place to do business and that s probably all I can say about that 
On the JEA front  I would say we re disappointed that the sale process has been terminated  We think we could have brought enormous value to the customers of    and the citizens of Jacksonville and we think it s unfortunate that it s been terminated  but it is    that is what it is  And in terms of terms of future M A activity  I will repeat what I ve been pretty consistent in terms of what our strategy is on that front  which is we    in terms of what we like  we have been very focused  First of all  I don t think there is a utility in the country that wouldn t benefit from the application of our playbook  That said  we have been focused on opportunities in the Southeast  in the Midwest  as well as FERC regulated opportunities  Those are the  from a regulatory standpoint and other opportunities  what we think are the best fit for us and that remains our focus  And we continue to be very interested in trying to do something 
That said  M A is always hard and there are a lot of hurdles to get over and we will as always be extraordinarily financially disciplined  You will never see us announce a deal that we say is strategic and has no accretion  So anything that we do  will have significant accretion associated with it  So I think it s probably the sum total what I could say on that 
Steve Fleishman    Wolfe Research    Analyst
Okay  One quick technical question  just    is there a quick and easy way you can quantify the balance sheet capacity available for these FFO to debt and metrics at Moody s and S P in terms of dollars 
Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  we re probably not going to quantify it exactly  Steve  As you ve heard us say quite a number of times over the years  a strong balance sheet is incredibly important to us  We clearly have some room from our downgrade threshold  which is certainly terrific  and it s important to us as we think about how do we make sure that we re prepared for making investments that we want to make in the future  including especially this year  Setting aside the comments that just    Jim just made on M A  just for our organic growth prospects alone  we have  14 billion of planned capital investment in our business and having a strong balance sheet as we start to make those investments is incredibly important

Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin Smith from Bank of America  Please go with your question 
Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America    Analyst
Hey  good morning  Can you hear me 
Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Good morning  We can hear you just fine 
Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America    Analyst
Excellent  So  thanks again for all the commentary  So perhaps kicking it off on the repowering front  would just be curious on your thoughts on the 24  Phonetic  opportunity now given the PTC extension  How does that shift your thinking and logic around incremental repower  And I know you provided already some fairly detailed remarks on repowering already  but I want to dig in on that specific opportunity  especially given that that s a year already after the timeline for the solar ITC here  if you can elaborate 
Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Sure  of course  As we highlighted in our development expectations that we laid out this summer for the 2019 through 2022 time frame  you ll note that the repowering opportunities that we saw were heavily and at that time exclusively in the 2019 to 2020 time frame  We ve continued to work on opportunities to repower our assets at both in 80  PTC and a 60  PTC  So  first  we ll focus on the 80  before we even think about the extensions of the    if anything that s possible in 60  
But remember  there s always a trade off in making these investment opportunities  Part of the economic value of that is getting the new set of PTCs and so there is a balance of the cost of the investment that you need to make in that equipment and also ensuring that you can meet the IRS test of the 80 20 valuation and as the PTC value goes down  it gets a little bit harder to justify those    in both of those requirements 
So again  we thought it was a terrific program to create a huge amount of shareholder value  really highlights the option value embedded in our portfolio and we ll continue to be creative and work toward creating more opportunities like that where things that are analogous to it in the future 
Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America    Analyst
Got it  Excellent  And just clarifying the last question a little bit  You mentioned FERC regulated opportunities  Jim  Can you elaborate a little bit further on thought process there  Obviously  this transmission ROE question has been kind of lingering across the sectors  Just want to make sure we heard you right  just how you re thinking about various FERC asset classes 
James L  Robo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  So obviously  we did the Trans Bay acquisition that s not in the Midwest or the Southeast  And we do on a long term basis  like FERC regulated assets  notwithstanding the recent ROE decision on the MISO transmission owners  Listen  I think there has been    obviously  that s an open docket at FERC right now  I probably can t comment on what I think the outcomes are going to be there  but other than to say  I do believe FERC regulation will be constructive in the long term and we think in the long term  it s a good place for us to deploy capital 
Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America    Analyst
And maybe Jim  if I can one more quickly on ESG  as you think about establishing targets and becoming a perhaps more prescriptive and being a leader on this front  how do you think about being more specific on carbon  I know this come up a little bit  but I m curious on thought process there  I know it s also a complicated too 
James L  Robo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Sure  You know  I think we have been  I think  pretty specific about what our 2025 goal is  which is    remember there    all of these discussions are about percent reductions  We started at an enormously lower level than the rest of the industry on just base CO2 emissions per megawatt hour generated  right  And so  any of the goals that we lay out  which    our goal is a 67  reduction off our 2005 base by 2025  I think if you went back and you looked at the 2005 average    U S  average that    and compare to our NextEra rate in 2025 to that 2005 average  I m going to give you a number and everyone is going to go check me on it  It s going to be    that would be an 85  or 90  reduction relative to the 2005 U S  average CO2 emissions rate 
So  we have a    we re going to significantly decarbonize our Company and our emissions  And I m really excited about the goals we set  I think they re very doable  And what I m most excited about is the role that we can play both in Florida and in the rest of the country in terms of leading the way to decarbonize not just the electric    not just the electric sector  but the transportation sector  So we have    there s lots more to do  As I said in my prepared remarks  I think the country has a lot more to do and the great news for the country and the economy is  you can be clean and low cost at the same time and whatever we do will be for the benefit of customers and it would drive    it will drive good economics  better GDP growth for the country  lower costs  and obviously a better environmental profile

Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners  Please go ahead with your question 
Shahriar Pourreza    Guggenheim Partners    Analyst
Hey  good morning guys 
James L  Robo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning 
Shahriar Pourreza    Guggenheim Partners    Analyst
Good morning  So just on near backlog  it s obviously very strong again  So I m just trying to get a sense  Rebecca  on sort of how much of that backlog increase mainly on the wind side was attributed to a pull forward of projects with the modest PTC extension versus a    versus like actual incremental opportunities you re seeing  as we think about modeling forward 
Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  I don t think it s very much  I think it s early    obviously  the PTC extension happened very  very late in 2019  So I don t think we ve seen any impacts from it whatsoever  coupled with the fact that it s quite a number of years down the road and it doesn t affect the profile of the PTC in the next three years  which is really what was driving a lot of our customers  actions 
In terms of the overall demand and how that s reflected  as we ve said in the past  we saw 2020 was going to be a significant development year  clearly it is for wind and that 2021 is more likely than not to be roughly comparable with where we were in 2019  And we continue to see really strong interest from our customers about wind in the long term  as they should be  As Jim highlighted the cost of wind and solar projects out in the mid 2020s  assuming there are not any meaningful extensions of the incentives  which is an assumption at this point that should be checked  but assuming those incentives are not extended  a very competitive versus existing coal  nuclear plants and some less efficient gas fired plants  So economic should continue to drive decisions for our customers for many  many years to come 
Shahriar Pourreza    Guggenheim Partners    Analyst
Got it  And then just lastly  thanks for the incremental disclosures around Gulf  Is there anything you can like maybe provide directionally on sort of the base assumptions you re assuming in  22 as we re thinking about your EPS guidance  i e   may be from a regulatory construct or even addition to spending opportunities like the extension of SoBRA  Is there anything you can provide directionally on how you re thinking about this 
Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Not much beyond what we ve already talked about in terms of everything that s built into our expectations for 2020 through 2022  And as you recall from the investor conference materials  we did lay out a lot of the detail for both businesses through 2021 and of course more detail for Energy Resources out in  22  But the fundamentals are very consistent with what we ve been doing for a long time on the regulated businesses  again focusing on good capital investment that adds value for our customers and taking cost out of the business to ensure that we have very thoughtful views on customer bills and in the case of Gulf Power targeting a meaningful decline in the bills out to the mid 2020s  So  keep doing what we re doing  and we couldn t be more excited about the growth opportunities for all of the businesses that lay out in front of us 
Shahriar Pourreza    Guggenheim Partners    Analyst
Got it  So stay tuned around the cap structure and the reserve amortization  now you re thinking about chewing up between the two utilities

Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse  Please go ahead with your question 
Maheep Mandloi    Credit Suisse    Analyst
Hi  this is Maheep here on behalf of Mike  Thanks for taking the questions  Just touching on the battery growth you re talking about  can you talk about these reductions you re seeing on the battery systems for the projects in the pipe  And would it be possible to quantify the scale of opportunity for retrofits on existing sites either at near or at NEP 
Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial Officer
In terms of battery costs  we ve laid out some of our thoughts and expectations  I think most recently in our EEI investor presentation  We haven t broken that out between    broken out a lot of the detail between battery pack and rest of the balance of system costs  But everything that we ve laid out in terms of where we ve seen the market declines coming from in aggregate has really started to materialize  and whereas two years ago we were surprised at how much faster costs were coming down  we ve gotten more aggressive with our assumptions and now they re roughly consistent with what we were thinking 
We continue to be very optimistic longer term about batteries and is    the whole industry has talked about  It s really not about the power sector  it s being driven much more by the electric vehicle sector and those drivers appear to be pretty clear for quite a number of years down the road  which is really driving the manufacturing efficiencies and scale that we re seeing on the battery pack side  So really excited and optimistic about where that business is headed 
Maheep Mandloi    Credit Suisse    Analyst
Got it  And could you just touch upon the retrofit opportunity for either NEER or NEP for batteries  And would it be possible to get the tax credits on adding storage to an existing solar project 
Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  It could obviously be a significant opportunity  coincident with the significant deployment of renewables  particularly where the penetration is high  adding batteries to existing solar sites could be very advantageous to the extent that they ve elected the ITC and ultimately our charge    are being used to charge the battery system  yes  they would qualify for ITCs as long as we meet certain conditions  So it s a terrific opportunity for the team  but it s really consistent with what we ve been thinking about for the overall market opportunity and what we ve been highlighting for quite some time now to investors 
Maheep Mandloi    Credit Suisse    Analyst
Got it  And just one last question from me  If you could talk about the impact on interest rates on NEP s ability to execute the convertible refinancings  Thank you 
Rebecca J  Kujawa    Executive Vice President  Finance and Chief Financial Officer
It s been terrific  Low interest rate environment is obviously terrific for both of our businesses  We love low cost of capital to be able to deploy these solutions as economically as possible for both our customers on the energy resources side as well as our regulated utilities and of course also for NextEra Energy Partners  So  it s been terrific

138528,360043,NEE,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Fomento Economico Mexicano  Southern Company  DISH Network  NextEra Energy And Charles Schwab,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 30  2020   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Fomento Economico Mexicano   NYSE FMX    Southern Company   NYSE SO    DISH Network   NASDAQ DISH    NextEra Energy   NYSE NEE   and Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  Top Research Reports for Fomento Economico  Southern Company and DISHThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Fomento Economico Mexicano  FMX   Southern Company  SO  and DISH Network  DISH   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Fomento Economico s shares have underperformed the Zacks Soft Drinks Beverages industry over the past year   2 6  vs   16 3    The Zacks analyst believes that the company s growth via acquisition strategy is reaping benefits  Its sound fundamentals and growth efforts position it for growth ahead The recent acquisition of minority stake in Jetro Restaurant Depot  AGV and 40  stake in Grupo Socofar  as well as joint venture with Ra zen reveal its commitment to invest in the expansion of core businesses  Furthermore  its third quarter 2019 results reflect significant strength across all businesses However  the company witnessed soft operating results across some divisions in the past few quarters  Operating margins at FEMSA Comercio s Health and Proximity Divisions in third quarter 2019 were hurt by operating expense deleverage in these units  Tariff related and higher input costs are headwinds hurting its bottling unit  Shares of Southern Company have gained  26 7  in the past six months against the Zacks Electric Power industry s rise of  14 8   The Zacks analyst believes that leveraging the demographics of its operating territories  as in healthy population and job growth  the firm has gradually increased its customer base With good rate base growth and constructive regulation  Southern Company is expected to generate steady earnings and dividend growth in the coming years  However  elevated leverage of the firm  along with continued timing and cost overrun issues over its Vogtle project  are major overhangs While the electric utility holding company s debt to capital ratio of 57  restricts financial flexibility  its  25 billion Vogtle nuclear plant has already exceeded budget and is years behind schedule  As such  Southern Company warrants a cautious stance from the investors DISH s shares have gained  6 9  over the past three months against the Zacks Cable Television industry s rise of  1 7   The Zacks analyst believes that DISH s efforts to diversify its business from being a pure play satellite TV operator to an Internet TV operator are noteworthy The Sling TV subscriber base is also expanding  The company recently raised Sling TV prices and also introduced channels  Further  its focus on acquiring and retaining subscribers  who will be profitable over the long term  is expected to drive growth Additionally  DISH is set to enter the U S  wireless market as the fourth  nationwide  facilities based network competitor by acquiring Sprint s prepaid businesses and customers  and 14 MHz of nationwide 800 MHz spectrum  This is expected to drive DISH s top line over the long haul Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include NextEra Energy

138530,360045,NEE,Expand Your Portfolio With This First Profit Stock Screener,opinion,"We are in the midst of the fourth quarter earnings season  This makes it a great time to use our  First Profit  stock screener  The idea is to search for companies that recently reported their first quarterly profit   
More specifically  the screen searches for firms that just posted their first profit last quarter  after not posting a profit for at least the previous four quarters  Finding companies that recently reported their first profits help investors find stocks that can prove to be big winners 
These companies may vary widely  Some of the firms might be new  and this recent profit is perhaps the only profit in its short history 
Meanwhile  other companies might have held an impressive and long history of quarterly profitability  but for whatever reason haven t seen a profit in a while  Therefore  the return to profit could spark a turning point that management had promised or Wall Street had been clamoring for 
The concept is relatively simple  if the trend has been one of improvement  there is a solid chance the trend will continue  This is true whether a company has been profitable  or is just reaching that key inflection point 
And that s what we are screening for today 
  EPS for the previous 4 Quarters less than or equal to 0
 This means in each of the previous 4 quarters  except the most recently reported quarter  the company has reported earnings of less than or equal to zero  i e   no profit  
  EPS for the recently reported quarter greater than 0
 This time  the company reported earnings greater than zero  meaning they finally showed a profit  
  Current Price greater than or equal to 5
 Stocks that are trading for less than  5 are more speculative  
The screen is pretty simple  yet powerful  Here are 5 of the 30 plus stocks that made it through this week s screen

138563,360078,NEE,Morgan Stanley Says These Firms Will Profit From Climate Change,news," Bloomberg     The world needs to spend  50 trillion on five areas of technology by 2050 to slash emissions and meet the Paris Agreement s goal of curbing global warming   Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  analysts wrote in a report 
To reduce net emissions of carbon to zero  the world would have to eradicate the equivalent of 53 5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide a year  according to the report  which identified renewable energy  electric vehicles  hydrogen  carbon capture and storage  and biofuels as the key technologies that could help meet the target 
Carbon emissions from fossil fuels hit a record last year  but estimates vary of how much it would cost to meet the Paris target of keeping the global temperature rise to within 2 degrees  The International Renewable Energy Agency says  750 billion a year is needed in renewables over a decade  United Nations scientists say  300 billion spent on reclaiming degraded land could offset emissions to buy time to deploy zero carbon technologies 
Here are Morgan Stanley s estimates for the five key technology areas and some of the 33 companies it says are set to benefit 
Renewables
Renewable power generation will require  14 trillion by 2050  including investments in energy storage Renewables would need to deliver about 80  of global power by then  up from 37  today  meaning an additional 11 000 gigawatts of capacity  excluding hydro power Solar energy s rapidly falling cost will make it the fastest growing renewable technology over the coming decade with a 13  compound annual growth rate Stocks that could benefit include  CGN New Energy Holdings Co   China Resources Power Holdings Co  and China Suntien Green Energy Co    NextEra Energy Inc   NYSE NEE  Electric vehicles
With passenger cars currently pumping out about 7  of greenhouse gas emissions  some  11 trillion will be needed to build factories  expand power capacity and develop the batteries and infrastructure needed to switch to electric vehicles With increased investment  annual EV sales could grow from 1 3 million units in 2018 to 23 2 million in 2030  lifting the total number of electric vehicles to 113 million by 2030 and 924 million by 2050 Some of the companies to watch  Beijing Easpring Material Technology Co   Rohm Co   Daimler and Panasonic Corp Carbon capture and storage
Almost  2 5 trillion would be needed for technologies that capture carbon and store it While it currently costs about  700 million to capture a million tons of carbon a year  the cost of building CCS plants is expected to drop 30  by 2050 With more than 200 000 megawatts of new coal fired generation capacity under construction  CCS is the only option to offset the emissions of these plants  Morgan Stanley says The bank s top picks include  Air Liquide   PA AIRP  SA and Bloom Energy Corp Hydrogen
About  5 4 trillion is needed for electrolyzers to make the gas  which can help provide clean fuel for power generation  industrial processes  vehicles and heating In addition   13 trillion would be required to increase renewable energy capacity to power the plants Another  1 trillion would be needed for storage  with additional investment for transportation and distribution Leading players include   Johnson Matthey   LON JMAT  Plc and Air Liquide SA Biofuels
Almost  2 7 trillion should go into biofuels like ethanol  which are currently mixed with petroleum products but will spread eventually to areas such as aviation About 4  of global transportation fuel will be biofuel in 2030 Ethanol  the most used biofuel at the moment will grow at about 3  a year  while a type of biodiesel called hydrotreated vegetable oil will achieve must faster growth  quadrupling production by 2030 Companies invloved include Neste Corporation and Sao Martinho SA  Adds company names throughout ",2019-10-24,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/morgan-stanley-says-these-firms-will-profit-from-climate-change-2003954,2003954
138564,360079,NEE,Better Buy  NextEra Energy Partners vs  TC Energy,news,"NextEra Energy Partners  NYSE NEP  and TC Energy  NYSE TRP  both offer yield seeking investors attractive dividend payouts  The clean energy focused NextEra currently yields 3 8   while pipeline giant TC Energy pays 4 4  
However  since most investors probably don t want to own too many energy stocks in their portfolio  they likely will only want to hold one of these high yielders  Here s a look at the bull and bear cases for buying either one 

The case for and against NextEra Energy Partners
NextEra Energy Partners is coming off a decent year  The renewable energy producer s stock gained about 22  in 2019 while generating a total return of 27 5  after adding in its dividend  which fell just short of the red hot S P 500 s 31 5  total return  One factor powering the company s solid performance were two needle moving acquisitions  This not only bought some more renewable energy assets from its parent  NextEra Energy  but it also purchased a natural gas pipeline company  Because of that  NextEra Energy Partners has enough power to support its plan to grow its high yielding dividend by 12  to 15  through the end of this year 
The company believes it can continue buying renewable assets from NextEra  given its parent s rapidly expanding portfolio  In its view  it can make enough deals to support annual dividend growth of 12  to 15  through at least 2024  Add to that the fact it has a conservative dividend payout ratio of 70  and a low valuation of less than 10 times earnings  and there s a lot to like  
However  one knock against NextEra Energy Partners is that it has a weaker balance sheet  giving it a sub investment grade credit rating  Because of that  it has less flexibility and higher costs when it comes to borrowing money  which has forced it to get creative when paying for acquisitions  Speaking of which  dealmaking is the main power source of the company s dividend growth strategy  As such  if it can t access the money it needs in the future  it might not deliver on its bold dividend growth plan  Finally  the company sells a meaningful portion of the renewable energy it produces to the bankrupt utility PG E  which could negatively impact its cash flow if the court rules that PG E can alter its power purchase agreements 
The case for and against TC Energy
Canadian pipeline giant TC Energy  meanwhile  is coming off an even stronger year  Its stock zoomed 49 3  in 2019  while its total return was an impressive 56 3   However  even with that big time rally  shares of the pipeline giant still trade at a relatively attractive price due to its underperformance in previous years 
One factor fueling last year s surge was the company s expansion program  which helped grow its cash flow by 14  through the third quarter  Meanwhile  TC Energy has a multibillion dollar backlog of additional growth projects  which should come online over the next several years  Those expansions should give the company the fuel to increase its high yielding dividend by 8  to 10  through 2021 and by 5  to 7  annually after that  
TC Energy can fully finance its capital program through retained cash after paying its dividend  due to its conservative payout ratio  and new debt thanks to its top notch balance sheet  The company s ability to internally finance growth is a notable improvement from previous years  which saw it sell assets to fund expansion projects so that its credit profile didn t weaken 
While TC Energy has low risk in the near term  rising climate change concerns are a longer term headwind for the company  It s becoming increasingly difficult for pipeline companies to build new projects due to opposition from environmentalists and local stakeholders  Because of that  the company could find it more challenging to develop new pipelines in the future  which could negatively impact its ability to continue growing its dividend 
Verdict  TC Energy is the lower risk buy
Both energy companies are excellent choices for income seeking investors  However  NextEra Energy Partners is a bit riskier in the near term than TC Energy  given its weaker balance sheet and reliance on acquisitions to power growth  While NextEra Energy Partners offers higher reward potential  TC Energy seems like the safer bet for investors looking for a growing income stream  making TC Energy the better buy right now ",2020-01-15,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pidcm,2060083
138565,360080,NEE,What to Watch When NextEra Energy Reports Its Q4 Results,news,"NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  once again generated market beating total returns last year  What made that impressive is that the S P 500 was scorching hot  as it produced an eye popping 31 5  total return  NextEra Energy  however  blew past that mark  as its total return came in at a lofty 42 7   which is a monster gain for a utility 
Several factors helped the company produce such strong gains  Two noteworthy ones were that it was on track to generate high end earnings growth and was locking up new renewable projects at the best rate in its history  Ideally  both trends continued during the fourth quarter  which is something investors should keep an eye on when it reports results later this week 

See if it generated high end earnings growth
NextEra s outlook for 2019 estimated that it would generate between  8 00 to  8 50 per share of adjusted earnings  which would be about 6  8  above 2018 s level  However  thanks to its strong results through the third quarter   6 94 per share of adjusted earnings   it expected its full year number to be  at or near the top end  of its growth range  or roughly  8 32 per share  As such  the company should generate around  1 38 per share of adjusted earnings during the fourth quarter  Given that outlook  investors should see if the company delivered on that expectation   
One factor that could play a notable role in whether it achieves a high end result is the impact of the wind on its renewable energy business  Wind resources across much of North America had been weaker than historical levels over the past year  which has negatively impacted renewable energy producers like NextEra Energy and its affiliate NextEra Energy Partners  NYSE NEP   Wind conditions  however  were much more favorable during the third quarter  which helped boost the results of both companies during that period  According to U S  government data  that trend continued during October  which bodes well for NextEra s ability to generate high end results in 2019  
Check if its backlog continued to grow
NextEra s CFO Rebecca Kujawa noted on the company s third quarter conference call that its  energy resources development team continues to capitalize on what we believe is the best renewables development environment in our history   She further pointed out that   through the first three quarters of 2019  we have added nearly 4 200 MW to our renewables backlog  which now totals more than 12 300 MW   That s a massive backlog  which she put in context by saying that  it is larger than energy resources  operating renewables portfolio at the end of 2014  which took us more than 15 years to develop  
Given the strong market conditions for new renewable energy projects  investors should see if the company continued growing its backlog during the third quarter  One item to watch closely is the addition of new solar projects that include energy storage  Thanks to rapidly falling costs  the company has seen an uptick in customers seeking these types of projects 
Look for any changes to its 2020 outlook
Thanks to its large backlog of renewable projects  the acquisition of Gulf Power  and expansion opportunities within its two utilities  NextEra expects to keep growing over the next several years  In its view  its adjusted earnings per share will expand by 6  to 8  per year through 2021 from 2018 s baseline level  plus some added accretion from the Gulf Power deal  That forecast implies that the company should earn between  8 70 to  9 20 per share in 2020  with  0 15 per share of that coming from cost savings at Gulf Power 
Investors should see if the company continues to stand by that outlook  especially the additional boost from its Gulf Power deal  Ideally  it will not only reaffirm that forecast but also project that results could be around the high end of the range again this year  If that s not the case  investors should see what issues could cause the company to fall short this year 
Anticipating a strong finish
NextEra Energy entered the fourth quarter with the wind literally at its back  The company appeared poised to produce high end results while also continuing to secure more renewable energy development projects  If that was the case  and the company expects more of the same in 2020  then that could give it the power to keep generating market beating returns this year ",2020-01-22,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plcpd,2064899

138568,360083,NEE,NextEra Energy Partners  NEP  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  Partners  NEP  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This limited partnership for clean energy projects is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 44 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  212 8  
Revenues are expected to be  326 83 million  up 110 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 31 92  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NextEra Energy Partners 
For NextEra Energy Partners  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  30 08  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NextEra Energy Partners will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that NextEra Energy Partners would post earnings of  0 62 per share when it actually produced a loss of  1 21  delivering a surprise of  295 16  
The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
NextEra Energy Partners doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nextera-energy-partners-nep-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200499703,200499703

138593,360108,NEE,Dorian Becomes Major Hurricane as It Heads Toward Florida Coast,news," Bloomberg     Hurricane Dorian reached major hurricane status as it heads toward Florida  with the potential to stall near the coast and bring a prolonged period of wind  rain and storm surge 
The hurricane s center was about 625 miles  1 005 kilometers  east of West Palm Beach  Florida  as of 2 p m  New York time  with maximum sustained winds of 115 miles per hour  according to the U S  National Hurricane Center  That wind speed means it has reached the Category 3 level on the Saffir Simpson scale 
Dorian is an  extremely dangerous  storm that  poses a significant threat to Florida and the Northwestern Bahamas   the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory  The hurricane could make landfall late Monday or early Tuesday 
Storm surge could reach 10 feet  3 meters  or more just north of where the center of Dorian crosses the coast  Pydynowski said  The storm is then expected to turn north and drag destruction up Florida into Georgia and beyond  The forecast suggests the system will continue dumping rain as it moves through the region into the middle of next week 
 The big news is that we are dealing with a potentially historic weather event again and it will definitely rival what Michael did to the Panhandle last year    said Jim Rouiller  chief meteorologist at the Energy Weather Group outside Philadelphia   Florida is going to get really hammered by this   
Dorian is threatening to become the strongest storm to hit anywhere in Florida since Hurricane Michael landed as a Category 5 hurricane  causing about  10 billion in insured losses 
On its current path  it s about a  40 billion or  50 billion dollar storm  according to Chuck Watson  a disaster modeler with Enki Research  If Dorian hits Fort Lauderdale and meanders up through Orlando  that is  realistically a  200 Billion     event   he wrote in an email 
The center of the storm s  cone of uncertainty  is Jupiter  Florida  about 25 miles  40 kilometers  north of President Donald Trump s Mar a Lago resort  Trump canceled a planned trip to Poland this weekend because of the storm 
Florida Prepares
About 2 000 national guard members are being mobilized in Florida on Friday  and the number is likely to double by late Saturday  Governor Ron DeSantis said he had spoken to President Trump about the storm on Wednesday night and was guaranteed  all the resources we need  
 This is a major event   DeSantis said at a press conference Friday  noting that the track still remained highly uncertain   We ve just got to be prepared for all those circumstances  
Two high pressure systems could pin Dorian between them as it nears the coast or gets on shore and that could create a situation similar to what happened when Hurricane Harvey stalled over Texas bringing record rainfall  said Rouiller 
 At this point Monday it will slow down considerably  it will come to a crawl because we are getting the Bermuda high over the Atlantic and the high over the southern Plains    Rouiller said   They are basically going to be tugging at Dorian and it doesn t know which way to go   
By the end of next week there could be two more hurricanes in the Atlantic  Rouiller said   these will track similar to Dorian and I still think we are under the gun beyond that   he said

Nextera Energy  NYSE NEE  CFD DFT Its parabolic trend continues  zoon out to see the chart from the 1990 s and you ll see what we mean  and price action is considering a break to new highs  Having rebounded from 220 support at the trendline  price action is now carving out a bullish flag which  if successful  projects a target around 248 
Bias remains bullish above the trendline  although we d prefer to see 231 hold as support to assume a bullish flag remains in play Traders can either wait for a break of the bull flag or  if confident it could revert to its trend  enter during the consolidation period As it s a long term bullish trend  an upside target could remain open  Although the bull flag target around 248 could also be considered 






McDonald s  NYSE MCD  CFD DFT As much as we love them  we re bearish on burgers whilst McDonalds remains below 200  Having carved out a top pattern between June through October  prices gapped topped proceeded to trade below the projected target around 190  The 50 day eMA ha crossed below the 200 day eMA  both of which are capping as resistance around the 38 2  Fibonacci level and the round number 200  Prices are now consolidating below a cluster of resistance around 200  so we re waiting for this to break lower or complete its correction beneath the bearish trendline 
Bias remains bearish beneath the resistance cluster around 200Whilst this could morph into a bearish triangle  it could just as easily pull back towards the trendline   resistance cluster before topping out  Therefore  a wider stop is something to consider to allow  breathing room  around the position Initial target is the 187 55 low and then 180 Price Action Update  
Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  CFD DFT  After gapping lower through support then breaking higher  it would have been difficult to gain a decent entry  This is on the backburner until the picture becomes clearer  although give its longer term uptrend  we ll continue to monitor its potential for a trough United Technologies  NYSE UTX  CFD DFT  The bias for a pullback has played out  albeit a little deeper than anticipated as it dipped beneath 144 35 support  Yet support has been found at the 50 day eMA and the bearish days were on lower volume to suggest the declines were indeed a correction  Bulls could either wait for a break above 149 81 or a consider a break of a bearish channel  Ultimately  we d prefer to at least see a bullish candle on the daily as  for far  each candle has been bearish Apache  NYSE APA  CFD DFT Due to the large gap down at the open  one would have to have already been  in it to win it   So whilst the directional bias was correct  the gap was unfortunate  It remains on the bearish watchlist for another entry  so perhaps bears could consider fading into minor rallies below 22 19 with view for it to break to new lows NiSource  NYSE NI  CFD DFT  The bias remains bearish although retracement from its lows has recycled higher  leaving a potential ABC correction to monitor  and as volumes on the minor rebound are low it also points towards corrective price action   Whilst too soon so say it has finally completed  yesterday s bearish candle below 27 resistance  and the 38 2  Fibonacci ratio  are encouraging so bears should keep this on their watchlist for signs of bearish momentum to return ",2019-12-10,Matt Simpson,https://www.investing.com/analysis/price-action-breakdown-mastercard-nextera-energy-mcdonalds-200491402,200491402

Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Right now  CenterPoint Energy is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while NextEra Energy has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This means that CNP s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
CNP currently has a forward P E ratio of 17  while NEE has a forward P E of 27 85  We also note that CNP has a PEG ratio of 3 11  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  NEE currently has a PEG ratio of 3 48 
Another notable valuation metric for CNP is its P B ratio of 2 17  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  NEE has a P B of 2 91 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to CNP s Value grade of B and NEE s Value grade of D 
CNP has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than NEE  so it seems like value investors will conclude that CNP is the superior option right now ",2019-10-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cnp-vs-nee-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200472349,200472349

138937,360452,NEE,Earnings Preview  NextEra Energy Partners  NEP  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  Partners  NEP  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This limited partnership for clean energy projects is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 42 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  70 6  
Revenues are expected to be  309 85 million  up 37 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NextEra Energy Partners 
For NextEra Energy Partners  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NextEra Energy Partners will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that NextEra Energy Partners would post earnings of  0 52 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 38  delivering a surprise of  173 08  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

138963,360478,NEE,Betting Big On Rate Cuts  Consider Buying These 2 Dividend Stocks,opinion,"Consensus is emerging in the market that the U S  Federal Reserve s next move will be a cut in interest rates  The bond markets  for example  are pricing in the assumption that the Fed will make at least two quarter percentage point cuts this year due to the increasing risk of recession 
That pessimism  in our view  isn t without reason  The U S  China trade war has started to hurt investor sentiment and  more importantly  is now forcing companies to cut their revenue forecasts 
With corporate America beginning to feel the pain  a growing number of economic indicators are also flashing red  The New York Fed s Empire State Manufacturing Index  released on Monday  showed the biggest monthly decline since the last recession 
If these market readings are correct and the Fed is ready to cut interest rates  then it makes sense for equity investors to seek shelter and add some safety to their portfolios  Stocks that generally outperform in a slowing economy are those that pay regular dividends  To help you get started  we have picked the following two income producing stocks to help ride through the market volatility 
1  NextEra Energy
It s not unusual for utility stocks to outperform the market in times of distress  Their business model based on recurring cash flows and their ability to pay regular dividends are some of the traits that attract investors  That s the main reason the utility sector has continued to be one of the best performers this year with the S P 500 Utilities gaining more than 13  
In this space  we particularly like Nextera Energy Inc  NYSE NEE   the Florida based utility that has scaled up by providing clean energy  NextEra is the largest U S  provider of renewable power  generating electricity from the wind and sun  It operates a large natural gas pipeline business as well as a growing energy storage operation 
The big difference between NextEra and other traditional utility companies is that its growth wasn t funded by a massive injection of debt  Instead  the company very smartly used government subsidies and tax breaks offered to clean power producers  It mostly sells the output to old school utilities  many of which must procure power from green sources to meet state mandates 

NextEra plans to invest  40 billion on its development projects through the end of next year  This should help fuel growth  especially at a time when the renewable market opportunity is huge and the company has already built an impressive scale  Shares closed yesterday down 0 5  at  205 38  but have advanced 19  this year versus the S P 500 s gains of 17  
With a dividend yield of 2 45   NextEra pays an annual dividend of  5 a share  The company plans to grow that between 12  14  through the end of 2020 
2  Welltower
Just like utility stocks  real estate income trusts  or REITs  are also a bet on the direction of interest rates  Their yield becomes attractive once the rates on safe haven government bonds fall 
Welltower Inc  NYSE WELL   one of the largest healthcare focused REITs  is an attractive option to consider if you re looking to earn a higher yield  The company manages more than 1 500 properties and is focused on healthcare   a relatively safe bet within REITs due to the ageing population in the U S  and increased spending on such facilities 
Its portfolio has a good mix of facilities to take advantage of this shift  including senior housing  outpatient medical facilities  and long term care  These revenue generating streams are solid  especially when the U S  is going through a huge demographic shift where  according to some estimates  10 000 baby boomers turn 65 each day 

Welltower is already benefiting from this trend  Its net income jumped 61  last year and is expected to grow a further 29  to around  1 billion in 2019  assuming the company meets the low end of its profit guidance  The shares fell 0 7  to  83 04 yesterday  which only slightly dented it s almost 20  gain so far this year 
Over the past decade  this REIT has boosted its payout to  3 48 a share annually  which translates to a yield of more than 4  at the current stock price 
Bottom Line
After a powerful rally in income producing stocks fueled by low interest rate expectations  these two names may not have much more room to the upside  Both NextEra and Welltower are trading close to their 52 week highs and their valuations seem a bit stretched at the moment 
But if the bond market is correct and we re soon going to see a rate cut  we shouldn t rule out another leg higher in the values of these stocks ",2019-06-19,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/betting-big-on-rate-declines-consider-buying-these-2-dividend-stocks-200432715,200432715

138965,360480,NEE,4 Large Cap Utilities On A Roll  Can They Climb Higher ,opinion,Amid geopolitical tensions in Iran and an impending global economic slowdown  one sector that is immune to the vagaries of economic cycle is the utility sector  Utilities are relatively protected from large swings in the stock market and are therefore considered a defensive investment  unaffected by economic cycles and politics Utility companies enjoy a reputation for safety  given the regulated nature of businesses  which lend their revenues a high level of certainty  These companies also benefit from the domestic orientation of their businesses  which shield them from foreign currency translation issues  Utilities offer solid dividend payouts and excellent capital appreciation over the longer term Last week  the Utilities Select Sector SPDR  XLU  hit a 52 week high of  61 38  Many of the utility stocks are currently trading near 52 week high and are expected to scale higher  Below we have

139087,360602,NEE,3 Reasons Why NextEra  NEE  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this parent company of Florida Power   Light Co  A great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for NextEra is 9   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 9 2  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 4 2  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for NextEra is 34 8   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 8  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 11  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 4 9  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for NextEra  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made NextEra a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

139104,360619,NEE,NextEra Energy  NEE  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  in Focus
Headquartered in Juno Beach  NextEra Energy  NEE  is a Utilities stock that has seen a price change of 9 34  so far this year  Currently paying a dividend of  1 25 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 63   In comparison  the Utility   Electric Power industry s yield is 2 97   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 89  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  5 is up 12 6  from last year  In the past five year period  NextEra Energy has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 11 98   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  NextEra s current payout ratio is 58   meaning it paid out 58  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for NEE for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  8 41 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 9 22  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  NEE presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-04-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nextera-energy-nee-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200410866,200410866

139126,360641,NEE,NextEra Energy Partners  NEP  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  Partners  NEP  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This limited partnership for clean energy projects is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 47 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  61 2  
Revenues are expected to be  316 31 million  up 49 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5 63  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NextEra Energy Partners 
For NextEra Energy Partners  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  18 03  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that NextEra Energy Partners will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that NextEra Energy Partners would post earnings of  0 49 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 39  delivering a surprise of  179 59  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
NextEra Energy Partners appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nextera-energy-partners-nep-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200407235,200407235

Chicago  IL   March 28  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG   OTC RHHBY    Celgene Corp    NASDAQ CELG    Johnson and Johnson  Inc    NYSE JNJ    Bayer  DE BAYGN  AG   OTC BAYRY   and Sunesis Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ SNSS   
Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  
5 Cancer Fighting Stocks to Boost Portfolio Gains
 According to one estimate  nearly 1 7 million individuals in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer in 2019  This is likely to boost demand for oncology drugs and treatment further  Among the most terminal diseases  cancer has nearly 200 variations which can impact almost every organ and tissue of the human body 
In 2017  Roche Holding AG  Celgene Corp  and Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY  contributed nearly 45  to global cancer revenues  with Roche commanding a 25  market share  But competition is expected to intensify by 2024  with six companies expected to hold the same market share 
Investing in the cancer space is extremely rewarding  This is why it would pay to invest in these five companies which offer present day franchises or prospective treatments for the most dreaded of diseases 
Mergers Heat Up Sector in January
The sector witnessed an eventful January after Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  decided to buy Loxo Oncology for  8 billion  Analysts took the view that the Loxo acquisition was leading to resurgence in mergers and acquisitions among oncology companies  At the time  Blueprint Medicines  which is a developer of small molecule kinase inhibitors  was believed to be the next logical target 
The Loxo buyout came a week after Celgene agreed to be acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb for  74 billion  The deal has subsequently been challenged by activist investor Starboard Value LP and Wellington Management  Meanwhile  GlaxoSmithKline decided to take over oncology focused firm TESARO  Inc  for  5 1 billion  a transaction which has subsequently been completed 
Market Potential  New Pipeline Trends Promising
Currently  the pace of growth in the oncology market is stunning  Worldwide revenues are projected to increase from  104 billion in 2017 to  233 billion in 2024  according to pharmaceutical data research firm Evaluate  And an extremely rich pipeline is powering this level of growth 
At present  more than 700 molecules have successfully reached late stage development  This shows a 60  jump from a decade ago  per IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science 
In fact  nearly 14 of the world s biggest pharma companies have more than 33  of late stage research and development focused on oncology  Further  nearly 700 companies have ensured at least one oncology treatment in late stage development 
This represents both a challenge and an opportunity  since the product life cycle for oncology drugs in nearly five times shorter than it was 30 years ago  In effect  drugs are replaced by newer better treatments within a few years  Though this presents oncology focused companies with tremendous opportunity  it also increases competition by reducing periods of exclusivity 
Our Choices
The need for newer  safer and more effective cancer drugs continues to grow  While competition in the space continues to rise  oncology drugs have extremely bright prospects  This is exactly why pharma majors have dedicated a major chunk of their R D spend toward oncology drug pipelines 
Investing in companies which offer blockbuster oncology drugs looks like a smart option  We have narrowed our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics 
Celgene s key growth engine is Revlimid  which was originally intended for treatment of multiple myeloma 
Celgene REIT flaunts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   The company s expected earnings growth for the current year is 21   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings has moved 3 5  north over the past 60 days

Investors will be hoping for strength from NEE as it approaches its next earnings release  In that report  analysts expect NEE to post earnings of  1 91 per share  This would mark a year over year decline of 1 55   Meanwhile  our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of  4 12 billion  up 6 65  from the prior year quarter 
NEE s full year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of  8 40 per share and revenue of  18 38 billion  These results would represent year over year changes of  9 09  and  9 77   respectively 
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for NEE  These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short term business trends  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability 
Based on our research  we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near team stock moves  Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank  This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple  actionable rating system

139151,360666,NEE,Forget Oil  This 7 6  Dividend Will Soar In 2019,opinion,"Oil prices have been locked in a tight range for five years and I know I don t have to tell you that this has been a disaster for energy investors 
Oil Fails to Launch

With the benchmark Energy Select Sector SPDR  XLE  NYSE XLE   unable to hold its gains for long  let alone recover to pre crash levels   even the most conservative energy investor has been clobbered 
Why is this happening 
After all  you d think a growing global population and emerging market growth would drive up the price of a limited resource like oil  But the tables have turned  I ll get into why shortly 
These Dividend Payers Are Better Buys Than Oil
For now  though  I recommend that income seekers go a different route and pick stocks  and closed end funds  CEFs   that benefit from cheaper oil and gas like utilities 
The reason is simple  these companies will pay less to fuel their plants  driving up their profit margins and their dividend payouts  too 
So what s the best way to buy in 
You could choose a utility ETF  like the Utilities Sector SPDR Fund  NYSE XLU   With a 3  yield  it pays 70  more than an index fund like the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  
But my favorite method probably won t surprise you  CEFs  The Cohen   Steers Infrastructure Fund  NYSE UTF   for example  pays a 7 6  dividend now  while trading at a 4 6  discount to net asset value  NAV  or what it s underlying portfolio is worth   It also holds major electric utilities like NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  and Atmos Energy  NYSE ATO  
What s Weighing on Oil
Now let s dive into some of the other issues that are bound to keep energy down for a long time to come 
Energy Efficiency  Oil s Nemesis
We hear a lot about alternative fuels these days  but if you re reading this  you re still likely using more power generated by oil  coal and nuclear power than wind and solar 
The real story is a bit more boring  people are simply using less energy and utilities are learning to provide more power with less energy inputs  raising their profit margins 
A European Union study  for example  found that more efficient thermal power production meant less energy needed to be used to satisfy consumers  needs  The trend was nowhere near slowing 
Europe s Lean Energy Machines

Source  European Environment Agency
The same trend holds in the US  where from 1980 to 2014  the fuel economy of vehicles fell by over 25   industrial energy efficiency rose 40   and lost energy from transport fell by 25   according to the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy 
And if you re looking for China for growth  think again  It s getting better at using energy  too 
Chinese Power Consumption Falls Relative to Economic Growth

Source  International Energy Charter
Note the one line going down  That s the ratio of total produced energy to GDP  indicating that China has been more efficient in its use of energy  the IEC estimates energy production to GDP fell by over 3  in 2018  continuing the trend  
Another problem for oil bulls  population growth is slowing 
A  Slower  Growing Population

Source  World Bank
With slower population growth  the natural growth of energy demand will slow  as well  Meantime  alternative energy costs are tanking  making it easier to replace oil with other fuels 
Solar Gets Cheaper  

Source  Natural Renewable Energy Laboratory
The continued decline in solar power costs has helped keep solar installations growing over the last decade  The cost of wind power production has also been on a steady decline since 2008 
  And so Does Wind

Source  U S  Department of Energy
While alternatives still face a few hurdles  the largest of which is storage   it s clear that lower costs for alternative fuels will mean companies and consumers will choose them more often  creating another headwind for oil 
Action to Take  Avoid Oil
While oil companies can pivot to alternative energies  Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa   RDS  has been particularly good on this front   the transition is slow and full of risks that constantly need to be repriced in  RDS said it will likely spend between  1 billion and  2 billion on alternative energy per year in 2019  which is just 4 3  of the company s operating expenses in 2018 and 0 4  of its annual revenues 
But RDS s sales still depend on oil prices  and little has changed in the last five years  the company s 2018 revenues were still down 7 8  since 2014 
The bottom line  These companies are clearly not set for a future of steadily declining oil demand  and we need to invest for the future  not the past  The risks of betting on oil firms turning around are simply too high

139180,360695,NEE,Top Utility Stocks To Hedge Your Portfolio,opinion,"The stock market has been on shaky ground since the drop off at the end of 2018 and with a 460 point drop in the Dow index just today  Therefore  a low beta stocks  low market correlation  with high yields might be a smart hedge for your portfolio  Utility stocks fit this profile with their low market correlation and typically larger dividend payouts  These stocks usually have a flight to quality classification as well   when there is a broader market sell off investors will go to utility stocks as a high yield safe haven 
Treasury yields have been sinking since the Feds decision to hold rates steady came Wednesday afternoon  The US 10 Yr Treasury yield is down 16 basis points since Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke on Wednesday and down 82 basis points from its high last November of 3 24   Mr  Powell signaled that there would be no more rate hikes in 2019  The Fed also plans to slow their current portfolio runoff and completely end the quantitative tightening by October of this year  This dovish talk should cause the 10 yr yields to slide even further  These huge moves downward in the US economy s  risk free  bond makes high yield utility stocks look much more attractive to investors 
Here are a few utility stocks to think about adding to your portfolio 
NextEra Energy   NYSE NEE  
NextEra Energy is the largest public utility company by market cap in the US  operating in 27 states and 4 provinces in Canada  The company produces 46  of its energy from natural gas  26  from nuclear  22  from wind turbines and the remaining 6  from solar  coal and oil combined  NEE has shown a consistent top line with expanding margins  seen in the bar chart below  that have outpaced its competitors by a considerable amount  58  gross margin  
 
 
The business is moving towards alternative power generation with plans to add around 15 000 MW by 2020  currently producing close to 50 000 MW   in 2018 they were able to add more than 6 500 MW of renewable energy to their capacity  NextEra has numerous projects in the works including a joint venture that just received approval by the FERC called the Mountain Valley Pipeline  MVP  that will further connect their natural gas operations to the Southeast US markets 
NEE trades more like a growth stock outpacing the S P 500 index by almost 25  in the last 2 years  This is due to expanding margins and lucrative projects that have broadened NextEra s reach  The stock is only yielding 2 6  but with a 0 29 beta this investment option would make a great broader market hedge for your portfolio   NEE is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
 
 
Southern Company   NYSE SO  
Southern Company is an Atlanta based electric utility firm that serves around 9 million customers in 9 states in the southeast  SO completed the acquisition of AGL Resources  NYSE GAS  at the end of 2016 making them one of the largest utility companies in the US with a 46 000 MW capacity  This stock is boasting a similar growth story to NextEra Energy with a 27  total return over the last year  and according to Edward Jones analyst  earnings are expected to grow 5  annually for the next 5 years 
Southern Company is trading at a beta of 0 19 and boasting a 4 65  yield making it an attractive hedge for your portfolio if you believe the growth story  The company has beaten estimates for the past 8 earnings report  and analyst are still adjusting future EPS estimates up  You can see below that for the full year 2019 and full year 2020 adjusted up motivating a Zacks Rank  2  buy  
 
 
Pacific Gas   Electric Co   NYSE PCG  
PG E has been in the news quite a bit recently because of its connection with the Paradise  California wildfire that killed at least 86 people  PG E came out to the public and said they likely caused the  campfire  that destroyed thousands of lives and became the deadliest campfire in California history  The company decided to file bankruptcy protection to itself from lawsuits  As you could probably guess the stock plummeted and is currently trading down 57  for the last 52 weeks 
 
 
I know this probably sounds like a stock you wouldn t want to touch because of the potential liabilities involved but this could be a great buying opportunity for a stock that everyone is scared of  PG E didn t have any systemic changes in its operations other than increasing controls and safety measures  They have shown consistent adjusted net income growth  shown on the chart below   According to some investors  they didn t even need to file for bankruptcy protection because they had sufficient cash flows to pay for damages 
 
 
PCG is also boasting a 20  yield because its stock dropped so much in the last 6 month  These catalysts lead me to believe this may be an excellent opportunity to get on the ground floor of an undervalued utility company that still serves 16 million Americans and not to mention a crazy high dividend yield  PCG is a Zacks Ranking  3  Hold  at the moment

139181,360696,NEE,NextEra  NEE  Is An Incredible Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this parent company of Florida Power   Light Co  Is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for NextEra is 9   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 9 1  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 3 8  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for NextEra is 34 8   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 9 4  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 11  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 4 9  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for NextEra have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made NextEra a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that NextEra is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-03-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nextera-nee-is-an-incredible-growth-stock-3-reasons-why-200400687,200400687
139182,360697,NEE,Are You Looking For A High Growth Dividend Stock  NextEra Energy  NEE  Could Be A Great Choice,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  in Focus
Based in Juno Beach  NextEra Energy  NEE  is in the Utilities sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 11 39   The parent company of Florida Power   Light Co  Is currently shelling out a dividend of  1 25 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 58   This compares to the Utility   Electric Power industry s yield of 2 88  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 99  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  5 is up 12 6  from last year  Over the last 5 years  NextEra Energy has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 11 12   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  NextEra s current payout ratio is 58   meaning it paid out 58  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  NEE expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  8 40 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 9 09  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that NEE is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-03-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-nextera-energy-nee-could-be-a-great-choice-200401092,200401092
139183,360698,NEE,5 Cancer Fighting Stocks To Boost Portfolio Gains,opinion,"According to one estimate  nearly 1 7 million individuals in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer in 2019  This is likely to boost demand for oncology drugs and treatment further  Among the most terminal diseases  cancer has nearly 200 variations which can impact almost every organ and tissue of the human body 
In 2017  Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG   OTC RHHBY    Celgene Corp    NASDAQ CELG   and Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   contributed nearly 45  to global cancer revenues  with Roche commanding a 25  market share  But competition is expected to intensify by 2024  with six companies expected to hold the same market share 
Investing in the cancer space is extremely rewarding  This is why it would pay to invest in these five companies which offer present day franchises or prospective treatments for the most dreaded of diseases 
Mergers Heat Up Sector in January
The sector witnessed an eventful January after Eli Lilly and Company   NYSE LLY   decided to buy Loxo Oncology for  8 billion  Analysts took the view that the Loxo acquisition was leading to resurgence in mergers and acquisitions among oncology companies  At the time  Blueprint Medicines Corp    NASDAQ BPMC    which is a developer of small molecule kinase inhibitors  was believed to be the next logical target 
The Loxo buyout came a week after Celgene agreed to be acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb for  74 billion  The deal has subsequently been challenged by activist investor Starboard Value LP and Wellington Management  Meanwhile  GlaxoSmithKline plc   NYSE GSK   decided to take over oncology focused firm TESARO  Inc  for  5 1 billion  a transaction which has subsequently been completed 
Market Potential  New Pipeline Trends Promising
Currently  the pace of growth in the oncology market is stunning  Worldwide revenues are projected to increase from  104 billion in 2017 to  233 billion in 2024  according to pharmaceutical data research firm Evaluate  And an extremely rich pipeline is powering this level of growth 
At present  more than 700 molecules have successfully reached late stage development  This shows a 60  jump from a decade ago  per IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science 
In fact  nearly 14 of the world s biggest pharma companies have more than 33  of late stage research and development focused on oncology  Further  nearly 700 companies have ensured at least one oncology treatment in late stage development 
This represents both a challenge and an opportunity  since the product life cycle for oncology drugs in nearly five times shorter than it was 30 years ago  In effect  drugs are replaced by newer better treatments within a few years  Though this presents oncology focused companies with tremendous opportunity  it also increases competition by reducing periods of exclusivity 
Our Choices
The need for newer  safer and more effective cancer drugs continues to grow  While competition in the space continues to rise  oncology drugs have extremely bright prospects  This is exactly why pharma majors have dedicated a major chunk of their R D spend toward oncology drug pipelines 
Investing in companies which offer blockbuster oncology drugs looks like a smart option  We have narrowed our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics 
Celgene s key growth engine is Revlimid  which was originally intended for treatment of multiple myeloma 
Celgene REIT flaunts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   The company s expected earnings growth for the current year is 21   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings has moved 3 5  north over the past 60 days

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE   T Mobile  TMUS  and Petrobras  PBR   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Buy ranked NextEra Energy s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electric Power industry in the past year  gaining  18 6  vs  14   The Zacks analyst thinks NextEra Energy s investments to strengthen its infrastructure and ongoing capital projects  on completion  will help in serving the expanding customer base more efficiently  
The expansion of business through strategic acquisitions has positively impacted earnings  However  the company s nature of business is subject to complex and comprehensive federal  state and other regulations  Substantial investments are undertaken to ensure the safety of nuclear operations  That said  the risk of unplanned outages remains  which could derail its normal operations and impact profitability 
 You can   
Shares of T Mobile have outperformed the Zacks National Wireless industry over the past year  gaining  11 7  vs   0 9   T Mobile has received shareholder approval for its merger with Sprint  This is a step forward in creating the New T Mobile through which the wireless carrier aims to bring robust competition to the 5G era  
The New T Mobile would have about 127 million customers and a strong closing balance sheet  The company has also collaborated with Ericsson  BS ERICAs  and Nokia  HE NOKIA  to accelerate the deployment of a nationwide 5G network  The Zacks analyst thinks T Mobile s network expansion strategy continues to be superior to its rivals  
However  a highly competitive and saturated U S  wireless market remains a major headwind  Intensifying competition could limit the company s ability to attract and retain customers and may adversely affect its operating results  T Mobile launched several low priced service plans which have enhanced revenues but not significantly improved the bottom line 
 You can   
Petrobras  shares have outperformed the Zacks Emerging Markets Integrated Oil industry over the past three months  gaining  23 1  vs   15 5   While Petrobras recently reported weaker than expected Q4 earnings triggered by lower production  impairments and legal charges  results were strong overall  
In particular  Petrobras  upstream profit soared year over year thanks to steady commodity price recovery that lead to meaningful improvements in net income and EBITDA  The Zacks analyst thinks the largest oil company in South America also stands to benefit from Brazil s economic growth and huge pre salt oil reserves  
However  it was another quarter that production weakness clipped profits and cut into overall gains from rising oil prices  Moreover  the company s downstream business   consisting of the refining and marketing activities   suffered from weak oil products sales margins  
With the largest debt load in the oil industry  coupled with years of mismanagement and corruption  investors are advised to wait for a better entry point before buying shares

139211,360726,NEE,Buy 4 Stocks Despite Weak Industrial Production In February ,opinion,On Mar 15  Federal Reserve reported that industrial production data for the month of February fell below the consensus estimate  However  industrial production recorded positive growth in February against a contraction in January  Capacity utilization also fell below consensus expectation Nevertheless  a closer look at the report reveals that despite softness of manufacturing output  production of utilities products and mining has increased  Market group wise  increase in materials  business supplies and defense and space equipment were offset by decrease in consumer goods  business equipment and construction supplies Industrial Production Rises in FebruaryPer Federal Reserve report  industrial production in February inched up 0 1  compared with consensus estimate of 0 4   Per revised estimate  in January  industrial production decreased 0 4  instead of prior estimate of a decline of 0 6  Primary reason behind less than expected industrial production data is a decline of 0 4  in the manufacturing products  However  as per revised estimate  manufacturing production fell 0 5  in January instead of the prior estimate of a drop of 0 9  Consequently  the report clearly indicates that the rate of decline in manufacturing has decreased in February  Overall industrial production also entered positive territory recovering from January s slump  However  it failed to meet consensus estimates  Moreover  utilities output rose a significant 3 7  in February  Mining output increased 0 3  while oil and gas drilling grew by 2 8    Industry researchers were highly concerned about future capital spending by the U S  manufacturing sector owing to a stiff rise in interest rate in 2018 and apprehensions regarding an impending global economic slowdown  However  business spending is likely to maintain its momentum driven by several tailwinds Three Major Drivers of Business SpendingFirst  on Jan 30  Fed chair Jerome Powell said that the central bank will maintain its dovish monetary stance at least for the time being  Better than expected inflation data  both consumer price index and producer price index  also strengthened investors  confidence that the central bank will not take an aggressive stance in 2019 Second  the 11 month long trade dispute between the United States and China is heading toward a likely resolution  If the two countries can reach an amicable solution  a major concern for global economic slowdown will be eliminated  The International Monetary Fund has identified ongoing tariff related hassle between the United States and China as the primary factor behind a perceived global economic slowdown in 2019 Third  in order to streamline their own economies  both China and the 19 member European Union have decided to inject economic stimulus with an immediate effect  Notably  China and Eurozone economies are the two of the largest trading partners of the United States  Consolidation of Chinese and Eurozone economies will enable the United States to export more especially when the U S  dollar price index is gradually diminishing Our PicksAt present

5 Utility Service Providers to Keep You Protected in 2019
The Utilities sector was the best performer for the S P 500 in 2018  Although Wall Street has been recovering impressively so far in 2019  several headwinds still persist  On Feb 25  the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in its Congressional testimony that although the U S  economy is in good shape now  it may face headwinds due to slowdown in China  Japan and European Union 
Utilities are a safe bet during times of market turmoil  as they are relatively stable due to the essential nature of the products they offer  Consequently  it will be prudent to invest in utility stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to stay safe 
Eurozone s Growth at Risk
On Feb 21  Data firm IHS Markit reported that Eurozone s Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index  PMI  declined to a reading of 49 2 in February  its lowest reading in 69 months  Any reading below 50 indicates contraction of manufacturing activities 
On Feb 6  the European Commission lowered 2019 growth projection for the 19 member Eurozone from 1 9  in November to 1 3   The growth rate for 2020 was pegged at 1 6  On Feb 4  Bank of England reduced growth rate of the U K  for 2019 to 1 2  from 1 7  forecasted earlier  Economic forecast for 2020 has been reduced to 1 5   The root cause of an impending slowdown is the Brexit related problem 
Japan s Manufacturing Declining
On Feb 21  Bloomberg reported that the Flash Markit Nikkei Japan Manufacturing PMI fell to a seasonally adjusted 48 5 in February from 50 3 in January  its lowest reading since June 2016  On Feb 20  Japan stated that its trade deficit for the month of January increased a whopping 49 2  year over year to 1 41 trillion yen  The stiff increase in trade deficit was owing to a decline of 17 4  of exports to China  its largest decline since January 2016  This was the second consecutive month of export decline 
Slowdown in Chinese Growth 
Chinese economy expanded at 6 6  in 2018  its slowest pace since 1990  The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers reported that deliveries of passenger vehicles to dealers dropped 4 1  to 23 7 million units  its first decline in 28 years  Moreover  the China Passenger Car Association reported a slump of 6  in retail vehicle sales in 2018  China is providing several stimuli to accelerate its economic growth 
Utilities are Immune to Vagaries of Economic Cycle   
The Utilities sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to vagaries of the economic cycle  It s because these companies provide basic services like electricity  gas and water  which can never go out of demand 
Consequently  adding stocks from the utility basket usually lends more stability to a portfolio in an uncertain market condition  Moreover  the sector is known for stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows   Stable earnings enable utilities to pay out consistent dividends that add to their attractiveness to income oriented investors 
Utility companies enjoy a reputation for safety given the regulated nature of their business  which lend their revenues a high level of certainty  These companies also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business  which shields them from foreign currency translation issues that have been plaguing the other industries of late 
Our Top Picks 
Utility service providers will benefit from the new rates in their service territories  customer growth  effective management and control of expenses through the introduction of new technology  Consequently  we have narrowed down our search to five utility stocks with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

139227,360742,NEE,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love NextEra  NEE ,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this parent company of Florida Power   Light Co  A great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for NextEra is 9   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 9 1  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 3 8  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for NextEra is 34 8   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 8  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 11  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 4 7  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for NextEra  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
NextEra has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that NextEra is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-03-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-growth-investors-will-love-nextera-nee-200395961,200395961
139228,360743,NEE,Why NextEra Energy  NEE  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  in Focus
Headquartered in Juno Beach  NextEra Energy  NEE  is a Utilities stock that has seen a price change of 8 12  so far this year  The parent company of Florida Power   Light Co  Is paying out a dividend of  1 11 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 66  compared to the Utility   Electric Power industry s yield of 2 97  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 97  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  5 is up 12 6  from last year  Over the last 5 years  NextEra Energy has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 11 12   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  NextEra s current payout ratio is 58   This means it paid out 58  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for NEE for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  8 40 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 9 11  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout

139302,360817,NEE,Is NextEra  NEE  A Solid Growth Stock  3 Reasons To Think   Yes  ,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this parent company of Florida Power   Light Co  Is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for NextEra is 9   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 9  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 4 1  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for NextEra is 34 8   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 3 6  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 11  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 4 8  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for NextEra  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 3  over the past month 
Bottom Line
NextEra has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Right now  NextEra Energy Partners is sporting a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Ormat Technologies has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that NEP is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
NEP currently has a forward P E ratio of 19 72  while ORA has a forward P E of 24 50  We also note that NEP has a PEG ratio of 2 19  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  ORA currently has a PEG ratio of 2 23 
Another notable valuation metric for NEP is its P B ratio of 0 69  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  ORA has a P B of 1 93 
Based on these metrics and many more  NEP holds a Value grade of B  while ORA has a Value grade of C 
NEP stands above ORA thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that NEP is the superior value option right now ",2019-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nep-or-ora-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200378322,200378322

139395,360910,NEE,NextEra Energy  NEE  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 25  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This parent company of Florida Power   Light Co  Is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 52 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  21 6  
Revenues are expected to be  4 43 billion  up 10 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 78  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NextEra 
For NextEra  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 71  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that NextEra will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that NextEra would post earnings of  2 17 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 18  delivering a surprise of  0 46  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

For NextEra  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier

featured in the blog include  Barclays  LON BARC  PLC   NYSE BCS    Rockwell Medical  Inc    NASDAQ RMTI    NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  Partners  LP   NYSE NEP    Belmond Ltd    NYSE BEL   and Shaw Communications Inc    NYSE SJR   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  Hot Momentum Stocks to Watch in 2019The U S  stock market has been combating deterrents like the U S  China trade dispute  multiple Fed rate hikes  global political spasms  volatile oil prices and others through 2018 Things deteriorated at the tail end of the year  thanks to the latest Treasury yield anxiety and increase in federal funds rates  Not to forget  a rising interest rate environment reduces borrowing and eventually spending  If spending drops too much  there may be chances of a recession soon Now  as we gear up to ring in a New Year  investors might want to zero in on stocks that hold solid potential for a healthy ROI in 2019  But before that  let s go through the noteworthy events of the year and then take a look at an elaborate outlook for 2019 2018 in a Nutshell The year 2018 has been quite a mixed bag for investors In the first half  the Trump administration announced the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that provided a boost to cash flow and infused confidence for healthy investments As the year progressed  markets were stripped of the initial gains due to volatile oil prices  trade tiff  geopolitical conflict with North Korea and Iran  multiple interest hikes by Fed  imposition of tariffs on various foreign countries to improve the U S  trade balance and a soft global economy In December  for the first time in more than a decade  yields on Treasuries with shorter maturities exceeded longer dated issues  In other words  the yield curve experienced an inversion  Traditionally  such a phenomenon heralds severe economic downturn  Last time this happened in December 2007  just before the Great Recession However  we don t see a near term recession  This is because debt payments were way higher than household budgets during the Great Recession  Now  household debt payments account for a modest share of household income 2019 Overall ForecastEconomy as a WholeFresh data from IMF shows that the economy will maintain a slow pace in 2019 and 2020  The GDP growth rate is expected to remain in the 2 3  ideal range  Meanwhile  unemployment is expected to continue at the usual rate Bloomberg forecasts United States  net contribution to global GDP to drop from 12 3  to 8 5  in 2022 Trade War Jibe to Relax Till March The trade war jibe seems to settle down soon as Washington and Beijing have agreed to not levy further tariffs till March 2019  However  many experts believe that the mutually agreed timeframe is not enough to enable a comprehensive trade pact between the economies  The increase in tariff from 10  to 25   on hold till Mar 1  2019  on  200 billion worth of Chinese imports  if imposed  will have a significant impact on companies  profits Fed Rate Hike OutlookOn Dec 19  policymakers announced the expectations of two more hikes in 2019  However  it did strike a dovish note by reducing projected rate hikes from three to two Oil Prices OutlookCrude oil prices are recovering fast after plummeting to its lowest level of 2018 in November  According to market watchers  given OPEC s recent decision of production cut with global oil demand remaining solid  there are high chances that crude prices will increase in 2019 Any recovery in oil prices can play a major role in driving the broader stock market and of course small cap stocks  Although it is not clear what 2019 will unfold for the markets  per Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   recent declines in oil price are likely to boost disposable income and in turn spending Time to Buy Momentum StocksWith a

139471,360986,NEE,Utilities ETF  XLU  Hits New 52 Week High,opinion,"For investors seeking momentum  Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund  is probably on radar now  The fund just hit a 52 week high  Shares of XLU are up roughly 20 3  from their 52 week low price of  47 37 share 
But could more gains be ahead for this ETF  Let s take a quick look at the fund and the near term outlook to get a better idea on where it might be headed 
XLU in Focus
The fund tracks the Utilities Select Sector Index  which seeks to represent the utilities sector of the S P 500 index  It comprises 29 holdings with NextEra Energy Inc   NYSE NEE   occupying the top position  11 57    The fund charges 13 bps as fees  see    
Why the move 
The utilities sector of the broad market has been an area to watch lately as stock markets are in a state of turmoil with easing signs of economic activity and rising rate concerns  The last trading session added to the already fragile sentiments with rising political tension in the nation s capital  A controversial meet between President Trump and Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi over border security caused hurt investor sentiment  making the safe haven sector a favorable option 
More Gains Ahead

There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
NextEra Energy Partners and Evergy Inc are both sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
NEP currently has a forward P E ratio of 10 09  while EVRG has a forward P E of 22 10  We also note that NEP has a PEG ratio of 1 12  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  EVRG currently has a PEG ratio of 2 86

outperforming the Zacks International Integrated Oil industry  which declined  11 6  over the same period  While PetroChina recently reported weaker than expected third quarter earnings triggered by tepid oil production growth and massive gas import losses  results were strong overall PetroChina s upstream unit profit soared from the year ago period thanks to steady commodity price recovery and stricter cost control  while the downstream business   consisting of the refining and chemicals activities   also impressed on the back of optimized resource allocation  strict cost control and increased production of high value products  PetroChina also experienced strong refined products demand and higher natural gas sales However  the Zacks analyst thinks the company s weak oil production growth prospects is an area of concern  A limited international operation and losses on gas imports gives investors more reason to be cautious on the stock  Hence  while looking incrementally positive

139575,361090,NEE,A Crash Proof Way To Bank  63 720 In The Next 12 Months,opinion,"Market gyrations don t matter when you can generate  63 720 over the next 12 months on a capital base as modest as  350 000  The secret  Monthly cash flow that adds up to 20  average annual returns regardless of what stocks do 
It s an income investors  dream   banking regular payments without having to worry about a pullback for the pricey  and increasingly wobbly  stock market 
 Buy and hope  investors are  understandably  terrified today  They ve bought their shares   and now all they can do is hope the aging bull market keeps climbing higher 
We income investors prefer to calculate rather than gamble  It s why we demand dividends  After all  without cash flow  what is a stock really worth besides what someone will possibly pay us for it tomorrow 
But this market could very well be topping  After all  this current bull market is nine years old  And lately it appears to be aging in dog years 
Which makes right now a good time to talk about my two favorite strategies for generating current cash flow from the stock market  Because whether stocks go up  down or meander sideways  I always want my money to be working for me   and paying me regularly  preferably monthly  or even weekly  
Monthly Cash Flow Play  High Current Yields
Our Contrarian Income Report portfolio pays 7 5  as I write  This is 4X the payout of the broader market  It means a  350 000 portfolio will pay you  26 250 in annual dividends 
That s a lot better than the S P 500  which would insult us income investors with its measly  6 300 annual check  But even  26 250 is likely less than your local coffee barista or friendly bartender earns per year 
And with all due respect to our industry friends  we don t envy their day jobs  But if we don t have enough capital to retire on  then we either need to pickup a  side hustle  or follow one of these two high yield trails 

 Chase  higher yields of 10  or more 

Bad idea  I can get you a safe diversified dividend portfolio paying 7 5  today  I can even recommend seven stocks that are so cheap that their yields are a bit inflated  9     But most double digit dividends are high for a reason  and should be avoided today 
Which means  if you actually need to earn yields of 10  or more on your income  you must consider our second option 

 Accelerate  blue chip dividends from 2  to 20  

This is a special system I ve developed that allows you to collect  instant dividends  worth 5X  10X and even 20X more than the yields listed to  first level investors  on most financial websites  Let me explain 
Weekly Cash Flow Play  2  My  Dividend Accelerator  for 20  Yields
The beauty of the Dividend Accelerator is that you can collect  instant income  on every trade  This means you can make exponentially higher returns than what s possible from just traditional dividends 
The ideal stock to sell cash secured puts against is a dividend grower  Its payout provides a natural lift to its share price  And remember  we don t really care if a stock goes up   we generally only ask that it trades sideways or better 
Let s take refiner Valero  VLO   Shares yield 3  today  But we regularly generate up to 10 times as much cash simply by selling puts that are trading below Valero s current share price 
That s exactly what my subscribers and I have done three times as Valero s stock price inevitably gets pulled up towards its payout curve 

In November 2016  we collected  153 per contract for 25  annualized gains 
In May 2017  we banked  129 per contract for 20  yearly returns 
And in July 2017  we added another  97 per contract for 36  annualized returns 

Contracts are for lots of 100 shares  Folks who sold 5 or 10 contracts at a time were able to scale their income accordingly  A 10 pack sold on the November trade  for example  would have generated  1 530 in  instant income  versus just  153 
Accelerating VLO s 3  Dividend To a 25   Cash Yield 
And by the way  this cash gets deposited into your account instantly  No need to wait for dividend day  or even for the contract to expire  You sell the contract  and you get the cash flow right now 
19 5  Cash Yields From a Safe Utility
When investors ask me about utility stocks and their dividends  they usually go on to name the stodgiest  slowest growers of the group  Few have heard of NextEra Energy Inc  NYSE NEE    and that s too bad  because this renewable energy powerhouse is probably the best of the bunch  Case in point  it s grown its dividend by 149  over the last decade 
NEE Delivers 3X the Dividend Growth 
NEE s rising payout lifts its share price higher  which is good for folks who already own it  But for those of us who need a new position  and income  today  shares only yield 2 7  
Of course we don t grind out 2 7  per year when we can bank 16  to 24  yearly returns  in cash  With lower risk to boot 
Over the past couple of years  my  dividend acceleration disciples  and I have accelerated NEE s dividend four times   for an average annualized return of 19 5   And we never had to actually buy the stock  either 
We Accelerated NEE s 2 7  Dividend to 19 5  
NEE basically became our personal ATM  We didn t buy  hold and wait for a dividend payment  We simply sold a put whenever the setup looked favorable   and banked thousands each time

139576,361091,NEE,WEC Energy  NextEra  My 2 Favorite Utility Companies But I Hate The Stocks ,opinion,"Introduction
It is quite easy to get caught up  and quite hard to avoid getting caught up in a great bull market like the one we are currently in  However  it s important to remind ourselves that   everybody is a genius in a bull market   In my experience  the hardest thing for investors to do is to go against the crowd  Although Warren Buffett s advice  be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy  is sound  it is simultaneously almost impossible for people to do  Instead of going against the grain  people tend to rationalize about how it s different this time  and fundamentals don t really matter 
Another insidious aspect of a great bull market is that people love a rising stock price and hate a falling one  Consequently  regardless of valuation levels  people consider a stock with a current rising stock price a good stock and a stock with a current falling price a bad stock  However  common sense would dictate that you will not find bargains investing in hot or popular stocks  Although it is often true that a stock with the rising price might generate great short term returns  in the long run valuations inevitably and rightfully so revert to the mean 
Nevertheless  it is almost impossible to argue against a rising stock price over the short run  Investors get overconfident which leads to complacency  A great mentor of mine once asked me if I knew the definition of appreciation  As I started reciting a financial dictionary definition he immediately stopped me  Instead of the dictionary version he simply pointed out that all too often the definition of appreciation is when others appreciate what you own more than you do  Unfortunately  investors should beware that short term gain often leads to long term pain  This is especially true when valuations are above what fundamentals would rationally suggest and or support 
Importantly  nothing that has been said thus far would suggest that stock prices cannot remain excessively valued for relatively long periods of time  In truth  this happens quite often  Therefore  I am not trying to suggest that you cannot make money by investing in an overvalued stock  In truth and fact  a stock with good momentum can be an excellent investment over several months or even years   especially in a long running bull market like we have today  However  investors should be fully aware of the amount of risk they are assuming by investing in excessively valued stocks  Therefore  I suggest that recognizing excessive valuation is more about risk assessment than it is about possibly losing money   at least over the short run  Stated differently  as an investor  how much risk are you willing to take  Or better yet  are you aware of the amount of risk you are currently taking 
NextEra And WEC  Great Utilities  Risky Stocks
From my personal perspective  the two best utilities in America are NextEra Energy Inc  NYSE NEE  and WEC Energy Group Inc  NYSE WEC   There are numerous reasons why I feel this way  One of them is simply personal bias  I reside in Florida and my wife and girl of my dreams hails from Wisconsin  However  personal bias aside  these are two of the most consistent and fastest growing utilities in the country  Both utilities have grown earnings at approximately twice the rate of the average utility company  As a result  both utilities have produced significantly more dividend income than the average company  S P 500   and both utilities have consistently increased their dividend more than the average company  Additionally  both companies are A  rated and both have solid balance sheets and reasonable debt levels  To summarize  as utility stocks go  there s a lot to like about these two 
Consequently  if you currently conduct research on either of these utilities you are likely to find very positive write ups and recommendations  Within these write ups you will find many factual and positive pieces of information about how great these two businesses are  Moreover  most everything that you read will be truthful and correct  As the title of this article states  these are my two favorite utilities  However  my title also suggests that I hate the stocks  Although this is true  it is only because I consider both excessively overvalued relative to their great fundamentals  Therefore  if I were to find them attractively valued again in the future  as I am basically certain I will  I will be a ready and willing buyer of either or both 
FAST Graphs Analyze Out Loud Video  NextEra Energy Inc  and WEC Energy Group Inc 
In the following analyze out loud video I will clearly illustrate why I believe that both utilities are significantly overvalued  Conversely  I will clearly also illustrate what great businesses both are  and how well they have both historically been run  Therefore  and the most important objective of this article  is to simply provide the reader the awareness of the risk associated with investing in either of them today 

NextEra Energy Inc  and WEC Energy Group Inc  are both great utilities and both have excellent prospects for future operating performance  However  thanks to the current bull market and very positive investor sentiment  I consider both significantly overvalued  Most importantly  I am suggesting that neither represents a good candidate for fresh money at their current levels  On the other hand  if you have been a long term holder of either  I am not necessarily suggesting that they be immediately sold  Nevertheless  I am suggesting that you be aware of their current high valuations and pay close attention to what might be occurring in the future

139595,361110,NEE,How To Double Your Money Every 3 Years With Safe Dividend Stocks,opinion,"If you want to clobber the stock market   and double your money every two or three years   then buying companies with accelerating dividends is an absolute must 
And I ve got good news for you  there s never been a better time to buy them 
That s because dividend growth is on a sugar high  research firm IHS Markit recently predicted that global dividends would jump 10  this year a new record 
What s more  if you re looking to grow your nest egg fast  you re in luck  because accelerating dividends are the beating heart of my personal 3 step system for banking 12  annual returns for life 
I ll tell you all about this safe  simple approach  and why that 12  number is vital  in just a moment  First  let s talk about why I m so focused on an accelerating payout 
Getting a fatter income stream is an obvious reason  but it s just the start  Because as I wrote in December  a rising payout acts like a lever on a company s share price  prying it higher and higher with every single dividend hike 
The pattern is plain as day in this chart of NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE   a supposedly  boring  utility that s been quietly sending its shareholders bigger and bigger dividend checks over the past five years 
Look at how NEE s stock has jumped with each and every dividend hike NextEra has delivered and how its latest monster payout hikes have magnified those gains 
Bigger Dividend Hike  Fatter Share Price Pop
NextEra just delivered a 13  dividend hike earlier this year  But you and I can do even better 
We ll start by looking at each part of my 3 step  accelerating dividend strategy   designed to uncover the stocks that will deliver that 12  annual return we re craving 
Why 12   That s because  as I show you in my in depth investment report   The Simple  and Safe  Way to Earn 12  Every Year From Stocks   it s enough to double your portfolio every 6 years and throw off a dividend stream that s 3 times larger than the experts say you need in retirement 
That s more than good enough for a risk averse dividend fan like me  So let s get going  starting with 
Step 1  Build Your Own High Yields
Plenty of dividend hounds simply run out and find the stock paying a high current dividend yield  6   7   8  and more  and call it a day 
But that can be a recipe for disaster 
Take telecom provider CenturyLink  NYSE CTL   which is getting a lot of headlines these days because of its ridiculous 12 3  yield  But that s entirely because  as I told you back in November  the shares have been walloped  as you calculate dividend yield by dividing the annual payout into the current share price   Check out how the dividend yield has risen as the share price has dropped through the floor 
CTL  The  Dividend Trap  Is Set
This is a textbook example of why you re often safer with a lower yielding stock that grows the yield on your initial buy over time 
Let s again consider NextEra for a moment  if you d bought that stock five years ago  you d be pocketing a nice 5 5  on your original buy today  thanks to the company s accelerating payouts  That s more than double NEE s current yield of 2 8  
Or better yet  you could go with a stock like Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX   which dropped a fat 120  dividend hike on shareholders in March and has plenty of room for even bigger raises  thanks to another misunderstood measure  2  actually  I ll show you now 
Step 2  Know Your Ratios 
If you ve been buying dividend stocks for a while  you probably know about the payout ratio  You calculate it by dividing the total amount of dividends paid out by the company s last 12 months of net income 
If the result comes out to  say  50  or less  you ve got a safe dividend that s likely to grow  As you get climb closer to 100   the noose around the payout gets tighter 
Simple  right 
Problem is  earnings are an accounting creation and can be easily manipulated to overstate cash flow generation  But they can  at times  understate it  too 
Right now  for example  Lam has a net income based payout ratio of 15 9   That sounds great  but it doesn t tell the whole story  because the company s free cash flow payout ratio clocks in at a minuscule 12 3  
Why the difference 
Because free cash flow  FCF  tells you how much cash a company is generating once it s paid the cost of maintaining and growing its business  You calculate it by subtracting capital expenditures from cash flow from operating activities 
The bottom line is that FCF is a much better snapshot of how much cash a company is truly making  And while Lam gets a fantastic grade on both ratios  its higher net income based payout ratio masks its even higher dividend growing power  And that s why I expect more massive payout hikes out of this stock for years to come 
By the way  this is precisely the opposite of the almost certain payout cut our long suffering CenturyLink investors can expect  That company s FCF payout ratio is 128  so it s paying out way more in dividends than it generates in FCF 
Step 3  Buy Growth Instead of  Bond Proxies 
Lazy financial writers like to say that higher bond yields will hurt dividend stocks  This blanket statement may sound reasonable  but it ll cost you money if you take it at face value 
Pundits have called sleepy dividend stocks like General Mills  NYSE GIS   bond proxies  in recent times  GIS has paid 3   more or less  over the last three years  That compared favorably with the 10 year Treasury note  which paid 2   more or less  over that time period 
So  the story goes  investors had been buying stocks like GIS instead of safe bonds like Treasuries to scrape an extra 1  or so  But with Treasuries rallying to 3   these same investors have  demanded  a higher yield from GIS  It now pays 4 6   which means its stock price has dropped as the Treasury s price has risen 
Bonds and Their Proxies  Like Oil and Water
This is a waste of time  It begs the question 
Who the heck was buying GIS for an extra stinking percent per year  Not contrarian income seekers 
Green Giant peas  Cheerios  Seriously  This company dominates food staples of yesterday  GIS is behind the curve on every current food trend  The numbers don t lie   it s been evident in the firm s slowing dividend growth and falling revenue 
Beware the Slowing Dividend
What does GIS have to do with dividend growth tomorrow  Not much 
Remember  share prices tend to move higher with their payouts  So there s a simple way to maximize our returns and hedge against higher interest rates  Buy the dividends that are growing the fastest 
Let s take internet landlord CoreSite Realty Corporation  NYSE COR   Its dividend has  lapped  GIS over the last three years  No matter how much trash the bond market talks  it will never catch this runaway yield 
Proxy  Please 
When Hidden Yields subscribers bought CoreSite on my recommendation in March 2016  it paid a  0 53 quarterly dividend  That was a 3 1  starting yield for us based on our purchase price 
In less than two years  the firm has nearly doubled its dividend  It now pays  0 98 per quarter  which means we re earning more than 5 8  on our initial capital 
Plus as our income stream was rising  other investors were bidding up the price of our shares to keep pace with the increasing yields 
This combination of rising dividends and capital appreciation is what earned us 73  total returns in just 26 months   with no active trading beyond our initial purchase  
CoreSite Cooks the Bond Proxies
The 10 year s yield is up about 1  since we bought CoreSite  Our stock gains haven t been slowed by the bond bully because our dividend simply outran it 
And there are plenty of dividend growth stocks like CoreSite ready to run 70   80  and even 100   higher in the year or two ahead  Seven are particularly compelling buys today  to be specific

139643,361158,NEE,Southern Company Inks  6 5B Divestment Deal To Reduce Debt,opinion,Southern Company   NYSE SO   recently inked a deal to divest stakes in several of its Florida assets to the U S  based wholesale electricity supplier  NextEra Energy  Inc    NYSE NEE    in a bid to strengthen its financials  Atlanta based electric utility  Southern Company will sell its Gulf Power Company  Florida City Gas  along with interests in the Oleander and Stanton natural gas plants in a deal valued  6 5 billion   Post the announcement of the deal  shares of Southern Company have moved up 1 66  to close at  43 44 on May 21  Meanwhile  shares of NextEra have edged up 2 41  to eventually close at  160 22  The deal seems to be a win win for both the companies  While the move will help NextEra to expand and diversify its operations  it will address Southern Company s leverage issues at the same time Deal DetailsThe total transaction value is estimated at around  6 5 billion  This includes  5 1 billion in cash  which is expected to be financed by the issuance of new debt  Moreover  NextEra will also assume the  1 4 billion debt burden of Gulf Power  raising the total consideration to  6 5 billion NextEra will be acquiring the Florida based utility  Gulf Power  which serves around 450 000 customers in eight counties in Northwest Florida  Further  it will also purchase Florida City Gas  which supplies natural gas to approximately 111 000 residential and commercial consumers in four counties along the state s East Coast Apart from these holdings  NextEra will buy Southern Company s entire stake in Oleander Plant   a 791 MW gas fired simple cycle combustion turbine power plant   which the latter purchased from Constellation Energy Group in 2005  The cash starved Southern Company will also jettison its 65  stake in the Stanton Energy Centre   a gas fired combined cycle plant   to NextEra  Both Oleander and Stanton Plants have dual fuel power  with distillate as the backup fuel Subject to approvals from Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  and Federal Trade Commission  the acquisition of Gulf Power and Stanton Oleander facilities is set for closure in the first half of 2019  On the other hand  subject to Federal Trade Commission s approval  the Florida City Gas buyout is likely to close by the third quarter of 2018 Deal Rationale for Southern CompanyThe deal is likely to be a prudent strategy for Southern Company  which is grappling with elevated leverage along with cost overruns in two of its large construction projects  Vogtle and Kemper  Notably  the company  which spent around  12 billion for the AGL Resources  NYSE GAS  buyout in 2016 to expand and diversify its offerings  is heading toward the retrenchment road  weighed by its financial struggles  As of Mar 31  the company s long term debt stood at  44 4 billion  representing a debt to capital ratio of more than 63  The company suffered a massive loss last year when Mississippi Public Service Commission ordered Southern Company s subsidiary  Mississippi Power Company  to suspend all coal gasification operations in the Kemper project  thus converting it to a natural gas project  Originally estimated at around  3 billion  the project s cost ballooned to  7 3 billion  affecting its commercial viability and balance sheet  The Vogtle project is also being bankrolled with more than  8 billion in federal loans and loan guarantees  The project s cost is soaring to  25 million  thereby increasing its credit risk  With Southern Company winning Georgia PSC s nod for the construction of the Vogtle plant in December 2017  the divestiture deal will enable the company to sharpen its focus on the first U S  nuclear project in decades With the divestiture deal  Southern Company will also be able to streamline its portfolio  boost utility returns  along with raise cash to repay debts and pay for the new reactors  The sale eliminates the overhang of its equity needs by helping the company reduce  3 billion from the amount it is required to raise in the next three years  In fact  the company is planning to offload its interests in its solar projects as well as raise another  1 billion  It is also seeking  1 billion in third party tax equity financing for its wind projects Thus  apart from bolstering its financial strength  the deal will streamline Southern Company s portfolio and enable the company to forge ahead with its Vogtle Project more effectively  With limited cash flow and large amounts of investment to make  the deal would provide some relief to the company Deal Benefits to NextEraThe deal has enabled Next Era  America s most valuable power company  to significantly progress with its strategic expansion  The deal will further enhance its long term growth prospects in a space  in which it already has a command The acquired assets  including the regulated electric and natural gas franchises  serve as a complementary fit to NextEra s existing portfolio in Florida  The assets  which are a perfect geographic and strategic fit  will lead to several commercial  financial and operational synergies Upon closure  the deal is likely to be immediately accretive to NextEra s earnings  As a result  the company raised its adjusted EPS guidance for 2020 and 2021 by 15 cents and 20 cents  respectively The company  which has a long term track record of delivering value to its shareholders  is likely to continue its momentum  going forward  NextEra expects to maintain  5  7 billion of excess balance sheet capacity  post the completion of the deal and is likely to witness an upgrade in its credit ratings Zacks Rank and Key PicksCurrently  Southern Company carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Southern Company  The  Price    Some better ranked

139669,361184,NEE,Utilities Banking On Shift To Clean Sources For Future Growth,opinion,"The utility sector is currently undergoing a transition as the primary fuel source  coal  is being replaced by natural gas  and we could notice increased usage of clean energy to produce electricity  The new U S  administration s coal friendly moves will definitely lead to some of the coal based utility plants running for a longer time period than expected 
We advocate that there needs to be a balance between emission control and clean energy generation  A constructive utility rate environment  increase in electricity production from natural gas and renewables  and supporting clean coal powered projects will enable utilities to efficiently serve a larger customer base 
In the segment below  we discuss the basic strengths of the utility sector 
Transition Toward Cleaner Source
Utility operators are gradually changing the source of electricity production  Abundant cheap natural gas and declining installation costs of renewable sources like solar and wind are acting as tailwinds for the sector  The regulated utilities are also getting ample support from the administration to shut down old and less profitable fossil fuel plants and replace them with more technologically sound new generation units 
The U S  Energy Information Administration s   EIA   report indicates that the share of U S  total utility scale electricity generation from renewable sources will increase from less than 17  in 2017 to 17  in 2018 and increase to 18  in 2019  EIA expects natural gas to generate nearly 34  of U S  electricity in 2018 and 2019  up from 32  in 2017  while coal is expected to contribute 29  in 2018 and 2019  down from 27  from 2017  The above prediction from EIA indicates the preference to or against the legislation supporting the usage of coal 
Increase in Infrastructure Resilience
Due to its geographical location  the United States is battered by tropical storms  cyclones  extreme cold weather and hurricanes  Natural disaster disturbs normal day to day life including utility services 
Utilities are investing steadily to upgrade and strengthen their existing transmission and distribution lines  Usage of technology for the maintenance of wide spread electric lines helps to lower the possibility of power outages  Strengthening infrastructure will help utilities serve their expanding customer base efficiently and effectively 
Extensive R D   Extension of ITC PTC
In their pursuit of improving the standard of services  utility operators have steadily invested in research and development  R D   They have introduced new smart meters and strengthened their transmission and distribution lines  which helped in the efficient usage of energy 
Utility operators are also benefiting from the ongoing research in the solar photovoltaic sector  Solar energy is a growing alternate energy source and the new solar cells with higher conversion rates allow operators to generate more power from fewer solar panels  This enables the operators to lower the cost of generating power from alternate sources as these are generally more expensive than fossil fuel sources 
In addition  the utility friendly moves of the U S  administration through the extension of the validity period of Solar Energy Investment Tax Credit  ITC  and Wind Energy Production Tax Credit  PTC  will help the companies  We will see more utility scale solar and wind projects coming up  which will boost green power generation 
Thanks to the backing from government  EIA expects wind generation capacity to increase to 735 000 megawatt hours per day  MWh d  by the end of 2018 and 779 000 MWh d by the end of 2019 from 697 000 MWh d in 2017  EIA expects solar generation capacity to increase to 1705 000 megawatt hours per day  MWh d  by the end of 2018 and 198 000 MWh d by the end of 2019 from 145 000 MWh d in 2017 
NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE   NEE  a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock has plans to make long term investment in clean energy assets  NextEra Energy s current renewal energy development program aims at nearly 10 100 16 500 MW of new renewable projects  including wind repowering  online over the 2017 2020 time frame You can see  
Acquisitions   Merger
Utility sector operators don t shy away from merger and acquisition  M A  activities to supplement organic growth  In addition to giving their operations greater scale and scope  such measures also lead to cost synergies and better utilization of resources  The larger the company  the more access it has to funds essential for vital infrastructure upgrades 
We believe that in a mature energy market like the United States  M As represent a sure way of enhancing market share  This expands market reach through the usage of transmission and distribution lines  diversifies the generation portfolio and lowers operating costs through the usage of common back office space 
At the beginning of this year  SCANA Corp   SCG  entered into a merger agreement with Dominion Energy  D   Per the accord  each stock holder of SCANA will likely get 0 669 shares of Dominion  Considering the assumption of  6 7 billion debt of SCANA by Dominion  the transaction is worth roughly  14 6 billion 
We are noticing major deals in the water utility space  American Water Works Company  AWK  entered into a few deals during the first quarter of 2018 and is in talks to acquire a few more this year  While Connecticut Water Service  CTWS  has decided to merge with SJW Group  SJW   citing that the union will be accretive to earnings of each company  and that there will be ample financial flexibility to expand operation and compete with water utility operators in the fragmented industry 
Regular Dividend   Share Buybacks
Utility operators generate more or less stable earnings unless there are severe factors disrupting their operations  The regulated nature of operations provides stability  These operators  in turn  reward their shareholders through the payment of sustainable dividends and share buybacks  This was evident during the economic crisis of 2008 2009 when utilities continued to pay dividends uninterruptedly 
To Sum Up
We notice a transition in the utility sector with more focus on clean energy generation  Stable operations  highly visible revenues and cash flows  combined with the sector s income yield attributes are some of its key defining features 
There is increasing focus on electricity storage facilities that will provide more support to the grid during a peak demand period  Already more than 700 MW of storage facility has been installed in the United States and we expect more storage facility across the country  We also expect more battery storage facility to be added to the system as utilities produce more from renewable sources and continue to let go traditional fossil fuel sources

139671,361186,NEE,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  NextEra Energy  SCANA And Dominion Energy,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   May 3  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Utilities  Part 2  including NextEra Energy   NYSE NEE    SCANA Corp    NYSE SCG   and Dominion Energy   NYSE D   Industry  Utilities  Part 2Link  The utility sector is currently undergoing a transition as the primary fuel source  coal  is being replaced by natural gas  and we could notice increased usage of clean energy to produce electricity  The new U S  administration s coal friendly moves will definitely lead to some of the coal based utility plants running for a longer time period than expected We advocate that there needs to be a balance between emission control and clean energy generation  A constructive utility rate environment  increase in electricity production from natural gas and renewables  and supporting clean coal powered projects will enable utilities to efficiently serve a larger customer base In the segment below  we discuss the basic strengths of the utility sector Transition Toward Cleaner SourceUtility operators are gradually changing the source of electricity production  Abundant cheap natural gas and declining installation costs of renewable sources like solar and wind are acting as tailwinds for the sector  The regulated utilities are also getting ample support from the administration to shut down old and less profitable fossil fuel plants and replace them with more technologically sound new generation units The U S  Energy Information Administration s   EIA   report indicates that the share of U S  total utility scale electricity generation from renewable sources will increase from less than 17  in 2017 to 17  in 2018 and increase to 18  in 2019  EIA expects natural gas to generate nearly 34  of U S  electricity in 2018 and 2019  up from 32  in 2017  while coal is expected to contribute 29  in 2018 and 2019  down from 27  from 2017  The above prediction from EIA indicates the preference to or against the legislation supporting the usage of coal Increase in Infrastructure ResilienceDue to its geographical location  the United States is battered by tropical storms  cyclones  extreme cold weather and hurricanes  Natural disaster disturbs normal day to day life including utility services Utilities are investing steadily to upgrade and strengthen their existing transmission and distribution lines  Usage of technology for the maintenance of wide spread electric lines helps to lower the possibility of power outages  Strengthening infrastructure will help utilities serve their expanding customer base efficiently and effectively Extensive R D   Extension of ITC PTCIn their pursuit of improving the standard of services  utility operators have steadily invested in research and development  R D   They have introduced new smart meters and strengthened their transmission and distribution lines  which helped in the efficient usage of energy Utility operators are also benefiting from the ongoing research in the solar photovoltaic sector  Solar energy is a growing alternate energy source and the new solar cells with higher conversion rates allow operators to generate more power from fewer solar panels  This enables the operators to lower the cost of generating power from alternate sources as these are generally more expensive than fossil fuel sources In addition  the utility friendly moves of the U S  administration through the extension of the validity period of Solar Energy Investment Tax Credit  ITC  and Wind Energy Production Tax Credit  PTC  will help the companies  We will see more utility scale solar and wind projects coming up  which will boost green power generation Thanks to the backing from government  EIA expects wind generation capacity to increase to 735 000 megawatt hours per day  MWh d  by the end of 2018 and 779 000 MWh d by the end of 2019 from 697 000 MWh d in 2017  EIA expects solar generation capacity to increase to 1705 000 megawatt hours per day  MWh d  by the end of 2018 and 198 000 MWh d by the end of 2019 from 145 000 MWh d in 2017 NextEra Energy a Zacks

139692,361207,NEE,Will Solar Import Tariffs Hurt U S  Alternative Energy ,opinion,China s emergence as a global leader of investment in clean energy projects poses serious threat to U S based operators for the Alternative Energy industry  China has been a frontrunner in terms of solar module manufacturing and it has made substantial wind power investments in 2017 to expand its renewables footprint worldwide   While China is vigorously expanding its renewables businesses  the operating environment for the U S renewable industry has been less than helpful given the Trump administration s less than supportive environment  The current administration s actions on the Clean Power Plan in March 2017 and unilateral exit from the Paris climate agreement are part of this unhelpful posture  The imposition of a 30  import tariff on solar panel components will also form part of this unfavorable backdrop  The industry has held up reasonably well so far  but the operating environment in the United States has undoubtedly become far less supportive and helpful  which is essential for a relatively young industry  Stocks in the Zacks Alternative Energy industry are down  5 2  in the year to date period  lagging the S P 500 index s  0 8  decline  While the long term potential of the space is undeniable  the industry is faced with a number of near term challenges that will likely keep these stocks under pressure  We discuss some of these below China s Clean Energy Leadership  China established itself as a global leader by substantial investments in clean energy projects  Indeed  the nation plays a critical role in the global transition toward a clean energy future in an increasingly carbon constrained world  Notably  China installed 50 GW of solar PV in 2017  smashing the 10 6 GW count of the United States  Surely this boosted the prospects of the Chinese solar companies over their American counter parts  Chinese solar module manufacturer Jinko Solar  JKS  maintained its world leading solar module shipments position in 2017  Along with third quarter results  Jinko Solar issued a guidance that called for full year shipment of 9 6 9 8 GW  about 10  of global share  When the company reported its full year result in March 2018  it successfully achieved this target  Going beyond its obvious dominance in solar  the country has become a pioneer in wind power  China Energy Investment Corporation is now the world s largest developer of wind energy  post the acquisition of China Guodian  The companies together intend to invest around  3 5 billion in energy projects  In hydro power as well  China is expanding its international footprint in countries like Nepal  Brazil  Philippines and lately Pakistan  Import Tariff on Solar Modules  In January 2018  the U S  government announced the levy of 30  tariff on import of solar panel components  In four years  time  the tax rate is expected to come down to 15   Following the news  U S  solar stocks moved up buoyed by hopes that such trade restrictions will create jobs for Americans  However  with the passage of time  the solar industry s growth was not sustained as investors seemed to have become skeptical over the long term success of the tariff This was part of Trump s broader protectionist agenda to help U S  manufacturers against foreign producers who flood the market with cheaper solar modules  The U S  administration argued that the Chinese government subsidized solar manufacturers and allowed them to sell products in the United States at less than their fair market value  This resulted in increased price competition among the U S  solar stocks and more than two dozen companies were forced to stall operations  U S  solar industry advocates  however  have been raising strong objections against the move  The U S  Solar Energy Industries Association predicted that the tariff may cut forecasted solar installations in 2018 by nearly 20   to 9 gigawatts from 11 gigawatts  and lead to the loss of 23 000 jobs in the United States  the world s fourth largest solar market after China  Japan and Germany  Research firm Wood Mackenzie also estimated that over the next five years  the tariffs will reduce U S  solar installation growth by 10 15  According to GTM Research  this new tariff is expected to increase solar module costs by 10 12 cents per watt  based on current U S  import prices of 35 to 40 cents per watt  According to an earlier analysis  a 10 cent per watt tariff is expected to slow the solar market by 8 3   No doubt this import tariff  if kept over the long term  will weigh on the U S  solar market that imports more than 80  of its supplies from foreign nations  majorly from China Other Import Tariffs  In March 2018  the Trump administration proposed to impose a 24  tariff on steel imports and a 10  tax on aluminum imports  Now  steel and aluminum are important commodities for critical wind  solar and storage components  According to the U S  Geological Survey  operational aluminum smelters in the United States have declined from 23 in 1993 to five in 2018  So  industries are dependent on imported aluminum and a tariff on the same will have an impact on the renewables industry  GTM Research  MAKE Consulting and Wood Mackenzie collectively calculate the resulting price increase in commodities could potentially result in a 3 5  increase in the levelized cost of energy for U S  renewable power plants  leading to slightly lowered forecasts for project deployments  According to the Solar Energy Industries Association  SEIA   steel and aluminum tariffs could add cost of 2 cents per watt to utility scale solar projects  which is a significant increase on top of what the association sees as  job killing  solar tariffs  Thus  Trump s proposal for steel and aluminum import added to the woes of the U S  alternative energy industry The Trump Effect  The present U S  administration doesn t have a friendly stance toward alternative energy sources  In June 2017  President Trump had announced his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement  Many fear that whatever progress the United States has made last year toward pollution mitigation and renewable assets expansion in accord with the Paris agreement will now be in vain  The current administration issued an executive order to roll back the Clean Power Plan   which was the preceding administration s signature climate policy to curb carbon emissions to 32  below 2005 levels by 2030 at coal fired power plants  The Clean Power Plan had mandated emission reduction goals for the states in order to ensure that the Environmental Protection Agency s overall target was achieved The annulment of the Clean Power Plan  if approved  will lift the ban on coal leasing on federal lands  scrap regulations to curb methane emissions from oil and gas production  and lead to reconsideration of  social cost  of carbon emissions in all regulatory actions  The move will definitely hurt the clean energy space Market Pricing Scenario  In terms of valuation  the industry has always traded at a premium to the broader market  though the magnitude of premium to the market is a lot less than has historically been the case  The Zacks Alternative Energy industry is currently trading at 24 7X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates  Over the last 5 years  the industry has traded as high as 97 3X and as low as 17 6X  with a median of 29 9X  The S P 500 index is currently trading 16 9X forward 12 month EPS estimates  Over the last 5 years  the index has traded as high as 19 1X and as low as 14X  with a median of 17 1X  As such  the industry s relative valuation picture remains favorable  But the aforementioned unhelpful government policy posture will likely continue to cause  multiple compression  going forward  Fed Rate Hike   In March 2018  the Federal Reserve raised rates for the sixth time since the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee began lifting rates off near zero in December 2015  While long term interest rates remain low by historical standards  a material rise in long term interest rates is a key risk for this capital intensive industry that relies heavily on capital markets for access to funds While companies in this space have been benefiting from a low interest rate environment so far  rate hike makes this industry far less appealing  This is because the resulting increase in cost of capital will raise cost of operations for the alternate energy companies  thereby reducing hurting profits New Emerging Technologies  The alternative energy industry remains an emerging sector with a steady focus on lowest cost technology  This may prove disastrous for existing companies riding the solar boom should a cheaper alternative emerge  The industry also has to deal with cost competitiveness from traditional means of electricity generation Limitation of Quantity  Renewable energy technologies totally depend on the weather to generate energy Hydro generators require rains to fill dams to supply flowing water  Wind turbines require strong winds to move the blades  and solar generators have need of clear skies and sunlight to gather heat and generate electricity  When these resources are absent  in the event of weather fluctuations  it hampers the amount of electricity generated  This problem can be solved with energy storage  which leads to additional costs It is difficult to generate large volumes of electricity from renewable sources compared with traditional fossil fuel generators  Solely depending on renewables would either require a reduction in consumption or ramping up of energy facilities  In order to tackle current energy problems  it is necessary to strike a balance between different power sources Stocks to AvoidGiven the looming headwinds  we advise investors against names that offer little growth opportunity over the near term  These include companies for which estimate revision trends reflect a bearish sentiment We remain skeptical of Azure Power Global  AZRE  and Dominion Midstream  DM  which carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Moreover  SunPower Corp  SPWR  and NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  Partners  NEP  have a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   which investors may avoid investing in  You can see  ConclusionChina s leading global position in terms of electricity generation from renewable sources poses competitive threat to the U S  alternative energy industry  The current scenario  where Trump administration seems to be opposing the rise of the industry as is evident from the imposition of the aforementioned tariff  surely lends China a competitive advantage  Of course  importing cheap solar modules from China was hampering the industry to some extent  But since the United States has to rely on these imports  levying heavy duty on these items isn t wise as is evident from the looming trade war tensions  Instead  we suggest the two nations should settle their dispute if they want to progress with the clean energy environment plans  This is because the countries are dependent on each other in terms of trade and slapping high taxes on Chinese manufacturers may do more harm than good for the U S  industry  5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for

AWS generates much higher margins than retail  thus significantly impacting Amazon s profitability  However  increased operating expenses to support expansion of its business into new markets and territories  localize the availability of products and grow its content will keep margins under pressure

139870,361385,NEE,NextEra Energy  NEE  Gains From Clean Energy Investments,opinion,"On Nov 15  2017  we issued an updated research report on NextEra Energy  Inc    NYSE NEE   
The company is benefiting from its focus on clean energy  NextEra Energy has lowered emission levels and is trying to reduce energy bills for customers  However  impacts of unpredictable natural disasters remain a headwind  Notably  its  3 billion infrastructure investment in the last 11 years in Florida has cushioned it against significant electric infrastructure losses 
NextEra Energy s third quarter 2017 adjusted earnings surpassed estimates by 5 7  on the back of solid contribution and investments from its segments   Florida Power   Light Company  FPL  and NextEra Energy Resources  NER  
NextEra Energy is on track with its business strategies  The company makes long term investments in clean energy assets with plans to put in  40  44 billion in projects during 2017 2020  In line with this strategy  the company announced plans to generate an additional 1 400 3 800 megawatt  MW  of solar generation in the United States over the next few years 
NextEra Energy s current renewal energy development program aims at bringing 10 100 16 500 MW of new renewable projects online  including wind repowering  during 2017 2020 
In the last two years  FPL has entered into agreements to shut two independent coal fired power plants  with the aim of saving additional costs for customers  This is expected to result in  183 million in savings for FPL customers and reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions by 5 6 million tons 
However  the company s business is subject to complex federal  state and other regulations  Additionally  its subsidiaries depend on regulatory bodies for rate relief and cost recovery approvals  As a result  NextEra Energy s current capital projects might get hampered by delays  This will lead to cost overruns and hurt the company s profits 
Additionally  the company s subsidiary NEER s dependence on government policies and budgetary constraints may lead to delay and reduced returns through investment losses  Additionally  increasing indirect input costs are also among the other headwinds for the company

4 Excellent Value Picks Based on PEG Ratio

	At a time when volatility strikes every second day  investors often rely on value investing rather than other options like growth or momentum  As soon as other investors start selling their stocks at a cheaper rate in times of market uncertainty  these value investors take this as an opportunity to pick good stocks at a discounted price 

	However  this apparently simple value investment technique has some drawbacks and not understanding the strategy properly may often lead to  value traps   In such a situation  these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems  which once drove the share price down  turn out to be persistent  There are many value investment yardsticks such as dividend yield  P E or P B  which are simple and can single out whether a stock is trading at a discount 

	However  for investors looking to escape such value traps  it is also vital to determine where the stock would be headed in the next 12 to 24 months  Warren Buffett advises these investors to focus on the earnings growth potential of a stock  This is where lies the importance of a not so popular value investing metric  the PEG ratio 

	The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings   Earnings Growth Rate

	A lower PEG ratio is always better for value investors 

	While P E alone fails to identify a true value stock  PEG helps to find the intrinsic value of a stock 

	Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock 

	There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term 

	Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration 

	Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy 

PEG Ratio less than X Industry Median

P E Ratio  using F1  less than X Industry Median   for more accurate valuation purpose 

Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy    Whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 have a proven history of success  

Market Capitalization greater than  1 Billion   This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity  

Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000   A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable  

Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than 5    Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism  suggesting further bullishness  

Value Score of less than or equal to B   Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3  Hold  offer the best upside potential 

	Here are four out of nine stocks that qualified the screening 

Unilever PLC  NYSE       is one of the world s leading suppliers of Food  Home Care  Personal Care and Refreshment products with sales in over 190 countries  Its leading brands in the U S  and Canada include Axe  Becel  Ben   Jerry s  Dove  Lipton  Magnum  Nexxus  Noxzema  Pond s  and Vaseline among many more  The company currently holds a Zacks Rank  1 and has a Value Style Score of  B   The company also has an impressive expected five year growth rate of 12  

NextEra Energy Partners  LP   NYSE        This Florida based growth oriented limited partnership formed by NextEra Energy acquires  manages and owns contracted clean energy projects with stable  long term cash flows  The company also owns interests in wind and solar projects in North America as well as natural gas infrastructure assets in Texas  Apart from a discounted PEG and P E  the stock has a Value Style Score of  A  and holds a Zacks Rank  2  You can see   

Renewable Energy Group  NASDAQ        This is a provider of cleaner  lower carbon intensity products and services  It internationally produces biomass based diesel and develops renewable chemicals  The company also claims to be North America s largest producer of advanced biofuel  The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank  1 and has a Value Style Score of  A   The company also has an impressive long term growth rate of 82  

CAI International  Inc    NYSE        This is a leading transportation finance and logistics company  The company holds a Zacks Rank  1 and has a Value Style Score of  A   The stock also has an impressive earnings growth rate of 19 2  for the next year

140001,361516,NEE,Should Value Investors Consider NextEra Energy  NEP  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  Partners  LP   NYSE NEP   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  NextEra Energy has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 06  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 09  If we focus on the long term PE trend  NextEra Energy s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past two years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Oils Energy sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 34 97  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers However  we should point out that NextEra Energy has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 25 80  so on the ground of the forward earnings estimates  we might say that the company s share price is likely to appreciate in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  NextEra Energy has a P S ratio of about 2 79  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 12 right now  However  as we can see in the chart below  this is above the median for this stock in particular over the past few years NEP is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  NextEra Energy currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes NextEra Energy a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though NextEra Energy might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  D  and a Momentum score of  B   This gives NEP a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and one downward revision in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has remained stable in the past two months  while the full year estimate has risen by 3 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below NextEra Energy Partners  LP Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineNextEra Energy is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among the bottom 28   and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the Zacks Oils Energy  Alternative Energy Other industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name

Here are some of the severe headwinds that the coal industry is up against 
Environmental Legislations  Coal has been losing importance as a fuel source over the last few years  particularly in the U S   in comparison with other sources that are less harmful to the environment  Concerns over the emission of greenhouse gases and global climate change have resulted in the formulation of new legislations and policies which emphasize the use of environment friendly fuel sources  particularly in the power sector 
This has considerably slowed down the expansion of coal fired capacity in the power sector  with utility companies now building new natural gas fired plants and resorting to alternative sources of energy generation like wind  solar and hydro power 
The Trump administration is trying to ease regulations that are hurting the coal industry  Will the U S  be able to work in isolation ignoring the emission agreements directed at benefiting everyone   The answer to this question actually holds the key to the coal industry s prospects

Natural Gas Substituting Coal  A major substitute for coal in energy generation is another fossil fuel  natural gas  Coal is being dumped in favor of natural gas  which due to extensive exploration and production  and a shale gas boom in onshore U S   is witnessing significantly lower prices than in the past 
Natural gas is an attractive choice for new generating plants because of its relative fuel efficiency  low emissions  quick construction timelines and low capital costs  This trend is encouraging power generating utilities to not only convert their existing plants to gas fired ones but to build new units 
The U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  expects natural gas to contribute to 32  of the total energy generation in 2017  while coal represents 31   However  in 2018  the share of natural gas is expected to improve 33  while coal s share will remain unchanged 
Besides power generation  natural gas is being utilized in new projects in the fertilizer and chemical sectors 
Competition from Alternative Energy Sources  Apart from natural gas  the coal industry has been losing a major share of its electric generation demand to renewable sources of energy  Usage of alternate energy is on the rise  with more utility scale solar projects being commissioned across the country 
The EIA report reveals combined electricity generation from conventional hydroelectric and renewable will reach 1 753 billion KWh per day in 2017  exhibiting growth of 5 9  from 2016 levels  The production from the alternate sources is anticipated to reach 1 845 billion KWh per day in 2018  reflecting growth of 5 2

Rising Competition  Stronger Dollar  Besides competition from renewables and natural gas  U S  coal producers are also affected by rising export from Indonesia and Australia as well as a stronger dollar  which is making this commodity dearer in the international markets  International players enjoy the benefit of low mining and transportation costs  consequently making the coal cheaper than their American peers

140029,361544,NEE,4 Excellent Value Picks Based On PEG Ratio,opinion,At a time when volatility strikes every second day  investors often rely on value investing rather than other options like growth or momentum  As soon as other investors start selling their stocks at a cheaper rate in times of market uncertainty  these value investors take this as an opportunity to pick good stocks at a discounted price However  this apparently simple value investment technique has some drawbacks and not understanding the strategy properly may often lead to  value traps   In such a situation  these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems  which once drove the share price down  turn out to be persistent  There are many value investment yardsticks such as dividend yield  P E or P B  which are simple and can single out whether a stock is trading at a discount However  for investors looking to escape such value traps  it is also vital to determine where the stock would be headed in the next 12 to 24 months  Warren Buffett advises these investors to focus on the earnings growth potential of a stock  This is where lies the importance of a not so popular value investing metric  the PEG ratio The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings   Earnings Growth RateA lower PEG ratio is always better for value investors While P E alone fails to identify a true value stock  PEG helps to find the intrinsic value of a stock Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP E Ratio  using F1  less than X Industry Median  for more accurate valuation purpose Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 have a proven history of success  Market Capitalization greater than  1 Billion  This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity  Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable  Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than 5   Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism  suggesting further bullishness  Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3  Hold  offer the best upside potential  Here are four out of nine stocks that qualified the screening Unilever  LON ULVR  PLC

140185,361700,NEE,PPL Corporation  PPL  Q2 Earnings  Stock To Disappoint ,opinion,"Diversified utility PPL Corporation   NYSE PPL   is scheduled to report second quarter results on Aug 9  before the market opens  Last quarter  the company s earnings witnessed a negative earnings surprise of 10 67   Let s see how things are shaping up for this quarter 
Factors to Consider
The RIIO ED1 price control spanning from 2015 2023 has set limits on the revenues that utilities can collect in the UK  while mandating installation of pollution control technologies at the power stations  This will likely hurt PPL Corporation s margins in the second quarter by 10 cents a share  However  this decrease should be partially offset by the rate increase approved under RIIO ED1  which will add 5 cents per share to the bottom line 
A portion of the 10 megawatt E W  Brown solar plant in Kentucky started operations in April this year  thereby expanding its renewable generation fleet and this is expected to positively impact results in the second quarter  The plant is expected to be fully operational in the second half of 2016 
Moreover  above average temperatures in its service territories in the U S are expected to drive its topline 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that PPL Corporation will beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  1 89   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 52 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 53 cents PPL CORP Price and EPS Surprise
   Zacks Rank  Though PPL Corporation s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  its negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks  4 or  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

140257,361772,NEE,How To Find The Best Contrarian Stocks,opinion,"Why does everyone want to be contrarian  It is the best way for long term investors to beat the market  You can be a trader of popular momentum stocks  but you need to be agile in your timing 
Contrarian investing is rewarding for investors with discipline and the right temperament  Here are four rules 

Forget about what you read in the newspaper or see on financial television  This is what we call  old news   People who appear are attempting to sound smart by telling you things that reinforce what you already know 
Find a theme that is difficult to see  Contrast it with something that is easy to see 
Look for the best  or worst  ETF choices for these themes  Single out the best  or worst  stocks in the sector 
Verify your analysis with data 

A Current Example 
Often  the best way to explain an idea is to provide examples  Let s repeat the four points above with our examples in mind 

There is a daily media assault on banks  Government regulation is reducing profits  The yield curve is too flat  Energy companies might go bankrupt  and reserves might be too small  It is going to be 2008 all over again   Old news   and also inaccurate  
The long running quest for yield has induced investors to focus on dividend yield rather than the strength of the underlying investment  The yield is easy to see  The risk is not 
The financial sector is attractive  utilities are not  Focusing on regional banks permits you to avoid some of the government attention to big banks and also minimize energy exposure  The regional bank ETF  SPDR S P Regional Banking  NYSE KRE   is a good choice  By contrast  very bad sectors should be on your  sell  list  Utilities have rallied strongly in the reach for yield  The Utilities Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLU  ETF is the popular choice in this category  having risen to over valued territory 
We can now pick some attractive trading candidates  Due diligence starts  but does not end  with a trip to F A S T  Graphs  Depending upon the stock and sector  you may need to dig deep  F A S T  Graphs has plenty of additional information  but check out other sources as well 

Since economic growth is under rated and interest rates are likely  finally  to move higher  my long and short candidates both reflect this  Most people do not realize how far the quest for yield has stretched the valuations for utilities  Meanwhile  banks are hated 
We investigated regional banks  looking at factors like tangible book  important for banks and hard to find  and identified several for our basic stock program   I was not surprised when a leading investor was interviewed on CNBC  mention six banks out of hundreds  Our three choices were on his list   One pick is KeyCorp  NYSE KEY   Earnings growth is 16  and the multiple is below 12  Meanwhile  you collect a dividend of 2 7 


While we do not do short selling of individual stocks or ETFs in our programs  investors should be worried about utilities  including XLU  Check out the stock that represents almost 9  of the ETF   NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  The stock has an earnings growth rate of about 6  and a P E of 20  The yield is 2 9   only slightly higher than our regional bank example  It is like owning a 100 year bond  Owners will get crushed by a modest increase in interest rates  as the stock price falls to maintain a yield differential over Treasury notes 


Conclusion 
Contrarian investing is not easy  You will not hear the TV pundits praising your stocks   at least not at first  You also would like to have a catalyst that will change the public perception  In this case  a small increase in interest rates will start the ball rolling 
Only the greatest succeed in spotting where the puck is going  That is the challenge  If you aspire to beat the market  you need to think ahead ",2016-06-08,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/finding-the-best-contrarian-stocks-200134861,200134861

	Earnings decreased 3  from 99 cents per share a year ago  The decline was primarily due to mild weather in its service territories and the absence of a farmout agreement 







	GAAP earnings were 88 cents per share compared with 91 cents per share in the year ago quarter  The difference between GAAP and operating earnings in the reported quarter was due to one time adjustments of 8 cents Total Revenues

Our View
	Dominion s earnings were in line with expectation  However  milder weather led to a year over year decline in earnings 
	The company is nonetheless well poised with regard to organic and inorganic growth strategies  Construction of the 1 358 megawatt natural gas combined cycle facility and the Cove Point liquefaction project are progressing as per schedule and budget  These projects will help in the long term earnings growth of the company  The extension of the investment tax credit will also benefit Dominion s solar facilities 
	In the reported quarter  Dominion served more customers across all customer classes than the year ago quarter  the only exception being industrial  Overall  customer volume increased 0 9  year over year  which will definitely have a positive impact on Dominion s performance in the future

Our proven model does not conclusively show that NextEra Energy will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at  1 37 
Zacks Rank  Though NextEra Energy s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks  4 or  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Here are a few operators in the utility electric power sector worth considering on the basis of our model  which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Spark Energy  Inc    NASDAQ SPKE   has an Earnings ESP of  53 57  and a Zacks Rank  1  The company is expected to report first quarter 2016 results on May 11 
TECO Energy  Inc    NYSE TE   has an Earnings ESP of  3 70  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is expected to report first quarter 2016 results on May 5 before the market opens

140319,361834,NEE,Can We Really Trust Nike s Stock Price  ,opinion,"Introduction
One of the most common mistakes that I see common stock investors make is failing to formulate the important distinction between a company and its publicly traded stock  There are many great companies out there with fabulous stories surrounding their wonderful businesses  As a result  it can be very easy to fall so much in love with a great company that you can t resist investing in the stock even when the valuation is extreme 
Often when a company s business is doing well  its stock becomes popular with investors  Pundits tend to like popular stocks and often write glowing reports and reviews about the company and how well its business is doing  Ironically  for the most part what is written about the business itself may be true and accurate  Writers will talk about things like how the company is increasing sales and earnings  how it has low debt and strong cash flows  improving margins and returns on equity or invested capital and the list goes on  And since all these accolades and positives about the business  the company  might actually be true  investors can get quite excited about investing in the company s stock 
On the other hand  even when business is strong  a company s stock price can get ahead of its fundamentals  When that happens  no matter how strong the business is  the stock enters the realm of becoming a risky and poor long term investment opportunity  However  it s important to acknowledge and understand that when a stock has momentum  its price can continue to run over the shorter term  But eventually  the day of reckoning must  and will  come  When it happens  you don t want to be the greater fool holding the bag 
Additionally  it is an indisputable fact that the stock market often mis appraises companies at least over short periods of time  History is full of examples such as the tech bubble that ran from the mid 1990s to 2000 where we saw high profile technology companies trading at obscenely high P E ratios  valuations  of 200 times earnings or more  And of course  it wasn t long before the bubble burst and the stock prices of those same high profile tech stocks literally collapsed 
Consequently  I can t believe the notion that the stock market is efficient  nor do I believe that everything that can be known about a stock is always factored into the price  However  I do believe that the market is continuously seeking efficiency  Therefore  when a stock is being improperly valued based on fundamentals  you can be sure that it will eventually and inevitably move back towards its intrinsic value in the longer run  The exact timing is an unknown  but common sense dictates that nosebleed valuations cannot hold forever 
Finally  the primary reason that it s important to make the distinction between the company and the stock is actually very straightforward  The operating results generated by the business behind the stock  is something that management has some control over  In contrast  the market price that Mr  Market applies to the shares of its stock is not directly controlled by the company s management  In short  management can run the business poorly or well  but they have virtually no control over the stock market and the price  or value  it places on their shares 
Nike  NYSE NKE  s Exceptional Operating History
As the following earnings and dividends F A S T  Graphs  on Nike for fiscal years 2000 2010 vividly reveals  Nike the business performed exceptionally well  Earnings growth was very reliable and consistent  and averaged over 15  per annum  Nike s dividend over that time frame also followed suit  averaging 15  growth and a similar compound annual growth rate  CAGR  of 14 5  

The above graph clearly supports the undeniable reality that Nike was a wonderful and superbly run business over this timeframe  Importantly  Mr  Market recognized Nike s superior business results to the extent that it was willing to generally apply an above average valuation to their shares  As the following graph depicts it was quite common to see Nike trading at a P E multiple of 19 20  normal P E ratio of 19 3  depicted by the blue line on the graph  or higher over this timeframe  I refer to this as a  quality premium valuation   and Nike has historically been a quintessential example  and arguably deservedly so 
However  the same graph also reveals short periods of time when Nike s stock price was valued below its normal premium  and conversely  short periods when it was priced higher than its normal premium  This offers clear evidence that the market has not always been efficiently pricing Nike shares 

Lessons on Valuation
By taking advantage of the return calculation functionality of F A S T  Graphs  we can run calculations and then analyze and evaluate the impact that valuation has had on long term returns  With my first example I calculate the long term performance when investing in Nike at the very beginning of the timeframe and at the highest valuation that the stock traded at over this period of time 
Here we discover something quite remarkable  Even if you invested in Nike at its worst possible valuation  you would have still achieved very attractive long term returns exceeding 9  per annum  This calculation suggests that within reason you cannot overpay for a great business and lose money  as long as you re willing to hold it long enough  On the other hand  few investors can show such fortitude once the company s stock price starts falling  as it did from the summer of 1999 to the spring of 2000 in the case of Nike  That kind of stock behavior will typically cause most investors to turn an unrealized loss into a realized one by selling out 

On the other hand  with this next calculation I again purchase Nike at its highest valuation  but this time I run my calculation only out to calendar year end 2002  That is more than three calendar years later  and up to that time buy and hold investors would have suffered a 27  loss of principal or a total loss of 8 61  annually  This calculation adds further support to the question  Would investors be willing to continue holding Nike after suffering such extended losses over such an extended period of time in order to eventually achieve the long term returns depicted above  Personally  I doubt that many would 

With my next example I calculate the returns that a patient investor that was only prudently willing to invest when fair value was manifest would have achieved  In this case  the prudent investor would only have had to wait approximately 7 months to find this superb company trading at fair value  the price touching the orange earnings justified valuation line  
What s truly fascinating about this is the reality that doing so would double the compound annual long term return from approximately 9  to 18   Even more interesting is the fact that this prudent behavior would have only caused this investor to miss out on less than a dime s worth of total dividends per share over the long run  And of course  they would have been saved from the more than three years of angst and worry caused by the falling stock price reverting to the fair valuation mean 
I believe this analysis clearly supports and validates not only the importance  but the great benefits of paying attention to valuation before investing in stocks  Succinctly stated  valuation matters a lot 

What If Anything Has Changed to Justify Nike s Current Valuation 
With this next earnings and price correlated graph I extend the timeframe to current time  Here we immediately are presented with vivid evidence that Nike s stock valuation has changed dramatically starting in the spring of 2013  red circle   Since that time  Nike s valuation has greatly exceeded the long term historical normal valuation that the market had previously applied  the dark blue line on the graph   To me  this immediately poses a vitally important question  What if anything about the business has changed to justify Nike s current valuation 

Let s examine the facts to see if this higher valuation is justified  If this higher valuation is justified it would be logical to assume that we would see significantly accelerated improvements in important fundamentals  For example  we should expect to see rapidly increasing revenues  earnings and or dividend growth   to name just a few important fundamental metrics  Common sense dictates that there must be some important and powerful fundamental catalyst to support Nike s higher valuations 
Importantly  if there hasn t been any material improvement or change with Nike s fundamentals  then we must assume that the market has been recently improperly valuing the stock  If that is the case  then we can also further assume that Nike s elevated stock price is emotionally driven rather than fundamentally based  The problem with emotionally driven valuations is that they can be quite fickle  whereas fundamental values are more permanent and reliable  Therefore  let s examine some of the important underlying fundamentals to see if we can see any significant improvements 
Gross Profit Margin Net Profit Margin
Utilizing the soon to be launched new and improved FUN Graphs  fundamental underlying numbers  let s first examine Nike s gross  gpm  and net profit margins  npm   Here we see a continuation of operating consistency and excellence  but not much in the way of a major change or improvement 

Return On Equity Return on Invested Capital
When we examine Nike s returns on equity  roe  and return on invested capital  roi   we again see great consistency  However  once again there is no abnormal or significant improvement in recent years  just more of the same 

Revenues and Earnings Before Interest and Taxes
Nike s revenues  rev  continue to increase as they historically have  and revenue growth for fiscal year ending in May  2014 was strong  but again nothing unusual for this great company 

Share Buyback Activity
There is one fundamental that I consider a negative  and that is Nike s recent share buyback activity  As I indicated in my recent article found here  share buybacks can be a good thing when stock valuations are low  and they can be a bad thing when valuations are high  as they clearly are with Nike today  Consequently  I find Nike s recent share buyback activity a concern  Reducing common shares outstanding  csho  with Nike s stock valuation so high could lead to a future destruction in shareholder capital 

Future Expectations for Nike s Earnings
Next  let s examine Nike s recent past and potential future earnings growth to see if we can find anything about Nike s operating results that have made the company so much more valuable  I am confident that earnings growth is one of the most important drivers of long term results  and the above graphics correlating Nike s historical earnings and price relationship validate my confidence  In the long run  price follows earnings  More importantly  the historical rate of change of earnings growth is the primary long term determinant of total return 
Utilizing the  Select Pre calculated GR   historical earnings growth rates  drop down on the F A S T  Graphs  Historical CAGR  compound annual growth rate  forecasting calculator we can easily and quickly review Nike s historical earnings growth rates over every period of time going back 19 years 
As we analyze Nike s historical earnings growth rate achievements  we discover that Nike s earnings growth rates over recent periods of time have moderately decelerated  see highlights  rather than accelerated  Nothing alarming  and recent growth has still been quite good  but no obvious catalyst or significant improvement to support Nike s current higher valuation 

Consensus Analyst Estimates
Utilizing the F A S T  Graphs   Analyst Scorecard  we discover that the record of analysts  forecasts one year forward and two year forward over the past two decades on Nike have been exceptional  Nike has either beat or met consensus estimates virtually 100  of the time  Consequently  as we next examine future analyst estimates  we can have some confidence that the estimates may be reasonably reliable 

The consensus of leading analysts reporting on Nike to S P 500 Capital IQ expect average estimated earnings growth of 15 3  out to fiscal year end 5 31 2017  This is a strong growth rate and slightly in excess of its recent historical average growth rates  However  if Nike were to trade at an earnings justified fair value P E of 15 3  P E   earnings growth  the annual rate of loss would be almost 17   16 76  see red circle   This represents the potential risk of holding Nike at such an elevated valuation 

Based on the same consensus earnings estimates  but assuming that Nike is awarded its normal historical quality premium valuation  P E   21  the dark blue line on the graph   shareholders would still be exposed to a potential annualized loss of 3 23   Both this estimate and the one above illustrate the potential risk of holding Nike at its current high valuation 

Summary and Conclusions
Nike is and has been one of my favorite companies for a very long time  However  as a stickler for fair valuation  I have had few opportunities to find the stock at fair value  Although I don t own Nike today  I did have the good fortune to invest in it when I found it at fair value  P E ratio 15  in February  2006  I held the stock until October  2010 and enjoyed a total annual rate of return of 16  
Nevertheless  even though Nike had only moved back to its historical normal P E ratio of 20  like most investors the trauma from the Great Recession of 2008 was still fresh in my mind  Therefore  I was of the mindset to de risk my stock investments  As a result  I took my excellent profits and looked for alternative high quality dividend growth stocks with better current yields and lower valuations 
Fortunately  I found NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  available at a P E ratio below 13 with a current yield above 3   Therefore  I traded my Nike with its P E ratio of 20 and a 1 5  dividend yield for NextEra Energy  Of course  Nike has continued to advance since I sold out  and therefore  one could argue that I left a lot of money on the table 
However  my replacement investment into NextEra Energy has also performed well and only slightly less than had I held onto my Nike  On the other hand  I also believe I took a lot less risk and received a significantly higher dividend than I would have gotten with Nike  Therefore  I don t consider selling Nike a mistake  especially considering its current high valuation 
The moral of the story is simple and straightforward  Nike is unquestionably a great company  has been for some time and probably will continue to be so in the future  However  since price is what you pay and value is what you get  I don t believe that the stock is a good investment at current levels  As investors  it s important to separate the company from the stock  A great company can be a risky and even a poor investment if valuation is too high  as I believe it currently is with Nike
