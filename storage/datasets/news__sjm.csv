over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but sales were soft  Results were hurt by persistent softness in premium dog food offerings and the divestiture of the U S  baking business  among other factors  To top it  management slashed sales and earnings guidance for fiscal 2020 Consequently  shares of the company were down about 2  during the pre market trading session Quarter in DetailAdjusted earnings of  2 26 per share rose 4  year over year and comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 13  The year over year increase can be attributable to lower interest expenses and a reduced tax rate The J  M  Smucker Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Net sales of the company amounted to  1 957 8 million  which missed the consensus mark of  1 987 million  Moreover  the top line dropped 3 2  year over year  mainly due to the divestiture of the U S  baking business and currency headwinds  Excluding these factors  the top line declined 1  due to lower net price realization  Volume mix was flat year over year Although Smucker s sales were affected by persistent softness in premium dog food offerings  management is pleased with the performance of the rest of the portfolio  Notably  Smucker maintained solid momentum at its cat food and pet snacks businesses and the Uncrustables brand  Also  the company saw improved market share for its high growth coffee

operating margin contracted 60 basis points to 20  Segment PerformanceU S  Retail Pet Foods  Segment sales came in at  709 9 million  which dropped 2  from the prior year quarter s figure owing to lower private label sales and reduced volume mix  Private label sales were hurt by planned exits as well as weakness at various retailers  However  improved net price realization offered some respite U S  Retail Consumer Foods  Net sales declined 8  to  426 1 million  due to the divestiture of the baking business  Excluding the non comparable results  sales in the segment fell 1  on reduced net pricing  somewhat compensated by improved volume mix U S  Retail Coffee Market  Sales in the segment were flat at  543 4 million  as lower net price realization was offset by favorable volume mix International and Away From Home  Net sales decreased 3  from the prior year quarter to  278 4 million  thanks to adverse volume mix  impacts from the divestiture of the U S  baking business and currency headwinds  Net price realization was neutral in the quarter FinancialsSmucker  which shares space with Campbell Soup   NYSE CPB    exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  48 8

cash flow totaled  160 6 million Fiscal 2020 OutlookSmucker lowered its sales guidance for fiscal 2020  expecting soft second quarter sales and weak sales in the second half of the fiscal  mainly due to various brands in the U S  Retail Pet Foods segment  This also led to a lowered earnings view Smucker now expects net sales to be down 3  compared with the previous guidance of flat to 1  growth

35257,256772,SJM,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top three things that could rock markets tomorrow  
1  Manufacturing  Services  Consumer Data in Focus
The economic calendar on Friday includes manufacturing  services and consumer data that will likely offer clues on whether fears that fourth quarter U S  economic growth is set to slow have been misplaced 
IHS Markit will release its reading on November U S  manufacturing and services PMIs at 08 30 ET  13 30 GMT  
The manufacturing PMI is forecast to inch higher to reading of 51 5 in November from 51 3 last month and the services to 51 from 50 6 
With the crucial holiday season just around the corner  the University of Michigan s final results of its November consumer sentiment survey will likely draw added attention at a time when some fear last month s fall in retail sales points to a slowdown in consumer spending 
The University of Michigan s consumer sentiment index  due at 10 00 a m  ET is forecast to show a final reading of 95 7  up slightly from the previous reading of 95 5  while consumer expectations data will also be in focus 
2 Oil Rig Count Rolls In
The latest rig count data due Friday will be closely watched to gauge whether there has been any change in sentiment on drilling activity follow four straight weekly declines 
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand 
Data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the U S  fell by 10 to 674  The count is off 24  from a year ago 
The continued decline in rig counts come as the low price energy has deterred dented spending on exploration and production activity 
Still  U S  production remains at a record 12 8 million barrels a day  the EIA reported earlier this week 
Crude oil rose 2 8  Thursday to settle at  58 58 a barrel 
3  Footlocker  JM Smucker Earnings Due

The footwear retailer s results are expected to receive a boost from the launch of new products from brands such as Jordan  YEEZY and   Nike    NYSE NKE  in the second half of year 
But Wall Street appears somewhat divided on whether new product offerings can boost same store sales growth to match guidance 
 The first half 2019 same store sales increase of 2 8  means that  Foot Locker   NYSE FL  will have to produce second half same store sales of at least 4 3  growth just to get to the lowest end of the mid single digit increase for fiscal 2019   Susquehanna said in a recent note 
Wedbush  however  has more faith in the potential boost from the product launches  forecasting Footlocker to generate same store sales growth of 4 9   above Wall Street consensus of 4 8  
 Foot Locker   NYSE FL  is expected to report earnings of  1 07 on revenue of  1 94 billion  A year ago  the company earned 95 cents a share on  1 86 billion in sales

The food manufacturer has had a tough start to its fiscal year as falling peanut and coffee commodity prices have forced it to lower prices on its coffee and peanut products  keeping a lid on margins 
Its pet food business has also seen margins compress as competition heats up 
 We did not fully anticipate how broad and aggressive some of the pricing actions would be on trial sizes   for premium dog food products  CEO Mark Smucker said during the company s fiscal first quarter conference call 
Smucker guided adjusted earnings per share for the full year in the range of  8 35 to  8 55  down 10 cents  and sales were forecast to be flat to down 1   compared with a previous guidance of up 1  to 2   Shares are up 11 4  on the year ",2019-11-21,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/day-ahead-top-3-things-to-watch-2025717,2025717

steep pricing for supplies like grains  edible oils  vegetables  dairy items and animal feed among others  Moreover  elevated costs of logistics along with increased warehouse and packaging expenses have raised cost burden Moreover  as these firms operate in a highly competitive arena  they are compelled to invest heavily in promotional activities  Unfavorable product mix and adverse currency fluctuations are among other threats that cannot be counted out That said  we note that some food players are prepping to release quarterly results in the upcoming weeks  Let s take a look at what s in store for some of these companies Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive   the chance of a positive earnings surprise is high  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Sysco Corporation   NYSE SYY    a well known distributor and marketer of food and related products  is slated to release fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results on Aug 12  The company surpassed earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters  at an average positive surprise of 4    Sysco Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise     The company is likely to gain from a strong U S  Foodservice unit as well as focus on enhancing assortments  making constant innovations and revitalizing brands  It is also striving to invest in technology and enhancing e commerce operations  Further  the company is striving to reduce costs  We note that for fiscal fourth quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at  1 07  reflecting a rise of 13 8  year over year  Meanwhile  the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at  15 56 billion  reflecting a 1 6  increase year over year However  we note that rising supply chain and labor costs along with headwinds in certain international regions might weigh upon the company s performance   Read More   Our proven model does not show that Sysco is likely to beat estimates this quarter  Although the company has a Zacks Rank  3  its Earnings ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult  You can see  Hormel Foods Corporation   NYSE HRL    a meat products company  is slated to release third quarter fiscal 2019 results on Aug 22  The company s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters  at an average of 4 5  Steady growth in the refrigerated food segment along with focus on boosting brand capabilities are tailwinds for the company  However  an unstable tariff environment is likely to weigh upon Hormel Foods  pork unit in the impending quarter  Also  challenges related to the turkey market and high input costs are concerns Hormel Foods Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise     The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third quarter earnings is pegged at 36 cents  which suggests a decline of 7 7  year over year  The consensus estimate for revenues is currently pegged at  2 32 billion  which indicates a slip of 1 6  year over year  Moreover  our proven model doesn t show that Hormel Foods is likely to beat bottom line estimates this quarter  It currently carries a Zacks Rank  3 and has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  The J  M  Smucker Company   NYSE SJM   is scheduled to release first quarter fiscal 2020 results on Aug 27  The company has a mixed history of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters  Smucker has been struggling with lower net price realization across some of its segments  This combined with the divestiture of the U S  baking business as well as rising operating costs is likely to exert pressure on the to be reported quarter s performance  Nevertheless  we expect gains from savings measures and buyouts to provide some cushion from these headwinds The J  M  Smucker Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise     The consensus mark for earnings for the quarter under review is pegged at  1 76  which calls for a drop of 1 1  from the year ago quarter s tally  Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales is currently pegged at  1 89 billion  which suggests a decline of 0 8  from the year ago quarter s figure  Further  our proven model doesn t show a beat for Smucker in the first quarter  It carries a Zacks Rank  3 but has an Earnings ESP of  0 33   which makes surprise prediction difficult Campbell Soup Company   NYSE CPB   is another food company  which is grappling with weak segments  The company is expected to announce fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results  Notably  it has been witnessing sluggishness in U S  soup business for a while  Moreover  headwinds in the Campbell Fresh segment led management to undertake divestitures of Bolthouse Farms  U S  refrigerated soup and Garden Fresh Gourmet businesses  Such headwinds are likely to put pressure on the company s performance in the to be reported quarter  Nevertheless  gains from acquisitions  innovations in the snack s category and cost saving plans are likely to be tailwinds Campbell Soup Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise     We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the impending quarter is pegged at 41 cents  which suggests a rise of almost 64  from the prior year quarter s figure  However  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net revenues is currently pegged at  2 billion  which indicates a decline of nearly 9 8  from the prior year quarter s level Moreover  our proven model doesn t show a beat for Campbell this earnings season  It carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which along with an Earnings ESP of 0 00  makes us less confident of an earnings beat Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to

35347,256862,SJM,Smucker s  SJM  Stock Down On Q1 Earnings Miss   View Cut,opinion,The J  M  Smucker Company   NYSE SJM   started fiscal 2020 on a dismal note as both earnings and sales declined year over year and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter  Results were mainly hurt by unfavorable shipment timings  intense competition in the premium dog food business  and lower pricing at coffee and peanut butter businesses Moreover  the divestiture of the U S  baking business weighed on the results  whereas gains from the Ainsworth buyout offered some cushion  Though the company is on track to improve and strengthen its business  management curtailed sales and earnings guidance for fiscal 2020  Consequently  shares of the company were down more than 5  during the pre market trading session Quarter in DetailAdjusted earnings of  1 58 per share declined nearly 11  year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 75 The J  M  Smucker Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Net sales of the company amounted to  1 778 9 million  which missed the consensus mark of  1 885 million  Moreover  the top line dropped roughly 6  year over year  mainly due to the divestiture of the U S  baking business  partly compensated by the Ainsworth buyout  Notably  the Ainsworth acquisition contributed  25 4 million during the quarter Excluding items that affected comparability  the top line declined 4  due to reduced volume mix and lower net price realization  which dragged sales by 3 and 1 percentage points  respectively Adjusted gross profit fell 4 2  to  670 6 million  while the adjusted gross margin expanded 90 basis points to 37 7   Adjusted operating income decreased 8 3  to  290 7 million  and adjusted operating margin contracted 40 basis points to 16 3  Segment PerformanceU S  Retail Pet Foods  The company s U S  Retail Coffee Market segment sales came in at  669 9 million  which dipped marginally from the prior year quarter s figure  Excluding Ainsworth s contribution  net sales declined due to lower sales of private label products  This  in turn  was accountable to the company s exit from low margin products and weak trends at some retailers  Improved net price realization was offset by lower volume mix U S  Retail Consumer Foods  Sales in the segment declined 17  to  402 2 million  thanks to the divestiture of the baking business  Excluding the non comparable results  sales in the segment fell 3  due to reduced net pricing  somewhat compensated by improved volume mix U S  Retail Coffee Market  Net sales dropped about 5  to  465 7 million  due to lower net price realization and unfavorable volume mix International and Away From Home  Net sales fell 7  from the prior year quarter to  241 1 million  thanks to lower net price realization  adverse volume mix and impacts from the divestiture of the U S  baking business FinancialsSmucker exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  48 8 million  long term debt  less current portion  of  4 685 3 million and total shareholders  equity of  8 007 7 million  Cash flow from operations amounted to  221 5 million in the quarter and free cash flow totaled  148 5 million Fiscal 2020 OutlookSmucker now expects net sales to be down 1  to flat compared with the previous guidance of an increase of 1 2   The top line view includes a loss of  105 9 million stemming from the divestiture of the U S  baking business and non comparable sales associated with Ainsworth  On a comparable basis  sales are now projected to be flat to up 1  compared with the earlier guidance of growth of more than 2   Adjusted earnings are now anticipated to be  8 35  8 55 per share  down from  8 45  8 65 projected earlier  Smucker s adjusted earnings came in at  8 29 per share in fiscal 2019  The bottom line is likely to be affected by reduced contributions from sales  while slightly lower SD A costs are likely to offer some cushion  Gross margin is anticipated to be

35383,256898,SJM,Top 5 Things to Know in The Market on Tuesday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday  August 21 
1  Dollar Drops on Trump Fed Criticism
The U S  dollar was broadly lower against a basket of the other major currencies  after President Donald Trump reiterated his displeasure at the Federal Reserve s monetary policy 
Just before the market close on Monday  Reuters published an interview with Trump during which the president said he was  not thrilled  with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for raising rates and added that the Fed should do more to help him to boost the economy 
 We re negotiating very powerfully and strongly with other nations  We re going to win  But during this period of time I should be given some help by the Fed  The other countries are accommodated   Trump said 
This is not the first time Trump has called out the Fed for raising rates  When he did so in July  Powell stressed that the Fed operated independently of political considerations 
The president s latest criticism of the Fed comes three days before Friday s much anticipated speech by Powell at the central bank s annual Jackson Hole Symposium 
The Fed has been hiking rates and is expected to continue doing so  with another two increases expected this year 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a basket of six major currencies  was down 0 2  to 95 50  after touching an overnight low of 95 31  a level not seen since August 9 
The index is facing its fifth straight losing session  which would mark the first such streak since the start of the year 
In the bond market  Treasury prices slipped  pushing yields a tad higher across the curve  The benchmark 10 year yield ticked up to around 2 835  while the 2 year yield rose to 2 605  
Elsewhere in foreign exchange markets  the euro rose 0 3  to 1 1520  after climbing as high as 1 1541 overnight 
The offshore Chinese yuan was 0 2  stronger against the greenback at 6 8420 
Trump also accused China and Europe of manipulating their respective currencies 
2  Trump Pessimistic on This Week s China Trade Talks
On the trade front  Trump told Reuters that he does not expect much progress from talks with China this week in Washington  dashing hopes it will lead to an easing of their ongoing trade conflict 
Trump said Chinese negotiators would be arriving shortly  adding he did not  anticipate much  from the mid level discussions 
A nine member delegation from Beijing  led by Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen  will hold meetings with U S  officials led by the Treasury undersecretary  David Malpass  in Washington on Wednesday and Thursday 
Washington and Beijing have been locked in escalating rounds of tit for tat tariffs since the start of the year  with  34 billion in goods targeted by each country and another  16 billion slated to go into effect this week 
Trump has threatened further tariffs on exports worth as much as  500 billion  as he tries to reduce a trade deficit and protect intellectual property rights 
3  U S  Stock Futures Tick Higher  S P  Nasdaq Eye Records
On Wall Street  U S  stock futures pointed to a higher open  with the S P and Nasdaq set to edge closer to their respective all time highs 
The blue chip Dow futures were up 48 points  or around 0 2   at 5 40AM ET  the S P 500 futures tacked on 4 points  or around 0 1   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a gain of 14 points  or roughly 0 2  
At current levels  the S P is less than 0 6  below all time highs set in January  while the Nasdaq is 1 4  below its record  last reached in late July 
Elsewhere  in Europe  the majority of the region s major bourses were higher in mid morning trade  with most sectors in positive territory 
Earlier  Chinese markets led gains in a mostly positive trading session across Asia  after the country s banking regulator urged institutions to boost lending in the country  the latest in Beijing s effort to boost policy stimulus

35403,256918,SJM,Service Corporation  SCI  Q2 Earnings In Line  Revenues Top,opinion,Service Corporation International   NYSE SCI   reported mixed financial numbers for second quarter 2019  Although the company s earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  revenues surpassed the mark  Meanwhile  both the bottom and the top line increased on a year over year basis  The quarterly results gained from a strong performance in the cemetery category and favorable adjusted effective tax rate  Encouraged by quarterly results  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company revised its bottom line view for 2019  The company now anticipates adjusted earnings to be  1 90  2  the mid point   1 95  of which meets the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Meanwhile  the same is up from the sequential quarter s mid point of  1 93  This might have raised investor s optimism on this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock Q2 in DetailService Corporation reported adjusted earnings of 47 cents per share  matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  the bottom line improved 6 8  from the year ago quarter  Strength in comparable cemetery revenues and favorable adjusted effective tax rate offset the rise in interest expense  Adjusted effective tax rate was 23 3  in the second quarter of 2019 compared with 26 7  in the same period last year Total revenues of  812 6 million inched up 2 1  from  796 1 million in the year ago quarter  Both funeral and cemetery revenues aided the top line  Moreover  the figure came ahead of the consensus mark of  810 million General and administrative costs fell 5 7  to reach  29 4 million  driven by an efficient cost management The company s interest costs rose  2 8 million to  47 3 million due to higher interest rates on its floating rate debt Segment DiscussionComparable Funeral revenues grew 1 1   backed by improved preneed revenues along with higher core revenues and non funeral revenues  Core revenues were up owing to increased funeral services performed that offset the reduced average revenue per service conducted  However  revenues in this category were dented by the absence of last year s strong flu season  Recognized preneed revenues improved 15 7  on the back of high non funeral home sales production  courtesy of growth in the number of contracts sold These upsides were partly compensated by a decrease in other revenues  driven by weak General Agency revenues  Comparable preneed funeral sales production increased 3 1   driven by sales growth in non funeral home channel Comparable funeral operating profit was almost flat at  91 4 million while the operating margin contracted 30 basis points  bps  to 19 5   This downside resulted from lower fixed costs Comparable Cemetery revenues rose 0 7  year over year  riding on higher recognized preneed revenues  partially offset by a softness in other revenues  Comparable preneed cemetery sales production dipped 2 9  Comparable cemetery operating profit rose around 2 4  to  99 6 million while the respective margin expanded 50 bps to 30 4   This upside was driven by higher recognized preneed property revenues and cost containment efforts Other Financial DetailsThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  243 7 million  long term debt of  3 464 9 million and total equity of approximately  1 744 2 million Net cash from operating activities  excluding special items  amounted to  84 4 million in the quarter compared with  103 9 million in the prior year period  This decrease was due to the elevated tax and interests that more than offset growth in the operating profit and an improved working capital During the second quarter  Service Corporation returned  47 9 million to its shareholders via dividends and share buybacks and invested  23 6 million of capital in accretive acquisitions and building new funeral homes Also  the company incurred capital expenditures of  61 1 million during the second quarter 2019 Service Corporation International

standing  It plans to continue deploying capital efficiently to augment shareholder value  Notably  shares of this company have rallied 13 2  in the past three months  outperforming the  s growth of 2

Turnaround Plan  It includes numerous organization wide measures to strengthen business capabilities  Management also set certain financial targets for fiscal 2023 Though ambitious  the news failed to boost investors  optimism  The stock fell 13 5  in yesterday s trading session  The downturn was caused by management s frail view for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019  thanks to apprehended impacts of the restructuring plans  That said  let s take a closer look at these developments Restructuring Efforts to Boost Long Term GrowthThe Turnaround Plan emphasizes three important areas   reviving growth  boosting operational leadership as well as developing a culture of pride and performance  These factors are likely to strengthen margins and augment free cash flow In sync with these strategies  Coty plans to focus on brand building  enhance shelf productivity through assortment optimization  improve product mix and develop a strong pipeline of innovations to support expansion Additionally  management is looking toward minimizing costs to boost profitability  Such efforts include the optimization of supply chain  reduction of cost of goods sold  rationalization of SKU s as well as reducing inventory  Moreover  cutting down on fixed costs is an important goal for management  Further  the company is striving to simplify decision making process by refining organizational layers and improve the process of responsibility allocation among units To implement the proposed actions  the company plans to make changes in organizational structure  Accordingly  it plans to develop regional commercial teams in Europe  Middle East   Africa  EMEA  and in Americas   Asia Pacific  The regional teams and marketing units will be established for the Luxury and Consumer Beauty segments  However  the Professional Beauty will continue as a distinct unit owing to its unique salon focused operations  These organizational changes entail modifications in the executive committee Further  Coty has revealed plans to develop a centralized headquarter in Amsterdam  wherein most of the corporate functions will be carried out  This location is likely to provide greater cost efficiency  tax stability and improve resource accessibility Based on the aforementioned plans and other prudent moves to bolster financial standing  the company has set certain targets for fiscal 2023  The company expects operating margin in the range of 14 16   Further  free cash flow is estimated at  1 billion and net debt to EBITDA ratio is expected to be below 4x To implement the turnaround plans  the company expects to incur costs worth almost  600 million  from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2023  Apart from this  the company has costs worth nearly  160 million associated with previous development

35467,256982,SJM,Should Value Investors Consider J  M  Smucker  SJM  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The J  M  Smucker Company   NYSE SJM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  J  M  Smucker has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 41  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 48  If we focus on the long term PE trend  J  M  Smucker s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Staples sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 25  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that J  M  Smucker has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 00  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for J  M  Smucker stock in the near term too  P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  J  M  Smucker has a P S ratio of about 1 74  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 34 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  SJM is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  J  M  Smucker currently has a Zacks Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes J  M  Smucker a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the its P CF ratio comes in at 9 14  which is lower than the industry average of 12 72  Clearly  SJM is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall   Though J  M  Smucker might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of C  This gives SJM a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current year has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction  while the full year 2020 estimate has seen three upward revision compared to one downward in the same time period    This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has inched up by 0 9  in the past two months  while the full year 2020 estimate has risen by 0 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below The J  M  Smucker Company Price and Consensus    This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  J  M  Smucker is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among top 40  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  2 further instils our confidence However  over the past two years  the Zacks Food   Miscellaneous industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for industry trends to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2

35490,257005,SJM,Pampered pets set Wall Street on the prowl for deals,news,By Harry Brumpton  Reuters    Gordie Spater has been manufacturing dog harnesses for nearly 15 years on the northernmost reaches of the Massachusetts shoreline  but he is in high demand right now on Wall Street  His brand  Kurgo  occupies the sort of niche coveted by investors looking to profit from the U S  pet economy  a range of outdoor gear and accessories for the traveling mutt  Consumers  increasing tendency to treat their pooches like family  along with the retail industry s need for new products to lure people online and in store  have created a boom in deals for companies catering to pets  Food brands  particularly those offering premium  natural ingredients  have been among the most popular acquisition targets in the pets space  But as the number of major  independent players shrinks and valuations get steeper  buyers are setting their sights further afield   at niche products such as snacks and accessories and services including grooming and doggie daycare   We ve been looking in detail at opportunities in many of the categories over the past 24 months   says David Fiorentino of private equity firm J W  Childs Associates  There has been a lot of competition among investors for buyouts  he said   Especially companies with more than  30 million to  40 million in revenue   So far this year  there has been at least  8 3 billion worth of transactions  involving veterinary clinics in Australia and cat snacks in the Netherlands as well as pet insurance in the United States and canine raincoats in Italy    For a graphic on pet industry M A  click   Buyers range from private equity firms such as KKR  as well as  General Mills  Inc  N GIS  and other consumer giants looking to expand beyond cereals and yoghurts for humans to high protein meals for dogs and cats with sensitive stomachs  That start to 2018 is close to the same period last year when there was the highest total value of pet related deals in 16 years  Pet dealmaking has dipped 6 percent on last year s total value of deals while dealmaking in the wider consumer industry has slipped more than 22 percent so far this year compared to 2017  Thomson Reuters data shows  Spater has been fielding inquiries almost every week from private equity funds and companies looking to buy Kurgo  which he founded with his brother Kitter after the latter rigged up a  backseat barrier  with some mesh and bungee cords to stop his Plott Hound Zelda from jumping out of the trunk of his car   Obviously  retail is a challenging space  but there s a lot of activity in the pet specialty space   said Spater   I think the consolidation is definitely here   David Blatte  a board member of rival cat and dog accessories brand Worldwise  sees the emergence of so called  pet parents  among Millennials and Baby Boomers creating a large  lucrative gap for health conscious  high end products and services   It s unbelievable  This is the most white space of any consumer sector   said Blatte  a former consumer products investment banker  who is currently looking to buy companies selling luxury pet totes and doggie dental enhancing chew toys  Adding to the pressure to consolidate are the distributors  who want suppliers with scale and a wide variety of products   A lot of these retailers want to deal with less vendors   said Blatte   We do somewhere like three to four acquisitions a year  smaller pet companies and we bring them into the Worldwise umbrella   Among the more significant deals in the space this year was General Mills acquisition of pet food maker  Blue Buffalo Pet Products Inc   O BUFF  for about  8 billion in cash   That price equated to around 6 times annual sales according to investment manager Susquehanna International Group  a valuation similar to the sort of multiples seen for health oriented human foods including Kellogg Co s  N K   600 million deal for upstart healthy snack maker RXBar and  Dr Pepper Snapple  Group Inc s  N DPS   1 7 billion deal for drinks brand Bai   Valuations are steep   said Tim Larsen  a managing director at investment bank Houlihan Lokey  which has negotiated a number of pet deals   According to Larsen  even in the universe of private companies  many pet company acquisitions this year and last have been struck at low to mid teens profit multiples  This compares to a multiple of about 10 times across the consumer industry more broadly last year  according to Thomson Reuters data  For many acquirers  there is competitive pressure to get involved  To match consumer conglomerates Nestle  Colgate Palmolive Co  N CL  and J M  Smucker Co  N SJM   who all have pet care divisions outpacing core company sales  agricultural giant Cargill ramped up its pet food manufacturing facilities in January through the acquisition of Ohio based Pro Pet  The price was not disclosed   When you sit down with your strategic customers and you have every one of them say to you that premium pet is where they need to invest and they need you to be there with them  that s a glaring reason to invest   said Cargill s Feed and Nutrition Retail Director Christi Brown  DOG SALONS U S  consumer spending on premium dog and cat food   the sort of meals that combine deboned meat with garden veggies   is expected to accelerate by 16 percent in total over the next five years compared to 12 2 percent for pet food more generally  according to market research firm Euromonitor  Spending on toys  carriers and bedding  as well as food brands for therapeutic or  prescription  diets are also set to grow at a breezy clip of between 12 1 percent and 12 6 percent even as the total population of pets stays the same  according to Euromonitor  With a scarcity of targets with scale  Larsen and other M A advisors are looking at smaller deals focused on healthy foods and snacks   I think that there should be a wave of deals over the next one  two  three years   he said  Cat catering is also expected to be a growth area  along with premium services aimed at dogs  such as grooming and doggie hotels  Dan Barton s no expense spared dog salon chain Splash and Dash Groomerie  headquartered in Florida  still has only 18 franchises generating  14 million in annual revenues across the network  but receives approaches on average every few months from prospective acquirers   The big players have been all focused on the food industry and that s where there have been a lot of mergers and acquisitions  Players in the service industry  there s not many at all   said Barton   My dog Mercedes is like a family member to me  Like my child   said Barton  who sees his own preferences mirrored in younger consumers   That is a huge market now that is just starting to become a huge industry   Gordie Spater agrees  and that is what is different from older generations of pet owners  His business was established trying to keep dogs stowed in the trunk of a car but in the future  people might prefer to have them travel upfront  That evolving relationship will require different types of products   I go into my daughter s room this morning and even though my dog is 80 pounds he slept on the twin bed with her all night  and does most nights   said Spater

35493,257008,SJM,Top 5 Things To Know In The Market On Thursday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Thursday  June 7 
1  U S  Stocks Set For Positive Open As June Rally Continues
U S  stock futures pointed to more gains at the open  as an impressive start to June looked set to continue 
At 5 55AM ET  1050GMT   the blue chip Dow futures were up 50 points  or about 0 2   while the S P 500 futures tacked on 2 points  or roughly 0 1  
The tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a gain of 5 points  less than 0 1   which would put the benchmark on track to open at a fresh record high 
The moves in pre market trade followed a strong session Wednesday  which saw the Dow close above 25 000 for the first time since mid March  while the Nasdaq registered its third straight record closing high 
After just four trading days in June  each of the major indexes is up more than 2  for the month 
Elsewhere  in Europe  most of the continent s major bourses traded higher during mid morning hours  with almost every sector trading in positive territory 
Earlier  Asian markets rose to a fresh 2 1 2 month high  tracking strong overnight gains on Wall Street 
2  Quiet Day For Data  Earnings
The economics and earnings calendars are fairly quiet  as they ve been for most of the week  with the weekly report on initial jobless claims  as well as the Fed s latest report on household net worth  highlights on the economics side 
And on the earnings calendar  notable reports out Thursday will include results from JM Smucker  NYSE SJM  and Vail Resorts  NYSE MTN  ahead of the opening bell  while Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO   DocuSign  NASDAQ DOCU  and Stitch  NASDAQ SFIX  are due to release their latest earnings after the close 
3  Dollar On Track For Fourth Straight Loss
The dollar continued lower for the fourth day in a row  as concerns about trade frictions stayed in the forefront ahead of the Group of Seven leaders weekend summit 
The dollar index was off almost 0 4  to 93 27  the lowest since May 17 
With a lack of major economic reports and earnings news  markets are likely to turn their attention to the upcoming G7 summit in Canada  where the topic of trade is expected to be of key importance 
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said late on Wednesday that U S  President Donald Trump would meet French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the G7 summit this week 
Although Kudlow said Trump would not back down from the tough line he has taken on trade  the comments appeared to calm investors 
4  Euro Continues Rally On ECB Tapering Bets
The euro gained further ground  building on the previous day s gains  amid rising bets the European Central Bank  ECB  may announce it will wind down its stimulus program by year end as early as next week 
EUR USD was up around 0 5  to 1 1825  the highest level since May 16 
Sovereign bond yields across the single currency bloc also continued higher  as investors grew confident that higher interest rates are underway 
The central bank s chief economist Peter Praet  a close ally of President Mario Draghi  said the ECB would debate next week whether to end bond purchases later this year 
The hawkish comments prompted money market investors to price in a roughly 90  chance that the ECB will raise interest rates in July 2019  This is a change from last week  when investors thought uncertainty caused by a political crisis in Italy could make policymakers cautious about indicating an end to stimulus at its policy meeting next week 
5  Oil Prices Tick Higher Amid Venezuela Supply Woes
Oil prices rose to shake off some of the previous session s losses  supported by plunging exports by OPEC member Venezuela 
Venezuela s state owned PdVSA is reportedly considering declaring force majeure on some contracts with crude oil buyers  essentially declaring they cannot be fulfilled as output from its oil fields has tanked and bottlenecks are slowing down exports at the ports 
Brent crude futures were up 31 cents  or 0 4   to  75 69 a barrel 
Meanwhile  U S  West Texas Intermediate WTI crude was up 16 cents  or 0 3   at  64 89 a barrel  sitting around its lowest since April 9  as concerns over a jump in U S  oil inventories and record weekly domestic production weighed ",2018-06-07,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-thursday-1483861,1483861
35525,257040,SJM,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Unilever  Medifast  British American Tobacco  Sysco And J M  Smucker,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   March 29  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Unilever PLC   NYSE UL    Medifast  Inc    NYSE MED    British American Tobacco  LON BATS  p l c    NYSE BTI    Sysco Corporation   NYSE SYY   and The J M  Smucker Company   NYSE SJM    Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  5 Consumer Staples Stocks for an Era of Soft YieldsThe Fed s decidedly dovish turn on interest rates last week has pushed government bond yields to their lowest point in more than a year  A section of economists believe global economic weakness has played a role in lowering yields  But the consensus is clear  an economic slowdown is around the corner  And it would be prudent for investors to seek defensive stocks When it comes to safer equity categories  consumer staples have a clear edge  The stability and superior dividends that they provide are common to most other defensive options  Also  Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  thinks they are yet to price in low rates  unlike real estate investment trusts  REITs  and utilities  This is why it makes sense to add consumer staples stocks to your portfolios at this time 10 Year Treasury Yield Plumbs Fresh 14 Month LowOn Mar 27  the plunge in long term treasury yields continued unabated  The yield on the 10 year Treasury note had touched 2 38  by 5 17 PM ET  its lowest since December 2017  Ultimately  the yield lost 2 basis points to finish the day at 2 39   The 30 year Treasury bond yield lost 3 basis points to close at 2 83  Additionally  the 3 month Treasury bond yield lost 2 basis points to close the day at 2 44   Worryingly  the yield on the 10 year Treasury note has lost 20 basis points since Mar 15   In fact  the retreat in yields is now a worldwide phenomenon  This is because central banks are opting to keep interest rates lower for a period which is much longer than what was being predicted even a year ago Concerns about tepid growth have troubled China and most of Europe for some time now  But  as was apparent last week  sluggish inflation was enough for the Fed to revise its monetary stance drastically Defensive Stocks Gain Popularity  Consumer Staples Hold EdgeAccording to Larry McDonald  founder of The Bear Traps Report  it is increasingly apparent that investors are beginning to rotate out of cyclicals  like financials  The beneficiaries of such a movement have been defensive stocks like consumer staples McDonald points out that the path of the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund  XLF  and the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR  XLP  has begun to diverge recently  While the XLP is up 2 1  since Mar 1  the XLF has lost 4 2  over the same period  This divergence is essentially a product of soft rates  which are likely to remain low for most of the year  In fact  there is currently a 70  chance that the Fed will cut rates at least once by Dec 11  Trump s pick for the central bank Stephen Moore thinks the Fed should  cut rates by half a percentage point  immediately In such circumstances  consumer staples companies emerge as a logical choice for most investors  according to Binky Chadha  chief strategist at Deutsche Bank  This is because they are yet to price in a decline in rates  unlike other defensive options such as REITs and utilities Chadha thinks consumer staples are still priced for a substantially higher yield  close to 3   This means that they will retain upside  even if rates and growth stay at current levels  more so if they decline further  Our ChoicesWith the Fed likely to maintain a dovish stance going ahead  interest rates are likely to remain low for an extended period  The fact that long term rates are declining faster than their short term counterparts also indicates that at the very least  an economic slowdown is around the corner In such circumstances  defensive options become the natural choice for most investors  Consumer staples companies hold the edge here  since they are yet to price in a fall in rates  per Deutsche Bank  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult

35574,257089,SJM,Smucker Does Not Look Enticing But These 3 Food Stocks Do,opinion,Many players in the Zacks  industry have been sailing through rough seas  thanks to rising cost woes  Input cost inflation for a variety of commodities and persistently rising freight expenses have been posing acute concerns to several players in the food universe  Additionally  competition in the food space has been steadily rising  making things tougher for companies belonging to the Food   Miscellaneous industry  which has lost 16 1  in a year compared with the S P 500 s decline of 4 3  Despite the obstacles  the space is surely not devoid of delicacies that have managed to perform well and defy the industry trends  However  before getting into those rosy picks  we have highlighted The J  M  Smucker Company   NYSE SJM   that has not been in a good shape lately  due worries related to escalated costs and lower net price realization  Well  this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock has plummeted close to 17  in a year Smucker  Not So EnticingSmucker is bearing the brunt of lower net price realization  We note that the company s top line slipped 1  during the second quarter  excluding items that impact comparability   due to lower net price realization  Further  such a headwind also dragged gross margin in the said period  In fact  lower net price realization has been weighing on the performance of the company s U S  Retail Coffee  the International and Away from Home categories for a while Also  high freight costs marred Smucker s profitability in the U S  Retail Pet Foods category in the second quarter of fiscal 2019  Moreover  management expects increased freight costs to be a drag on earnings in fiscal 2019  Further  Smucker s SG A expenses witnessed 6  year over year growth during the second quarter  mainly due to the Ainsworth s addition  Also  interest expenses rose 28 8  in the quarter on account of costs related to the acquisition  We note that interest expenses went up 27 6  in the first quarter of 2019  preceded by 17 6  and 6 9  in the fourth and third quarters of fiscal 2018  respectively  Persistence of these trends is a concern for Smucker s bottom line Owing to the aforementioned hurdles  Smucker s top and bottom lines missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate during the second quarter of fiscal 2019  This marks the company s third consecutive quarter of sales and earnings miss  Performance in the quarter was also marred by the divestiture of the U S  baking business  Unfortunately  management lowered fiscal 2019 view and projected net sales to be  7 9 billion  down from the prior forecast of  8 billion  Further  Smucker forecasted adjusted earnings per share of  8 00  8 20  down from the prior view of  8 40  8 65  To top it  earnings for the third quarter are expected to decline almost 20  year over year Clearly  these factors have made analysts hesitant about Smucker  with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter and fiscal 2019 moving south over the past 60 days Appetizers in the Food SpaceThough obstacles like the aforementioned ones have placed the Food   Miscellaneous industry in the bottom 23  out of all Zacks industries  the space still has some hidden gems with favorable prospects  Notably  there are some solid food players  which have bucked the industry trend with their solid pricing initiatives  focus on innovation  product launches and diversification  Also  benefits from acquisitions  divestitures and alliances have been helping these companies tide over the obstacles  Additionally  many food companies are gaining from efforts to augment organic and natural offerings in response to rising health consciousness  Stringent cost containment efforts and efficient productivity programs are also helping a host of food players stand out That said  we have highlighted three stocks  which have crushed the industry trend  Markedly  these stocks carry a favorable Zacks Rank and flaunt an impressive record of earnings surprises 3 Food Stocks to Satiate Investors  Appetite Investors can count on Smart   Final Stores  Inc    NYSE SFS    This California based company s earnings estimates for the current year have increased 9 3  to 47 cents in the past 60 days  Also  this Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company has seen its shares rally as much as 17 1  in the past six months  Smart   Final Stores has long term growth rate of 3  and its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by average of 25 8  in the trailing four quarters  You can seeMcCormick   Company  Incorporated   NYSE MKC   is another solid bet  Carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   the Maryland based company s shares have gained 41 3  in a year  McCormick  which has delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5 2  in the past four quarters  has been gaining from dedicated focus on buyouts  product innovations  cost containment measures and efficient marketing initiatives  Notably  this leading manufacturer and distributor of spices and seasonings has long term growth rate of 9  Lamb Weston Holdings  Inc    NYSE LW   also appears appetizing  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has grown close to 22  in the past year  courtesy of its superb surprise history  Markedly  following its spin off from Conagra Brands in November 2016  the company has been delivering positive earnings and sales surprise  Also  the company s robust potential is reflected in its encouraging outlook for fiscal 2019  strong estimate revisions for the fiscal in the past seven days and long term growth rate of 12

35577,257092,SJM,11 Investable Consumer Non Durables ,opinion,"Introduction
My primary objective with this series of articles  identifying attractively valued stocks in different sectors  is to provide the reader with a clear perspective of just how different individual stocks are and how different companies operating in different sectors are  It is my opinion and experience that investors worry far too much about what the general market may or may not do  and far too little about the specifics of the individual stocks that they actually own 
The old saying that  knowledge is power  really comes to mind  When dealing with my own portfolio  or portfolios that I manage for others  my primary goal is to evaluate  assess and establish as clear as I possibly can an understanding of what each business in the portfolio is intrinsically worth based on fundamentals  This can be   and often is   in stark contrast to how the market may be valuing a given business in the short run  Stocks  and markets for that matter  do become overvalued  undervalued and fairly valued from time to time 
However  when you know what your businesses are truly worth you are empowered and protected from making impulsive mistakes  This simply means that you are not foolish enough to sell a valuable asset for less than it s worth  Conversely  nor are you foolish enough to hold onto an asset that is dangerously overvalued  In other words  when you know the value of your individual businesses  you are empowered towards making sound and prudent long term investing decisions 
Now there is a point of clarification that should be made here  Knowing the precise value of a business is not a practical notion  Instead  all that you can do is have a general but learned idea of what a business is worth  Stated differently  every investor can calculate their businesses  worth within a reasonable range of prudence and understanding  The central idea here is that you understand your value well enough that you never sell a dollars  worth of assets for  0 50 or vice versa 
A Sector By Sector Review
This is part 4 of a series where I have conducted a simple screening looking for value over the overall market based on industry classifications and subindustry classifications reported by FactSet Research Systems  Inc  In part 1 found here I covered the Consumer Services Sector  In part 2 found here I covered the Communication Sector  In part 3 found here I covered the Consumer Durables Sector and its many diverse subsectors 
In each article in this series  I will be providing a listing of screened research candidates from each of the following industry sectors  the sector I m covering in this article is marked in green 

A Simple Valuation and Quality Screening Process
With this series of articles  I will be presenting a screening of companies that have become attractively valued primarily as a result of the bearish market activities experienced in 2018 from each of the above sectors  I will be applying a rather simple valuation and quality oriented screen across each of the sectors  First  I have screened for investment grade S P credit ratings of BBB  or above  Next  I have screened for low valuations based on P E ratios between 2 and 17  Finally  I have screened for long term debt to capital no greater than 70  
By keeping my screen simple  and at the same time rather broad  I will be able to identify attractively valued research candidates that I might have overlooked through a more rigorous screening process  In other words  I m looking for fresh ideas that I might have previously been overlooking  Furthermore  I want to be clear that I do not consider every candidate that I have discovered as suitable for every investor  However  I do consider them all to be attractively valued  Additionally  I also believe that every investor will be able to find companies to research that meet their own goals  objectives and risk tolerances as this series unfolds 
In part 4  I have found 11 research candidates from the Consumer Non Durables Sector 
Sector 4  Consumer Non Durables
Food  Major Diversified
Food  Specialty Candy
Food  Meat Fish Dairy
Beverages  Non Alcoholic
Beverages  Alcoholic
Tobacco
Household Personal Care
Apparel Footwear
Consumer Sundries
In contrast to the Consumer Durables Sector  the consumer Non Durables Sector is comprised of companies with more consistent operating histories and more consistent records of dividend increases  Moreover  consumer non durables are generally lower growth businesses with above average dividend yields  Consequently  even though there are many well known brands comprising this sector  very few produce long term returns that are greater than the S P 500 average long term total returns 
On the other hand  of the 403 Consumer Non Durables companies  many of the most recognized brands have significantly outperformed the S P 500 on dividend yield and total dividends paid  Consequently  these companies tend to be favored for their above average yield and steadily growing dividends over time 
As I pointed out in part 2 of this series  there are many different reasons for investors to choose a given stock to include in their portfolios  Consumer Non Durables tend to be well known and highly respected companies that many investors are comfortable investing in  Moreover  as previously stated  they also tend to be favored for their dividend income 
Portfolio Review  Consumer Non Durables Sector 11 Research Candidates

FAST Graphs Screenshots of the 11 Research Candidates
The following screenshots provide a quick look at each of the 11 candidates screened out of over 19 000 possibilities  However  there are only 403 companies categorized as Consumer Non Durables  and these 11 were the only ones I was comfortable presenting in this article  I have placed them in order of the highest dividend yield to lowest  Additionally  the reader should note that one of these candidates  PVH Corporation  technically pays a dividend  but barely  The company descriptions are provided courtesy of the Wall Street Journal  In the FAST Graphs analyze out the loud video that follows the screenshots  I will provide additional details and thoughts on the possible attractiveness as well as the potential negatives of each of these research candidates

F A S T  Graphs Analyze Out Loud Video  11 Investable Consumer Non Durables



Summary and Conclusions
As an over generalization  Consumer Non Durables are products that tend to be purchased repeatedly over short periods of time  This short repeat sales cycle tends to produce a level of stability and consistency  However  it also comes with a price  Typically  companies in the Consumer Non Durables Sector are not high growth opportunities  Instead  and for the most part  they can best be thought of as stable income producers  Of course  there are exceptions 
Consequently  I would argue that there is a place in most everyone s portfolio for a high quality income producing Consumer Non Durable investment  The quality consumer non durable investment can help diversify and even stabilize a portfolio  On the other hand  investments in this sector are not likely to be producing the highest total returns in your portfolio  Nevertheless  they can make sense for a portion of your portfolio

beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the former improved year over year  Moreover  management reiterated its earnings outlook range  whose mid point stands above the current consensus mark Markedly  the company envisions fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings per share  EPS  in the range of  8 00  8 20  whose mid point of  8 10 is well above the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of  8 02  These factors seem to have spurred investors  optimism in the stock  which gained almost 7  during the pre market trading session on Feb 26 Quarter in DetailAdjusted earnings of  2 26 per share tumbled 9 6  year over year  though it came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 03  Smucker  which belongs to the  industry  has lost 6 5  in the past three months The J  M  Smucker Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Net sales of the company came in at  2 011 9 million  which beat the consensus mark of  1 984 million  Moreover  the top line increased nearly 6  year over year  mainly driven by the Ainsworth buyout and gains from the company s growth brands  Notably  the Ainsworth acquisition contributed  199 2 million during the quarter  These upsides were partially offset by impacts from non comparable net sales in the year ago quarter  stemming from the divestiture of the U S  baking business Excluding items that impact comparability  the top line rose 1  due to favorable volume mix  Net price realization remained neutral in the quarter Adjusted gross profit jumped 6 2  to  776 7 million and adjusted gross margin expanded 20 basis points  bps  to 38 6   Adjusted operating income climbed 1 3  to  406 2 million  though the adjusted operating margin contracted 90 bps to 20 2  Segment PerformanceU S  Retail Coffee Market  The company s U S  Retail Coffee Market segment sales came in at  561 6 million  which grew 2  from the prior year quarter s figure  This was backed by favorable volume mix  stemming from brands such as 1850 and Dunkin  Donuts  This was somewhat countered by reduced net price realization Profit in the segment rose 1  to  183 7 million thanks to improved volume mix and lower input costs  These compensated for escalated marketing costs and reduced net price realization U S  Retail Consumer Foods  Sales in the segment declined 17  to  422 7 million  largely bearing the brunt of the divestiture of the baking business  On excluding the noncomparable results  sales in the segment went up by 4   courtesy of improved volume mix Profit in the segment plunged 21  to  95 9 million  mainly due to the divestiture of the U S  baking business  Excluding this  profit dropped 6  on account of elevated input costs  increased marketing costs and costs associated with the making of Smucker s Uncrustables production facility U S  Retail Pet Foods  Net sales surged 35  to  759 million  owing to contributions from the Ainsworth buyout  Excluding the impacts from this buyout  sales in the segment went down  owing to discontinuation of Gravy Train products  Volume mix remained unfavorable  whereas pricing improved at the segment Segment profit jumped 26  to  147 9 million  supported by gains from Ainsworth  Excluding this buyout  profit in the segment remained flat as increased costs were negated by greater pricing International and Away from Home  Net sales fell 6  from the prior year quarter s figure to  268 6 million  owing to lower net price realization  currency headwinds  adverse volume mix and impacts from the divestiture of the U S  baking business  Segment profit dipped 2  to  52 5 million  owing to lower sales  currency woes and impacts from U S  baking business sale  somewhat made up by lower marketing expenses  and benefits from reduced pricing and costs FinancialsSmucker exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  206 5 million  long term debt  less current portion  of  5 285 8 million and total shareholders  equity of  8 021 6 million  Cash flow from operations amounted to  421 1 million in the quarter and free cash flow totaled  333 million Fiscal 2019 OutlookManagement remained pleased with the progress of its customer focused strategy  Further  the company s core brands like Smucker s Uncrustables  Nature s Recipe and Sahale Snacks  among others  delivered solid sales growth in the quarter  These factors along with effective cost containment measures and efforts to keep pace with consumers evolving preferences bode well for this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company The company reiterated its outlook for fiscal 2019  Accordingly  the company expects net sales for fiscal 2019 to be  7 9 billion

35581,257096,SJM,Should Value Investors Consider Smucker  SJM  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The J  M  Smucker Company   NYSE SJM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Smucker has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 5  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 7  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Smucker s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 17 5 over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Staples sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 18 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Smucker has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 12 6  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Smucker has a P S ratio of about 1 5  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  SJM is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Smucker currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Smucker a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too The P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  of Smucker comes in at 7 9  which is far lower than the industry average of 11 4  Clearly  SJM is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Smucker might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of A  This gives SJM a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen no upward revision in the past sixty days compared to six downward revisions  while the full year estimate has seen five upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had just a mixed impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 3 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has risen by 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below The J  M  Smucker Company Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineSmucker is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 41  out of more than 250 Zacks industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Food Miscellaneous industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks

35600,257115,SJM,5 Consumer Staples Stocks For An Era Of Soft Yields ,opinion,The Fed s decidedly dovish turn on interest rates last week has pushed government bond yields to their lowest point in more than a year  A section of economists believe global economic weakness has played a role in lowering yields  But the consensus is clear  an economic slowdown is around the corner  And it would be prudent for investors to seek defensive stocks When it comes to safer equity categories  consumer staples have a clear edge  The stability and superior dividends that they provide are common to most other defensive options  Also  Deutsche Bank   NYSE DB   thinks they are yet to price in low rates  unlike real estate investment trusts  REITs  and utilities  This is why it makes sense to add consumer staples stocks to your portfolios at this time 10 Year Treasury Yield Plumbs Fresh 14 Month LowOn Mar 27  the plunge in long term treasury yields continued unabated  The yield on the 10 year Treasury note had touched 2 38  by 5 17 PM ET  its lowest since December 2017  Ultimately  the yield lost 2 basis points to finish the day at 2 39   The 30 year Treasury bond yield lost 3 basis points to close at 2 83  Additionally  the 3 month Treasury bond yield lost 2 basis points to close the day at 2 44   Worryingly  the yield on the 10 year Treasury note has lost 20 basis points since Mar 15   In fact  the retreat in yields is now a worldwide phenomenon  This is because central banks are opting to keep interest rates lower for a period which is much longer than what was being predicted even a year ago Concerns about tepid growth have troubled China and most of Europe for some time now  But  as was apparent last week  sluggish inflation was enough for the Fed to revise its monetary stance drastically Defensive Stocks Gain Popularity  Consumer Staples Hold EdgeAccording to Larry McDonald  founder of The Bear Traps Report  it is increasingly apparent that investors are beginning to rotate out of cyclicals  like financials  The beneficiaries of such a movement have been defensive stocks like consumer staples McDonald points out that the path of the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund  XLF  and the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR  XLP  has begun to diverge recently  While the XLP is up 2 1  since Mar 1  the XLF has lost 4 2  over the same period  This divergence is essentially a product of soft rates  which are likely to remain low for most of the year  In fact  there is currently a 70  chance that the Fed will cut rates at least once by Dec 11  Trump s pick for the central bank Stephen Moore thinks the Fed should  cut rates by half a percentage point  immediately In such circumstances  consumer staples companies emerge as a logical choice for most investors  according to Binky Chadha  chief strategist at Deutsche Bank  This is because they are yet to price in a decline in rates  unlike other defensive options such as REITs and utilities Chadha thinks consumer staples are still priced for a substantially higher yield  close to 3   This means that they will retain upside  even if rates and growth stay at current levels  more so if they decline further  Our ChoicesWith the Fed likely to maintain a dovish stance going ahead  interest rates are likely to remain low for an extended period  The fact that long term rates are declining faster than their short term counterparts also indicates that at the very least  an economic slowdown is around the corner In such circumstances  defensive options become the natural choice for most investors  Consumer staples companies hold the edge here  since they are yet to price in a fall in rates  per Deutsche Bank  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V

35633,257148,SJM,7 July Dividend Hikes To Buy For 12  Yearly Gains  Forever ,opinion,"Most people are chasing big dividend payers right now in this  3  world  we live in  Meanwhile  a small group of  hidden yield  stocks are quietly handing smart investors growing income streams PLUS annual returns of 12   17 3   or more 
Let s talk about how to find these stocks  and bank 12  returns or better every single year  by following a simple two step formula 
See  everyone wants dividend stocks with good current yields  It s easy to scan a newspaper or financial website and pick out the stocks that are paying 3   4   8  or whatever number you might consider  good  
Yet that s NOT the right way to pick dividend stocks 
You have to do more work to figure out if those yields are actually supported by the company s cash flows  earnings power  long term business prospects  etc  You have to sift through the same company s history to determine how long it s been paying those dividends  How consistently it s been paying those dividends  And especially if it s been regularly increasing its dividend payments 
The best time to buy a dividend grower is anytime  But we can tip the odds in our favor even further when we buy at moments like these   when the share price is due to  catch up  to the dividend 
Which brings me to step 1 of our 12  return formula 
Step 1  Buy Before Dividend Hikes
The  efficient market  is always slow to adjust to higher dividend levels  Folks who scan the papers are looking at trailing yields  They re not considering next month s payout increase  which is likely not yet priced into the stock quote 
Which means we should start our search for 12  by considering companies set to hike in the next month or two 
Here are nine firm s poised to give their investors a payout raise in June 
Step 2  Review Next Month s Dividend Hikes
Every dividend that eventually  accelerates  begins with a simple payout hike  We ll talk about purchase timing in a moment  First  let s review the seven stocks most likely to raise their dividends next month 
Discover Financial Services  NYSE DFS Dividend Yield  1 8 
Financial stocks aren t necessarily the most generous of dividend payers  with many of them shelling out in the 1  2  area  Such is the case with credit card purveyor Discover Financial Services  DFS   which doesn t even clear the 2  bar 
To its credit  DFS has pumped up its dividend significantly over the past few years  turning a 20 cent payout in 2014 into today s 35 cent offering   a 75  increase 
To its detriment  the company has done so amid a roughly 15  contraction in earnings over roughly the same time 
Discover s  DFS  Earnings Arsenal Is Waning
Still  the company did report a nice third quarter in April that included a 27  bump to the bottom line 
Expect Discover s next dividend increase to come sometime in mid July 
JM Smucker Company  NYSE SJM Dividend Yield  2 9 
Jam master JM Smucker  SJM  is having itself a trying 2018  off double digits less than halfway through the year  That comes despite a beat on both the top and bottom lines back in February   the company s  2 50 in earnings topped expectations by 37 cents  while revenues of  1 9 billion just slid above the  1 89 bill mark  Of particular interest was a gain in cash from operating activities  from  419 5 million to  469 0 million 
Perhaps investors aren t pleased with guidance  which has net sales coming in between flat and down slightly for the year 
Investors will be hoping for a pick me up in the form of a dividend increase announced sometime in mid July  SJM has lifted its dividend by almost 35  over the past five years  and still has ammunition enough to keep perking up the payout 
Kellogg Company  NYSE K Dividend Yield  3 4 
Kellogg  K  might command a horde of popular brands including Frosted Flakes  Froot Loops  Rice Krispies  Pringles  Pop Tarts  Eggo  Kashi  Morningstar Farms and more  But it doesn t command much respect among Wall Streeters   nor has it for some time  The stock has essentially been dead money for the past five years  and it has posted a 5  loss this year versus a roughly flat market 
That s despite a significant bump since its first quarter report in early May  At the time  the company reported a 69  jump in earnings as well as top  and bottom line beats  thanks in part to strength in its frozen foods unit 
Kellogg leaves much to be desired  not just on a share appreciation basis  but also in the dividend growth arena  The company s payout expansion has slowed to a crawl  ranging between about 2  and 4  annually for the past several years 
Kellogg s  K  Dividend Growth Is Flattening Out
Education Realty Trust Inc  NYSE EDR Dividend Yield  4 1 
Education Realty Trust  EDR  is a niche real estate investment trust  REIT  that specializes in collegiate housing  serving 79 communities across 25 states  Some of its most recent projects have been focused on Pennsylvania s Lehigh University  as well as Mississippi State University 
This has been a roller coaster stock for several years  including an up and down 2018 that has EDR sitting on fractional losses for the year to date  That hasn t been helped much by a somewhat lackluster quarter for the period ended in March   the company s funds from operation  FFO  declined 5  year over year on a 1 5  drop in same community net operating income 
Also disappointing has been the dividend growth in this real estate name  The payout has improved by a modest 18  since 2014  with only penny per share hikes since 2015  Investors certainly will want to see better in mid July  when the company typically announces its annual improvement 
National Retail Properties Inc  NYSE NNN Dividend Yield  4 6 
National Retail Properties  NNN  is a so called  triple net lease  REIT that boasts 2 800 properties across 48 states and 37 industries  It s called a  triple net  lease because when it leases properties  it puts the triple onus of taxes  insurance and maintenance on the tenant  too  So while the REIT charges less overall  because it s not covering those expenses   it s a far more predictable revenue model because there s no guesswork as to what taxes will be in a given year  or what building issues will need to be addressed 
Like many retail REITs  National Retail Properties has been on the slide for a couple of years as the industry suffers the wrath of an ever encroaching Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  as well as other e commerce headwinds  That said  the damage hasn t been too bad simply because so many of NNN s tenants aren t direct competitors with Amazon  Consider that top tenants at the moment include companies such as 7 Eleven  Mister Car Wash and LA Fitness  As a result  funds from operation have actually been improving for years 
Dividend growth hasn t exactly been explosive  however  The company s payout has advanced by just 17  since 2014  And there s no reason to expect anything different in mid July  when the company is expected to deliver its 29th consecutive annual increase 
National Retail Properties  NNN  Is Making Money  Now It Needs to Give More Back 
Duke Energy  NYSE DUK Dividend Yield  4 9 
What list of dividend growth stocks would be complete without a utility stock 
Duke Energy  DUK  is a Charlotte  North Carolina based electric utility that serves roughly 7 6 million customers across 95 000 square miles of service area  and owns 49 500 megawatts of generating capacity 
This is one of the steadier dividends in the game  with Duke doling out a regular paycheck to investors for 92 consecutive years  And while it doesn t sport a particularly long dividend growth history compared to the likes of Southern Company  NYSE SO   it still has more than a decade under its belt and has improved its payout by about 14  since 2014  The next payout hike should come sometime in the first couple weeks of July 
The yield also is getting help from a 10  year to date decline   more than twice as worse as the utility sector as a whole 
Enterprise Products Partners LP  NYSE EPD Distribution Yield  5 9 
Energy master limited partnership  MLP  Enterprise Products Partners LP  EPD  has built an impressive income resume that includes 55 consecutive quarterly distribution increases  And that streak should extend to 56 consecutive quarters sometime in the first full week of July 
It s likely to be a token increase  mind you  since it makes four such improvements in any given year  It also doesn t add up a ton   the company s distribution has inflated by just 22  since the start of 2014 
EPD is one of the largest energy partnerships in the world  boasting roughly 50 000 miles of natural gas  NGL  crude oil  refined products and petrochemical pipelines  not to mention storage facilities  processing plants and other assets 
It s also no slouch  producing record net income  gross operating margin and adjusted EBITDA during its most recently reported quarter 
Step 3  Earn 12  Annual Returns For Life 
Robust dividend growth separates the winners from the losers 
And I m not just talking about the stocks 
Low dividend growth goes hand in hand with slow and no growth   and even eventual decay  Hitch your wagon to the supposedly  safe  blue chips that most financial pundits shill for  and you ll quickly be looking for part time work a few years into your retirement 
If you want to retire fully funded and worry free  it ll take more   a lot more  In fact  it ll take 12  in safe  annual returns

These stock picks will each reap at least 12  in annual returns   the magic number you need to meet to ensure the worry free retirement you ve labored so hard for decades to reach 
My  12  for Life  portfolio ditches pundit favorites such as Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   Coca Cola Company  NYSE KO  or General Mills  NYSE GIS    yes  the same General Mills that has lost a quarter of its value this year    and relies on these kind of picks instead 

One stock that has juiced its dividend 800  plus in just four years  and has at least another decade of double digit growth ahead of it 
A high growth  high yield  double threat  stock that threw off 252  gains the last time it was this cheap 
A 9  plus payer that hikes its payout multiple times a year  and is on track to double its payout by 2021 

Income  Dividend growth  Capital gains  Even nest egg protection  This all weather portfolio is a diversified powerhouse that provides three times more income than most retirement experts say you need  while being built to be more durable against retirement shattering downturns like in 2007 09 
I don t want you to ever have to worry about how you ll pay next month s bills in retirement  With this portfolio  you won t have to  In fact  you ll be able to pay all your monthly expenses from dividend income alone  with enough left over for the convertible  the new master bedroom or the island vacation   all those extras you should be enjoying in retirement

35649,257164,SJM,5  Cash Cow  Dividend Aristocrats Paying Up To 6 ,opinion,"S P 500 Dividend Aristocrats are great if you ve already owned them for many years or decades  These stocks have raised their payouts for 25 straight years or more  Since share prices rise as their underlying dividends rise  these stocks have showered investors with 500  to 1 000  returns or better 
BUT   if you re looking for yield today   Club Aristocrat  is a tough place to find new income  On average  these stocks pay 2 2   This means you can put a million dollars into them and collect only  22 000 per year   yikes 
Instead let s consider the High Yield Dividend Aristocrats  This group of roughly 110 S P Composite 1500 stocks has paid and improved dividends for at least 20 consecutive years  That s a slightly lower threshold for inclusion than the S P 500 Aristocrats  but the group does yield a bit more on average  and the larger selection includes several individual dividend payers that I want to highlight today 
Dividend growth is a vital component of any retirement portfolio  Yes  you need a high enough income yield to ensure you can pay the bills once your salary is gone   but dividend growth will ensure that inflation doesn t erode the buying power of those regular payouts  and ensure that you always have enough to live on 
Dividend growth also acts as a way to measure quality 
Consider a 2016 study from S P Dow Jones Indices on dividend growth strategies  which compares the S P 500 High Dividend Index  S P Composite 1500 and S P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats  Not only does this group of high yield royalty deliver payout growth   its stocks also boast more tenable debt to equity situations and far better earnings growth 

The same study shows how resilient High Yield Dividend Aristocrats are in down markets 

Long story short  On the whole  these high yield dividend growers can punch far above their weight  But  like with any group of stocks  you need to be selective   if they were all gems  no one would own anything else 
That said  here are the best and the worst of the High Yield Dividend Aristocrats 
People s United Financial Inc  NASDAQ PBCT  Dividend Yield  3 9 
People s United Financial  PBCT  is a mid cap regional bank stock that operates as People s United Bank  The bank boasts more than 300 branches across the Northeast   states such as Massachusetts  Vermont and Connecticut  among others 
There s nothing out of the ordinary about People s   it provides retail banking services such as checking and savings accounts  commercial banking and wealth management products 
But it s hard not to love what s underneath the hood  People s has rebounded well out of the 2007 09 bear market and financial crisis  and has grown its top and bottom lines each year since 2014  People s United is on track to finish 2017 up as well  and Wall Street analysts project more of the same going into 2018  Investors should feel even more optimistic about next year  as Jerome Powell   President Donald Trump s nominee to replace Janet Yellen as the Federal Reserve s chair   said he supports  tailoring  regulations to take some weight off the backs of smaller banks  which is good news for the likes of PBCT 
People s United also is a serial dividend raiser that has boosted its payout for 25 consecutive years  which actually makes it eligible for Dividend Aristocracy  Considering the prospects for better business  a potentially more friendly regulatory environment and tax cuts  PBCT should be able to keep its foot on the dividend pedal 
People s United  PBCT   Mid Size Stock  King Size Results 
Kimberly Clark  NYSE KMB  Dividend Yield  3 8 
Kimberly Clark  KMB  is one of the largest consumer staples companies on the planet  Its geographic reach spans roughly 175 countries  and the company claims that a quarter of the world s population uses KMB products such as Huggies diapers  Kleenex tissues and Scott paper towels 
That has helped the company deliver dividends for 84 consecutive years  including 46 straight years of improvements to the annual payout 
That s all well and good  And yes  it rarely pays to bet against consumer staples stocks  whose recession resistant wares and typically sturdy dividends will ensure that they stay afloat  KMB simply won t do the job 
Conscientious  mom sumers  are gravitating away from the likes of Kimberly Clark and toward companies such as Jessica Alba s Honest Co   which offer  non toxic  baby products  Thus  despite expanding economies in the U S  and across the globe  Kimberly s revenues have been thinning out for years  So has KMB stock  which is flat over the past three years while the broader market has ripped off 30  plus gains 
The company is expected to return to top line growth this year and next   but only in the low single digits  with some analysts still predicting even less 
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers Inc  NYSE SKT  Dividend Yield  6 0 
The past few years have been brutal for retail  with mall based operators such as JC Penney Company Inc Holding  NYSE JCP   Sears Holdings Corporation  NASDAQ SHLD   and Macy s Inc  NYSE M  plunging between 45  and 90  over the past three years as Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  sucks the life out of brick and mortar stores 
Retail REITs   some of which own the malls that are suffering from store closures and lower occupancy   have cracked  too  But a few babies are being thrown out with the bathwater 
Take Tanger Factory Outlet Centers  SKT   for instance 
Tanger owns  operates or has an ownership interest in 44 upscale outlet malls across 22 states  featuring stores that are diversified across 510 different companies   factory stores from Adidas  DE ADSGN   ADDYY  and Ecco to Kate Spade and Tumi 
SKT has had its own share of problems  off by about 25  over the past three years  But there still are a few things to like about this contrarian retail play  For one  those losses have juiced Tanger s dividend yield to decade plus highs  Moreover  the company still is managing to generate profits  including a 3  bump in FFO in its most recent quarterly report 
Investors should be cautious about the retail space  but the selloff in Tanger is grossly overdone  New money has a chance to jump into a quality  high yield name that doesn t face the exact same pressures as traditional mall retailers  and at a value price of less than 10 times adjusted FFO  Moreover  they ll be jumping into a company that recently qualified for inclusion in the Dividend Aristocrats with its 25th consecutive annual dividend increase 
Tanger s  SKT  Dividend Is a Buffer Against Retail Risk 
National Retail Properties Inc  NYSE NNN  Dividend Yield  4 3 
In the same vein is National Retail Properties  NNN   which actually is up about 2  to roughly match the broader market 
National Retail Properties is a retail centric REIT  yes  But this isn t a traditional mall operator   instead  the company focuses its energy on single tenant leases to businesses such as Sunoco gas stations  LA Fitness gyms  SunTrust Banks Inc  NYSE STI  banks  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc  NYSE AMC  and Frisch s restaurants 
You see any real potential Amazon victims there  I don t 
I also don t see an occupancy problem  either  Portfolio occupancy was 99 2  as of March 31   actually slightly up from both the prior quarter and the year ago quarter  Moreover  the company s average remaining lease still has 11 4 years left on it  so tenants are locked in 
Better still  first quarter FFO jumped 12  to 67 cents per share  prompting the company to actually upgrade its forecast for full year results 
Not bad for a  retail stock   right 
National Retail Properties operates via  net leases   which put the onus of things such as property taxes  insurance and repairs on the tenant   NNN simply cashes the rent check  which makes its operations far more consistent and predictable 
That business has helped National Retail Properties deliver 28 consecutive annual dividend hikes  The REIT s most recent upgrade was a 4 4  bump in its late July 2017 distribution  which means investors should soon expect another announcement for No  29 
JM Smucker Company  NYSE SJM  Dividend Yield  2 9 
It s no surprise that a consumer staples powerhouse such as JM Smucker  SJM  has achieved Aristocrat membership  After all  its portfolio of brands include its namesake jams  as well as Jif peanut butter and Crisco oils  are in theory no doubt winners that should enjoy some level of popularity no matter how the economy is doing 
Smucker also made what appeared to be a smart gamble by diving headfirst into pet foods via several acquisitions  That started with the  3 2 billion purchase of Big Heart Pet Brands in 2015  and also includes its 2018 purchase of Ainsworth Pet Nutrition LLC   which owns Rachel Ray s Nutrish brand   for  1 7 billion 
Yet SJM shares have essentially been dead money for half a decade  and likely will continue to tread water  as the company keeps running into land mines 
For one  the stock dipped hard in the early June following a dreadful fiscal fourth quarter earnings report  which showed weakness in core areas such as peanut butter and oils  Adjusted EPS of  1 93 were well short of estimates for  2 19  while sales declined to  1 781 billion and also missed analyst expectations of  1 784 billion  Its fiscal 2019 guidance was the biggest whiff  however  with a profit range of  8 40  8 65 missing the  9 18 Wall Street mark 
JM Smucker  SJM  Just Can t Get Anything to Stick 
J M  Smucker also can t seem to  find itself   In March  the FTC challenged a deal to buy Wesson cooking oils from ConAgra Foods Inc  NYSE CAG   prompting SJM to kill the deal  Then in April  the company announced it was  reviewing strategic options   read  looking to sell  its baking division  which includes once bulletproof brands such as Pillsbury  Hungry Jack and Jim Dandy 
Smucker still has some powerhouse name brands  but it s no longer offering the same promise of stability that it once did 
A 3 Step Process for 100   Dividend Growth Returns 
Despite the bigger nominal payouts  High Yield Dividend Aristocrats aren t necessarily any better than their  normal  brethren  In fact  the very best dividend stocks rarely show high yields because their prices keep rising in line with the increasing payments 
Most people never realize this  But those of us who DO stand to profit handsomely and almost automatically 
It s a simple three step process 
Step 1  You invest a set amount of money into one of these  hidden yield  stocks and immediately start getting regular returns on the order of 3   4   or maybe more 
That alone is better than you can get from just about any other conservative investment right now 
Step 2  Over time  your dividend payments go up so you re eventually earning 8   9   or 10  a year on your original investment 
That should not only keep pace with inflation or rising interest rates  it should stay ahead of them 
Step 3  As your income is rising  other investors are also bidding up the price of your shares to keep pace with the increasing yields 
This combination of rising dividends and capital appreciation is what gives you the potential to earn 12  or more on average with almost no effort or active investing at all 
I ve scoured thousands of stocks out there right now  looking for the very best companies that have both rising dividends and strong buyback programs in place   the kind of stocks that could easily spin off annual total returns of 12   17   even 25  or more   doubling your money in very short order 
Right now  at this very moment  there are 7 in particular that I think you should consider buying 
They stand to do well no matter what the broad market does   regardless of what happens in Washington   and irrespective of interest rate trends

At 15 31GMT or 11 31AM ET  the Dow 30 retreated 72 points  or 0 40   the S P 500 fell 9 points  or 0 44   while the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite gave up 21 points  or 0 42  
After the World Bank cut its 2016 global growth forecast on Wednesday  citing  sluggish growth in advanced economies  stubbornly low commodity prices  weak global trade  and diminishing capital flows   billionaire investors came out of the woodwork to warn about equity valuations in a sluggish global environment 
A Wall Street Journal report after the prior session s close revealed that the billionaire investor George Soros had returned to trading with large  bearish investments 
The financial newspaper quoted people close to the matter as stating that Soros was concerned about the outlook for the global economy and was looking to profit from what he expected to be economic troubles 
On Thursday  fellow billionaire investor Carl Icahn backed Soros  idea  saying that stock valuations were being propped up 
 I don t think you can have zero interest rates for much longer without having these bubbles explode on you   Icahn warned in an interview with CNBC 
With the blackout period for Federal Reserve  Fed  officials in full effect ahead of the June 14 15 monetary policy meeting  eyes focused on European Central Bank  ECB  president Mario Draghi who painted a somber picture of the euro area economy 
In a dire speech delivered in the Brussels Economic Forum  Draghi promised that the ECB would not undershoot its inflation objection for longer than is avoidable  but urged governments to ensure that  output is returned to potential before subpar growth causes lasting damage  
The warning came on the back of gloomy data from Japan where core machinery orders tumbled 11   suggesting that weak business investment will probably continue to persist throughout 2016 
In Germany  exports stagnated in April  though the read was better than the forecast for a 0 6  decline 
However  economic news was brighter stateside as weekly jobless claims showed a continued firming of the U S  labor market  removing some of the bad taste left from Friday s dismal employment report 
Additionally  April wholesale inventories recorded their largest increase in 10 months which could imply a boost to economic growth in the second quarter 
In any case  financial markets continued to rule out a June rate hike from the U S  central bank with Fed fund futures putting the odds at just 3 8  and the first move not priced in until the December 14 decision 
That said  a Reuters poll released on Thursday showed that about 80  of economists surveyed predicted that the Fed would raise rates at either the July or the September meeting 
In big moves on earnings  Restoration Hardware Holdings Inc  NYSE RH  tumbled 20  after quarterly earnings disappointed and guidance came in far under consensus

110015,331530,SJM,U S  stocks higher as low volatility in equities is compensated by oil,news,"Investing com   Wall Street moved higher on Tuesday  with the Nasdaq marking a record intraday high and the S P hovering just below  while all the lack of movement in stocks continued to be compensated by another wild swing in oil prices 
At 16 03GMT  or 12 03ET  the Dow 30 gained 23 points  or 0 13   the S P 500 rose 6 points  or 0 30   while the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite traded up 19 points  or 0 36  
Trade continued to be light in equities with NYSE volume near the year s low with experts pointing to summer vacation as well as caution ahead of Federal Reserve  Fed  chair Janet Yellen s speech at Jackson Hole on Friday as the main culprits for the lack of movement  The S P 500 hasn t closed with a 1  move since July 8 
As evidence of the lack of movement  not only has the S P 500 not had a close with a 1  move in either direction since July 8  but only five days out the last 30 saw the global equity benchmark move by more than 0 5   the lowest since the fall of 1995 
The dollar was lower against most of the major currencies on Tuesday  including the yen  euro and pound  as markets looked ahead to Yellen s appearance in the hopes that it could shed light on the timing of a U S interest rate hike 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a trade weighted basket of six major currencies  slipped 0 03  to 94 49 by 16 05GMT  or 12 05ET  pulling back from the prior session s high of 94 94 but still keeping distance from last week s eight week low of 94 05 
Data was mixed on Tuesday with July new home sales blew past consensus with its largest rise since October 2007 
However  Markit s preliminary manufacturing PMI for August showed that activity in the sector slowed more than expected 
Still  the research group s chief economist Chris Williamson pointed to the fact that  taken with the data from July  the third quarter was showing the best growth so far this year 
 Policymakers will therefore be pleased to see signs that the economy may have picked up speed in the third quarter  but the Fed looks unlikely to tighten policy again until the upturn has stronger foundations  suggesting any interest rate rise looks unlikely before December   Williamson concluded 
According to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool  investors are pricing in an 18  chance of a rate hike by September  up from 12  at the start of last week before several Fed officials declared that an increase was on the table for the next meeting  December odds had slipped back to 48 8   barely passing the 50  threshold for the February 2017 meeting 
Meanwhile  oil prices staged an impressive turnaround  swinging more than a dollar as hopes for an agreement among major oil producers to stabilize production resurfaced 
All the volatility lacking in equities in the last 30 days could be found in U S  crude with the barrel of West Texas Intermediate chalking up a move of less than 1  in either direction on only five occasions 
Early losses spurred by a Goldman Sachs report pointing to the fact that a  production freeze would also likely prove self defeating  vanished on Tuesday as a Reuters report cited sources stating that Iran was willing to join in on OPEC action to stabilize markets 
The euphoria wiped out the losses that had taken West Texas and Brent to an intraday low of  46 62 and  48 49  respectively  despite indications from other Reuter s sources that admitted that even if there was an agreement  producers would not commit to sticking to it 
U S  crude futures gained 0 57  to  47 69 by 16 03GMT  or 12 03ET  while Brent oil traded up 0 90  to  49 60

On the flip side  we remain hopeful about Dean Foods  cost productivity program  which is expected to generate additional savings in 2018 and beyond  These savings are likely to offset some negative impacts from volume declines and higher non dairy input costs  Notably  this productivity program focuses on enhancing its supply chain network  optimizing spending across all key categories to ensure greater efficiency and  minimize general and administrative expenses  While some savings are expected to reflect in 2018  the company anticipates increased savings in 2019 and beyond Additionally  the company s OpEx 2020 cost productivity plan introduced in 2017 looks encouraging  Under this plan  the company had targeted annual productivity of  80  100 million  Going ahead  this plan will be extended to the company s manufacturing and logistics footprint alongside targeting reduction in SG A expenses Although Dean Foods  cost saving efforts look appeasing  unfortunately it might be unable to offset the headwinds in the near term  So  let s wait and see what lies in the company s fate when it reports first quarter 2018 results Zacks Model Our proven model does not show that Dean Foods is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Dean Foods has an Earnings ESP of  7 54  and a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   which make surprise prediction inconclusive As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat Flowers Foods  Inc    NYSE FLO   has an Earnings ESP of  3 85  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  Hostess Brands  Inc    NASDAQ TWNK   has an Earnings ESP of  10 87  and a Zacks Rank of 3  The J  M  Smucker Company   NYSE SJM   has an Earnings ESP of  0 48  and a Zacks Rank  3 5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia  AIDS  muscular dystrophy  hemophilia  and other conditions New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline  Early investors could realize exceptional profits ",2018-05-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-higher-milk-costs-weigh-on-dean-foods-df-q1-earnings-200312306,200312306

110090,331605,SJM,Is J  M  Smucker  SJM  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The J  M  Smucker Company   NYSE SJM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  J  M  Smucker has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 9  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 22 1  If we focus on the long term PE trend  J  M  Smucker s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that J  M  Smucker has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 15 4  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for J  M  Smucker stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  J  M  Smucker has a P S ratio of about 1 8  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  SJM is towards the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  J  M  Smucker currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes J  M  Smucker a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 10 6  which is better than the industry average of 13 3  Clearly  SJM is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though J  M  Smucker might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of A  This gives SJM a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current fiscal quarter as well as the fiscal full year has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower As a result  the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has risen by nearly 1  in the past two months  while the fiscal full year estimate has inched up by 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below J M  Smucker Company  The  Price and Consensus    Even though J  M  Smucker has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineJ  M  Smucker is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a robust industry rank  among the Top 44   should boost investor confidence However over the past two years  the industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite the poor past performance of the industry  a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in J  M  Smucker More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1

fiscal 2018  respectively  and also raises concerns over the upcoming performance Final Thoughts   Q4 Expectations in NumbersNevertheless  the company remains encouraged about its ongoing performance  as reflected in its raised earnings guidance for fiscal 2018 and favorable comps view for the fourth quarter  In the quarter to be reported  Walmart expects both U S  comps  excluding fuel  and Sam s

110100,331615,SJM,Can Buyouts   Cost Savings Aid McCormick s  MKC  Q1 Earnings ,opinion,McCormick   Company Inc    NYSE MKC   is slated to report first quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 27  before the opening bell  We note that the company s bottom line results outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimates in the preceding four quarters  with an average surprise of 4 3   Incidentally  the company s well chalked buyouts  product innovations and efficiency enhancing initiatives have been yielding well With these in mind  let s delve into how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement and see if his leading distributor of spices  seasonings and other specialty food products can maintain its positive earnings surprise streak Expansion Efforts Aid Consumer   Industrial BusinessesAcquisitions have long been favoring McCormick s performance  aiding the company to develop a robust product portfolio and strengthen its base business  To this end  McCormick s buyout of the food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc in August 2017 deserves special mention  Apart from adding iconic brands to McCormick s portfolio  the deal has been aiding sales growth in the company s industrial and consumer business segments for a while Looking back  the company s past acquisitions have played a significant role in bolstering its performance  Some of the noteworthy buyouts of the company include Italy based Enrico Giotti SpA  Dec 2016  and Australia based Botanical Food Company  April 2016   Markedly  additional sales from buyouts of RB Foods  Giotti and Gourmet Garden contributed 6  to the company s constant currency sales growth in fiscal 2017  Also  management expects additional sales from RB Foods to contribute 8  to fiscal 2018 sales growth Apart from acquisitions  McCormick regularly undertakes innovations to add new products to its portfolio  stay competitive and tap the evolving demand for new flavors  spices and herbs   Notably  the company s innovation agenda is primarily based on the health and wellness of consumers at large  The company is planning to offer innovative flavors in breakfast platform and ready to serve gravies  McCormick is also shaping up portfolio with gluten free  non GMO and organic products to cater to the evolving needs of consumers  In 2016  the company renovated its core products with non GMO labeling on everyday spices and seasonings Such constant growth endeavors have indeed aided in radically expanding and bolstering the company s consumer and industrial business segments  To top it  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales related to consumer and industrial business segments for the first quarter i currently pegged at  762 and  480 million  respectively  The consensus mark depicts a growth of approximately 19 2  and 18 5  from the prior year reported figures Enhancing Savings Via the CCI ProgramMcCormick focuses on saving costs and enhancing productivity through its ongoing Comprehensive Continuous Improvement  CCI  program  The program has enabled the company to increase investments  which has been leading to higher sales and profits  Notably  cost savings through CCI and streamlining actions reached  117 million in fiscal 2017  up from  109 million in fiscal 2016  McCormick is on track with its four year targeted savings of around  400 million by November 2019 Notably  cost savings from CCI helped the company deliver double digit adjusted operating income growth in fourth quarter fiscal 2017  The adjusted operating margin expanded 220 basis points  bps   marking the eighth consecutive quarter of margin improvement  Further  gross margin increased 180 bps in the fourth quarter and is likely to expand in the range of 150 20 bps in fiscal 2018  The company projects adjusted operating income growth in the range of 23 25  in fiscal 2018  with plans to achieve cost savings of  100 million   Hurdles Yet to Be CrossedAlthough the company has been progressing well with savings and business expansion plans  higher input costs have been hurting McCormick s performance of late  In fact  higher raw material costs  along with increased brand marketing and freight expenses also affected the company s performance in the fourth quarter  In fiscal 2018  the company expects material costs to escalate in low single digits  Nevertheless  we expect these downsides to adequately be cushioned by the company s CCI program and efficient pricing strategies McCormick   Company  Incorporated Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   What Picture Do Estimates Provide  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter has been stable over the past thirty days at 91 cents  Expected earnings for the quarter under review depicts a rise of 19 7   from the prior year reported figures Further  analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of  1 235 million for the first quarter  reflecting an improvement of 18 3  from the year ago period sales figure A Look at the Zacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively show that McCormick is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have a positive  and a

Revenue and Margin Details
Net sales in the quarter declined 1  year over year to  1 784 billion  The fall was due to lower net price realization mostly in the U S  Retail Pet Foods segment and unfavorable volume mix in the U S  Retail Coffee segment  partially offset by higher net pricing on coffee and fruit spreads  Net sales however beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 775 billion by 5 1

U S  Retail Pet Foods  Segment net sales were  534 5 million in the quarter  which represented a 5  year over year decline  due to lower net price realization  Volume mix also reduced net sales by 1  as gains for the Nature s Recipe and Milk Bone brands were more than offset by declines across the rest of the portfolio  most notably 9Lives and Meow Mix cat food 
Segment profit declined 15  to  48 4 million due to decline in sales and increased distribution expense  partially offset by lower input costs 
International and Foodservice  Net sales in the International and Foodservice segment increased 4  from the prior year quarter to  269 6 million  as lower net price realization and currency headwinds was somewhat offset by favorable volume mix  Segment profit also grew 26  to  48 4 million driven by favorable volume mix J M  Smucker Company  The  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

110166,331681,SJM,Smucker  SJM  Hits 52 Week Low  What s Hurting The Stock ,opinion,The J  M  Smucker Company   NYSE SJM   hit a 52 week low of  117 47 on Jun 30  closing at  118 33  Poor coffee volumes  unfavorable pricing and sluggish pet food sales have been weakening the revenues and earnings of this firm Additionally  a bearish near term outlook provided during the fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results has put pressure on the stock  This is well reflected in the company s bearish share price movement for the last three months  Let s delve deeper into the factors which have been affecting Smucker s performance  in order to understand why its shares are performing dismally and whether there are any hopes of improvement Factors Impacting Performance The U S  Retail Coffee Market is Smucker s biggest revenue generating segment  Of late  this segment has been battling with lower volume mix due to reduced volume for the Folgers brand  as a result of escalating coffee costs  We note that Smucker s performance is adversely affected by the highly volatile coffee prices which remain susceptible to aspects such as political decisions in coffee producing countries  worldwide supply and demand  relative strength of the U S  dollar  as well as speculative trading  A hike in coffee price leads the company to raise the pricing of its branded roast and ground coffee offerings  which thereby erodes its sales volume Smucker s Pet Food business has been facing several challenges  Heightened competitive activity from more premium brands and challenges in dry dog food against a deflationary macro environment is weighing over the Kibbles  n Bits brand s performance  Sourcing challenges have also posed a concern in this segment The introduction of Nature s Recipe premium pet food in second quarter fiscal 2017 is anticipated to stabilize the Kibbles  n Bits brand  as well as benefit the entire dog food portfolio  However  the rest of the Pet Foods business  top line performance remains a concern  In fact  the company expects soft Pet Food sales in the near term  Smucker s international business performance also remains under pressure due to currency headwinds Dismal Fourth Quarter ResultsThough Smucker posted better than expected earnings and revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter  the figures were down on a year over year basis  While earnings fell 19  year over year due to lower revenues and decline in gross profits  sales edged down 1  due to lower net price realization  mostly in the U S  Retail Pet Foods segment  and unfavorable volume mix in the U S  Retail Coffee segment  However  this decline was partially offset by higher net pricing on coffee and fruit spreads  Lower volume mix also pulled down gross margins of the company In addition  the company expects its earnings to decline due to softness in the coffee and pet foods segments  moving ahead  A lower volume and mix  and increased competitive activity in the pet foods segment are likely to dent Smucker s bottom line growth  Further  management expects elevated commodity costs  mainly in coffee  protein meals  and peanuts and oil  to constrain the company s margins  Also  increased marketing spending to support product launches  like Nature s Recipe  will take a toll on EPS growth Share Price PerformanceWe also observed that Smucker has underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the past three months  During the said time frame  the company s shares fell approximately 9 5  compared to the industry s decline of 3 8  Bottom LineSmucker remains hopeful that its cost reduction initiatives  combined with the restructuring and innovation related efforts  would improve the company s performance in the near term  Furthermore  the company expects to gain from its strategic partnerships  over the long run  Nevertheless  headwinds such as unfavorable volume mix and sluggish pet food sales are expected to thwart its performance  going ahead Smucker

110170,331685,SJM,Smucker Hikes Dividend By 4  To Boost Shareholder Value,opinion,"Despite softness in the coffee and pet foods segments  The J  M  Smucker Company   NYSE SJM    has managed to keep its shareholders happy through regular dividend payments 
The board of directors recently approved an increase of 4  in its quarterly dividend  from  0 75 to  0 78 per common share  The dividend will be paid on Sep 1 to shareholders held in record at the close of business on Aug 11  This represents the company s 16th consecutive year of dividend growth 
However  the dividend growth rate was lower when compared with year ago numbers  Smucker increased its quarterly dividend by 12  in 2016  by 5  in 2015  by 10  in 2014 and by 11 5  in 2013 
In addition to dividend payment  the company actively repurchases shares  During the fourth quarter fiscal 2017  the company completed the 3 million share repurchase program that was announced in February 
In fiscal 2017  the company returned over  775 million in the form of share repurchases and dividends  up from  750 million of cash returned to shareholders last year  reflecting strong cash flow  In fact  in the last five fiscal years  the company has returned over  3 1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 
Stock Price Performance and Estimates Revision
If we look into the company s share price performance over the past six months  we will notice that shares of Smucker underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry  In the said time frame  shares of the company have declined 12 5   compared with the industry s fall of 5 3   Challenging coffee and pet foods segments seems to have pressurized the stock 

Moreover  the fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results of Smucker were not quite impressive  While earnings during the quarter fell 19  year over year due to lower revenues and decline in gross profits  sales edged down 1  due to lower net price realization  The fall was witnessed in the U S  Retail Pet Foods segment and an unfavorable mix in the U S  Retail Coffee segment 
The dismal quarterly performance has also lowered analysts  expectations  Estimates for the first quarter and for fiscal 2018 have gone down by a penny to reach  1 67 and  7 97 respectively  over the last 30 days 
Bottom Line
Despite such unfavorable trends  we are encouraged with Smucker s acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brand  the launch of Dunkin Donuts K cup pods and expanded distribution for the Natural Balance pet brand which are fueling sales  The company remains focused on expanding its business though sustained innovation  cost cutting initiatives and efforts to expand e commerce sales  Smucker currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and carries a long term growth rate of 7 3

underscoring confidence in its growth prospects Adjusted earnings for the second quarter came in at  2 05 per share  which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 94 and jumped about 7  year over

for the second quarter was  28 5 million  whereas the same came in at  60 5 million for the first half of the fiscal year  Further  the company remains on track to achieve  100 million of incremental synergies in fiscal 2017 Revenue and Margin DetailsNet sales in the quarter declined 8  year over year to  1 913 9 million due to the divested U S  canned milk business  Excluding the divested business and currency headwinds  net sales dropped 5   This fall was attributable to lower net price realization resulting from lower net pricing on coffee  Unfavorable volume mix  owing to the U S  Retail Pet Foods segment and the Folgers and Jif brands  also contributed to lower net sales  Moreover  net sales lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 001 million Adjusted gross profit dropped 3  due to lower net pricing  which was somewhat offset by a reduction in commodity and manufacturing overhead expenses  coupled with additional synergies Adjusted operating profit  however  inched up 0 5  to  396 2 million owing to lower selling  distribution and administrative expenses Segment PerformanceU S  Retail Coffee Market  The company s biggest segment  U S  Retail Coffee Market  reported a 6  slump in sales to  551 8 million  This was attributable to lower net price realization  which in turn mainly stemmed from lower list price of coffee  Further  sales were hampered by unfavorable

million due to the U S  canned milk divestiture  Excluding the impact of the divestiture  net sales decreased 4   The decline reflected lower net price realization and unfavorable volume mix that in turn was primarily attributable to weakness witnessed across Pillsbury and Jif brands  partly compensated by benefits from Smucker s Uncrustables frozen sandwiches Segment profit fell 7  to  118 9 million  primarily due to the loss of U S  canned milk profits U S  Retail Pet Foods  Segment net sales were  531 million in the quarter  which represented a 6  year over year decline  due to unfavorable volume mix stemming from softness in Kibbles  n Bits and Meow Mix brands  A slight decline in net price realization also contributed to the decrease in net sales Segment profit slipped 0 5  to  114 5 million as benefits from synergy realization  lower manufacturing and marketing expense were countered by the impact of unfavorable volume mix International and Foodservice  Net sales in the International and Foodservice segment decreased 3  from the prior year quarter to  273 8 million  due to lower net price realization and the divested U S  canned milk business  This was somewhat offset by favorable volume mix Segment profit fell 7  to  51 7 million  bearing the brunt of the divested business and unfavorable pricing and costs  However  this too was partly compensated by

The Conference Board s Index of Leading Economic Indicators  LEI  was up 0 6  month over month  m m  in January  above the Bloomberg projection to match December s unrevised 0 5  gain  Support came from the components pertaining to the yield curve  building permits  jobless claims  ISM new orders and consumer expectations

The stock markets paused near record high territory  Treasury yields gave back some of their recent jumps and the U S  dollar rebounded from losses as of late  The global markets continue to grapple with resurfaced optimism regarding President Donald Trump s reflationary policy promises  along with lingering trade and immigration concerns  Moreover continued solid economic data  including signs of inflation heating up  and this week s hawkish Congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen  are keeping the possibility of a March rate hike on the table

Europe mixed to close out the week  Asia mostly lower as global market rally stalls 
European equities finished mixed on the heels of yesterday s pullback from a recent rally  and amid festering uncertainty regarding the political fronts in the U S  and Europe  The markets appeared to assess the global rally that ushered in all time highs in the U S   bolstered by U S  President Donald Trump s reflationary policy pledges  notably tax reform  Key elections loom on the horizon for the eurozone  which continued to hamstring sentiment  However  shares of Unilever jumped on the news of Kraft Heinz s merger proposal  which helped lift the consumer goods sector and UK stocks  though technology  financials and oil   gas issues led to the downside 
In economic news  UK retail sales missed expectations for January  The euro and British pound lost ground as the U S  dollar rebounded from a two day pullback  while bond yields in the region finished mixed

Stocks post another weekly rally to all time highs  housing data due out next week
U S  stocks headlined a global market rally for the week  posting more record highs as sentiment continued to shift focus to President Donald Trump s pledged reflationary policies  highlighted by last week s promise of a  phenomenal  tax plan in the coming weeks  This helped overshadow lingering political uneasiness toward U S  trade and immigration and the looming key elections in Europe  Moreover  the economic front continued to suggest the economy is heating up  with retail sales easily topping forecasts  regional manufacturing output surging  small business optimism remaining at the highest since December 2004  and housing construction activity besting forecasts  This appeared to help the markets absorb a sign that the possibility of a March Fed rate hike remains on the table delivered by this week s semi annual monetary Congressional testimony from Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen 
Volatility in the currency and bond markets ensued  with the dollar index finishing little changed following a mid week stumble  while Treasury yields nudged higher in choppy action  Stocks also showed some resiliency in the face of hotter than expected reads on consumer and producer price inflation  Earnings season continued to roll on but reached the home stretch as 411 companies have reported out of the S P 500  So far  about 74  have topped earnings estimates  while 52  have exceeded sales projections  per data compiled by Bloomberg 
The holiday shortened economic calendar next week will still bring a plethora of key reports for the markets to consider when grappling with whether a March rate hike is in the offing  Housing will be in focus  courtesy of January existing and new home sales reports  while national business activity will be on display as Markit will release its preliminary February looks at manufacturing and services sector output  Rounding out the week  we will get the final University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index and the minutes from the Fed s monetary policy meeting that concluded with an unchanged decision on February 1st 
Investor caution is rising  which contrarily should help the bull market continue  Economic data has continued to beat expectations  but the number of upside surprises may start to level off  and investor enthusiasm toward potential new policies from Washington could wane as political realities set in  If economic data continues to surprise on the upside  a March rate hike is likely to be on the table  while there is an additional risk that the Fed may be forced to speed up the tightening process should inflation accelerate from here

110218,331733,SJM,Smuckers Misses On Revenues  Where Is Support And What Can We Learn ,opinion,"JM Smucker Company  NYSE SJM  reported a miss on revenues while maintaining it s EPS outlook  The shares are down about 8  today  I ve long been a fan  and a shareholder  Strong balance sheet  that s been a steady and consistent out performer  in a  safe  industry 
The stocks had quite a run up leading into today s earnings  It was up 26  YTD and even after today s drop it s still outperforming the S P 500  at 7 61  YTD  by a wide margin  The company has a long successful track record to allow one quarter to derail any of that  In my opinion this has more to do with the run up leading into this report  It s great to see a stock you already own go  parabolic   But oftentimes that just means investors are pulling future returns forward into the present and the result is usually either sub par performance going forward  as the prior gains are  digested   or worse  a major swing high before a significant pullback  as the stock asset class becomes significantly overvalued  
A major daily move like this is almost never resolved in one day  Which leads me to believe there will be further downside in the days weeks to come  Projected support comes in at  132 and  120 respectively  If your bullish on the stock  these might be good price points to enter 
Perhaps the better question is what can we learn from this  While there is no one perfect way to invest or trade  this is what has worked for me 

Never chase momentum

Nothing goes up  or down  forever  Patience is critical to successful investing and it s one of the hardest elements to master  A stock actually becomes more risky the higher it goes and less risky the lower it goes  This goes against our natural instincts but it s the truth 
2  Never over allocate to any one individual company
How many blue chip companies over the last 50 years are no longer relevant  My personal rule is to never allocate more than 5  to any one individual company  This way even a 50  drop in the company s stock would only have a 2 5  effect on your total portfolio There are some great companies that look like they may be around forever  But the truth is no one knows what the future holds with any certainty  Don t allow your pride to make you think otherwise 
3  Equal weightings for all companies in your portfolio
While this is not a hard and fast rule for me  I do think the theme is relevant  This sort of piggy backs off of  2  I m not interested in trying to figure out what company may or may not outperform the other each and every year  To me this is a classic  paralysis by over analysis  and I think it does more harm than good  When you overweight certain stocks over another it becomes more emotional  You become more emotionally connected in the outcome of the stock and this can make for some bad judgement calls  Locate some good companies and buy them at good prices and in equal size portions  Let the chips fall as they may  After all there is much outside of our control in the short term anyway 
4  Stay balanced
There is much debate between passive and active management  The problem I find is that most people take one side over the other and become entrenched in that viewpoint  Personally I think both sides have excellent points and I use a combination of passive index ETF s and active stock picking in my approach 
There is a growing trend in this  buy and hold forever  philosophy  This is mainly the product of a seven year bull market  Investors can certainly do better than this approach but it takes time and effort  nothing good is easy

110220,331735,SJM,4 Great Dividend Stocks In The Consumer Staples Sector,opinion,"The consumer staples sector has been performing really well among most product categories over the past few months  despite tepid economic figures  Brexit aftershocks  the Federal Reserve s reluctance to hike rates and other global growth issues 
Further  lower gas prices and increasing consumer confidence are doing the trick for these stocks  Also  the sector has the potential to counter headwinds stemming from the global market turmoil and continued volatility in the equity market 
We note that the GDP has expanded at a slower rate in the second quarter than earlier estimated  thus leading to concerns about the health of the economy  However  the largest contributor to U S  GDP  consumer spending  experienced a significant upward revision  In fact  there is enough evidence to suggest that a strong rebound is likely in the third quarter  owing to improved residential construction and strong labor market conditions  Meanwhile  the reduction in business inventories  the primary culprit when it comes to a fall in estimated GDP  is expected to give a boost to the industry as it will result in a buildup of fresh inventories 
The Winning Strategy
In the face of prevailing economic conditions  we believe investors should be very careful about their strategy  Thus  investing in the consumer staples stocks is safe because of their defensive nature 
With the U S  economy picking up steam  investors should venture into dividend stocks  Not only do these stocks offer higher income in the current low rate environment but also provide a cushion against equity market risks 
Moreover  dividend stocks are historically less volatile and are proven outperformers over the long term  These stocks are a safe bet as dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty

This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved lower by 4 8  in the past four weeks  And with the recent moving average crossover  investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for SJM stock 
If that wasn t enough  J  M  Smucker isn t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either  It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately  which is usually not a good sign of things to come 
Consider that in the last 30 days  2 estimates have been reduced  while none have moved higher  Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate  and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here

The packaged food manufacturer delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the past four quarters with an average surprise of 4 46  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement KRAFT HEINZ CO Price and EPS Surprise
   Factors to Consider
Kraft Heinz has been seeing top line weakness over several past quarters  The company is witnessing lower volumes and share losses in the U S  due to weak category trends  Reduced spending by the U S  shoppers and a shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food has been hurting the company s business  Category trends and market share performance are likely to remain under pressure in the second quarter and through the rest of 2016 
Despite relatively soft sales  cost savings have led to better margins  primarily in the developed markets of the U S  and Europe  We expect the trend to continue in the second quarter  A part of these savings are being re invested in the business for innovation  brand building and marketing to stimulate top line growth 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Kraft Heinz is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below

Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Unfavorable currency has been a concern for Nu Skin s revenues since quite some time  Last quarter  currency fluctuations negatively impacted sales by 5   For the second quarter  revenues are expected in a range of  560 million to  580 million  assuming a negative foreign currency impact of approximately 4  
On a constant currency basis  revenues are expected to increase in a range of 6  to 8  in the second quarter  with earnings in the band of 75 79 cents per share  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 79 cents per share is at the higher end of the guided range 
In addition  multi level marketer Nu Skin has been witnessing a decline in Greater China since the past few quarters  This is a concern as the company generates more than a third of its total revenue from the region  which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong  Last quarter  the company witnessed a sales decline in all the geographic regions  except EMEA  on a constant currency basis  owing to lower than expected sales of cosmetic oils as well as difficult economic conditions 
Another concern is the regulatory steps undertaken by the company in mainland China to review a legal issue  This is also negatively impacting sales in the region 
Moreover  we note that China has always been suspicious about direct selling companies like Nu Skin and Herbalife Ltd    NYSE HLF    Both these companies employ sales representatives to sell products and are always closely watched by rivals and regulators  They face accusations like focusing more on recruiting instead of selling products and running a pyramid business model i e  employing deceptive marketing practices for improving business 
Nevertheless  Nu Skin plans to continue to roll out ageLOC Me and ageLOC Youth in the second quarter  with more products in the second half of the year 
In the second quarter  the company will offer limited time deals of ageLOC Me in Greater China and ageLOC Youth in South Asia  and launch ageLOC Me on a full time basis in Japan NU SKIN ENTERP Price and EPS Surprise   Earnings Whispers

Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for Nu Skin is 0 00  as both the Most Accurate Estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 79 cents

Earnings Beat
Second quarter adjusted earnings of 91 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents by 1 1   Earnings dipped 1 1  year over year due to significant currency headwinds 
Excluding currency headwinds of 9 cents  mostly from the Venezuela business   earnings increased 8 7  year over year primarily driven by better profit margin performance in North America

Volumes declined 1 6   more than 0 7  drop in the previous quarter  On the other hand  price mix added 10 2  to sales  better than 7 3  last quarter  due to accelerating levels of inflation in Venezuela

The improved cereal trends witnessed in the fourth quarter of 2015 could not be sustained in the first two quarters of 2016 though the company continued to gain market share

In order to improve sales performance  Kellogg launched campaigns supporting the breakfast occasion  It is also investing in in store capabilities  product and packaging innovation as well as reformulation of many existing products to drive demand  Specifically  the company completely redesigned the Special K brand and re launched it as a healthy lifestyle brand to cater to changing consumer trends

2016 Outlook Raised
The company has raised its guidance for earnings and operating profit in 2016 owing to better than expected first half profit in inflationary Venezuela  and an increased forecast for operating profit margin for the rest of the business  However  it has trimmed its sales outlook 
Net sales growth  excluding Venezuela  is now expected at the low end of the previously guided range of flat to 2  growth  Currency is expected to have a more negative impact due to further weakening in currency exchange rates for Venezuela and for other currencies  particularly in the aftermath of Britain s vote to exit from the European Union  Including benefits from Venezuela  organic sales growth is expected in the range of 4  6

The company beat earnings estimates in two quarters and reported in line earnings in the remaining two  translating to an average positive surprise of 6 65  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement SYSCO CORP Price and EPS Surprise   Factors to Consider this Quarter
A strong portfolio of businesses and continued acquisitions have been driving the company s growth  Sysco s expense management initiatives are reducing administrative costs and thereby boosting operating profits  It is also encouraging that Sysco has delivered higher gross margins in the past one year  after witnessing declining gross margins since the last two fiscal years  It seems that the company s growth strategy is paying off and its efforts to boost sales and margins are likely to impact the company s results in the to be reported quarter 
However  Sysco expects food cost deflation and currency translation to unfavorably impact fourth quarter results  The company witnessed 0 2  deflation in the first quarter  1 2  in the second quarter and 0 4  in the third quarter of fiscal 2016  The company believes that deflation headwinds will persist in the fourth quarter as well  which will result into soft earnings growth 
Unfavorable currency headwind is also putting pressure on sales and earnings  since Canada represents the majority of its international sales  The company continues to witness strength in the US dollar versus the Canadian dollar and the euro  which will hinder sales growth 
Earnings Whispers 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Sysco is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Sysco is 0 00  as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 60 cents

Factors to Consider
NetApp posted dismal results for the fiscal fourth quarter wherein its top and bottom line results compared unfavorably with the year ago quarter figures 
Nonetheless  the company is expected to gain momentum in flash based solutions with the newly introduced all flash array  which will help it to gain traction in the storage market  The recent product launches and refreshes will drive revenues while stringent cost controls will facilitate margin expansion in the to be reported quarter 
However  the recent forecast for worldwide IT spending by Gartner raises concerns about NetApp s near term performance  Competition from EMC Corp    NYSE EMC   and HP Inc  add to its woes NETAPP INC Price and EPS Surprise
    
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that NetApp will beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  However  that is not the case here  as you will see below

Last quarter  this food products manufacturer delivered a positive surprise of 56 30   We note that the company has posted positive earnings surprises in each of the last four quarters  which translates to an average positive surprise of 19 93  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement SMUCKER JM Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Smucker is likely to beat earnings this quarter because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients 
Zacks ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  stands at  2 87   This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise 
Zacks Rank  Smucker carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which when combined with  2 87  ESP makes us confident about an earnings beat 
Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  The Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
What is Driving the Better Than Expected Earnings 
Strong organic sales growth  product innovation and constant efforts to expand through acquisitions are the company s strong points  Further  lower coffee prices owing to the continued decline in green coffee costs are aiding the company s volumes  Lower pricing on Folgers roast and ground coffee resulted in improved performance for the mainstream coffee business in 2016  In fact  management expects momentum in the coffee business to continue in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 
The company completed the acquisition of pet food maker  Big Heart Pet Brand in Mar 2015  This has placed Smucker in the fastest growing pet food and snacks category in the U S  Also  the divestiture of its U S  canned milk brands and operations  in Dec 2015  to Eagle Family Foods Group will allow the company to focus on its key brands and growth opportunities 
The acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brand  the launch of Dunkin Donuts K cup pods  expanding distribution of the Natural Balance pet brand are expected to contribute to the top line in fiscal 2017 
However  currency headwinds pose a concern for Smucker  The company also remains apprehensive about heightened competitive activity in the pet food business

110267,331782,SJM,Tap These 5 Momentum Picks For Big Profits,opinion,What in basketball we call a  hot hand   a player making a few shots in a row  in finance parlance  we have a word for it  It s called  momentum  Momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks  i e  stocks that have outperformed the market in recent times  to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction than move against the drift At the core  momentum investing calls for investors to  Buy High  Sell Higher  Momentum vs  Other StylesIt is worth pondering over how the momentum strategy compares to other styles of investing over time  Recent research indicates that the size premium for small cap stocks has shrunk dramatically since the 1980s  value premium has also declined dramatically since the1990s  Academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums  like size and value  become known to the public  the investment world catches on and the premium is gradually eroded However  unlike other investment styles  the momentum premium has remained remarkably robust and persistent ever since it was identified by financial academics in the 1990s But Why Does Momentum Strategy Work There s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit  and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works  For instance  we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses  and hence hold onto losing stocks for too long  hoping that they will come back to their original prices  On the other hand  investors sell their winners way too early Furthermore  investors initially tend to under react to news  events or data releases  However  once things become clear  they tend to go with the herd and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions These behavioral issues extend trends  and thus open up a huge opportunity for momentum players to make profits  So  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future Momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again Chase the AlphaMomentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over long periods of time and across markets  So obviously  this strategy is quite tricky to implement  as detecting these trends is no child s play Here  we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers and make handsome gains  Our screen will help you to take advantage of both long term price momentum and a short term pullback in price  which would reflect some profit taking in the stock Screening

110271,331786,SJM,Unilever  UN  Q2 Revenues Drop  Growth Weak  Stock Falls,opinion,"Shares of Unilever  LON ULVR  N V    NYSE UN   declined 6 06  in after hours trading on Jul 21 after the company posted weak second quarter 2016 results 
In the second quarter of 2016  Unilever s sales declined 2 6  due to currency headwinds  Unilever delivered organic sales growth of 4 7   in local currency   which was toward the upper end of the 3  to 5  range expected for the year  This was driven by pricing gain of 2 8  and volume growth of 1 8   Organic sales growth was same as that of the preceding quarter 
Emerging markets grew 7 7  in the second quarter of 2016  weaker than the preceding quarter s growth of 8 3   with an increased contribution from volume  Many emerging markets continued to remain weak with currency devaluation pushing up the cost of living and squeezing disposable incomes UNILEVER N V Price and EPS Surprise   Encouragingly  the company witnessed good volume growth in Asia and price growth in Latin America  despite difficult macro economic conditions and lower consumer confidence  However  in Brazil and Argentina  market volumes continued to contract as consumers struggled with rising unemployment and high local inflation brought on by currency adjustment  Falling real wages are also holding back demand in commodity exporting countries like Russia  South Africa and in the Gulf  The economies in China  India and Southeast Asia are in a better position but are negatively impacted by weak consumer demand 
Developed markets grew 0 7  in the quarter as against 0 3  decline in the preceding quarter with volume growth more than offsetting price deflation in Europe 
The company witnessed growth in all the categories of Personal Care  Refreshment  Home Care and Foods  with improved volumes and pricing  except volume decline in the Foods category 
Outlook
Overall  we are encouraged by the fact that Unilever is consistently focusing on improving its products through innovation  While the company is introducing new products in some markets  it is re launching some of its products with improvements in the existing markets Unilever has also accelerated its cost containment measures to remove unnecessary costs and simplify the business 
However  the company still remains concerned about deteriorating trends in Europe  Brazil and Russia  Consumer demand continues to remain weak  Many emerging markets continue to be volatile  particularly those dependent on oil and other commodity exports and those where currency devaluation is pushing up the cost of living for consumers 
For the year 2016  the company expects currency to impact sales and earnings by 5 to 6 percentage points

110277,331792,SJM,Can Kellogg  K  Keep The Earnings Streak Alive In Q2 ,opinion,"Kellogg Company   NYSE K   is slated to report second quarter 2016 results on Aug 4  before the opening bell  Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4 30  
The cereal and snacks company delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the past four quarters with an average surprise of 3 29  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement KELLOGG CO Price and Consensus
   Factors to Consider
Kellogg has been struggling to drive sales over the past two years primarily due to weak performance by its cereal products in developed markets as well as a soft U S  snacks businesses owing to lower demand  Toward this end  the company has invested in brand building  in store capabilities along with product and packaging innovation as well as reformulation many of its existing products 
Moreover  cost savings from its re structuring program  Project K  are being deployed for renovation  innovation and brand support  which have led to better than expected sales trends in 2015  especially in the U S  cereal businesses 
However  the improved sales trends could not be sustained in the first quarter 2016  Slower than anticipated sales growth in some businesses hurt sales in the quarter which compelled Kellogg to lower its 2016 sales guidance 
Nonetheless  all the factors that affected sales in the first quarter are temporary  Management is optimistic about better results as sales trends improve in certain categories and markets as the year progresses 
The Pringles snacks business has been doing well since several past quarters  We anticipate this positive trend to continue in the second quarter as well 
Moreover  lower commodity costs along with strong Project K and ZBB cost savings should support the bottom line 
However  the U S  snacks business remains a drag  Further  currency headwinds will limit revenue growth to some extent in the second quarter 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Kellogg is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP is 0 0  as the Most Accurate estimate as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 91 cents 
Zacks Rank  Kellogg s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about a positive earnings surprise 
We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Some stocks in the consumer staples sector that have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include 
The J  M  Smucker Co    NYSE SJM    with an Earnings ESP of  4 07  and a Zacks Rank  1 
Post Holdings  Inc    NYSE POST    with an Earnings ESP of 12 5  and a Zacks Rank  2

Our Take
Overall  McCormick is focusing on building sales through acquisitions  and expects strong sales momentum to continue in fiscal 2016  Its cost saving initiative is also appealing  The company expects lower impact from currency headwinds in 2016  However  earnings growth is expected to be sluggish in the near term due to higher brand marketing expenses 
Currently  McCormick has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

110310,331825,SJM,5 Reasons Why You Should Invest In United Natural  UNFI ,opinion,"Most product categories across the consumer staples space have been rising since the past few months  In fact  amid tepid job data figures  Brexit aftershocks  Federal Reserve s reluctance to hike rates and other global growth issues  we believe investing in consumer staples stocks is safe because of their defensive nature 
The sector fared well in the first quarter of 2016  Lower gas prices and increasing consumer confidence did the trick for these stocks  In fact  it should be kept in mind that the consumer staples sector has the potential to face the headwinds coming from global market turmoil and continued volatility in the equity market 
Let us focus on one consumer staples stock   United Natural Foods  Inc    NASDAQ UNFI     which can be a good choice for investors  amid global issues UTD NATURAL FDS Price and Consensus   Why Pick United Natural 
Low Beta Stock  United Natural has a beta of 0 96  A stock with less than 1 beta suggests that the price movement of the stock is not highly correlated with the market  Since they are less volatile than the market  they are safer bets at the moment

Value Score  United Natural carries a  of A  Here  V  stands for Value   G  for Growth and  M  for Momentum and the score is the weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners

Quarterly Results and Outlook  United Natural posted better than expected earnings in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and raised its outlook for fiscal 2016  Earnings of 76 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 66 cents by 15 2  but declined 8 4  from the prior year quarter earnings of 83 cents due to lower gross and operating income margins  Net sales of  2 13 billion lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 17 billion  but increased 0 8  from the prior year quarter  Acquisitions of Global Organic Specialty Source  Inc    Global Organic   in March and Nor Cal Produce  Inc    Nor Cal   in April contributed about  18 1 million to net sales 
United Natural raised its fiscal 2016 sales and earnings guidance  based on the company s performance  recent acquisitions and the positive outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2016 
Strategic Acquisitions  The company has been carrying out various acquisitions over the years to grow its distribution network  customer base and boost long term growth  In May 2016  United Natural completed the acquisition of Haddon House Food Products  which will provide the company with greater operating scale and resources to further develop its product and service offerings 
The acquisition of Nor Cal Produce  Inc   a distributor of conventional and organic produce and other fresh products in Northern California  will provide United Natural a national presence and would help expand its existing produce operations  Prior to that  the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary Albert s Organics  Inc   completed the acquisition of certain assets of Global Organic  which is a premier distributor of organic fruits  vegetables  juices  milk  eggs  nuts  and coffee in the Southeast 
In the past too  the company has benefited from acquisitions  The acquisition of Tony s Fine Foods  in Jul 2014   a specialty distributor of perishable food products  has helped the company to expand both its high growth perishable product offerings and its distribution footprint in the western region of the United States  The buyout of Trudeau Foods in Sep 2013 helped the company to expand its products in the markets of Minnesota  North Dakota  Wisconsin and Michigan s Upper Peninsula 
The acquisition of Canadian food distribution assets of SunOpta Inc  in Jun 2010 made the company the largest distributor of natural  organic and specialty foods  including kosher foods in Canada

110333,331848,SJM,Combat Volatility With These 5 Low Beta Stocks ,opinion,For investors looking to cut their portfolio risk  low beat stocks are great  A lower level of market exposure means that losses will be minimized in case of a downturn  This is why an investor with a long term horizon prefers to invest in stocks carrying lower risks  One of the most popular metrics used to measure such risk is beta Understanding BetaBeta indicates the volatility of a particular stock with respect to the market  In other words  beta measures the extent of stock price movement relative to the market  we are considering S P 500 here  If a company has a beta of 1  it means that the volatility of the stock is the same as that of the S P 500  In the same way  if the stock s beta is greater than 1 then it is more volatile compared to the market  Conversely  a beta below 1 signifies less volatility Now  if a portfolio s beta is 3  it is three times more volatile than the market  Hence  if the market is projected to give 20  return  the portfolio will then definitely contribute 60  return which is amazing However  the opposite case also holds true  If the market slips 20  then the portfolio return plummets 60  which is surely a matter of concern The Winning StrategyIn our screening criteria we included beta in the range of 0 to 0 6 for short listing low risk stocks  But this can t be the only criterion for betting on stocks  The other parameters that need to be added to create a winning portfolio are Percentage Change in Price in the Last 4 Weeks greater than zero  This ensures that the stocks saw positive price movement over the last one month Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Zacks Rank equal to 1  Whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  have a proven history of

110341,331856,SJM,Bet On These 5 Stocks With Solid Earnings Growth ,opinion,What are earnings  In simple terms  it is how much money a company generates  In other words  when you subtract the cost of production from revenues  you get earnings  But why is everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  captivated by this metric  This is because earnings are the ultimate indicator of profitability and also have a direct impact on the share price An upbeat earnings result more or less leads to an uptick in the share price  Earnings expectations too play a crucial role in share price movements Impact of Earnings Estimates on Share PricesDespite generating earnings growth  companies have on several occasions seen their share prices falling  This happens when a company s earnings fail to meet market expectations  So  what are earnings estimates  These are analysts  expectations of a company s future quarterly or annual earnings  Earnings estimates embody analysts  opinions of factors such as sales growth  product demand  competitive industry environment  profit margins  expenses and cost control Earnings estimates also help an analyst to use cash flow analysis

110363,331878,SJM,Will J M  Smucker  SJM  Q4 Earnings Surpass Estimates ,opinion,"We expect The J  M  Smucker Company   NYSE SJM   to beat expectations when it reports fiscal fourth quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Jun 9 
Last quarter  this food products manufacturer delivered a positive surprise of 8 64   We note that the company has posted positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters and a negative surprise in the remaining quarter  translating to an average positive surprise of 5 60  SMUCKER JM Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Smucker is likely to beat earnings this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Positive Zacks ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  stands at  0 84   This is meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise 
Zacks Rank  Smucker carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which when combined with  0 84  ESP makes us confident about an earnings beat 
Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1   2 or  3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  The Sell rated stocks   4 and  5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  
What is Driving the Better Than Expected Earnings 
Strong organic sales growth  product innovation and constant efforts to expand through acquisitions are the company s strong points  Further  lower coffee prices owing to the continued decline in green coffee costs are aiding the company s volumes  We expect recent acquisitions and higher volumes to pull up the top line to some extent in the soon to be reported quarter 
The company completed the acquisition of pet food maker Big Heart Pet Brand in Mar 2015  which has placed Smucker in the fastest growing pet food and snacks category in the U S  The divestiture of its US canned milk brands and operations  in Dec 2015  to Eagle Family Foods Group will allow the company to focus on the key brands and growth opportunities 
Encouragingly  the company will witness growth in coffee volumes in the coming quarter owing to lower coffee price and increase from sales of Dunkin Donuts K Cup pods 
The acquisitions and divestiture are expected to drive much of the profits in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 
However  the company anticipates a significant increase in marketing spend for Pet Food in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 related to new launches  Currency impact also continues to remain a headwind through fiscal 2016 due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar 
Stocks to Consider
Stocks in the consumer staples sector that have both a positive earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank and are therefore worth considering include 
United Natural Foods  Inc    NASDAQ UNFI   with an Earnings ESP of  1 52  and a Zacks Rank  3

110399,331914,SJM,Hormel s Shareholder Friendly Business,opinion,"Hormel Foods  NYSE HRL  has quietly assembled a large portfolio of well known food brands 
The company s more successful brands include  Skippy peanut butter  Spam  Dinty Moore  Jennie O Turkey  Muscle Milk  and the recently acquired Applegate Farms 
The Applegate Organics Acquisition
Hormel recently acquired Applegate Farms for  775 million  Applegate Farms is the leader in natural and organic lunchmeat  Applegate Farms is expected to generate sales of around  340 million in fiscal 2015 
This means Hormel is acquiring Applegate Farms for a price to sales ratio of 2 3  For comparison  Hormel currently trades at a price to sales multiple of 1 6  Other health conscious publicly traded food companies trade for a price to sales ratio of 2 or higher  WhiteWave Foods  NYSE WWAV  has a price to sales multiple of 2 5  and Lifeway  NASDAQ LWAY  has a price to sales ratio of 2 1 
Hormel appears to have paid around fair value for a premium health food brand with the Applegate Farms acquisition  Hormel will leave Applegate to operate as a stand alone company  Applegate Farms should benefit from Hormel s larger advertising budget and better supply chain 
Hormel s Stability   Longevity
Hormel was founded in 1891  Since that time  the company has grown to reach a market cap of  15 3 billion 
Hormel is a very shareholder friendly business  The company has paid increasing dividends for 49 consecutive years  making Hormel a Dividend Aristocrat 
The company currently has a dividend yield of 1 7  and a payout ratio of 36 0   Hormel s conservative payout ratio makes it extremely likely the company will continue to pay increasing dividends 
When the company increases its dividend payments in 2016  Hormel well join the exclusive Dividend Kings list   stocks with 50  years of consecutive dividend increases 
Hormel has a clean balance sheet  The company has  624 million in cash on hand and just  250 million in total debt  Hormel s sound financial position gives it plenty of  dry powder  to explore further acquisitions and pay increasing dividends 
Hormel performed well during the Great Recession of 2007 through 2009  The company saw earnings per share dip slightly from  1 07 per share in 2007 to  1 04 per share in 2008  By 2009  the company was hitting record highs in earnings per share  Hormel tends to perform well during recessions because it sells a mix of grocery products  Consumers tend to dine out less and prepare more food at home when the economy is uncertain 
Growth Prospects   Total Return
Earnings per share grew at 10 5  a year for Hormel over the last decade  The company has grown earnings per share in 27 of its last 30 years 

The company has achieved above average results through organic growth and acquisitions  Growth continued in the company s 2nd quarter of 2015  Earnings per share grew an amazing 29  from  0 52 in the same quarter a year ago to  0 67 
The company realized rapid growth due in large part to lower food input costs  Hormel is expecting earnings per share growth of between 12  and 16  for full fiscal 2015 
Hormel has seen especially rapid growth in its international segment  The segment has grown operating profit at 25  a year over the last 5 years  The international segment currently makes up about 8  of Hormel s total operating profit 
International growth will likely continue to be strong  Hormel s acquisition of Skippy gave the company a better international presence  The company is leveraging this presence to introduce other brands to international markets 
Going forward  Hormel should continue to grow its earnings per share quickly I expect the company s earnings per share to grow at between 9  and 11  a year over the next several years  This growth combined with the company s 1 7  dividend yield gives investors an expected total return of 10 7  to 12 7  a year  before accounting for valuation changes 
Hormel s Valuation
Hormel traded for an average price to earnings ratio under 20 from 1999 through 2013  Since that time  the company s price to earnings ratio has increased 
Recent success has driven the company s price to earnings multiple higher  Hormel is currently trading at a price to earnings ratio of 23 6  This is significantly higher than its historical average 
The price to earnings ratios of many of the company s competitors in the packaged meat and packaged foods industries are shown below 
Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN    price to earnings ratio of 16 8
General Mills  NYSE GIS    price to earnings ratio of 20 3
Kellogg  NYSE K    price to earnings ratio of 17 1
 JM Smucker Company  NYSE SJM    price to earnings ratio of 20 0
Hormel has performed better than these companies in recent years  With that said  Hormel is also trading at a substantial premium to its peers 
Hormel appears to be overvalued by 10  to 20  at this time  Potential investors in Hormel should wait to purchase this high quality company at better prices 
Final Thoughts
Hormel is a very shareholder friendly business  Next year  it will hit the 50 consecutive years of dividend increases milestone 
The company s high quality brands give it a lasting and durable competitive advantage  The evidence for this is the company s impressive earnings and dividend growth streaks 
Hormel is a low risk business  The company should continue to prosper as long as consumers demand packaged food products  this should be a very  very long time 
The one real risk to owning Hormel stock is the company s high valuation  If it were trading under a price to earnings ratio of 20  it would be a strong buy  At current prices  it appears slightly overvalued  Hormel is certainly a hold at this time  but investors looking for exposure to the packaged food industry should look elsewhere ",2015-07-24,Ben Reynolds,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hormel-dividend-stock-analysis-259399,259399
110400,331915,SJM,K Cups Are Changing The Way We Drink Coffee,opinion,"In the modern office  no one complains about someone leaving an empty coffee pot on the burner  That s because the younger generation has risen above such petty affronts  Just kidding 
It s actually because the big office coffee pot is a thing of the past  Now we have  that make one cup of fresh and customizable coffee  You choose your flavor and size  and in about 10 seconds you have your coffee just the way you want it 
This latest and greatest coffee technology is piping hot  too  The Washington Post reported that sales of coffee pods now account for more than a third of all the coffee sold in the United States  You can also see the ever shrinking gap between sales of standard and pod brewing machines below 

The sudden popularity of coffee pods combined with their efficiency is cutting coffee demand in a significant way 
You see  while coffee pods are creating more trash  think about how many individual pods an average office goes through in a day   they re actually reducing the amount of coffee wasted  Regular drip coffee machines are inefficient  require a bit of guesstimation  which may cause you to use more than you need   and the person brewing often makes more than needed  so much of the coffee  consumed  is actually getting poured down the drain 
All those factors are eliminated with coffee pods  And it s making a real difference to demand in the coffee market  In fact  the amount of coffee consumed by Americans dropped by more than 1  this year   that s equivalent to almost 300 000 60 kilogram bags 

Some producers are already making adjustments  The Financial Times reported that  JM Smucker Company  NYSE SJM   which owns Folgers and Dunkin  Donuts  cut its prices by 6  at the start of the month  followed by Kraft Heinz  which reduced the price for Maxwell House and Yuban packaged coffee by a similar amount

110401,331916,SJM,Jelly   Jam   Preserves   Success At Smuckers,opinion,"The J M  Smucker Company  N SJM  probably started as a nice local fruit farm just down the road a ways in Orrville  Ohio  It is still run by the family 118 years after it was founded by Jerome Monroe Smucker in 1897  The company has spread its wings a bit in that time  but fruit spreads have always been a big part 
That simple recipe has made for a booming stock price  up over 740  in the last 15 years  The last 4 months has been a bit of a pause in that record  Perhaps a buying opportunity for the long sighted investor  But there also appears to be an opportunity right now for the trader 

The chart above shows Smucker s stock price this year  Technically it fell out of a bearish rising wedge in June  reaching the target price move quickly  Then it drifted sideways through July and August  rising after the market plunge in August  It has bounced around under resistance at 118 since then  Until Monday  It tested above resistance Monday and pushed higher Tuesday 
A close above 118 is a short term buy trigger and a signal to look for new all time highs soon  The momentum  indicators support the upside continuing  as does the broadening Bollinger Bands   It might be time to spread some Smuckers stock in your portfolio

110404,331919,SJM,Stocks Rally Off Long Term Support Levels As Worry Rises,opinion,"The Wall of Worry just keeps adding more bricks  Although there has been much talk about the impact of low oil prices on the U S  high yield debt market and by extension the U S  banks that did the lending  the bigger worry now is the stability of the European banking system  It is like 2011 all over again  Also  there continue to be signs of an insidious corporate  earnings recession   Such headlines add to the steady stream of  worry bricks  that have so confounded disciplined fundamental investors for at least the past seven months or so  Even Morgan Stanley came out recently to say that January was the worst for its investment portfolios in more than five years  Given the modern prevalence of short attention spans and the need for instant gratification  all of this begs the question as to whether one should throw out the concept of investing based on fundamentals  quality  and strong forward valuations if no one really knows what s going to happen next for all of these companies that have been painstakingly analyzed  Instead  should we simply trade    or perhaps fade    the momentum 
Well  that s not what investing is all about  That s trading  And history tells us that markets eventually reward higher quality business models  balance sheets  management  products  service  etc  over time  So  the real question from an investment standpoint becomes whether to assume a bullish or defensive posture 
In this weekly update  I give my view of the current market environment  offer a technical analysis of the S P 500 chart  review our weekly fundamentals based SectorCast rankings of the ten U S  business sectors  and then offer up some actionable trading ideas  including a sector rotation strategy using ETFs and an enhanced version using top ranked stocks from the top ranked sectors 
Market overview 
Institutional money flows  i e   the so called  smart money   turned sharply in favor of equities a few weeks ago  even while individual investors were shying away  and indeed the markets responded  surging higher last week  But if we look back to the previous Friday  February 12  the Russell 2000 small cap index had plunged more than 25  off its high and emerging markets were down 34  from their highs  China had its slowest growth last year in 25 years  From a sector standpoint  Financial  Healthcare  primarily biotech   Basic Materials  Industrial  primarily transportation  have all fallen in excess of 20   and of course Energy  primarily oil and gas  has been decimated  falling more than 55   But much of this has been masked by the performance of the major large cap indexes  especially the Nasdaq 100 and S P 500  which have benefited from their large cap focus and market cap weighting  given the extremely poor market breadth 
The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  closed Friday at 20 53 and has been steadily falling since briefly touching above 30 on February 11  ConvergEx asked the question of why the VIX hasn t breached the 40 mark like it did during the market turmoil last August  They pointed out that only the Energy and Financial sectors are showing the big volatility this time around  Technology  the highest weighted sector  has only reached 30 instead of the 40 level it hit last August 
The flight to safety among global investors has continued to push capital into U S  Treasuries  The 10 year Treasury yield closed Friday at 1 75   and it has traded in a range from 1 57 to 1 85 since February 11  Two year yields closed Friday at 0 76   Compared to two weeks ago  the 10 year is flat while the 2 year is up significantly from 0 67     in other words  the yield curve has flattened even further  As for the Fed s path toward normalizing the fed funds rate  after Janet Yellen s latest testimony  the fed funds futures are now pricing a slightly higher probability of a March rate hike at 2   as opposed to 0  two weeks ago   June at 18   and December at only 38   with only a 7  chance that we will see two rate hikes this year 
Nevertheless  the FOMC is still trying to talk up an improving economy and keep the possibility of four rate hikes this year on the table  Whether or not the Fed hikes at all this year  it can t be ignored that the M2 money supply is currently growing at a robust 9  annual rate  This is an under the radar stimulus tactic that doesn t get a ton of press  like the quarter point hike in December   and in fact commercial industrial lending has been growing  This shows that the Fed is more interested in normalizing rates than in tightening monetary policy 
After all  there is no looming threat of inflation  Quite the contrary  deflation has been the nemesis and the resultant threat to the global economy due to the catastrophic decline in oil and commodity prices  which is not only threatening many energy and mining companies  but perhaps more critically the banks that have lent to them 
The true status of China s economic growth has been another major worry among investors  Since 2008  the U S  and China together have generated all global GDP growth when priced in dollars  with China the main contributor  However  demographics and the law of big numbers says that this amazing growth must come to an end  and some market observers are predicting India  with its rising population  is demographically poised to be the next big driver of global growth  Still  China s share of global trade now stands at 27   which is pretty phenomenal when you consider how much it has grown in such a short amount of time 
Although China might continue to grow at a healthy rate  when measured in US dollars  real growth will undoubtedly be weak  Either it will have slow nominal growth  i e   real growth plus inflation  and a strong yuan  or faster nominal growth via a major currency devaluation  In any case  we expect that it is the good ol  US of A that will continue as the one consistent shining light to keep the global economic candle burning 
Keep in mind  the U S  is by far the world s wealthiest nation as measured by GDP  which this year should hit  18 trillion  That amount is as much as the next three largest economies in the world  i e   China  Japan and Germany  combined  And despite all of the noise and frightening headlines  the fundamentals of the U S  economy show no evidence of impending recession and equities still look attractive to us  with historically reasonable forward valuations  Last week  the Atlanta Fed GDPNow forecasting model  which provides a hint of the official estimate prior to its release  forecasted that real GDP growth  seasonally adjusted annual rate  in the first quarter of 2016 will be 2 6  
Regarding the meltdown in oil prices  it has been driven by excess supply rather than falling demand  so it is not signaling a global recession  China s slowing growth and shift from a manufacturing to service industry is certainly impacting energy demand  but energy demand growth has been mostly steady for several years and relied more on the developed economies  In fact  the oversupply may transition into balance later this year given that production has fallen dramatically while demand continues to rise  although there is plenty of oil stored in situ and ready to come on line once price justifies it   Moreover  the correlation between oil and equities has been driven at least partly by liquidations from sovereign wealth funds of the major oil producing countries  which must raise cash to make up for their budget shortfall in oil revenues 
Here at Sabrient  we don t spend a lot of time ruminating like economists about macro predictions  Instead  our quant models build a bottom up view of the world  aggregating the many micro views of market segments from the sell side analyst community to create an overall macro picture  And with this approach  our latest Baker s Dozen portfolio of top stock picks for the year ahead is very U S  consumer centric 
Indeed  First Trust pointed out that average hourly earnings over the past six months have risen at a 2 9  annual rate  which is the fastest for any six month period since the current economic expansion started  Consumer confidence and spending are solid  as evidenced by cars  housing  and entertainment sales  Furthermore  S P  Dow Jones Indices observed that the ratio of high yield debt prices to investment grade corporate debt prices has now reached the 50  retracement level from the uptrend that started in March 2009  which may signal a logical reversal point and a situation that is favorable for equities 
SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  N SPY  closed on Monday at 194 78 after bouncing strongly from the support line of  last resort   so to speak  which demarks the low around 182 going back to April 2014  The recent solid performance is giving hints of a bullish W pattern forming  which is similar to the pattern forming in oil as the two continue to display strong correlation  To confirm the W pattern  price would have to close solidly above the center of the W  which is right here around 195  If it fails to move higher at this point  price could possibly retest the 182 major support line    where failure is not a pleasant option  SPY is now above its short term 20 day simple moving average  which has turned upwards   and it is testing resistance at its 50 day simple moving average  which is still pointing sharply downwards   however  it still remains below its 100 day  near 200  and 200 day SMA  near 203   The long term low near 182 dating back to April 2014    and retested in October 2014  August 2015    has been successfully tested for support a couple of times this year already  Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are all in essentially neutral positions that could go either way  On the upside  the 200 resistance level will be a tough test  but the bearish gap down from 204 at the beginning of the year should act as a magnet  Beyond that  there is a line of lower highs since last May as well as a broad rounding top to contend with  once it gets above 204 

Latest sector rankings  
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 
Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  N IYF   Technology  N IYW   Industrial  N IYJ   Healthcare  N IYH   Consumer Goods  N IYK   Consumer Services  N IYC   Energy  N IYE   Basic Materials  N IYM   Telecommunications  N IYZ   and Utilities  N IDU   Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 

Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1  Healthcare retains the top spot by a wide margin with an Outlook score of 91  It displays relatively good Wall Street analyst sentiment  although still slightly negative net revisions to earnings estimates  and generally solid factor scores across the board  including a steadily improving  i e   falling  forward P E as the sector struggles to overcome headline risk  Technology stays in second place with an Outlook score of 65  as it also displays solid factor scores across the board  including the highest forward long term growth rate  Financial takes the third spot once again with an Outlook score of 61 and continues to show the best  i e   lowest  aggregate forward P E  13x   although this has risen a bit as the sector gets pounded with net reductions to earnings estimates given the general rethinking of the future of interest rates and the shape of the yield curve  A surprise in fourth place this week is Telecom  which jumped due to receiving net positive revisions to sell side earnings estimates  Rounding out the top six  which all score above 50  are Utilities and Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  
2  Energy remains at the bottom with an Outlook score of 5 as the sector scores among the worst in all factors of the GARP model  including the highest forward P E  24 9x   Also  it is the only sector to display a negative long term growth rate  Basic Materials takes the other spot in the bottom two with an Outlook score of 16 as commodity prices in general continue to languish along with oil prices  In fact  Materials is taking the brunt of the downward revisions to earnings estimates  The other two scoring in the bottom four are economically sensitive sectors Industrial and Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical  
3  Looking at the Bull scores  Energy tops the list with a robust 69  as investors do some bottom fishing on strong market days  while Utilities is the lowest at 44  The top bottom spread is a wide 25 points  which reflects quite low sector correlations on strong market days  which is good for stock picking  It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold  rather than broad risk on behavior  
4  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities  as usual  displays the top score of 68  which means that stocks within this sector have been the preferred safe havens on weak market days  Basic Materials  Technology  and Financial all score the lowest at 46  as investors flee during market weakness  The top bottom spread is 22 points  which reflects low sector correlations on weak market days  which is good for stock picking  Ideally  certain sectors will hold up relatively well while others are selling off  rather than broad risk off behavior   so it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 
5  Healthcare displays the best all around combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  while Basic Materials is now the worst  However  looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Energy has emerged on top  followed by Utilities  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   while Healthcare and Financial are the worst  followed closely by Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical  
6  This week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings still look mostly neutral  although the signs of bullishness I have talked about recently have given way to signs of defensiveness  given that Telecom  Utilities  and Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  are all in the top six  Nevertheless  the top three still comprise Healthcare  which is all weather  so it s not a strong indicator either way   Technology  and Financial  Keep in mind  the Outlook Rank does not include timing  momentum  or relative strength factors  but rather is a reflection of the fundamental expectations of individual stocks aggregated by sector 
Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or defensive   continues to reflect a defensive bias and suggests holding Utilities  Healthcare  and Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical   in that order   Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be defensive from a rules based trend following standpoint when SPY is below both its 50 day and 200 day simple moving averages  
Other highly ranked ETFs in SectorCast from the Utilities  Healthcare  and Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  sectors include First Trust Utilities AlphaDEX  N FXU   ProShares Ultra Health Care  N RXL   and PowerShares Dynamic Food   Beverage  N PBJ  
Other notable ETFs that are highly ranked in our quant model include US Global Jets  N JETS   PowerShares Dynamic Leisure   Entertainment  N PEJ   iShares Mortgage Real Estate Capped  N REM   and Global X SuperDividend US  N DIV  
For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists some top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within the top ranked sectors  some long ideas from Utilities  Healthcare  and Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  sectors include NextEra Energy  N NEE   Alliant Energy Corporation  N LNT   Henry Schein Inc  O HSIC   Cigna  N CI   JM Smucker Company  N SJM   and McCormick   Company Incorporated  N MKC   All are highly ranked in the Sabrient Ratings Algorithm 
If you prefer to take a neutral bias  the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Healthcare  Technology  and Financial  in that order  On the other hand  if you prefer a bullish stance on the market  the model suggests holding Energy  Technology  and Financial  in that order 
IMPORTANT NOTE  I post this information periodically as a free look inside some of our institutional research and as a source of some trading ideas for your own further investigation  It is not intended to be traded directly as a rules based strategy in a real money portfolio  I am simply showing what a sector rotation model might suggest if a given portfolio was due for a rebalance  and I may or may not update the information each week  There are many ways for a client to trade such a strategy  including monthly or quarterly rebalancing  perhaps with interim adjustments to the bullish neutral defensive bias when warranted    but not necessarily on the days that I happen to post this weekly article  The enhanced strategy seeks higher returns by employing individual stocks  or stock options  that are also highly ranked  but this introduces greater risks and volatility  I do not track performance of the ETF and stock ideas mentioned here as a managed portfolio

110408,331923,SJM,Smuckers  SJM   Three Recipes For A Move Higher In,opinion,"It is Pi Day  or Pie Day  if you prefer  And what better way to celebrate than with a fresh made pie like the one below  Not only does Smuckers  NYSE SJM  have all the ingredients you need to make a pie  from the flour and shortening to make the crust  to the fillings  but they also have a great looking stock chart 
The longer term chart is great  up over 430  since the March 2009 low  The chart below shows the latest trend higher from a pullback and bottom in August  Rising nearly 25  since then  it has paused in a consolidation since the beginning of February  You can see 3 of these consolidations in the latest move up  Each time the jump started after a touch at the 100 day SMA  The MACD has also reset into negative territory ahead of each move up  You can wait for a pullback to 122 5 for an entry  But there are other recipes to use as well 

First understand that it does not have to pullback  If the price moves over 130 it could just start moving higher without the prior resets happening again  You could also buy the stock today and add an April 130 120 put spread  July 270 covered call collar  Buying the put spread and selling the covered call protects for a possible pullback over the next month  and the collar generates a credit putting it on  A third recipe would be to sell April 125 puts  This would generate a credit as well  and give an entry into the stock at about 123 70 if the puts are in the money at expiry 
Which recipe do you like

110425,331940,SJM,Will Steven Madden See Another Quarter Of In Line Results ,opinion,"Steven Madden Ltd  NASDAQ SHOO  is set to report second quarter fiscal 2014 results on Jul 31  Last quarter  the shoes and apparel retailer delivered in line results 
The company reported in line earnings for three out of the last four quarters  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
Steven Madden s top line has been affected by harsh winter conditions and slow store traffic in the past couple of quarters  Moreover  limited new fashion trends at the stores failed to attract shoppers which added to the company s woes  Management expects the tough retail conditions to continue in the second quarter as well 
Further  slow sales in the first few months of the 2014 resulted in piled up inventory in Steven Madden s retail segment  The company will have to clear its stock by offering heavy discounts and through promotional strategies which will put pressure on margins in the coming quarter 
However   summer is expected to spur the pent up demand for the company s products  Moreover  Steven Madden revamped its website in Mar 2014  The new site offers a much improved experience on mobile and tablets and innovative social media integration  The initiative is expected to lead to uptick in sales in the to be reported quarter 
Earnings Whispers 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Steven Madden is likely to beat earnings this quarter  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 to surpass earnings estimate  However  that is not the case here due to the following factors 
Zacks ESP  ESP for Steven Madden is 0 00  
Zacks Rank  Steven Madden has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  which when combined with a 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank  4 and 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Other Stocks to Consider
Here are some other companies that  according to our model  have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Treehouse Foods Inc  NYSE THS  with an Earnings ESP of  1 21  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
Colgate Palmolive Company  NYSE CL   with an Earnings ESP of  1 37  and a Zacks Rank  2 
JM Smucker Company  NYSE SJM  with an Earnings ESP of  1 46  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  ",2014-07-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-steven-madden-see-another-quarter-of-in-line-results-221163,221163
110427,331942,SJM,Labor Markets Continue To Strengthen  Coffee Prices Are Dropping,opinion,"Today let s begin with the United States  where labor markets continue to strengthen  Shown below is the Gallup Job Creation Index which has been quite helpful in estimating fluctuations in hiring 

We also had a strong ADP private payrolls report 

Drilling into the ADP report we see a couple of developments 
1  US manufacturing sector is creating jobs again  which is a bit surprising  more on this below  
2  Small business continues to drive job creation in the United States  In US manufacturing  we see the two major PMI indicators diverging  Markit PMI shows slowing growth while the ISM PMI indicates improvement  However both show slowing growth in new orders and order backlog  Both also indicate improved employment in the manufacturing sector  Here is the breakdown of the ISM PMI  And this is the Markit PMI Employment Index 

US initial jobless claims are steadily declining  Some of the declines are driven by people running out of unemployment benefits and dropping out of the workforce  a general decline in labor force participation   Some of it is due to very limited layoffs in recent years  Whatever the case  initial jobless claims as a percentage of US population are at the lowest level since at least the 60s  possibly since WWII  We finished the quarter with economists  GDP forecasts at just under 3   The Atlanta Fed GDP tracker is at 2 2   
Elsewhere in the Americas we see a fairly severe GDP decline in Canada this year  Here is a 4 month change  annualized   The energy correction is taking its toll 

Brazil s balance of trade improved on weak real  bolstering exports  and poor domestic demand  Devaluation has its benefits  assuming you can keep inflation under control  

Similar to the situation in Canada  weak energy prices are taking their toll on Norway s economy  Here is the manufacturing PMI  
Switching to the Eurozone  After months of back to back declines  French manufacturing sector gradually shifts into expansion mode 
 We continue to get more nonsense out of the Greek government  Lost and desperate they are trying plan C  D      The euro group leadership wants nothing to do with this government   at least until after the referendum  By the way  it s not at all clear what the Greeks will vote for in the referendum  A  yes  vote would support the latest financing deal from the Eurogroup  However the bailout program under which this proposal was made has expired at the end of June   thus the deal is no longer on the table  Most view a  no  vote as a rejection of the  expired  proposal that would lead to Grexit  However Alexis Tsipras said on TV on Wednesday that a  no  vote means staying in the Eurozone but pushing for a new agreement   something he already tried to do for the past 6 months  If you a Greek voter  how do you make heads or tails of this 
There are of course folks who lone for the old drachma 

 Alright  enough of Greece  Let s look at China  After giving up over 5  yesterday and another 1 25  today  the Shanghai Composite is approaching 4000  5  intraday swings have become commonplace  as retail investors are punished 
We don t hear much about the losses  but they are severe  In a frenzy that resembles other spectacular asset bubbles  according to Bloomberg   some Chinese investors are taking margin loans with rates as high as 22    Incredible 
Of course with all the money poured into the stock market  there is little left for a more traditional form of gambling  Here is Macau gambling revenues   back to 2010 levels  
Turning to commodities markets  US crude oil inventories unexpectedly rose and remain highly elevated relative to last year  Crude oil prices came under pressure   
Coffee futures are getting hammered again  This is starting to make its way to the consumers  According to Reuters   JM Smucker Company  NYSE SJM  cut prices for most of its Folgers and Dunkin  Donuts coffee brands sold in the United States by 6 percent  the biggest U S  roaster said on Wednesday  partially reversing last year s price hikes to woo back customers  

Now  Food for Thought   4 items 
1  Auto sales in the United States have been brisk 
 2  With Puerto Rico having its  difficulties   Pew released some stats on the US territory  The island s population is falling as people leave for better opportunities elsewhere while fertility rates are declining 

3  Americans are deeply divided mostly by political affiliation on climate change and energy issues 

4  According to Bloomberg   the average Manhattan apartment is on the verge of hitting  2 million
