Bendza  Vice President of Investor Relations Mark Bendza    Vice President  Investor RelationsThank you  Robbie  Good morning and welcome to Honeywell s fourth quarter 2019 earnings and 2020 outlook conference call  With me here today are Chairman and CEO  Darius Adamczyk and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  Greg Lewis This call and webcast  including any non GAAP reconciliations are available on our website at   Note that elements of this presentation contain forward looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today  Those elements can change and we ask that you interpret them in that light  We identify the principal risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance in our annual report on Form 10 K and other SEC filings  For this call  references to adjusted earnings per share  adjusted free cash flow and free cash flow conversion and effective tax rate exclude the impacts from separation costs related to the two spin offs of our Homes and Transportation Systems businesses in 2018  as well as  pension mark to market adjustments and U S  tax legislation  except where otherwise noted  Comparisons are to the prior year period unless otherwise noted This morning we will review our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019  discuss our full year 2020 outlook and share our guidance for the first quarter of 2020  As always we ll leave time for your questions at the end  With that  I ll turn the call over to Chairman and CEO  Darius Adamczyk Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Mark  and good morning everyone  Let s begin on slide 2  We are very pleased with our results in 2019  We finished a great year of another strong quarter  In the fourth quarter  we delivered  2 06 adjusted earnings per share  above the high end of the guidance range  130 basis points of margin expansion and  maybe most importantly   2 3 billion of adjusted free cash flow resulting in the fourth quarter conversion of 154   With this conclusion to the year  we met or exceeded our financial commitments on all metrics in 2019  managing through a volatile environment and delivering adjusted earnings per share of  8 16   0 06 above the high end of our initial 2019 guidance Despite the challenging broad macro environment 2019  we grew organic sales 5   driven by strength across much of our portfolio throughout the year  Growth was driven by commercial Aerospace  Defense  Process Solutions and Building Products  We also had strong orders for HPS mega projects  UOP Equipment and Defense and over 100  increase in Intelligrated orders during the fourth quarter  These robust orders contributed to a 10  year over year increase in long cycle backlog Additionally  in 2019  Honeywell Connected Enterprise drove double digit software growth  We expanded segment margin 150 basis points  or 70 basis points  excluding the impact of the 2018 spin offs  both 10 basis points above the high end of our 2019 guidance  Our growth combined with productivity rigor and commercial excellence drove margin expansion in Aerospace  Building Technologies and Performance Materials and Technologies We generated  6 3 billion of adjusted free cash flow for the year  exceeding the high end of our initial guidance by approximately  300 million and resulting in 105  free cash flow conversion or 114  free cash flow conversion  excluding pension income  We continue to make smart investment in our businesses  people and communities  We deployed  7 8 billion of capital in 2019 across share repurchases  higher dividends  high return capex in two acquisitions  including the Rebellion Photonics  a provider of innovative  intelligent digital gas modelling solutions  which we closed in the fourth quarter  This also include over 10 investment by Honeywell Ventures for over  50 million deployed in 2019  bringing our total venture investments to date to over  75 million  We continue to have a robust pipeline of M A opportunities with significant balance sheet capacity deployed  We launched our new brand campaign to highlight some of the most exciting innovations and are ranked Number 13 on the Forbes Magazine s list of the World s Most Reputable Companies for Corporate Responsibility  Lastly  we continue to make progress in our breakthrough and transformation initiatives which I ll cover next in more detail Let s turn to slide 3  We continue to make significant progress on three key initiatives in support of our transformation to a software industrial company  In 2019  we commercialized Honeywell Forge  enterprise performance management software  which helps companies in a variety of industries gather  gain insights from  and ultimately autonomously control their operations to drive efficiency and safety  Honeywell Forge helped drive double digit Connected software growth this year  Additionally HCE is leading the transition to more recurring revenue models across the company  has delivered key wins and stronger customer relationships throughout 2019 and will continue to drive growth across Honeywell including a 20  Connected software growth component    annual growth rate over five years We also made great strides our integrated supply chain transformation  We established supply based management strategy for 11 categories across the enterprise  enabled our businesses to take actions to substantially reduce their distribution manufacturing footprint  drove improvements in sourcing productivity  and in the fourth quarter we began seeing broad improvements in our inventory We are on track to achieve our long term targets  including  0 5 billion of run rate benefits and a  1 billion reduction in inventory  On Honeywell Digital  which is foundational to running Honeywell with data driven decision making  we have matured our data management practices  digitized key processes through the deployment of new technology platforms  rationalized over 500 software applications  cleansed 5 2 million critical master data records  eliminated 20 ERP systems and reduced websites by 58   When complete  we expect our digital transformation to deliver  0 5 billion of run rate benefits across sales  productivity and working capital improvements We are very pleased with the progress we ve made in each of our transformation initiatives in 2019 and we ll continue to build on this momentum to 2020 as we transform into a software industrial  In summary  we had a terrific 2019  both in our short term operating performance and longer term transformation agenda and we re setting ourselves up for a strong 2020 and beyond  Now let me turn it over to Greg on slide 4 to discuss our fourth quarter results and provide our 2020 outlook Greg Lewis    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Darius and good morning everyone  For the fourth quarter  we grew organic sales by 2   driven by 7  organic growth in Aerospace  as well as continued growth in our Process Automation UOP and Building management products businesses  SPS contracted during the quarter  but the turnaround of productivity products is progressing  Intelligrated sales improved sequentially  but they were down year over year as expected due to tough comps compared to nearly 50  growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 Importantly  orders were up 100  as the major project orders we anticipated in Intelligrated materialized to set us up well for 2020  Our organic growth combined with commercial and operational excellence and the benefits from the portfolio enhancements that we made in 2018  drove segment margin expansion of 130 basis points with segment margin again exceeding 21  this quarter  Excluding the favorable impact of the spin offs  segment margins expanded by 90 basis points  which was 40 basis points above the high end of our guidance  driven by our strong commercial excellence and productivity programs We delivered adjusted earnings per share of  2 06  up 11  excluding the impact of the spin off and above the high end of our guidance  In addition to strong segment profit performance  earnings per share benefited from lower share count due to our buyback program and a lower adjusted effective tax rate  which more than offset our planned lower pension income  During the quarter  we generated  2 3 billion of adjusted free cash flow with conversion of 154  on the strength of improvements in working capital  primarily from cash collections and inventory reductions  As Darius highlighted  we re beginning to see the effects of our supply chain transformation as demonstrated by inventory improvements in the fourth quarter  This resulted in full year adjusted free cash flow of  6 3 billion and conversion of 105  above the high end of our guidance range We continue to execute our capital deployment strategy in the fourth quarter  We deployed  644 million to dividends and  750 million to repurchases of Honeywell shares  bringing the total share repurchases for the year to  4 4 billion  should be  1 4 billion   resulting in a 3  share reduction  which is above the commitment of at least 1  share count reduction that we highlighted at the beginning of the year  We also completed the acquisition of Rebellion Photonics and funded two additional Honeywell Venture investments Now let s turn to slide 5 and talk about the segments  Starting with Aerospace sales up 7  on an organic basis and orders were up double digits  finishing an outstanding year for the business overall  Defense and Space grew 9   led by increased aftermarket volumes on key U S  DoD programs and global demand for guidance and navigation systems  Backlog for Defense and Space is up double digits  Additionally  demand for Honeywell Forge drove double digit JetWave growth in Defense  As you ll recall  we launched JetWave for military platforms in 2018 and we continue to be excited about the Connected growth opportunities there  In Commercial OE  sales were up 4  organically driven by increased deliveries across major OE business aviation platforms  partially offset by lower air transport sales  Commercial aftermarket grew 6  organically  driven by strong demand in air transport while business jet aftermarket sales were approximately flat Aerospace segment margin expanded 270 basis points  driven by productivity  commercial excellence and strong aftermarket volumes  2019 was another outstanding year for the Aerospace team In Safety and Productivity Solutions  sales were down 11  on an organic basis  driven by lower sales volumes in productivity products  the impact of major systems project timing in Intelligrated and lower demand for personal protective equipment  SPS segment margins contracted 330 basis points year over year to approximately 13  similar to prior quarters as a result of the volume deleverage in productivity products and personal protective equipment Within our Intelligrated warehouse automation business  as we expected  sales were down double digits due to difficult comps and the timing of several major systems projects  4Q and 1Q are the two most difficult quarters that Intelligrated will face as sales were up nearly 50  in each of those comparable periods  As we discussed in our last call  the orders pipeline has been robust and for the second consecutive quarter  Intelligrated posted significant growth with orders up over 100   which contributed to more than 30  increase in the backlog year over year  This positions the business well for 2020 as these major projects begin to look drive growth starting in the second quarter and beyond  Importantly Intelligrated aftermarket service businesses continues to benefit from our large and growing installed base with strong double digit sales growth for life cycle support and services In Productivity products  we continue to see distributor destocking  but inventories are now approaching normalized levels and we expect the business to return to growth in 2020  We have taken significant actions to address the challenges in this business as we have discussed previously and we re seeing improvements in our commercial operations as a result  which is reflected in the sequential sales growth compared to the third quarter of 2019  We re optimistic that we ll continue to see further improvements in the business throughout 2020 In the Safety business  organic sales for the quarter were down 5  as continued demand for our gas sensing products was more than offset by decreased volumes of personal protective equipment and softer demand in the retail business Moving to Honeywell Building Technologies  sales were up 3  organically  primarily driven by ongoing strength in commercial fire products in the U S   double digit growth across our suite of building management products including double digit growth in our Connected software platforms and growth in security  that was partially offset by Building Solutions sales which were down for the quarter as declines in projects including the energy savings performance contracts business offset double digit growth in the airport vertical  HBTs segment margins expanded 170 basis points in the fourth quarter  driven by the favorable impact from the spin offs of the Homes business  Segment margins excluding impact from spin accretion were approximately flat in the quarter and we expect this to improve in 2020 as we continue to make progress toward our long term margin targets for the business Finally  in Performance Materials and Technologies  sales were up 3  on an organic basis  Process Solutions sales were up 6  organically  driven by strength across the automation portfolio and smart energy  Additionally  orders in the automation and projects businesses were up double digits  allowing us to exit the year with a strong backlog  notably in our global mega projects business  which was up double digits  In UOP  sales were up 3  organically  in both our petrochemical catalyst and our equipment business  partially offset by declines in gas processing due to fewer domestic Cryo unit sales as a result of the continuation of softer midstream gas processing markets in the U S  Backlog was up high single digits in UOP  driven by strong double digit growth in equipments  which carries lower margins as you know Organic sales in Advanced Materials were down 4   driven by lower volumes and pricing in flooring products due to the ongoing impact of the illegal HFC imports into Europe  Recent estimates suggest that these illegal imports are contributing annual emissions at least equivalent to that of 3 5 million cars  This means it would take a forest the size of Portugal to capture all the illegal emissions  We continue to actively work in partnership with private industry  EU regulators and EU member countries to address harmful illegal HFC imports  Increasing seizures of illegally imported HFCs are encouraging  but they re not yet meaningful enough reductions to the total illegal imports  While these efforts are ongoing  we ll continue to experience pressure on HFC pricing and volumes  For the remainder of Advanced Materials  Electronic Materials grew mid single digits and packaging and composites was up high single digits  This was partially offset by softer demand in Additives and Chemicals So overall  PMT segment margins contracted by 80 basis points in the quarter  driven by Advanced Materials volumes  the mix of catalyst shipments and higher mix of UOP equipment  partially offset by improvements in productivity  As we ve discussed before  the mix of catalysts sales and equipment project timing in UOP has an outsized impact on margins quarter to quarter  and for the full year PMT margins expanded 70 basis points So overall we capped off the year with a very strong fourth quarter performance and earnings  margin expansion and cash  as well as strong orders resulting in a healthy backlog as we enter into 2020 Now let s turn to slide 6 and discuss the markets and our 2020 outlook  As Darius mentioned  in 2019  we managed through a challenging year where trade tensions and the threat and reality of tariffs were constant  The uncertainty of Brexit  interest rate policy and indications of a possible recession with signals like the inverted yield curve weighed on markets  Today  some of those issues have started resolving themselves with the Phase 1 U S  China trade deal now in place and a more clear path forward on Brexit  but many uncertainties remain as we begin 2020  There is much more work to be done on the comprehensive long term agreement between China and the U S  Brexit has a conclusion  however  the execution of their exit from the European Union is yet to play out and ramifications aren t fully known Tensions in the Middle East have created the potential for market disruption  The recent health threat of the Coronavirus is developing rapidly and how it will evolve is still unknown  And a highly charged election year in the U S  brings additional uncertainties for companies to manage through In addition to that  we are facing discrete sales headwind in Aerospace  as others are  from the 737 MAX production delay in 2020 as Boeing has continued to recalibrate their expectations for its return to service and related production schedules  We are aligned with Boeing s most recent communications that assumes the 737 MAX returns to service roughly mid year  however  the situation remains fluid So  while there are perhaps fewer indications of a broader based recession today  there remain several challenging and potentially fast changing dynamics that create uncertainty in the macro and caution in our short cycle business outlook  With these factors  short cycle outcomes for the year will be difficult to forecast  and you ll see that we have a wider EPS guidance range than is typical for us due to the range of outcomes that could result  Our outlook assumes the Middle East remains relatively stable and that we can continue to deliver backlog and obtain new projects in the Middle East  We are assuming monetary policy remains stable and interest rates don t rise  lending support to the economy and that the U S  election does not delay investment We have not estimated a material impact if the Coronavirus becomes more significant which is already impacting aviation  in particular flight hours and could also have a broader negative impact on supply chains in the economy as was experienced with the SARS outbreak  We ve incorporated the latest communicated build rates as I mentioned  of the 737 MAX into our own revenue outlook so a knock on effects of the overall Aero supply chain are yet to play out  So while we have confidence in our market positions and have prepared ourselves for the year ahead  it s setting up as an equally and perhaps more uncertain year than the one we just completed Given that  let s move to slide 7 and discuss the markets and the segment outlook  Starting with Aerospace  Defense remained strong  driven by stable budgets and we expect growth again in 2020 but at more moderate levels relative to the strong double digits we experienced in 2019  We continue to see healthy demand in business aviation  but we will have tougher comps in the business aviation OE  We expect the aftermarket demand across commercial Aerospace will continue to grow  driven by flight hours and retrofit modifications and upgrades  as well as the impact of older equipment remaining in service as a result of the delays in the MAX  That will partially be offset by the ADSP phase out  However Aero will have sales headwinds from the MAX production delays  We re taking actions to try to mitigate this impact as best we can including leveraging recent improvements in our supply base to accelerate production from our backlog  And we continue to monitor the MAX situation closely  as you would expect  Additionally  the impact to our earnings potential due to the MAX will be somewhat muted as the potential aftermarket offsets with their higher profit levels compared to OE sales will provide some support for segment margins As a result of these dynamics across Aerospace  we re expecting organic sales to be up low to mid single digits for the year as compared to the high single digits in the fourth quarter and the double digit growth we experienced in the first three quarters of 2019 Now turning to SPS  We expect strong e commerce and warehouse distribution macro trend to continue as customers seek and implement differentiated warehousing solutions to meet increased demand  These dynamics contributed to the robust Intelligrated orders in the second half of 2019  that will fuel warehouse automation sales growth in 2020 and we continue to expect strong services growth from our expanding installed base  Excluding the warehousing market  industrial macro indicators remain weakened  which we expect will result in slower industrial safety  sensing and IoT sales  Productivity products is executing their recovery plan  as we mentioned and we continue to expect a turnaround in 2020 as destocking ends with the return to growth expected in the second half of the year  Overall  we expect SPS organic sales to be approximately flat to up low single digits and we expect SPS margins to begin recovering in 2020  driven by improvements in Productivity products margins  our productivity actions  and enhanced growth in software and services In HBT  following the spin of our Homes portfolio  our primary exposure is to the non resi market  our construction market and to the infrastructure and data center markets  While we will continue to monitor the outlook across construction today  we anticipate non residential market overall to remain flat to up modestly in 2020  And we are expecting HBT organic sales to be down slightly to up low single digits  We expect strength in commercial fire and modest growth in security products to continue  In Building Solutions  we expect continued growth in the airports vertical and we are focused on driving services growth to mitigate the impact of headwinds from lower energy performance contracts and softer projects orders  Building management system strength continues in the near term and driving better execution and pipeline development to deliver ongoing growth PMT entered 2020 with a healthy long cycle backlog up high single digits in both UOP and HPS  driven by robust 2019 orders for UOP equipment and HPS projects  The oil and gas market outlook is similar to recent trends with continued softness in the U S  midstream gas processing market  but continued from mega projects Finally  with Advanced Materials  we expect continued growth from sources in our flooring products business and better execution at specialty products  However  the illegal HFC imports into Europe continue to put pressure on growth  particularly through the first half of the year  Given these dynamics  in total  we expect PMT organic sales to be flat to up low single digits for the year Overall  the strength of Honeywell is our diversified portfolio  and we head into 2020 with a healthy long cycle backlog combined with strong operational playbooks which will enable us to perform in another tough macro backdrop Now let s turn to slide 8 and talk about how these dynamics come together for our 2020 financial guidance  We have an effective strategy at Honeywell which enables us to continuously deliver on our financial commitments and that is not changing in 2020  Our focus continues to be on smart investments for the future  new product development and breakthrough initiatives to fuel growth  all with ongoing productivity rigor and commercial and operational excellence to drive it  These strengths embodied in our transformation initiatives position us to deliver a solid year even with the unpredictability of the current market backdrop and uncertain short cycle macro environment For 2020  we expect organic sales growth overall of 0  to 3  which reflects our balanced portfolio  diverse end market expectations  headwinds from the 737 MAX production delay and a cautious outlook on our short cycle business in this environment  We expect to expand margins 20 to 50 basis points for the overall company  consistent with our long term framework  Below the line pension and OPEB income in 2020 is expected to be approximately  830 million about a  200 million increase from the prior year or  0 20 of EPS  which I ll discuss in more detail on the next slide  In addition to pension income  other key planning item to take note of include weighted average share count of approximately 780 million shares  repositioning charges of  375 million to  500 million as we continue to fund high return projects and the remaining below the line items to be in the range of  205 million to  230 million of expense  Combined  this results in below the line income in the range of  100 million to  230 million for the year Finally  we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 21  to 22  for the year  All in  we re guiding EPS to be  8 60 to  9 per share up 5  to 10  adjusted  including the  0 20 benefit from higher pension income  We expect continued strong free cash flow generation with adjusted free cash flow of  5 7 billion to  6 2 billion in 2020  driven by high quality income growth and continued working capital improvements  Compared to 2019  we expect approximately  500 million to  600 million of headwinds from higher planned capex investments and additional payroll cycle due to the calendar and anticipated environmental and other payments  This cash generation equates to adjusted free cash flow conversion of approximately 102  to 107  excluding pension income  We believe  excluding the non cash pension income impact  better reflects our operating performance and enables more appropriate comparisons to our peers We continue to have a strong balance sheet with significant capacity and desire to do more M A  as Darius mentioned  We do have a strong pipeline of opportunities  but in the absence of completing significant M A  we ll continue to deploy additional capital to repurchases of Honeywell shares Now let s turn to slide 9 to discuss our 2020 earnings per share bridge compared to  19  As I noted earlier  we re providing some slightly wider ranges than we typically do as a result of the number of variables that could impact the business over the next 12 months  Segment profit continues to be a key driver of our earnings growth  Continued productivity improvements  commercial excellence  volume leverage and ongoing benefits from previously funded repositioning will contribute  0 10 to  0 45 per share  We expect our share repurchase program  which has  as a base case  the delivered at least a 1  additional share count reduction to result in a benefit of approximately  0 14 per share year over year Our expected tax rate of 21  to 22  is a range of a  0 07 headwind to a  0 04 benefit to EPS  Excluding pension income below the line items are expected to be in the range of a  0 04 headwind to a  0 12 benefit per share  primarily driven by the range I mentioned on expected repositioning trend The last item is the  0 20 increase in the higher pension income as a result of high investment returns in 2019 and lower discount rates in 2020  Including that  0 20 tailwind  we expect earnings per share to be in the range of  8 60 to  9 as I mentioned previously So I d like to take a moment just to discuss the pension dynamics in a little bit more detail  As we ve talked about previously  we have derisked our pension plans and in 2019  approximately 50  of the plan assets were more conservative fixed income like assets  the other half being in return seeking assets  As a result of the strong equity markets in 2019  those return seeking assets earned approximately 21  in the year  resulting in over  3 billion of an increase in our pension asset base compared to last year  This higher asset base  combined with lower discount rates is driving higher income in 2020  even with lower rates of return expected  Our pension is now 110  funded and we continue to derisk that with approximately 60  of our plan assets now in fixed income out for 2020 So in summary  while we re cautious about the macro backdrop and the short cycle outcomes are once again hard to predict  we entered the year with a healthy backlog in our long cycle business  We have diversified end markets  a strong playbook and a solid track record of execution and we re prepared to deliver another strong year with growth primarily from continued segment profit performance and our capital deployment strategy Now let s turn to slide 10 for a preview of the first quarter  For the first quarter  we expect organic sales to be in the range of down 2  to up 2  organically driven by growth in Aerospace  continued strength in Building Products  UOP equipment and Process Automation  offset by headwinds from SPS and some of the other short cycle components of our portfolio  Keep in mind  Q1 of 2019 was our strongest quarter of the year and will be our most difficult comp  We expect commercial excellence  productivity rigor and the benefits from previously funded repositioning to drive continued segment profit and segment margin growth with 20 to 50 basis points of year over year margin expansion resulting in segment margins in the range of 20 6  to 20 9  for the first quarter In Aerospace  we continue to see demand for both commercial Aerospace and U S  Defense supported by robust orders growth and firm backlogs  as I ve discussed  However  as we ve stated after five straight quarters of double digit sales growth through 3Q  2019 and high single digit growth in 4Q  2019  we expect organic sales growth rate to moderate in 2020  Aero is facing sales headwinds as are others from Boeing s most recent recalibration of the 737 MAX production delays  which will contribute to the more moderate growth rates as we enter the year  although we plan to mitigate some of that impact by accelerating production from our backlog In SPS  we expect distributor destocking to come to an end in Productivity products  although return to growth will likely be a second half outcome  And we expect slow sales to continue in industria safety  Intelligrated sales will be impacted by the project timing  I mentioned  in the first quarter due to strong growth of approximately 50  last year at this time  But growth in robust orders in the second half of 2019 will contribute to more substantial sales growth in the following quarters In Building Technologies  we expect strength in commercial fire and security products  driven by demand in the Americas as well as continued strength in airports  We continue to see infrastructure including airports and datacenter projects as opportunities for strong growth in HBT  However  we expect softer project sales in energy and other verticals within Building solutions as we begin the year In Performance Materials and Technologies  we expect to see continued growth in products and services and Process Automation and we expect a healthy demand for equipment in UOP  The headwinds in the Advanced Materials business from illegal imports of HFCs into Europe and lower specialty products demand driven by the slowdown in China will persist in the early part of 2020  We expect the effective tax rate to be between 21  and 22  in the first quarter and average share count to be approximately 720 million shares  All of this results and earnings per share in the range of  2 02 to  2 07 represent a growth of 5  to 8  earnings per share In summary  well positioned going into the first quarter with plans in place and ongoing initiatives across all businesses to drive productivity and margin expansion to mitigate the impacts of the mixed macro environment and the headwinds of the tough comps compared to a year ago  We also continue to have significant balance sheet flexibility to generate strong returns through share repurchases and opportunistic M A  With that I d like to turn the call back over to Darius who will wrap up on slide 11Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Greg  Overall  we are pleased with the strong operational performance from our portfolio in 2019  We continue to execute on our core priorities and we again delivered on our commitments  We remain cautious on the macro environment of many factors  still very fluid for 2020 and significant uncertainty around short cycle demand of a balanced portfolio poised for continued performance despite macro headwinds and we continue to make significant progress on our transformation initiatives including Honeywell Connected Enterprise  Honeywell Digital  and our integrated supply chain Additionally  we re bringing innovative and Connected offerings to market to fuel growth  which combined with our strong execution track record  positions us well for 2020 and beyond  With that  Mark  Let s move to Q A Mark Bendza    Vice President  Investor RelationsThank you  Darius  Darius and Greg are now available to answer your questions  Robbie  please open the line for Q A Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  And our first question is coming from Steve Tusa with J P  Morgan Stephen Tusa    J P  Morgan    AnalystHey  guys  good morning Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Steve Greg Lewis    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Stephen Tusa    J P  Morgan    AnalystJust on the free cash you mentioned a few items obviously stronger in  19  you mentioned a few items influencing 2020  kind of disagree with using an adjusted conversion metric  ultimately cash per share is what matters  But what is the    is there anything kind of flip in  21  so is  20 to be viewed as kind of the base for growth or is there anything  timing wise  that was pulled into  19 that influence  20 and then  21 is kind of a more normal base to grow off of Greg Lewis    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  So  we ve always talked about our free cash flow conversion adjusted and we guided it last year  even in that  we ve 95  to 100  adjusted  We highlighted the    both in our press release materials both  the way we had done previously adjusted and then we also adjusted for pension income  just to be transparent about both of those metrics  We re particularly with the increase in pension income going into 2020  So that s really the    that s what you re seeing there in terms of    and both of those numbers are strongly above 100   So in terms of the 2019 into 2020 differences  what I tried to highlight in the    in the opening  Steve is really a couple of things  And first  we are going to spend a bit more capex as we go into 2020 and that s in support of our our transformation initiatives in the supply chain  some additional capacity for some new products We also have just from a calendar perspective  we re gonna have an extra payroll cycle in 2020  So that s just math and for us that s  call it  between  100 million and  200 million of headwind that will come and go in 2020  And then in terms of our environmental and other liabilities  those numbers will move a little bit and so there s probably a  100 ish million  maybe  200 million of flex that we have in there for 2020 also  So those are really the major items that you ll see  but our cash flow performance and the overachievement that we had in the fourth quarter relative to our own expectations were heavily anchored around our working capital improvements We did a tremendous job with our commercial and collections teams on the receivable side  we ve been doing a lot on transforming how we do credit to collections  And then we talked about inventory being our bugaboo for some time now and if you look at the free cash flow statement  you ll see for the first time in a while  we actually were able to get cash from inventory as we re specifically starting to tune some of those dials in  you know  a more disciplined way  with again some of the things that Torsten and the team are driving from a transformation perspective  So there are    Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  just to add a couple of things  Steve  And maybe just to add a couple of things on a year over year basis  And these are not dramatic impacts  but overall  our cash outlays are going to be slightly higher in 2020 versus 2019 due to restructuring  So that s probably another factor  I wouldn t get too focused about a baseline of 2020  obviously we have some capex to spend  which is the driver in our payment cycle  that s an extra one  So that s just a math worked outside  It doesn t necessarily mean that 2020 announced the baseline  But I do want to highlight something and I think it s a point that s been missed completely  which is if you look at the cash flow generation of this company versus what it was three years ago  we re about  2 billion higher on 15  to 20  in the last sales growth  I think that point has been just missed completely and I m extraordinarily proud of the team in terms of what they ve been able to accomplish in terms of cash generation  After all  that gives us more firepower to extra reinvest in the business or pass back to our shareowners or likely both  And I think that s the thing that really matters Stephen Tusa    J P  Morgan    AnalystOkay  So just    that makes sense  So basically a few  100 million dollars that is kind of timing related in  20  Is that    is that kind of how we should think about at a high level Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I m sorry Stephen Tusa    J P  Morgan    AnalystOkay  And then one last quick one  just on HBT  what s going on there with  I mean  you guys had a pretty positive Investor Day and now kind of framing a year with a little bit of a decline at the low end  what kind of popped up  is that kind of performance contracting out of JCI talked about that as being weak as well  What s kind of the drag there Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThat s exactly it  Steve  We basically are energy contracts or performance contracts primarily driven by the government sector  we ve seen a substantial drop off in that segment of the business in orders that has not been sort of the focus of the government sector lately  And that s been a problem  That s been a significant business for us in the past and that s dropped off  Yes  the orders there have dropped off double digit  So that s probably the one problem area that we ve seen in terms of orders  but that    we re always going to have an issue somewhere  but if we look at our long cycle orders for the quarter across Honeywell  15  growth  I don t want to sort of bypass that back in a book to bill ratio of 1 7  So I think it was an incredibly successful quarter from a long cycle orders perspective  And just to maybe quote you another fact  In a place like China  orders up north of 20  and backlog up nearly 50   So I view this quarter as just an outstanding from Honeywell winning in the marketplace Stephen Tusa    J P  Morgan    AnalystOkay  One quick one  what s your year end share count  And then I ll leave it there  just a year end ending share count  I ll leave it there  Thanks a lot Greg Lewis    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI think we ve talked about 718 Stephen Tusa    J P  Morgan    AnalystYeah OperatorWe will take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research Scott Davis    Melius Research    AnalystHi  good morning  guys Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Scott Davis    Melius Research    AnalystA lot of    a lot of information here and super helpful  I think this is the first quarter where we ve at least for the 2020 guide where supply chain seems to be a starting to become a tailwind and I guess my question really is  Darius is this become a linear tailwind  meaning you get some benefit in 2020  some in  21   22 or is there some sort of a step up that occurs over time as you kind of post these investments cycle Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think it s a gradual improvement  I think I was extraordinarily pleased with what we saw in terms of our inventory management  Inventory has been a bit of a Bugaboo for Honeywell for a long time  and we actually made some really nice progress in the second half of the year  I don t think there are any miracles for us out there  but I expect that progress to continue and it was reflected in our cash flow for Q4  And also  we re focused on our delivery our quality and so on and Torsten and his team are doing a really nice job driving those improvements and I expect a gradual improvement year over year and then transformation  I mean we dropped our fixed cost footprint in  19  We have an even more aggressive plan for 2020 and 2021  So you re going to kind of continue to see that progress on fixed cost reduction  which obviously makes us a much more variable cost company  which is something that I very much desire Scott Davis    Melius Research    AnalystYeah  Super helpful and I don t think you mentioned the word M A or deals of any course in the prepared remarks and was that    I may have missed it  of course  but was that purposeful in the context there s just not a lot  relatively expensive market out there or is it just not part of the planning right now  or deals are going to get announced when they get announced Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean  we did do Rebellion in December  which is a big acquisition  but really an interesting one  which is basically the use of imaging for advanced gas detection  So it s very much a technology oriented company in the industrial segment  which fits really  really well with industrial safety  but also  as well with Productivity Solutions and our HPS business  So we were very thrilled to get that one In terms of M A  we continue to be very active  I can tell you and the environment we re seeing is  yeah  the prices are elevated  but what I can also tell you is that kind of  because there is so much cash awash and so much capital to deploy  we re seeing very aggressive sort of due diligence in the kind of terms that others are willing to accept  So I think we re assessing that because we re going to continue to be a very cautious company and really study the market  but we also have to kind of look within ourselves in terms of  you know what s risk that s reasonable  what isn t  So it s    it s a very robust M A marketplace and we expect to do deals in 2020  certainly Scott Davis    Melius Research    AnalystHelpful  Best of luck guys  Thank you Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Scott Greg Lewis    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorWe will take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystHi  good morning  Maybe   Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystMaybe just a first question around the capex hike that you mentioned  It sounded pretty substantial  so maybe give us some idea of how long capital spending stays elevated and also in terms of the split of the capex increase maybe between growth focused on new product initiatives versus some of those supply chain internal self help measures Greg Lewis    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  So we ve been around  800 million  as you know  for the last couple of years and it goes  like in the  820 million or  830 million or so  And so  when I say elevated  this is not massive increases  we re talking about  100 million   100 million ish type of increases year on year and I would say it s probably 50 50 split between increases relative to the transformation and increases relative to some new capacity for some of our new product launches that we re doing  So I wouldn t    this is not like we re making one massive block investment and something huge here  But as we go through this transformation  in the supply chain  it s going to require    it s going to require capital  So 50 50  I would say and think about it in sort of like a  100 million   150 million type of potential increase year on year Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd by the way  just to add to that  the IRR in total on these investment is substantially north of 30   So  I mean if you think about that kind of a return versus M A  whenever we re going to see those kinds of returns  i m more than happy to deploy more capital because it s going to make us a better company in the long term  So I think that this increase in capital  I think  should be viewed as a positive  not a negative Greg Lewis    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And again  we talked about our free cash conversion  just to get back to that for a minute  We ve said many times  we are not like pinpointed on a  100 million  you know  if we ve got good investments  and we re going to be investing Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystThat s helpful  Thank you  And then my second question just around Safety and Productivity Solutions  not so much on the Productivity Solutions piece because I think that s well understood  But maybe on Safety  that did rollover in the fourth quarter  Just maybe give us some understanding of    was that a surprise to you and what do you think this year will look like in terms of Safety sales Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean there it s the markets  the industrial markets overall have been relatively soft  We don t think that there is anything sort of unusual going on in that business  it s a reflection of that  I mean it s not    obviously it s a market that s flattish to down  some of the segments that we play in  we saw that  So this is probably one why we have some uncertainty about the short cycle  that s one of the tougher businesses to call for us  We are concerned about what s happening in China around Coronavirus and so on and not just the impact in China  but really the impact on the global industrial production  because your global supply chain  So I think you have to look beyond just China  But we re optimistic that the markets are going to improve  but there isn t inherently something unusual going on in those    in that    in that business Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystGreat  thanks Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you Greg Lewis    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks OperatorWe will take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi Andy Kaplowitz    Citi    AnalystGood morning  guys Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Andy Greg Lewis    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Andy Andy Kaplowitz    Citi    AnalystDarius or Greg  just focusing on your guidance for 2020  To the extent you can  could you elaborate on the headwinds you could incur from the MAX  either growth or margin and obviously it s too early to tell the Coronavirus impact on commercial aftermarket  But there are lot of moving parts in that business  whether it s a brief flight hours  or the ADSP mandate  you ve had stronger news  your initiatives are doing well  So how do you think about the resiliency of commercial Aero aftermarket in 2020 Greg Lewis    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo obviously the    what Boeing is doing with the MAX return to service has and will have an impact on the aftermarket performance and I think we were all    we re all aware of the fly deal became longer and so the quarter has increased demand in that sense  When you think about our guide for what s happening with the math  you should think about    we re going to have probably a low to mid single digit headwind to the Aerospace growth because of the production schedule changes And so we talked last year about it being rather minimal because the numbers were smaller  But now with Boeing announcing the stoppage of production and their mid year return to service and their ramp up  their reramp  we are going to be taking down our deliveries to them much more significantly than we did in the back half of 2019  So as we talked about  we will try to utilize some of our other existing backlog and hopefully the supply base can provide us some additional material inputs  so that we can  Indecipherable  labor and try to serve some of our other customers in a way to offset some of that  but it s hard to say how that s going to work out  That s    that s why we re    we are being a bit cautious  because that s all very fresh news  as you know  within weeks and so the impacts to even our supply chain is unknown  So   Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  the revenue impact is meaningful  I mean it s    think about kind of a mid triple digit impact for millions of dollars that obviously we can    we think we can offset some of that  both through ARM  Phonetic  use and backlog reduction but it s from a revenue perspective  it s not an insignificant    and by the way  we re just    we re completely aligned to Boeing s perspective  So it s    that s what    that s what s reflected in our current outlook Andy Kaplowitz    Citi    AnalystThanks for that guys  And  Darius you already mentioned China in Q4 was pretty strong in terms of orders  but maybe you can walk us around the world  which you did in Q4 and what your expectations are for 2020  We are understanding that there s uncertainty out there  I think in Q3  China U S  year grew strong  you re expecting India to come back  So what happened to these regions in Q4 Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Yeah  interesting Q4  I mean  obviously  China was a highlight  both kind of on the orders growth rate  And by the way  China is accelerating for us  So you have seen a higher rate of growth in Q2  Q3  Q4  Q4 is even higher  So we re encouraged by what we re seeing there  the orders give us  So actually  China is one of the really nice storage for us  The other place to highlight  and I think  I ve talked about this before  which is Latin America  I mean Latin America was also up high single digits and obviously we have to be taking a lot of share there given the fact that a lot of those economies aren t exactly robust and they re struggling  So I m very  very pleased with what s happened there Middle East continues to be a region of strength for us  We had some tougher comps  but think low to mid single digit kind of growth rate  Probably that the low light for us was Western Europe  That s been kind of soft in Q4  I think a couple of the countries that I d look to get that were particularly soft would be Italy and the Netherlands  which were weak overall  India was OK in Q4  Frankly  it was a little bit lower than we had hoped  the low to mid single digit kind of growth numbers  There is some    we have    that s a country of strength for us  but slightly below our expectations And Russia actually did quite well for us as well in the segments that we play in  So sort of a mixed story but the highlight certainly would be in China   Indecipherable  the actual performance and the bookings growth  our growth Andy Kaplowitz    Citi    AnalystVery interesting  thanks guys Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you Greg Lewis    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks OperatorWe will take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystHey  thank you  Good morning  everyone  Couple of quick ones from me  Just on the Productivity products  Darius  a little surprised to hear you re not expecting a return to growth to the back half    into the back half  the comps are very easy in the first half  Do you feel like you have the product to actually drive the business and kind of take a little bit better control of your desk relative to kind of just what the noise is going on perhaps in the channel Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo  to be clear  I am expecting a return to growth in Productivity products  So I think we    I think we ve got our signals across  And just to give you some very specific data points  The sales out in the channel for Productivity products has grown every quarter of last year  More or less normalized our channel position now  By the end of 2019 we actually saw growth in the standing portfolio in Productivity products and we ve been able to secure a couple of good wins  the toughest comp still for Productivity products is Q1  We anticipated that  it s not news  but as we get further and further out the year  I do expect growth in Productivity products  So    and I have the data too  That gives me that confidence  So that s not that we shouldn t hope  I have some data points that says that that s a reasonable outcome to expect unless  of course  something goes wrong with the market  But actually I m very pleased with the kind of progress that s been made  the team that we now have there in place and the products that we have to the marketplace Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystAll right  I was just going by slide 7 there on the second half  Just thinking about the guide overall  when you read what you ve put on slide 6  it doesn t sound like you re being super conservative but then when you talk and with the    with the range  it does in a way feel conservative  Could you just address that  I mean zero at the low end feels pretty conservative particularly if you pull out a zero in Q1  which is your toughest comparison  right  Then you probably are on a path for something better than that as the year unfolds Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  Jeff  I think we ve been pretty consistent in our approach in terms of forecasting and outlooks  which is  we re not    when i m not sure of something or myself and Greg are not sure of something  we re going to give you a wider range  And we re not going to promise things that we don t either don t have visibility or can t do  I would also tell you a couple of other things  I mean  there are quite a few unknowns  I mean the Coronavirus right now  as an example  is something that s very difficult for us to predict around the impact  I mean if things go back and our factories reopen Monday or a week from Monday  which is kind of the schedule  then maybe it s conservative  What if they don t  What if this continues to spread  What if it gets worse  That impact could be    could be substantially worse than what we re expecting The short cycle is a little bit unpredictable  We talked about    there was a prior question industrial safety  it s tough    it s tough to call that right now  As I look at a lot of the reports from a lot of the shorter cycle oriented peers  they exactly have not been stellar  I mean  so we re trying to call it  I don t know about conservatively  when we don t know and we don t know that much about short cycle right now  We re going to kind of err on certainly  a little bit wider range and we ll see what happens and obviously like we do every year  as the year progresses  we ll update you and we ll refresh our guidance  I m very happy with our long cycle  I mean a 10  growth in the backlog is very good  So that gives me some confidence and we ll see how the year progresses Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystYeah  And on the long cycle  just one more if I could  Obviously projects are normally subject to delays and the like  But as it stands now  is most of that backlog deliverable in 2020  It s tied to expected activity in 2020 Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo  it s    some of it is beyond 2020  I mean  we sort of expect the normal conversion cycle  I mean it s    for example  some of the Intelligrated backlog just goes all the way into 20   Greg Lewis    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer15 months   Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  15  18 months  so it s longer cycle  But nevertheless  I mean the makeup of it isn t dramatically different in terms of execution versus 20    end of 2018  So it s    it kind of looks the same  It s always more than one year  So it s not inconsistent  what we ve seen in the past Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystGreat  thank you very much Mark Bendza    Vice President  Investor RelationsHey  Robbie  I think we can take two more questions OperatorOkay  thank you  We will take our next question from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank Nicole DeBlase    Deutsche Bank    AnalystYeah  thanks for the question  Good morning  guys Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Nicole Nicole DeBlase    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGood morning  So my first question is just around  you guys talked about short cycle as obviously another item of uncertainty in 2020  Can you talk a little bit about what you saw from short cycle trends in 4Q throughout the quarter  And was there maybe any signs of like weakening throughout December and into January that gives you concern into the first quarter or have you seen more like stabilization Greg Lewis    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI would tell you that as we    as we exited the year  it was relatively stable  But I would tell you that also January with the China situation is going to be one we re going to have to read into pretty closely  So  no  I wouldn t highlight a huge problem to solve at this point just yet  but certainly there have been some weakening trends as we exited December and into January in a few places  Again  China  on the short cycle is one we re going to watch very closely  Darius mentioned a couple of areas in Europe in particular as well Nicole DeBlase    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  got it  Thanks  Greg  And then secondly just around Process  if you guys could talk a little bit more about what you re seeing from a backlog perspective and areas of strength  One of your big competitors talked about some big LNG projects coming through recently  so it would be great to hear where the strength is coming from for you guys Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  well  I think for us it s probably three main components of strengths  By the way  HPS had a terrific quarter  double digit orders growth  the business is doing incredibly well  we re thrilled with their performance  But specifically LNGs coming through some of the mega refining petrochemical complexes is another place of growth and we re starting to give you a bit more in the renewable segment  That s actually one of the focus areas for PMT in general  And we re seeing some improved activity for    in renewables  So I would highlight those three as areas where we re seeing growth with a terrific bookings and orders outlook in Q4 Nicole DeBlase    Deutsche Bank    AnalystThanks  Darius  I ll pass it on OperatorAnd our next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystThanks guys  Thanks  Indecipherable  appreciate it  So yeah  we ve obviously covered a lot of ground and I appreciate all the detail by the way  I just want to clarify on the payroll cycle  Greg  you called out  100 million   200 million  is that just a cash impact or does that also impact   Darius Adamczyk    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThat s right  Payroll Greg Lewis    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  payroll  that s our payroll Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystRight  So was that just cash or was that earnings Greg Lewis    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  no that s cash  That s just   Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystBusiness cash  Okay Greg Lewis    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGenerally  at the end of the year  we carry an accrual  The way the calendar falls that are repaid every two weeks on a Friday  happens all the time  the exact same way  It happens  next year  this Friday it s going to be ready for the year end Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystUnderstood  Thank you very much  And then my main question is on the 20 to 50 bps of segment margin expansion  How does that look by segments  And the spirit of my question is  should we expect SPS to be sort of a heavy contributor to that  maybe Aerospace is a little bit less  So any color on that and then kind of the subtext here is  you re obviously doing a lot of restructuring this year  up to  0 5 billion in your plan  Is that all cash  And what kind of paybacks are you getting on that spend Greg Lewis    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  so let me unpack that  First of all  we re not giving segment margin expansion guidance individually  We should expect  of course that SPS will improve  given the degradation we saw in 2019  They ve obviously got a lot more room to run given that depression we had this year  The other three businesses  I think all have  I ll call it  equal opportunity on margin improvement overall  So that s the way I would think about    think about that from a segment perspective As it relates to the restructuring  a high percentage of the restructuring that we have on the balance sheet is cash oriented  and we do expect that is going to essentially get carried out over 2 5 to 3 years time  As Darius mentioned  a heavy amount of that would be in 2020 and then in 2021 and a little bit of a tail off into  22  But as it relates to the projects  you can think about them really in sort of two categories  those that are really tied to  call it  site consolidations  Those are above the cost of capital  clearly the high single digit  low double digit type returns  those that are more associated with  call it  back office productivity and organizational redevelopment and so on  Those are carrying far higher returns to them  So that s kind of what we are looking at Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystGreat  thank you  And one quick clarification on the share count reduction question  It doesn t feel like you ve got a whole lot dialed in for 2020 about  1 5 billion  by my calculations  Is that the right zone Greg Lewis    Senior

148001,369517,HON,Stocks   S P Suffers Worst Day Since October on Wuhan Virus Fears,news,"By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing com   The S P capped the first month of the new decade with its biggest daily loss since October as coronavirus led selling intensified on concerns a pandemic could send the global economy into turmoil 
The S P 500 fell 1 77   while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 1 59  and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2 09   
Thr S P and Dow ended January in the red 
Fears of contagion gripped stocks amid growing doubt about whether China can contain the outbreak  with more than 10 000 cases reported globally so far  and the death toll rising to 213 
The White House on Friday declared the coronavirus a public health emergency in the United States and warned that people who pose a risk of transmitting the disease will temporarily be suspended from entry into the U S 
The rapid spread of the virus has triggered recession fears as the impact on China s already slowing economy could spill over into the global economy 
But some have said it is far too early to estimate the impact on global growth and suggested the recent selloff was a long time coming as stocks were overbought 
 Global growth right now is projected to be greater than 3   If this continues  and maybe even if it only continues for another month  you could knock that down below 3      Blackstones  Byron Wien told CNBC  
 I think the market was overbought  It was due for a correction  A correction is healthy   Wein added 
The selling on stocks was exacerbated by a slump in energy  paced by weakness in   Exxon Mobil    NYSE XOM  
Exxon fell about 4  after the oil major missed quarterly estimates  which it blamed on short term supply issues in its refining business 
Industrials also played a role in the broader selloff  paced by declines in   Caterpillar    NYSE CAT  and Honeywell  NYSE HON  on weak quarterly results and guidance   
Caterpillar fell 3  after reporting mixed quarterly results and offering up a weaker than expected outlook on full year performance  warning that global economic uncertainty would continue to weigh on performance 
Honeywell slipped about 3  as its quarterly revenue missed Wall Street estimates  with the industrial pinning the blame on impact from the grounding of Boeing s 737 Max

148004,369520,HON,Why Honeywell International s Guidance Looks Conservative,news,"Honeywell International  NYSE HON  has acquired a reputation for giving conservative looking guidance and then promptly beating it  and CEO Darius Adamczyk appears to be continuing that tradition with his outlook for 2020  There are plenty of moving parts to the industrial conglomerate s earnings and a lot of uncertainty around its end markets in 2020    not least from the production slowdown on the Boeing  NYSE BA  737 MAX    but Honeywell still looks well placed for growth in the second half and beyond  Here s why 

Honeywell International guidance 
In order to understand Honeywell s earnings trajectory  here s a look at segment profit in 2019 

Now let s take a look at the company s headline guidance for 2020  As you can see below  sales growth is expected to slow with earnings per share  EPS  rising in the range of 5 4  to 10 3  

Data source  Honeywell International 
Three reasons why Honeywell will exit the year in better shape
While the guidance for 0  3  organic sales growth looks disappointing  there s reason for optimism that Honeywell s earnings growth will improve in the second half 
First  for the first quarter  management guided toward organic sales to be in the range of a decline of 2  to an increase of 2   However  it should be noted that the 8  organic growth reported in the first quarter of 2019 was the highest quarter of growth for the company in the year  In other words  Honeywell is about to come up against its toughest comparable of the year 
However  organic growth was just 3  and 2  in the last two quarters of 2019  meaning comparisons will get easier in the back half of the year  Moreover  many industrial companies are expecting a better second half in general  and this could feed through into an improved spending environment overall 
The Boeing 737 MAX should return to service
Second  the outlook in the first half is being negatively affected by the ongoing grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX  Here s a look at Honeywell s organic sales growth guidance by segment 

According to CFO Greg Lewis on the earnings call  the production delays on the 737 MAX are going to create  probably a low to mid single digit headwind to the Aerospace growth because of the production schedule changes  
However  since Boeing expects a return to service for the 737 MAX at around the midpoint of the year  it s fair to assume that Honeywell s aerospace growth could improve markedly in the second half  Moreover  a full year of 737 MAX production in 2021 should lead to an improvement in aerospace revenue when compared with 2020 
Many of Honeywell s businesses are in good shape
Third  management s commentary around its other businesses also suggests an improvement  I ve already discussed aerospace above  and the SPS segment is also expected to see an improvement in the second half  For example  productivity products  around 22  of SPS sales  is expected to return to growth in 2020 after three consecutive declines to the end of 2019  Meanwhile  Honeywell s warehouse automation business  Intelligrated  27  of SPS sales   saw orders improve by 100  in the quarter  which will position the business well for 2020 as these major projects begin to drive growth starting in the second quarter and beyond 
Turning to PMT  Adamczyk said Honeywell process solutions  around 35  of PMT sales  had  a terrific quarter  double digit orders growth   and Honeywell UOP  catalysts for refining  27  of PMT sales  also had robust order growth    suggesting good revenue growth down the line  The great imponderable in 2020 is likely to be growth at HBT  a business largely tied to non residential construction 

Looking ahead
Don t be surprised if Honeywell s guidance proves to be conservative once again  and there s good reason to believe that the company will exit 2020 looking better than it does entering it 
In common with many other industrial companies in 2020  Honeywell s near term outlook is somewhat dependent on a timely return to service for the Boeing 737 MAX  If that occurs alongside a return to growth in the SPS segment  and conversion of orders into revenue at PMT  then Honeywell could be set for a strong finish to 2020 ",2020-02-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/psg20,2079098

148144,369660,HON,With trade war as a backdrop  U S  companies walk a line at China expo,news,"By John Ruwitch and Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI  Reuters    At trade shows in the United States  California based Champion Power Equipment displays the faces of the tough looking sportsmen that it sponsors against the backdrop of an American flag 
At an import expo in China this week  the images of a pro bass fisherman  lumberjack  bull rider and NASCAR and off road drivers were there   but the flag was not 
 Even though we re proud to showcase we re a U S  company  there are some things we ve just tried to     tame it down a little bit   said Greg Pauken  director of product development at the maker of portable generators and other motorised tools   Why create any more conflict than you need to  
U S  companies are walking a tightrope at the Nov  5 10 China International Import Expo  CIIE  in Shanghai  with the fate of a preliminary deal between China and the United States to defuse the trade war still up in the air 
Strong backing from Chinese leader Xi Jinping has imbued CIIE with political symbolism unmatched by any other trade show in China 
The U S  government has made a point of skipping it in the two years it has existed  Several other countries have sent leaders or senior officials  and many are hosting lavish pavilions promoting their nation s wares 
Nevertheless  more American companies have showed up this year   nearly 200   than in CIIE s inaugural year  propelled by enthusiasm about China s vast market  In some cases  companies also want to support an event that the Chinese government considers highly significant 
Concern was not far from the surface about prospects for business if the trade war drags on and the world s no  2 economy continues slipping 
U S  companies are not yet being stigmatised  according to Stephen Lien  president of the Aerospace Asia Pacific Division at Honeywell International Inc  N HON   but such a thing was  certainly possible  
 We get Chinese customers walking in and talking to us all day long   he said   They re not going to Philips just because we re an American company and Philips is a European company  There continues to be a lot of interest  
Nearby  Twiggy Zhao  a representative at the WD 40 Co  O WDFC  booth  said the California based maker of lubricants was eager to gain traction in the China market but remained  a little bit worried  about trade war fallout 
 We quite want to separate politics and business  I mean  our product is very helpful and useful  so we want people to focus on products   she said 
On top of trade uncertainty is the perception that political risks have risen  as highlighted by the troubles the National Basketball Association has faced since the Houston Rockets  general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong s protests last month 
For Impossible Foods  the developer of plant based meat substitutes  the risks are outweighed by the prospect of tapping into a huge country reliant on a environment straining livestock industry 
Founder and chief executive Pat Brown was taking advice on how to walk the line from his brother  a diplomat in China 
 We don t intend to impose our own ideology on China or anything like that  but we are not going to be shy about talking about our values   he said 
 We re not here to tell China how to run its business   he added   We re here to help solve a huge global problem and help China solve its own food security and reduce its environmental impact  We re completely focused on that  
Li Fang  president and general manager of Corning Inc s  N GLW  greater China operations  said his company s success here had been aided by government support  Li said attending CIIE for the first time this year was  in part  a gesture of support for China 
The New York based company has invested more than  7 billion in China   more than half of it since 2015   and is doing  extremely well   despite risks  Li said  The impact of the trade war has been  minimal  and Corning plans to continue to invest

forcing it to shut down two of its 11 assembly lines   all located in mainland China  Already disenchanted with the U S  market after a legal battle with rival  iRobot Corp   O IRBT  in 2017  the tariffs were the last straw and in December Matsutek switched its focus to its own  Jiaweishi  vacuum cleaners   promoting them on Alibaba s  N BABA  Tmall and Pinduoduo s  O PDD  e commerce platforms  Although the brand was created in 2015  Matsutek had until then not done much with it   This was our wake up moment  We realized we couldn t rely on overseas markets alone  rather we should build our own brands in China   Terry Wu  general manager of two Matsutek units in Shenzhen  told Reuters  The trade war is proving to be a turning point for the countless Chinese original equipment manufacturers  OEMs  that supply products to Western firms to rebrand and sell  and on whose backs China has built up its reputation as the  Factory of the World   For some like Matsutek  it has triggered a major strategic rethink  while for others that have been developing brands aimed at the Chinese consumer  it has prompted them to step up those efforts    Being an OEM is like being a peasant counting on a good year of rain  Why shouldn t we build our own brands  lower the price a bit and offer products that have the same quality as foreign brands   Wu said  Indeed  for China based companies heavily exposed to the U S  market  it is one of their few strategic options aside from shifting some production to other countries   a tactic that is also gaining momentum  Longer term  the greater impetus for Chinese companies to more aggressively develop their own brands is expected to spell fiercer competition for big foreign companies   Chinese companies that used to be business partners and suppliers are becoming rivals   said Jason Ding  partner at consultancy Bain   Company  adding that foreign brands in the Chinese market will have to step up their game  E COMMERCE PUSH Anhui Deli  a maker of wine glasses and other glassware with annual revenue of 800 million yuan   113 million   has also been hit hard by the trade tariffs   The U S  was our main growth market until this year but due to the trade war  clients have become hesitant to put in an order  and many orders from the U S  have been canceled   said Cheng Yingling  the company s marketing director  Additional tariffs that went into effect this month will bring the levies on Chinese glassware to 40    a big hit to the industry  he added  E commerce sales at home  however  have helped offset some of that pain  Recently teaming up with  Pinduoduo   sales of a new glass container have hit more than 50 000 a month   around three times more than what a similar product would sell through stores  It has also decided to open a factory in Pakistan  which is expected to start operating in January  But transferring output to other countries takes time and can be fraught with risks  Both Matsutek  a smaller firm that made 500 million yuan in revenue last year  and Shenzhen MTC Co  a supplier of TVs to Walmart Inc  N WMT  under the Onn brand with 13 billion yuan in annual revenue  spent months exploring a shift of some production to Vietnam  But they gave up after U S  President Donald Trump s administration threatened in June to add the Southeast Asian country to its tariff list  MTC  which bought the rights to the JVC brand in China in 2017  has also started to work with Pinduoduo   Prompted in part by the trade dispute  the e commerce firm is wooing companies which want to quickly expand in the domestic market with a program launched in December that provides consulting services on product development  It also promises to share data and provide ad time   Pinduoduo reached out to us and said they want to have a manufacturer to consumer business model  Considering they are doing very well in lower tier cities and have fewer partners in home appliances  than other e commerce firms  we decided to work with them   said David Fang  vice president of MTC  Matsutek s Wu said the firm s new focus on the China market has been a huge success  and it has sold more than 100 000 robotic vacuum cleaners under the Jiaweishi brand  It plans to reopen the two assembly lines it shut down and add three more by early next year   We think there are great opportunities in China  The penetration rate of robotic vacuum cleaners in the U S  market is 17   while in China it s only 1 5    said Wu   At the end of the day  there are more than 1 billion people here

Sterling bulls could be forgiven if they thought Christmas had arrived early 
Deadlocked for months over Brexit  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar now say they  see a pathway to a possible deal   The pound has witnessed its biggest two day jump in more than three years  as investors slash some of their extreme short sterling bets  Expectations for an interest rate cut are falling too  as a positive Brexit outcome would remove the uncertainty hanging over the economy 
But the road is long   EU Council President Donald Tusk has signaled there is no guarantee of a deal and time is running out  It also remains unclear what compromises have been made on the thorny Irish border issue  but hopes are now high of further progress ahead the Oct 17 18 EU summit 
The risk of exiting without a deal had already faded  but if a deal is agreed at the summit or before it  sterling could jump above a 2019 high of near  1 34 hit in March  Delay and recrimination  however  could see the pound reverse the gains it racked up so quickly this week

Economic growth   the weakest in 27 years in June   is also seen going a little lower in the third quarter to test the bottom end of Beijing s 6  to 6 5  target for 2019  All that will put pressure on the central bank to loosen monetary policy  especially if the planned U S  tariff increase go through 
Another number of interest will be the daily fixing of the yuan s onshore trading range  A fall past the symbolic seven per dollar rate in August was considered a response to economic weakness as well as a message that the currency would be on the table if the trade war escalated  The yuan has been pegged around 7 0730 for a few weeks  and a move in either direction could telegraph clearer than words whether the trade war antagonists are moving closer together or further apart   POLL China s Sept exports seen falling 3   imports to shrink for 5th month U S  China currency deal won t change dollar yuan dynamics  expertsTIMELINE Key dates in the U S  China trade war

Meanwhile  Trump s blossoming friendship with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has hit a rocky patch  Bosom buddies not long ago  when the U S  president shielded Ankara from being sanctioned over its purchase of Russian missile defense systems  the two are locking horns over Turkey s launch of a military campaign in northeastern Syria against Kurdish forces   I say hit Turkey very hard financially   with sanctions if they don t play by the rules  I am watching closely   Trump tweeted 
Republicans in the House of Representatives have announced plans for legislation to impose sanctions and the upcoming EU summit will debate sanctions  The quarrel carries enormous risks for Turkey s economy  which is still emerging from its worst slump in two decades  The sanction threats have pushed the lira to its weakest level in nearly four months and its dollar bonds have tumbled  Risks include higher deficits and borrowing costs and slowing tourism  The volatility is likely to prevent the central bank from easing policy later this month  crimping economic recovery

148254,369770,HON,The Truth About Market Timing   January 28  2020,opinion,"In the long run  does consistent market timing really matter to be a successful investor 
In fact  even among long term investors who don t attempt to time the markets  being able to call the top of the market is a skill that many think they possess  This misguided confidence is often driving investors to sit on the sidelines and wait it out for better market opportunities 
Giving up too soon at the first sign of inconvenience often leads to missed opportunities among numerous individuals who try to trade on their own retirement  For example  many investors have forfeited immense chances waiting for the Conglomerates stocks to correct  only see the latter achieve new highs  move higher and drive the buyer markets to record levels  Barloworld Ltd   BRRAY   China Merchants Holdings International Co   CMHHY   Bunzl  LON BNZL  PLC  BZLFY   Crane Company  CR   Honeywell International Inc   NYSE HON 
Fear and greed often lead investors into behavioral traps since most investors are followers who react  rather than anticipate market moves 
Accomplished market timing requires three key components  1  A dependable sign of when to get in and out of stocks  2  The capacity to act upon signals quickly and accurately  3  Have the stomach to act on market signals  no matter how counterintuitive the move may be 
Market timing is commonly perceived as the ability to guess the exact market top or bottom and make moves accordingly  However  there is a less common  rather straightforward market timing strategy that has been utilized effectively by insightful financial specialists like Warren Buffet for a considerable length of time 
Rule 1  Never attempt and time tops and bottoms 
Forget tracking for market tops or bottoms to expand your odds for success with a longer timeline and give yourself the flexibility to eventually profit  regardless of whether your calls are spot on or way off base 
Rule 2  Make an effort not to sell in the midst of little crashes  Muster the courage to trust your gut and buy best in class stocks at a discount 
Warren Buffett has made a great part of his fortune due to this simple rule  He benefits by focusing on the long   term and buying high quality stocks at a discount during large market corrections to profit down the road 
There is a big difference between a stock market crash and small correction  No matter what happens in the stock market  chances are that the stocks you own will eventually come back to their pre   crash value  hanging on to your original positions  or opportunistically averaging down  during market downs can be the shrew distraction to take  Warren Buffett takes this idea further by frequently going on purchasing binges when the markets turn  basically purchasing extra shares of his top stock picks at a major markdown and doubling   down on his very own recommendations 
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But  think about this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Chasing alpha  outsized  short   term returns through market timing and other high   risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources  however for your long   term retirement assets a  risk adjusted  investment discipline is what largely bodes well

148257,369773,HON,How To Buy Microsoft For 8 6  Off With A 6  Dividend,opinion,"There s a dangerous myth going around  that stocks are in a bubble  and if you buy now  you ll lose money 
This myth is dangerous because it is discouraging people from putting money in one of the most powerful wealth generating machines on earth  And income seekers  retirees  in particular  who know how to navigate this market can not only get massive profits but also strong cash flow  like the 6  dividends  paid monthly  on a fund I ll introduce you to shortly  This fund is worth your while because it s a play on US stocks at a time when stocks are strong and getting stronger  and because it ll get you those stocks at an 8 6  discount  too 
And no  you aren t too late to get into this market now  even if people are telling you otherwise  Let me explain why 
The Bubble Myth

First  let s look at 2019 s stock performance by examining the SPDR S P 500 ETF Trust  NYSE SPY   which tracks the S P 500 
30  Gains in a Year






In just one year  the S P 500 rose over 30  with dividends included  In fact  2019 was the best year for the index since 2013  and one of the best on record  As a result  a lot of people are warning that we re in a bubble 
They re wrong  for one reason  recency bias  Look at 2019 on its own and it seems like stocks are overheating  But look back further and the picture changes a lot 
Two Years Were Worse Than One






Over two years  stocks earned about a 12 5  annualized return  That s still high  but by no means in bubble territory 
When we take a broader view of stocks  we realize that 2019 s performance was an aberration  and partly a result of luck  Since the 2018 downturn ended in late December  it just so happens that the 2019 calendar year looks unusually strong  But what if we looked from July 2018 to July 2019  Again  things seem much milder 
Slight Shift Changes the Picture






Now we see just 11  gains in a year a very big difference  The lesson here  Always take the long term view and don t cherry pick short term time periods when attempting to understand how stocks perform over the long haul 
The Really Long View






Let s go way back to understand how US stocks are doing now and try to get to the bottom of whether we re in a bubble  To do so  let s review some facts 
Fact  1  The worst year for stocks since 1928 was in 1931  when stocks fell 47 1   The global financial crisis triggered the third worst year  in 2008  when stocks fell 38 5  
Fact  2  The best annual return in history was 46 6  in 1933  when stocks recovered from the initial drop in the Great Depression 
Fact  3  Since 1928  even including the Great Depression  1970s stagflation  the dot com bubble bursting  and the global financial crisis  stocks have returned 7 6  annually  on average 
These three facts tell us something crucial  stocks tend to correct from big declines and  over the long term  investors will still make a lot of money  no matter how severe the crisis seems to be  US stocks have been through world wars  oil shortages and financial disasters and still come out ahead 
But naysayers still protest  over the last 10 years  stocks have returned 11 8  a year  on average 
Is This Market Too Hot 






Since this is above the long term average  the argument goes  stocks are in a bubble and should be sold immediately 
Again  this is flawed thinking  based on cherry picked data 
Rewind 20 years and the average return for stocks is just 5 6   Stocks were in neutral from their dot com reversal in the 2000s until the global financial crisis  and in the last decade they ve been recovering from this historical aberration through a gradual appreciation  That s evidence that the 10 year time horizon is wrongheaded 
But even more compelling is this  move the goalposts just slightly and the average annual return goes down to 8 6  
Two Years Make a Big Difference






Because the global financial crisis ended exactly a decade ago  choosing a 10 year time horizon right now will give you an unusually high data point that isn t an accurate reflection of reality  The longer term view tells us that  over the long haul  stocks go up  and right now stocks aren t going up much more than their normal rate of return 
Which is why now is the time to jump in 
But How 
If you re still worried that stocks are overvalued  there is one way to get them at a big discount   
Here s how they work  a CEF will buy a basket of assets and keep them in a portfolio  The sum of that portfolio s value is known as the net asset value  NAV  of the fund  Since CEFs trade on an exchange  like stocks  but trade a fixed number of shares  the market price of their shares  which is based on investor demand  can go above or below the NAV of the fund 
When the fund s market price is below its NAV  you can get the assets in that fund at a discount 

This is why a fund like the Gabelli Dividend   Income Trust  NYSE GDV  is so interesting  GDV holds a number of large cap US stocks like JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM   Honeywell  NYSE HON   Mastercard  MA   Verizon  NYSE VZ  and Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  while trading at an 8 4  discount  That means that you can get  10 000 worth of these stocks with just  9 160  Plus  that  9 160 will get you a 6  income stream  or  45 73 per month on your initial investment 

If you wanted to get that same income stream with SPY  you d need to invest a whopping  32 087  or three and a half times as much as you d need to put into GDV 
And GDV isn t the best CEF out there not by a longshot  There are dozens of CEFs with dividends upwards of 8   and dozens more with returns that have beaten the S P 500 for years  So you can get into this rising stock market and get a massive income stream at the same time  while also paying less than most investors do 
5 Quick Buys for 20  Upside and 8   Dividends Starting TodayIf you think a 6  would make a big difference to your retirement  wait until you see the 5 CEFs I have for you   They pay you steady dividends of 7   8   even north of 9   Like GDV  most of them pay you every single month  too 
In all  we re looking at an 8  average dividend from this 5 fund  mini portfolio   And thanks to their totally unwarranted discounts  I m calling for 20  gains in these 5 funds  market prices in the next 12 months  too 
It pains me to see regular folks sleepwalking right past huge dividends like these  especially when they re sitting in plain sight  Right now  there are around 500 CEFs out there  and they yield 7   on average 
Why haven t you heard about them 
Because the financial media is too obsessed with flashy headlines  like the latest offering from Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  or Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   to focus on  boring  CEFs  Most advisors  too  would rather simply recommend you buy an ETF it s a lot less research for them  and they get paid either way 
It s a sad situation we re going to put a stop to right now today

148307,369823,HON,Simple Market Timing Strategies That Work   December 19  2019,opinion,"Is the ability to time the markets more of a data driven science or a  gut   feeling  art 
Indeed  even among those investors who don t try to consistently time the markets  many think they can still call a top and act opportunistically  It s at these times when an investor who speculates often sits on the sidelines and looks for better opportunities to put money into the market 
Missed investing opportunities by exiting at the first sign of trouble is a common pattern among many self directed investors  Case in point  How many investors have missed huge opportunities waiting for the Conglomerates stocks listed below to correct  only to see them reach new highs  climb higher and drive the bull market to record levels  Barloworld Ltd   BRRAY   China Merchants Holdings International Co   CMHHY   Bunzl  LON BNZL  PLC  BZLFY   Crane Company  CR   Honeywell International Inc   NYSE HON 
Dread and exuberance regularly propel investors into merely  reacting  to market volatility  rather than envisioning market trends 
Productive market timing requires three key parts  1  A dependable sign for when to get in and out of stocks  2  The ability to follow up on the sign rapidly and precisely  3  The ability to be completely unemotional and trust in the signal no matter the current market environment 
Many investors believe that market timing is a short term investment strategy  There is a less known  more effective  longer term market timing approach that has been used successfully by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Never try and time tops and bottoms 
Forget tracking for market tops or bottoms to expand your odds for success with a longer timeline and give yourself the flexibility to eventually profit  regardless of whether your calls are spot on or way off base 
Rule 2  Don t sell during minor crashes   instead  have the patience to weather the storm  or even better  milk the opportunity to buy low 
Warren Buffett has made his fortune based of this straightforward guideline  He cautions not to sell during little crashes  and encourages enduring them by concentrating on the long haul 
There is a major distinction between a financial crash and a mild market reset  The theory is that if you like and bought a stock at a previous valuation prior to the correction  you should love the opportunity to this same at a steep discount since the underlying fundamentals are most likely still intact  Warren Buffett takes this idea one step further and often goes on a buying spree when markets turn  essentially buying additional shares of his top stock picks at a big discount and listening to his own advice   Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful  
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s only human that many succumb to greed and try and game the system by timing the market  But consider this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would have to be accurate 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Indeed  even a slight outperformance most likely wouldn t justify the efforts   and given that even the specialists for the most part come up short at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive methodology for investing  particularly when it comes to building your retirement nest egg 
Chasing alpha  outsized  short   term returns through market timing and other high   risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources  however for your long   term retirement assets a  risk adjusted  investment discipline is what largely bodes well

148309,369825,HON,The Truth About Market Timing   January 08  2020,opinion,"Have you ever dreamed of being that one in a million investor who has the talent to perfectly time the markets 
In fact  even among long term investors who don t attempt to time the markets  being able to call the top of the market is a skill that many think they possess  This misguided confidence is often driving investors to sit on the sidelines and wait it out for better market opportunities 
Giving up too soon at the first sign of inconvenience often leads to missed opportunities among numerous individuals who try to trade on their own retirement  For example  many investors have forfeited immense chances waiting for the Conglomerates stocks to correct  only see the latter achieve new highs  move higher and drive the buyer markets to record levels  Honeywell International Inc   NYSE HON   Barloworld Ltd   BRRAY   China Merchants Holdings International Co   CMHHY   Bunzl  LON BNZL  PLC  BZLFY   Crane Company  CR 
Fear and greed often lead investors into behavioral traps since most investors are followers who react  rather than anticipate market moves 
Fruitful market timing requires three key parts  1  A solid sign to guide you when to get in and out of stocks  or securities  gold or different kinds of investments   2  The capacity to act on the sign accurately  3  The control to follow up on it 
Market timing is commonly perceived as the ability to guess the exact market top or bottom and make moves accordingly  However  there is a less common  rather straightforward market timing strategy that has been utilized effectively by insightful financial specialists like Warren Buffet for a considerable length of time 
Rule 1  Never try and time tops and bottoms 
Abandoning the objective to time the tops and bottoms conclusively gives you the flexibility to profit  and extends your chance to benefit from the equity markets over the long term whether your specific market timing calls are right or wrong 
Rule 2  Don t sell during minor crashes   instead  have the patience to weather the storm  or even better  milk the opportunity to buy low 
Warren Buffett has made his fortune based of this straightforward guideline  He cautions not to sell amid little crashes and to instead endure the temporary hardship and profit by concentrating on the long haul 
There is a key distinction between a small correction and a market crash  No matter what happens in the stock market  chances are that the stocks you own will eventually come back to their pre   crash value  hanging on to your original positions  or opportunistically averaging down  during market downs can be the shrew distraction to take  Warren Buffett takes this thought one step further by often buying outsized positions in value stocks he likes across the board when markets turn  essentially leveraging his bottoms up analysis and stock picking acumen 
When It Comes to Trading Your Retirement  A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But consider this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would have to be accurate 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Actively trading for alpha  outsized  short   term gains through market timing and other high   risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets  but for your longer   term retirement assets  a  risk  adjusted focused  investment solution generally makes more sense

148329,369845,HON,Simple Market Timing Strategies That Work   October 18  2019,opinion,"Have you ever dreamed of being that one in a million investor who has the talent to perfectly time the markets 
Even among those who don t aspire to be the perfect market timer  many think they can call a top and act accordingly  It s at these times when investors choose to sit on the sidelines and wait for a  perceived  better opportunity to invest in the market 
Individual investors who focus their efforts on timing the market typically miss chances  For example  many investors have overlooked chances to benefit from buying the Conglomerates stocks at the first opportunity  by attempting to buy them during a pullback only to see these stocks accomplish new unsurpassed highs  Honeywell International Inc   NYSE HON   China Merchants Holdings International Co   CMHHY   Barloworld Ltd   BRRAY   Crane Company  CR   Bunzl  LON BNZL  PLC  BZLFY 
Dread and exuberance regularly propel investors into merely  reacting  to market volatility  rather than envisioning market trends 
Accomplished market timing requires three key components  1  A dependable sign of when to get in and out of stocks  2  The capacity to act upon signals quickly and accurately  3  Have the stomach to act on market signals  no matter how counterintuitive the move may be 
The popular image of market timing is that it calls for making drastic  all or nothing moves at the precise  exact market top or bottom  There is a less well known  rather simple market timing approach that has been used successfully by savvy investors like Warren Buffet for decades 
Rule 1  Why trying to time the tops and bottoms of the market is a dead end 
Forget tracking for market tops or bottoms to expand your odds for success with a longer timeline and give yourself the flexibility to eventually profit  regardless of whether your calls are spot on or way off base 
Rule 2  Make an effort not to sell in the midst of little crashes  Muster the courage to trust your gut and buy best in class stocks at a discount 
Warren Buffett has made his fortune based of this straightforward guideline  He benefits by focusing on the long   term and buying high quality stocks at a discount during large market corrections to profit down the road 
There is a noteworthy distinction between a complete market meltdown and a common 10  market correction  No matter what happens in the stock market  chances are that the stocks you own will eventually come back to their pre   crash value  hanging on to your original positions  or opportunistically averaging down  during market downs can be the shrew distraction to take  Warren Buffett takes this idea further by frequently going on purchasing binges when the markets turn  basically purchasing extra shares of his top stock picks at a major markdown and doubling   down on his very own recommendations 
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But consider this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would have to be accurate 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Chasing alpha  outsized  short   term returns through market timing and other high   risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources  however for your long   term retirement assets a  risk adjusted  investment discipline is what largely bodes well

There is a big difference between a stock market crash and small correction  If the companies you own are established and successful  they are likely to return to their pre   crash price before long  making holding on the wisest decision  Warren Buffett takes this idea one step further and often goes on a buying spree when markets turn  essentially buying additional shares of his top stock picks at a big discount and listening to his own advice   Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful

148372,369888,HON,How To Time The Markets Like An Investing Pro   September 11  2019,opinion,"Have you ever dreamed of being that one in a million investor who has the talent to perfectly time the markets 
Indeed  even among those investors who don t try to consistently time the markets  many think they can still call a top and act opportunistically  It s at these times when an investor who speculates often sits on the sidelines and looks for better opportunities to put money into the market 
Giving up too soon at the first sign of inconvenience often leads to missed opportunities among numerous individuals who try to trade on their own retirement  For example  many investors have forfeited immense chances waiting for the Conglomerates stocks to correct  only see the latter achieve new highs  move higher and drive the buyer markets to record levels  Crane Company  CR   Bunzl  LON BNZL  PLC  BZLFY   Barloworld Ltd   BRRAY   China Merchants Holdings International Co   CMHHY   Honeywell International Inc   NYSE HON 
Anxiety and eagerness regularly lead investors into psychological traps because most investors take cues from past market moves and trends instead of attempting to anticipate potential market moves 
Accomplished market timing requires three key components  1  A dependable sign of when to get in and out of stocks  2  The capacity to act upon signals quickly and accurately  3  Have the stomach to act on market signals  no matter how counterintuitive the move may be 
Many investors believe that market timing is a short term investment strategy  There is a less known  more effective  longer term market timing approach that has been used successfully by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Why trying to time the tops and bottoms of the market is a dead end 
Forget tracking for market tops or bottoms to expand your odds for success with a longer timeline and give yourself the flexibility to eventually profit  regardless of whether your calls are spot on or way off base 
Rule 2  Try not to sell amid little crashes   instead exploit the opportunity by buying 
Warren Buffett has made a great part of his fortune due to this simple rule  He cautions not to sell during little crashes  and encourages enduring them by concentrating on the long haul 
There is a key distinction between a small correction and a market crash  The theory is that if you like and bought a stock at a previous valuation prior to the correction  you should love the opportunity to this same at a steep discount since the underlying fundamentals are most likely still intact  Warren Buffett takes this thought a notch higher and frequently goes on a buying binge when markets turn  purchasing additional shares of his favorite stocks at a major markdown and tuning in to his own recommendation of being greedy when others are scared  and being scared when others are greedy 
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But  think about this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Actively trading for alpha  outsized  short   term gains through market timing and other high   risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets  but for your longer   term retirement assets  a risk  adjusted focused investment solution generally makes more sense

148375,369891,HON,Simple Market Timing Strategies That Work   September 30  2019,opinion,"Have you ever dreamed of being that one in a million investor who has the talent to perfectly time the markets 
Indeed  even among the individuals who don t seek to be the ideal market timer  many feel they can call a top and act in accordance  It is these tendencies that make investors sit on the sidelines and hang tight for a better chance to put money into the market 
Missed investing opportunities by exiting at the first sign of trouble is a common pattern among many self directed investors  Case in point  How many investors have missed huge opportunities waiting for the Conglomerates stocks listed below to correct  only to see them reach new highs  climb higher and drive the bull market to record levels  Bunzl  LON BNZL  PLC  BZLFY   Crane Company  CR   Barloworld Ltd   BRRAY   China Merchants Holdings International Co   CMHHY   Honeywell International Inc   NYSE HON 
Dread and exuberance regularly propel investors into merely  reacting  to market volatility  rather than envisioning market trends 
Productive market timing requires three key parts  1  A dependable sign for when to get in and out of stocks  2  The ability to follow up on the sign rapidly and precisely  3  The ability to be completely unemotional and trust in the signal no matter the current market environment 
Many investors think of market timing success as a win or lose proposition  But there is a less notable  rather straightforward  successful market timing approach that has been utilized effectively time after time by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Never try and time tops and bottoms 
Forget tracking for market tops or bottoms to expand your odds for success with a longer timeline and give yourself the flexibility to eventually profit  regardless of whether your calls are spot on or way off base 
Rule 2  Don t sell during minor crashes   instead  have the patience to weather the storm  or even better  milk the opportunity to buy low 
Warren Buffett has made his fortune based off this simple rule  He benefits by focusing on the long   term and buying high quality stocks at a discount during large market corrections to profit down the road 
There is a big difference between a stock market crash and small correction  If the companies you own are established and successful  they are likely to return to their pre   crash price before long  making holding on the wisest decision  Warren Buffett takes this idea further by frequently going on purchasing binges when the markets turn  basically purchasing extra shares of his top stock picks at a major markdown and doubling   down on his very own recommendations 
When It Comes to Trading Your Retirement  A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed
It s only human that many succumb to greed and try and game the system by timing the market  But consider this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would have to be accurate 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Chasing alpha  outsized  short   term returns through market timing and other high   risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources  however for your long   term retirement assets a  risk adjusted  investment discipline is what largely bodes well

The stock of the economic bellwether is headed for its worst monthly performance since 2015 as investors await third quarter results on Tuesday  Investors are looking at industrial earnings with a  glass half empty  mindset  according to Karen Ubelhart of Bloomberg Intelligence 
Among the things emptying that glass are worries that the full impact of U S  China trade frictions has yet to be felt at a time when many industrial customers may be reaching peaks in their growth cycles  Caterpillar  the world s biggest maker of mining and construction equipment  said as recently as last month that the trade spat hadn t yet dented sales 
During this earnings period   there s been a lot of companies that beat and raised and the market just doesn t seem to care right now   Stephen Volkmann  managing director of equity research at Jefferies LLC in New York  said by phone   It s all about whether we re at the peak of the cycle right now

Fear and greed often lead investors into behavioral traps since most investors are followers who react  rather than anticipate market moves 
Successful market timing requires three key ingredients  1  A reliable signal to tell you when to get in and out of stocks  or bonds  gold or other types of investments   2  The ability to interpret the signal correctly  3  The discipline to act on it 
Many investors believe that market timing is a short term investment strategy  There is a less known  more effective  longer term market timing approach that has been used successfully by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Never attempt and time tops and bottoms 
Abandoning the goal to time the tops and bottoms precisely gives you the flexibility to profit  thereby increasing your chances to lock in built up profits even if your calls aren t exactly right 
Rule 2  Don t sell during small crashes   ride the storm out  or better yet  take advantage of the opportunity 
Warren Buffett has made his fortune based of this straightforward guideline  He benefits by focusing on the long   term and buying high quality stocks at a discount during large market corrections to profit down the road 
There is a big difference between a stock market crash and small correction  If the companies you own are established and successful  they are likely to return to their pre   crash price before long  making holding on the wisest decision  Warren Buffett takes this idea one step further and often goes on a buying spree when markets turn  essentially buying additional shares of his top stock picks at a big discount and listening to his own advice   Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful  
When It Comes to Trading Your Retirement  A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But  think about this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Chasing alpha  outsized  short   term returns through market timing and other high   risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources  however for your long   term retirement assets a  risk adjusted  investment discipline is what largely bodes well

broadened its business profile and provide benefits of diversification  Its solid balance sheet and consistent cash flow generation has enabled investment in business which will drive long term growth

148429,369945,HON,Is Honeywell The Best Industrial Stock To Survive The Global Economic Recession ,opinion,"The outlook for industrials is becoming gloomier by the day  Signs of slackening industrial activity all round is mounting and this definitely doesn t seem to be right time to be investing in industrial stocks  Companies whose fate is closely tied with the health of the economy generally underperform when risks to growth accelerate  But Honeywell International may be one of the few exceptions to that rule 
Evidence of subsiding industrial activity is becoming more apparent across the board  New U S  factory orders stagnated in June  while the JPMorgan Global Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index posted its second straight contraction  the first time that s happened since 2012  according to Bloomberg data  The U S  China trade war is nowhere near resolution 





But one stock we believe is well positioned to withstand the possible storm is Honeywell International Inc   NYSE NYSE HON   The company s latest earnings report has shown that the company has the right product mix to guarantee growth in a downturn 
In the most recent quarter  its earnings per share grew 9   while organic sales in its largest division  aerospace  rose 11   With these strong numbers  Honeywell also raised its full year forecast and reported increased demand in most divisions 
In contrast  3M  NYSE MMM  Co   one of the largest industrial companies that makes Post its to air filters and touch screens  reported both sales and profit fell  citing challenges ranging from high raw materials prices to unfavorable foreign exchange rates to headwinds in China 
The Strength of Honeywell s Portfolio
Honeywell s diversified portfolio provides a lifeline to many industries  including homes and building  aviation  defense and space  The company s enduring competitive advantage is so large that it s hard to challenge its dominance on a global scale 
For the current fiscal year  Honeywell expects to record its highest profit margin in more than two decades  helped by robust demand in aviation parts and a booming market for warehouse automation equipment 
Darius Adamczyk  who is in his second year as the CEO  is trying to transform the 134 year industrial giant into an enterprise with a start up culture  He has introduced more software based products since he took control  to help clients better manage their supply chain 
He believes that the company has a solid long cycle portfolio of products  such as jet engines  to fuel growth even if the global economy gets hurt or a trade war with China further escalates 
 We ve seen some slowing in certain short cycle businesses that has been overcome by the strong performance in the rest of the portfolio   he told analysts on a conference call last month as cited by the Wall Street Journal 
Together with this strong financial outlook  Honeywell also has an impressive track record when it comes to paying dividends  With a dividend yield of under 2   its  0 82 a share quarterly dividend has grown over 11  per year during the last five years  Honeywell has paid uninterrupted dividends for more than two decades  while maintaining a low payout ratio  currently at 49  
Bottom Line
Honeywell s shares  which closed yesterday at  169 59  are up nearly 30  this year and have doubled in the past five years  Some investors would see buying this name as a risky bet  especially with the economy in this late boom cycle  But we still see value in this trade and advise investors to take a long term position  It s hard to find an industrial stock which is as well prepared as HON is to perform in the fast changing economy ",2019-08-02,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-honeywell-the-best-industrial-stock-to-survive-the-global-economic-recession-200449736,200449736
148430,369946,HON,When Does Market Timing Actually Work    August 06  2019,opinion,"Is the ability to time the markets more of a data driven science or a  gut   feeling  art 
Indeed  even among the individuals who don t seek to be the ideal market timer  many feel they can call a top and act in accordance  It is these tendencies that make investors sit on the sidelines and hang tight for a better chance to put money into the market 
Lost chances by those who attempt to time the market is a common mistake among those who trade their own accounts  How many traders have lost investing opportunities by choosing to wait for the Conglomerates stocks to correct or reach attractive entry levels  Only for them to continue to move higher and achieve new all time highs  Ck Hutchison Holdings Ltd  CKHUY   Bunzl  LON BNZL  PLC  BZLFY   Barloworld Ltd   BRRAY   China Merchants Holdings International Co   CMHHY   Honeywell International Inc   NYSE HON 
Investment emotional triggers  fear and greed  can lead to costly mental mistakes by investors who typically fall into the trap of being a market follower instead of a market leader 
Successful market timing requires three key ingredients  1  A reliable signal to tell you when to get in and out of stocks  or bonds  gold or other types of investments   2  The ability to interpret the signal correctly  3  The discipline to act on it 
Many investors believe that market timing is a short term investment strategy  There is a less known  more effective  longer term market timing approach that has been used successfully by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Attempting to time tops and bottoms is lose lose situation 
Abandoning the goal to time the tops and bottoms precisely gives you the flexibility to profit  thereby increasing your chances to lock in built up profits even if your calls aren t exactly right 
Rule 2  Don t sell during small crashes   ride the storm out  or better yet  take advantage of the opportunity 
Warren Buffett has made an incredible piece of his fortune because of this basic standard  He cautions not to sell amid little crashes and to instead endure the temporary hardship and profit by concentrating on the long haul 
There is a key distinction between a small correction and a market crash  No matter what happens in the stock market  chances are that the stocks you own will eventually come back to their pre   crash value  hanging on to your original positions  or opportunistically averaging down  during market downs can be the shrew distraction to take  Warren Buffett takes this thought one step further by often buying outsized positions in value stocks he likes across the board when markets turn  essentially leveraging his bottoms up analysis and stock picking acumen 
When It Comes to Trading Your Retirement  A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed
It s only human that many succumb to greed and try and game the system by timing the market  But consider this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would have to be accurate 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement

148454,369970,HON,Earnings Preview  Honeywell  HON  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Honeywell  HON  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 18  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This industrial conglomerate is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 08 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 9  
Revenues are expected to be  9 36 billion  down 14 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Honeywell 
For Honeywell  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Honeywell will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Honeywell would post earnings of  1 83 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 92  delivering a surprise of  4 92  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Honeywell doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-honeywell-hon-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200438965,200438965
148455,369971,HON,Siemens thinks big with small batch production,news,"By John Revill KARLSRUHE  Germany  Reuters    German engineering group  Siemens   DE SIEGn  is redoubling its efforts in an area where it has traditionally lagged  managing the processing of materials into medicines  chemicals or foodstuffs  Siemens excels at helping makers of cars  planes and trains make their production and assembly smarter by using its software to create distinct items and components   so called discrete manufacturing  But when it comes to process industries such as petrochemicals  Siemens has been at a disadvantage to rivals such as industrial machinery and controller makers Honeywell  N HON  or ABB  N ABB   which have longer standing relationships with major oil and gas players  Now Siemens is investing in the technology used to control mixing  heating  and pressurising ingredients in the process industry   enabling the small batch and hybrid production of products like drugs  where personalized and niche products are becoming more common   We have been developing very well  and have been gaining market share   Eckard Eberle  Siemens s head of process automation  told Reuters  Under a new strategy likely to be announced on Thursday along with quarterly results  analysts expect Siemens to announce it is incorporating process automation within its broader factory automation business  which aims to digitize and streamline production for clients to improve efficiency   The market in process automation is growing at around 3 to 4 percent per year and our intention is to grow faster than that   Eberle said in an interview at the division s offices in Karlsruhe  Germany   We are doing that already   Siemens  one of Germany s most famous industrial names  was founded in 1847  and is active in electrification  automation  industrial software and the manufacture of products from trains to turbines  The Munich based company  employs 377 000 people worldwide and generated revenue of 83 billion euros in 2017   Unlike the Digital Factory division  which houses Siemens  discrete manufacturing software and has been the star performer  Process Industries and Drives  PID  has been one of the weakest performing divisions  PID  which represents about 10 percent of group sales  saw its revenue fall 1 percent last year  while orders grew by only 2 percent  It also had the second lowest operating profit margin  at 5 percent  less than half the overall 11 2 percent  But analysts reckon Siemens has a decent chance of success at galvanizing its process automation business   With large scale process automation  such as downstream oil and gas  there are not many greenfield opportunities and the incumbents sitting on a large installed base have a clear advantage   said James Stettler of  Barclays   LON BARC    With more smaller batch manufacturing and hybrid projects there s more contracts around to go for   At present Siemens has a 15 percent share in the  14 billion global market for distributed control systems   the computer  brains  which oversee production   lagging market leaders ABB and Honeywell  according to ARC  an industrial analyst company  HOLY GRAIL One such opportunity that Siemens has grasped is at German biotech company BioNTech  which enlisted Siemens to help develop personalized anti cancer treatments made with just a few drops of medicine rather than mass producing thousands of liters  The Mainz based company  which is working with Roche s  S ROG  Genentech arm  uses Siemens software to produce trial batches of drugs which identify and attack cancerous cells   Each person s cancer is 95 percent different  so the ultimate target is to produce medicines for the individual in only small quantities which enable the immune system to identify their specific cancer and attack it   said Sierk Poetting  BioNTech s chief operating officer   It is not something you can produce in large quantities and put on the shelves to treat lots of people   BioNTech s project would not have been possible without a digital set up   In the past  an individual dose would have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars  but we are looking to reduce this to a tenth or a 15th of the cost   Poetting said   This kind of small batch production will require more automation and digitization of processes   Being able to produce in a batch size of one product is the Holy Grail for industrial firms   said David Humphrey  an analyst at ARC  Simon Toennessen  an analyst at Berenberg  said Siemens was doing well in acquiring new business in process automation

148459,369975,HON,Honeywell  HON  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Honeywell International  HON   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 3 6  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  176 43 in the previous session  Honeywell International has gained 33  since the start of the year compared to the 22 9  move for the Zacks Conglomerates sector and the 22 9  return for the Zacks Diversified Operations industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on April 18  2019  Honeywell reported EPS of  1 92 versus consensus estimate of  1 83 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 3 06  
For the current fiscal year  Honeywell is expected to post earnings of  8 1 per share on  37 17 billion in revenues  This represents a 1 12  change in EPS on a  11 08  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  8 83 per share on  38 96 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 9  and 4 82   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Honeywell may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Honeywell has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are C and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 21 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 17 9X versus its peer group s average of 11 3X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 34  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Honeywell currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Honeywell passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Honeywell shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come ",2019-06-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/honeywell-hon-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200432967,200432967

148469,369985,HON,Here s Why Honeywell  HON  Is A Great Momentum Stock To Buy,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Honeywell  HON   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Honeywell currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if HON is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this industrial conglomerate holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For HON  shares are up 0 32  over the past week while the Zacks Diversified Operations industry is down 0 12  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 5 92  compares favorably with the industry s 2 97  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of Honeywell have increased 11 2  over the past quarter  and have gained 22 45  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 5 48  and 8 71   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to HON s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  HON is currently averaging 2 231 568 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with HON 
Over the past two months  4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost HON s consensus estimate  increasing from  8 07 to  8 10 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that HON is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Honeywell on your short list ",2019-06-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-honeywell-hon-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-200433623,200433623

148515,370031,HON,Honeywell  HON  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Honeywell  HON   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Honeywell currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if HON is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this industrial conglomerate holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For HON  shares are up 1 89  over the past week while the Zacks Diversified Operations industry is down 0 05  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 7 74  compares favorably with the industry s 1 56  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of Honeywell have increased 17 14  over the past quarter  and have gained 21 05  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 9 36  and 14 14   respectively 
Investors should also take note of HON s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  HON is averaging 2 953 163 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with HON 
Over the past two months  8 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost HON s consensus estimate  increasing from  7 93 to  8 10 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that HON is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Honeywell on your short list ",2019-05-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/honeywell-hon-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200417402,200417402

148581,370097,HON,Honeywell  Omnitracs launch U S  trucker work compliance software,news,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT  Reuters    Industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc  NYSE HON  and U S  truck fleet services company Omnitracs said on Tuesday they are rolling out software for large less than truckload  LTL  firms to comply with a looming federal regulation for drivers to log hours electronically and manage trucker workflow 
The new system  available on a handheld Honeywell device around the size of a smartphone that uses Android based software  is being deployed by the Holland and Reddaway units of YRC Worldwide Inc  the second largest U S  LTL firm 
It is also aimed at other large operators  Taylor Smith  president of Honeywell s Workflow Solutions business  said 
LTL firms consolidate smaller loads into a single truck  requiring more complexity than regular long haul  truckload  services 
The software product comes ahead of a December mandate that trucking firms switch to electronic logs from paper logs to meet federal hours of service rules 
The mandate is widely seen as the biggest change to hit the trucking sector since deregulation in 1980  Industry experts believe many  mom and pop  trucking outfits are reliant on paper logs to fudge the books  inflating driver productivity in a low margin industry 
Because of its complexity  the Honeywell Omnitracs software is designed for larger firms that generally already have electronic logging systems in place  But Honeywell s Smith said many of those larger firms are legacy platforms developed in house that need to be upgraded 
The new system combines Omnitracs telematics data that automatically logs hours with Honeywell s pickup and delivery software on a single device instead of multiple applications 
 The older legacy platforms really tethered drivers to their trucks so they and their company could miss out on money   Smith said   Now they can accept loads away from their truck  which frees up drivers to be a lot more responsive  
Earlier this month  Dallas based Omnitracs announced it was rolling out a tablet software package with Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  Co Ltd to help smaller truck carriers comply with the electronic log mandate 
In February  Omnitracs teamed up with startup Peloton to bring to market technology that allows large trucks to save fuel by coordinating speed and braking so that the vehicles can drive closely together on the highway

148609,370125,HON,Honeywell  HON  Moves To Buy  Rationale Behind The Upgrade,opinion,"Honeywell  HON  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Honeywell is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Honeywell imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Honeywell
This industrial conglomerate is expected to earn  7 97 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of  0 5  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Honeywell  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 7  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Honeywell to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-04-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/honeywell-hon-moves-to-buy-rationale-behind-the-upgrade-200408751,200408751
148610,370126,HON,Honeywell  HON  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Honeywell International  HON   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 6 7  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  169 86 in the previous session  Honeywell International has gained 28  since the start of the year compared to the 25 1  move for the Zacks Conglomerates sector and the 25 1  return for the Zacks Diversified Operations industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on April 18  2019  Honeywell reported EPS of  1 92 versus consensus estimate of  1 83 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 3 06  
For the current fiscal year  Honeywell is expected to post earnings of  7 97 per share on  36 66 billion in revenues  This represents a  0 5  change in EPS on a  12 31  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  8 7 per share on  38 5 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 9 17  and 5 04   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Honeywell may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Honeywell has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 21 2X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 17 2X versus its peer group s average of 9 6X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 37  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Honeywell currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Honeywell passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Honeywell shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term ",2019-04-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/honeywell-hon-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200408742,200408742
148611,370127,HON,Is Honeywell International  HON  Outperforming Other Conglomerates Stocks This Year ,opinion,"The Conglomerates group has plenty of great stocks  but investors should always be looking for companies that are outperforming their peers  Has Honeywell International  HON  been one of those stocks this year  Let s take a closer look at the stock s year to date performance to find out 
Honeywell International is a member of the Conglomerates sector  This group includes 22 individual stocks and currently holds a Zacks Sector Rank of  2  The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different groups  measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the sector to gauge the strength of each group 
The Zacks Rank is a proven system that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions  highlighting a variety of stocks that are displaying the right characteristics to beat the market over the next one to three months  HON is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  
Over the past 90 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for HON s full year earnings has moved 0 68  higher  This is a sign of improving analyst sentiment and a positive earnings outlook trend 
According to our latest data  HON has moved about 27 96  on a year to date basis  Meanwhile  stocks in the Conglomerates group have gained about 25 13  on average  This means that Honeywell International is outperforming the sector as a whole this year 
Looking more specifically  HON belongs to the Diversified Operations industry  which includes 22 individual stocks and currently sits at  60 in the Zacks Industry Rank  This group has gained an average of 25 13  so far this year  so HON is performing better in this area 
Investors with an interest in Conglomerates stocks should continue to track HON  The stock will be looking to continue its solid performance ",2019-04-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-honeywell-international-hon-outperforming-other-conglomerates-stocks-this-year-200408719,200408719
148612,370128,HON,Honeywell  HON  Is Up 0 48  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Honeywell  HON   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Honeywell currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if HON is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this industrial conglomerate holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For HON  shares are up 0 48  over the past week while the Zacks Diversified Operations industry is up 0 26  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 6 7  compares favorably with the industry s 0 84  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of Honeywell have increased 19 75  over the past quarter  and have gained 14 13  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 9 35  and 9 4   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to HON s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  HON is currently averaging 2 641 626 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with HON 
Over the past two months  3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost HON s consensus estimate  increasing from  7 93 to  7 97 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that HON is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Honeywell on your short list ",2019-04-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/honeywell-hon-is-up-048-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200408816,200408816

148649,370165,HON,Why Honeywell  HON  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Honeywell  HON   which belongs to the Zacks Diversified Operations industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This industrial conglomerate has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 1 80  
For the last reported quarter  Honeywell came out with earnings of  1 91 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 88 per share  representing a surprise of 1 60   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 99 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 03 per share  delivering a surprise of 2 01  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Honeywell  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Honeywell has an Earnings ESP of  0 88  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on April 18  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-honeywell-hon-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200403178,200403178
148650,370166,HON,Honeywell  HON  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q1 Release,opinion,"Honeywell  HON  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 18  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This industrial conglomerate is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 83 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 2  
Revenues are expected to be  8 62 billion  down 17 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 43  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Honeywell 
For Honeywell  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 88  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Honeywell will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Honeywell would post earnings of  1 88 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 91  delivering a surprise of  1 60  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

148668,370184,HON,Puerto Rico s fragile economy dealt new blow by Maria,news,"By Dave Graham  Robin Respaut and Hilary Russ PUERTO RICO NEW YORK  Reuters    Chan Lo is racing against the clock to save thousands of dollars of supplies at his sushi restaurant in San Juan s Condado beachfront community   He has roughly  16 000 worth of perishable goods stored in his restaurant Nagoya Sushi   Tiki Bar   in jeopardy as the battered island waits for power and water to be re established   I give it about three or four days maximum if the  power  doesn t come back on and there are no generators available   he said   Everything will have to be thrown out   Puerto Rico s economy was already fragile before Hurricane Maria barreled into the island  but the strongest storm to hit the U S  territory of Puerto Rico in nearly 90 years could inflict heavy damage on the island s health   Small businesses like Lo s will be a significant part of the recovery  as they account for 80 percent of all private sector workers  according to a New York Federal Reserve report  And getting energy to them  and to manufacturers and hotels and other engines of the economy will be crucial for the island s ability to bounce back   After Maria made landfall midweek on the island of 3 4 million people as a major Category 4 hurricane  the storm s wind and water downed nearly all power and communications  Governor Ricardo Rossello said the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority s grid was so severely hit by the storm that it could be months before electricity is restored to all customers  Making matters worse  PREPA has been in bankruptcy since July  Disaster modeler Enki Research estimates damage to the island at  30 billion  with  20 billion in direct physical damage and  10 billion in economic impact    Puerto Rico is in a precarious state   said Chuck Watson  a disaster modeler at Enki    A MEASURABLE IMPACT  Puerto Rico has none of the economic might of other places hit hard in this active hurricane season  like the states of Texas and Florida  The island has spent most of the last ten years in recession  Its GDP shrank by more than one percent for seven of the last 10 years through 2016  the poverty rate is over 40 percent and unemployment stands at 10 percent  The chaos unleashed by the breakdown in basic services  a lack of cash and gas shortages has put many businesses into limbo  and the short term effects are likely to be severe  Some Puerto Ricans are  however  already looking ahead to the economic boost that could be delivered by investment in the recovery  The timeliness of U S  Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  funds will play into how quickly Puerto Rico gets back on its feet  said S P Global Ratings analyst David Hitchcock  Meanwhile  the hurricane has pushed back the island s bankruptcy process  Struggling under  72 billion in debt  Puerto Rico filed the biggest government bankruptcy in U S  history earlier this year but that is now on the backburner  sources said on Thursday   This is an island that has been riddled with bad news   said Jonathan Mondillo  Alpine Woods Capital Investors LLC  which holds insured Puerto Rican bonds   It s going to have a measurable impact on their economy locally    MANUFACTURING HEART  In the aftermath of the storm  businesses both big and small around the island were assessing the damage and putting contingency plans in place  Puerto Rico boasts investments from a number of U S  multinationals  such as Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  and Eli Lilly  A spokesman for Honeywell International Inc  NYSE HON   said the company s  folks on the ground are making sure everyone s accounted for and what their needs are     we re still assessing the facilities   Manufacturing is still the heart of Puerto Rico s economy and any blow to industry could have a significant impact  It makes up nearly 49 percent of the island s GDP  according to a 2015 report from the Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association   But the manufacturing sector is much diminished after the U S  Congress decided to gradually phase out a 1976 tax credit program  That program ended in 2006  after which many companies left and the island had lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs by 2014   HIT TO GROWING TOURISM  Just as concerning to the island is likely to be the impact Hurricane Maria has caused to tourism   which will be especially hard felt since it was one area of the economy that had been growing   Travel and tourism had grown from 7 3 percent of GDP in 2014 to an estimated 8 4 percent in 2017 and was projected to rise to 10 7 percent by 2027  including direct and indirect spending  according to the World Travel   Tourism Council  Hotels and resorts were struggling to stay open in the days after the hit  Reynaldo Rey  general manager of the AC Hotel San Juan  said businesses were facing a race against the clock if emergency power supplies and water ran out because generators would only keep hotels operating for a few days   Everything depends on when the supply lines are re established   Rey said   We risk a complete shutdown   Raul Brito  24  a security guard for the state tourism agency in the capital s upscale Condado neighborhood  said business was now in limbo at the worst time possible

148681,370197,HON,Honeywell s Technology Chosen By Phu My Plastics Production,opinion,"Honeywell International Inc    NYSE HON   recently announced that its business unit  Honeywell UOP  has been selected by Phu My Plastics Production JSC to provide its state of the art UOP technology in Vietnam  Notably  Phu My Plastics Production will be using Honeywell UOP s C3 Oleflex technology for the production of polymer grade propylene at its facility  This will enable the plant to cater to the increasing requirement of plastics in Vietnam as well as other countries in Southeast Asia 
Honeywell UOP is a division of Honeywell s Performance Materials and Technologies strategic business group  which also comprises Honeywell Process Solutions  Per the deal  Honeywell UOP will be responsible for providing technology licenses for the Oleflex process  In sync with the deal  the company will also provide proprietary and non proprietary equipment  process design package  proprietary catalysts  adsorbents as well as on site operator training  among others

Our Take
Honeywell believes that strength in licensing and engineering sales is likely to keep driving revenues of its Performance Materials and Technology business  Also  solid demand for its commercial fire and productivity products will boost the company s Safety and Productivity Solutions  revenues in the quarters ahead  It currently anticipates generating organic sales growth in the range of 2 5  in 2019 
Over the past year  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s shares have gained 2 1  against 6 7  decline recorded by the  

 
Moreover  the company is progressing well with its portfolio transformation strategy  having declared spin off dividends of shares of Resideo  and completing the divestment of Garrett Motion Inc  In addition  Honeywell completed the acquisition of the German company Transnorm  November 2018   As a matter of fact  these initiatives are likely to help it concentrate on high growth industrial businesses and thus boost sales growth 
However  Honeywell is currently dealing with rising costs of sales  Notably  in 2018  the company s cost of sales increased 5 3  year over year  Gross margin for the year was down 140 basis points  Also  high research and development costs could also be a drag on the Aerospace segment s profitability

148748,370264,HON,Honeywell  HON  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Honeywell  HON  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 1  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This industrial conglomerate is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 89 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 2  
Revenues are expected to be  9 69 billion  down 10 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 44  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Honeywell 
For Honeywell  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Honeywell will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Honeywell would post earnings of  1 99 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 03  delivering a surprise of  2 01  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Honeywell doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/honeywell-hon-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200379541,200379541

Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for HON  These revisions help to show the ever changing nature of near term business trends  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook 
Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near term stock prices  We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon  Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear  actionable rating model 
The Zacks Rank system  which ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0 05  higher within the past month  HON is currently a Zacks Rank  4  Sell

148780,370296,HON,Can Honeywell  HON  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Honeywell  HON   which belongs to the Zacks Diversified Operations industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this industrial conglomerate has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 3 74   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Honeywell came out with earnings of  2 03 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 99 per share  representing a surprise of 2 01   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  2 01 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 12 per share  delivering a surprise of 5 47  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Honeywell lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Honeywell currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 03   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 31  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-12-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-honeywell-hon-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200372131,200372131

As a result  estimates for the December quarter as well as full year 2019 have been coming down for operators like Caterpillar  CAT   Honeywell  HON   3M  MMM  and others  This is showing up in the aggregate revisions trend for the index as well  as the chart below shows  
The magnitude of negative revisions that we have seen for 2018 Q4 is not unusual in a historical sense  though it is high and more widespread relative to what we have been seeing over the preceding three quarters  
The bigger issue will be how estimates for the coming quarters hold up going forward  particularly given the emerging late cycle narrative of slowing economic growth or even a recession on the horizon  The growth pace was expected to decelerate in 2019 already as the direct benefits of the tax law changes faded  as the chart below of quarterly earnings and revenue growth show  
But even these low growth expectations for the coming quarters are vulnerable to further downward revisions  In other words  it is reasonable for market participants to nurse some doubts about the current earnings backdrop

148812,370328,HON,Zacks Earnings Trends Highlights  Caterpillar  Honeywell And 3M,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 13  2018   Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says   Total Q4 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  12 3  from the same period last year on  5 6  higher revenues  with the growth pace meaningfully decelerating from the rate we saw in the first three quarters of the year  Handicapping Q4 Earnings SeasonNote  The following is an excerpt from this week s  report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods  Here are the key points The Q4 earnings season has gotten underway already  but it will really get going with the January 11th releases from the big banks Total Q4 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  12 3  from the same period last year on  5 6  higher revenues  with the growth pace meaningfully decelerating from the rate we saw in the first three quarters of the year Q4 estimates have been coming down since the quarter got underway  with the current  12 3  earnings growth expected for the period down from  15 9  at the start of the quarter The negative revisions trend is widespread  with estimates for 15 of the 16 Zacks sectors coming down since the quarter got underway  Estimates have come down the most for the Conglomerates  Construction  Energy and Consumer Discretionary sectors The Transportation sector is the only one experiencing positive estimate revisions  a reflection of weakening oil prices The strongest year over year earnings growth in Q4 is expected to come from the Energy  Transportation  Construction  and Retail sectors  Excluding the Finance sector s strong growth  Q4 earnings growth for the rest of the index comes down to  10   from  12 3   For the small cap S P 600 index  total Q4 earnings are expected to be up  7 2  on  6 3 higher revenues  This would follow  33 6  earnings growth on  5 7  revenue growth in Q3 For full year 2018  total earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  20 8  on  6 8  higher revenues  For full year 2019  total earnings are expected to be up  7 9  on  5 2  higher revenues The implied  EPS  for the index  calculated using current 2018 P E of 16 7X and index close  as of December 11th  is  158 02  Using the same methodology  the index  EPS  works out to  170 51 for 2019  P E of 15 5X  and  187 53 for 2020  P E of 14 1X   The multiples for 2018  2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index s total market cap and aggregate bottom up earnings for each year  A number of major companies provided weak guidance at the time of the Q3 earnings season  blaming factors like the impact of the strong U S  dollar  cost inflation  particularly on the freight front  and trade tariffs  Questions about the international economic growth backdrop has emerged as an additional headwind to corporate earnings As a result  estimates for the December quarter as well as full year have been coming down for operators like Caterpillar   NYSE CAT    Honeywell   NYSE HON    3M   NYSE MMM   and others  This is showing up in the aggregate revisions trend for the index as well The magnitude of negative revisions that we have seen for 2018 Q4 is not unusual in a historical sense  though it is high and more widespread relative to what we have been seeing over the preceding three quarters The bigger issue will be how estimates for the coming quarters hold up going forward  particularly given the emerging late cycle narrative of slowing economic growth or even a recession on the horizon  The growth pace was expected to decelerate in 2019 already as the direct benefits of the tax law changes faded But even these low growth expectations for the coming quarters are vulnerable to further downward revisions  In other words  it is reasonable for market participants to nurse some doubts about the current earnings backdrop

148845,370361,HON,CR Vs  HON  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Diversified Operations sector might want to consider either Crane  CR  or Honeywell  HON   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Both Crane and Honeywell have a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
CR currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 38  while HON has a forward P E of 17 95  We also note that CR has a PEG ratio of 1 39  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  HON currently has a PEG ratio of 1 93 
Another notable valuation metric for CR is its P B ratio of 3 33  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  HON has a P B of 6 05 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to CR s Value grade of B and HON s Value grade of C 
Both CR and HON are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that CR is the superior value option right now ",2018-06-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cr-vs-hon-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200327542,200327542
148846,370362,HON,Delta  Understanding The Odds,opinion,"Delta is one of those option greeks that is not entirely understood  We can stand by the definition of course  which is the amount an option will move with a one dollar move in the stock  There are time decay considerations of course  this is just an approximation but really tells us about the tremendous leverage options have over stocks 
For example  the Honeywell  NYSE HON  September  at the money  strike of 157 5 closed on August 24th at 2 56  midpoint of the range   The stock is trading at 157 51  The current delta is  51  So  theoretically if the stock moves up 1 dollar in price this option will jump up 51 cents  or to 3 07  That is an astonishing 20  move in price  from 2 56 to 3 07  vs the stock price gain of less than 1  
There are other considerations of course affecting the option price such has theta and gamma  which tug at the option price as the stock price stalls or moves slowly  which is natural  For all intents and purposes the delta is a good approximation of the potential reward related to a stock move 
That is some great leverage  But I look at delta as a probability tool  What are the odds the stock will finish at a strike by expiration  I like to know if a play is low or high probability and if I m going to be paid based on the risk I m willing to take  If I m comfortable taking a low probability play  then that is my reference point 
Some option players like low probability  high risk trades  Delta helps you determine these probabilities 
It s very simple to assess the odds  Taking the above example  I would view Honeywell as having a 51  chance to stay in the money  It is currently right there  so why wouldn t it be 100   We have to factor in the time consideration and the potential for the stock to move lower  If Honeywell had zero implied volatility  expectation of no volatility  the delta would be 1  but that is not the case of course 
I would look at the implied odds of 50  and the price of the option and assess my risk  Is it fair  Is it in my wheelhouse for risk taking  Without considering the chart technicals yet  I can determine my risk based on the delta of the option  This is a good start for option players ",2018-08-27,Bob Lang,https://www.investing.com/analysis/delta--understanding-the-odds-200340718,200340718

Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for HON  These revisions typically reflect the latest short term business trends  which can change frequently  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability

Meanwhile  HON s PEG ratio is currently 1 85  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  The Diversified Operations industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1 85 as of yesterday s close

148989,370505,HON,UTX Or HON  Which Conglomerate To Bet On Post Q4 Earnings ,opinion,The earnings season is well past the halfway mark with about 294 S P 500 companies having reported results till Feb 7  2018  Various analysis and comparisons are being done by industry peers to gauge the underlying metrics and relative performance  Let us perform a similar analysis of two leading players in the Conglomerates sector to pick the best investment option based on the fourth quarter earnings scorecard Fourth Quarter EarningsUnited Technologies Corporation   NYSE UTX   reported healthy results driven by significant organic growth and diligent execution of operational plans  GAAP earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were  397 million or 50 cents per share compared with  1 013 million or  1 25 per share in the year earlier quarter  Excluding restructuring and other non recurring items  adjusted earnings for the reported quarter were  1 60 per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 56 Net sales came in at  15 680 million compared with  14 659 million in the year ago quarter  Quarterly sales exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  15 400 million  The top line increase was primarily attributable to organic growth of 5    the highest since 2014  Growth in revenues across all segments of the company helped drive total revenues  An increase in demand for the company s products by the commercial aviation industry and an increase in spending by the U S  defense industry have helped augment revenues for the company  The strong aftermarket business  which sells spare parts and offers related services to keep the primary products running  has also benefited results  United Technologies carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Honeywell International Inc    NYSE HON   reported solid results with healthy year over year increase in revenues and adjusted earnings  GAAP loss for the quarter was  2 411 million or loss of  3 18 a share as against net income of  1 034 million or  1 34 per share in the year ago quarter  The significant decline in GAAP earnings was primarily attributable to a provisional charge of  3 8 billion to reflect the estimated impacts of the U S  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017  Excluding non recurring items  adjusted earnings for the quarter were  1 85 per share compared with  1 74 in the year earlier quarter  Adjusted earnings for the reported quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny Fourth quarter revenues jumped 8 6  year over year to  10 843 million and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  10 689 million  The top line improvement was largely due to organic growth of 6   driven by strength in Aerospace aftermarket  UOP  Advanced Materials and Intelligrated GuidanceUnited Technologies is poised to grow on the back of continued investments  strategic cost reduction efforts and a favorable global macroeconomic environment  Backed by these positives  the company has given bullish full year 2018 earnings guidance  Adjusted earnings are anticipated to lie within the  6 85  7 10 per share range  Additionally  the company has given revenue guidance for 2018 between  62 5 billion and  64 billion  estimating organic growth of 4 6  year over year  Concurrent with the earnings release  Honeywell revised full year 2018 earnings guidance to better reflect the favorable impact from the tax reform  The company currently anticipates earnings within the range of  7 75  8 00 per share for 2018  up from earlier expectations of  7 55  7 80  representing year over year growth of 9 13   up from 6 10  expected earlier  However  revenue guidance is affirmed at  41 8  42 5 billion Price PerformanceFrom earnings release to date  United Technologies has outperformed the industry with an average loss of 2 8  compared with 5 6  decline for the latter  Honeywell  on the other hand  has underperformed the industry with an average loss of 8 4  compared with 7 2  decline for the latter Estimate RevisionsLast month  United Technologies  current quarter estimates increased to  1 50 per share from  1 47 while that for the current year increased from  6 86 to  7 01 Honeywell s current quarter estimates improved to  1 88 during the last month from  1 81  while current year estimates increased to  7 95 per share from  7 75 To Sum UpBased on the current scenario  although there is not much to choose from as the stocks seem to match on most counts  United Technologies seems to have trumped Honeywell only on the basis of price performance and stands out as a better investment proposition Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and

149030,370546,HON,Business jet sales to keep rising but some purchases delayed,news,"NEW YORK  Reuters    Business jet buyers are expected to take delivery of as many as 675 new aircraft worth about  20 5 billion this year  a slight rise over deliveries worth  20 billion 2013  according to a forecast by Honeywell International Inc  N HON  
The outlook for the next decade shows demand for 9 450 jets worth about  280 billion  That s up from 9 250 jets worth  250 billion in last years  long range forecast  Honeywell said 
But the global survey of 1 500 corporate flight departments  released on the eve of the National Business Aviation Association conference  found that companies had reduced their five year plans to replace or add to their fleets  with the biggest demand change coming from the Asia Pacific region 
Corporate fleet managers  including governments and charter companies  plan to make new jet purchases over the next five years equal to  on average  about 23 percent of their fleets  down from about 28 percent in the 2013 survey  Honeywell said 
Buyers in the Asia Pacific region showed the biggest drop in buying plans  down about 12 percentage points  while buying expectations in the Middle East and Africa  Latin America  and North America fell by 8  11  and 6 percentage points  respectively  the survey found 
Plans by buyers in Europe  however  jumped 6 percentage points  despite the inclusion of Russia  where purchase plans fell due to economic uncertainty and sanctions 
 Even with a lower purchase expectation from Russia  Europe was still up  which I think is a good sign for the Western European economies   said Brian Sill  president of business and general aviation at Honeywell Aerospace 
Buyers remain most interested in large cabin business jets  but interest in mid cabin and small cabin jets improved in the latest survey   That s good news because they had been languishing for the last few years   Sill said 
The launch last week of two new large cabin aircraft by Gulfstream Aerospace Corp  a unit of General Dynamics Corp  N GD   is among the factors expected to fuel purchases over the longer term  Fractional ownership companies also are starting to renew their fleets  Sill said  Fractional operator Flexjet was one of the two launch customers of the new Gulfstream G500 and G600 models 
In terms of market share  demand from North America slipped 2 percentage points to 59 percent  The share of so called BRIC countries  Brazil  Russia  India and China  fell to 29 percent in the latest survey from 42 percent last year 

 Brazil had very strong purchase expectations  despite the economy being in a bit of a slowdown   Sill said

149031,370547,HON,Exclusive  U S  CEOs threaten to pull tacit Obamacare support over  wellness  spat,news,"By Sharon Begley  NEW YORK  Reuters    Leading U S  CEOs  angered by the Obama administration s challenge to certain  workplace wellness  programs  are threatening to side with anti Obamacare forces unless the government backs off  according to people familiar with the matter    Major U S  corporations have broadly supported President Barack Obama s healthcare reform despite concerns over several of its elements  largely because it included provisions encouraging the wellness programs   The programs aim to control healthcare costs by reducing smoking  obesity  hypertension and other risk factors that can lead to expensive illnesses  A bipartisan provision in the 2010 healthcare reform law allows employers to reward workers who participate and penalize those who don t   But recent lawsuits filed by the administration s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  EEOC   challenging the programs at Honeywell International and two smaller companies  have thrown the future of that part of Obamacare into doubt   The lawsuits infuriated some large employers so much that they are considering aligning themselves with Obama s opponents  according to people familiar with the executives  thinking    The fact that the EEOC sued is shocking to our members   said Maria Ghazal  vice president and counsel at the Business Roundtable  a group of chief executives of more than 200 large U S  corporations   They don t understand why a plan in compliance with the ACA  Affordable Care Act  is the target of a lawsuit   she said   This is a major issue to our members      There have been conversations at the most senior levels of the administration about this   she added   Business Roundtable members are due to meet Obama in a closed door session on Tuesday  where they may air their concerns   It is not clear how many members of the group  whose companies sponsor health insurance for 40 million people  are considering any action  It is also not clear if the White House can stop the EEOC from challenging wellness programs   A threat of a corporate backlash comes at a time when Obama faces criticism even from his Democrats  ranks that he had devoted too much political capital to healthcare reform   Such action could take the form of radical changes in health benefits that employers offer  It could also mean supporting a potentially game changing challenge to Obamacare at the Supreme Court next year and expected Republican efforts to eviscerate the law when they take control of Congress in 2015   CARROTS AND STICKS  Obamacare allows financial incentives for workers taking part in workplace wellness programs of up to 50 percent of their monthly premiums  deductibles  and other costs  That translates into hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars in extra annual costs for those who do not participate    Typically  participation means filling out detailed health questionnaires  undergoing medical screenings  and in some cases attending weight loss or smoking cessation programs   One of the arguments presented in the lawsuit against three employers is that requiring medical testing violates the Americans with Disabilities Act   That 1990 law  according to employment law attorney Joseph Lazzarotti of Jackson Lewis P C  in Morristown  N J   largely prohibits requiring medical tests as part of employment    You can t make medical inquiries unless it s consistent with job necessity  or part of a voluntary wellness program   he said    The lawsuits are based on the view that it is no longer voluntary if employees face up to  4 000 in penalties for non participation  loss of insurance or even their jobs    Employers  however  see the lawsuits as reneging on the administration s commitment to an important part of the healthcare reform    On Nov  14  Roundtable president John Engler sent a letter to the Labor  Treasury and Health and Human Services cabinet secretaries who oversee Obamacare asking them to  thwart all future inappropriate actions against employers who are complying with  the law s wellness rules  and warning of  a chilling effect across the country    Asked for a response to the letter  an administration official told Reuters that it supported workplace health promotion and prevention  while ensuring that individuals are protected from unfair underwriting practices that could otherwise reduce benefits based on health status     UNDERMINING OBAMACARE  In practical terms  large corporations have several ways to undermine Obamacare if they decide to   One is to support legal challenges to the subsidies given to low income individuals who buy health insurance on the federal exchange established under the law  Neither the Business Roundtable nor any of its CEO members have done this so far  The Supreme Court is expected to hear oral arguments in the case in 2015   Another option is to make top executives available for hearings on repealing or diluting Obamacare   We never did this before   said the person familiar with the executives  thinking   But they could turn up the noise  I don t think the White House would want the CEOs turning on them and supporting these efforts on the Hill    
The nuclear option would be to radically change employer sponsored health insurance  Large corporations are highly unlikely to eliminate it  but they might give workers a fixed amount of money to buy coverage on a private insurance exchange  That would allow employers  almost all of which pay workers  medical claims out of their earnings  to cap their healthcare spending     Reporting by Sharon Begley  Editing by Michele Gershberg and Tomasz Janowski ",2014-11-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-u.s.-ceos-threaten-to-pull-tacit-obamacare-support-over-'wellness'-spat-318439,318439

Inside Spin offs
Sometimes businesses form another autonomous entity from an existing business division  when they believe that the separated line would add more value as an independent company  In such situations  the parent can focus on its core business management while the new entity can focus on its relative different goals 
How Profitable Spin offs are to Investors 
According to    spinoffs completed between 2009 and 2013 outperformed the S P 500 in their first year of trading by an average of more than 17 percent   As per an article published on   spun off entities have been performing better than parent companies lately 
PayPal   NASDAQ PYPL    up about 114   generated higher gains than parent eBay   NASDAQ EBAY    up about 56   in the last two years  post spin off   WhiteWave Foods Co  gained about 67 8  in the last three years against an 11 2  decline in Dean Foods Co   NYSE DF    WhiteWave Foods was spun off in May 2013  Abbot Laboratories   NYSE ABT   cut ties with part of its business and formed a new company called AbbVie   NYSE ABBV   in Jan 2013  ABBV was up 85  while ABT gained 41  in the last three years  as of Oct 12  2017  
What s Behind the Recent Surge in Spin Off
A Chicago based partner at The Boston Consulting Group recently commented that in a bull market  which we are witnessing currently  equities are overvalued  This makes materialization of mergers and acquisitions difficult  Instead  high valuations better justify   or divesting assets   If this logic holds good  we are likely to see more such actions in the coming days  read    
Notably  the United States saw 88 completed spinoffs in 1999  which fell to 80 in 2000  when the dot com bubble burst  The number further declined to 55 in 2001  The number of actions again rose from 24 in 2007 to 30 in 2008  before  in 2009 when the financial crisis kicked in  as per the data provided by Dealogic  quoted on CNBC  The momentum again gained momentum in 2015 by value  though 2016 and 2017 have been subdued

After a full portfolio review  Honeywell decided to spin off its home and ADI global distribution unit  which pulls in  4 5 billion in annual revenues  and its transportation systems unit  which has about  3 billion in revenue  The new  separate home business will focus on heating  ventilation  and air conditioning  and the distribution of security and fire protection products  the new transportation company will deal with technologies used in a wide range of vehicles 
  Honeywell president and chief executive Daruis Adamczyk said that the new companies will be  better positioned to maximize share owner value through focused strategic decision making and capital allocation tailored for their end markets  
Honeywell also announced that it would be keeping its aerospace technology business  a decision that went against the recommendation of activist investor Daniel Loeb  For months now  Loeb and hedge fund Third Point have placed pressure on Honeywell to overhaul its business  in particular to spin off its aerospace unit  Loeb believed that the move would  result in an increase in shareholder value in excess of  20 billion    
However  Loeb will likely be partially satisfied with Honeywell s final decision  but if he isn t  he would have to wait until the company s 2018 annual meeting to make any dissenting moves  added The Street 
Additionally  Honeywell raised the low end of its full year 2017 earnings guidance by five cents to the range of  7 05 to  7 10 per share  saying it would spend the proceeds from the spinoffs on acquisitions  share buybacks  and paying down debt 
Shares of Honeywell are up a slight 0 20  in mid morning trading  but have gained well over 23  so far in 2017

149188,370704,HON,Honeywell  HON   NASA Complete 2 Year Pilot Interface Test ,opinion,"Honeywell International Inc    NYSE HON   declared that it has successfully completed a two year long test with National Aeronautics and Space Administration  NASA   for evaluating the pilot interface in civilian airspaces 
Over the last three months  shares of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock yielded a return of 7 52   outperforming 3 59  growth recorded by the Zacks categorized  industry 

 
The company is poised to grow on the back of its diversified product portfolio  greater cost discipline and new capital investment programs 
Inside the Headlines
The two year testing program successfully integrated display technology and predictive software into corporate jet cockpits  The program demonstrated how pilots can view as well as determine the extent up to which sonic booms would affect the population on ground 
NASA noted that  This technology could prove to be useful for NASA s future planned Low Boom Flight Demonstration experimental airplane  This plane is being designed to gather community noise response data that may help remove the regulatory speed restriction to overland commercial supersonic flight  
The aviation industry would drastically progress if airplanes are run on supersonic speeds  This would help pilots cut down business jet travelling time by nearly 50   For instance  the travel time between Los Angeles to New York would be reduced from 5 to 2 5 hours  or even lesser than that 
However  sonic booms  loud noises  are the major barriers to widespread adoption of supersonic airplanes 
Nevertheless  the test depicted that Honeywell s predictive technology would help pilots change course and lower sonic booms over densely populated areas

149228,370744,HON,The Temperature Is Rising On Honeywell  Bonus Idea,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Honeywell International Inc  NYSE HON   had only a minor pullback in its stock price at the beginning of the year  It hit a low and found support in late January  before embarking on a 6 month move higher  That culminated in a high in July near 120  Since then it has pulled back  finding support a couple times around 110 and bouncing  In October it gapped lower though  falling more than 5  below its 200 day SMA  Since then it has bounced and moved through the prior resistance and is now near filling the gap down as it consolidates 
A Measured Move higher would give a target to 118 30 as an initial target  But there is also a possible AB CD pattern that gives a longer term target to about 131 50  The momentum indicators are bullish  The RSI is rising in the bullish zone while the MACD is rising and positive  There is resistance at 114 20 and 117 followed by 119 and then free air to new all time highs  Support lower comes at 112 and 110 followed by 108  Short interest is low under 1  and the company is expected to report earnings next January 27th 
The options chains show large open interest at the 115 strike in December on the call side  but big open interest at the 110 and 100 puts as well  In January there is large open interest at the 115 call as well  and from 100 to 110 open the put side  In March  the first expiry beyond the next earnings report  open interest is biggest at 115 and 120 on the call side  and then 115 on the put side  but still relatively small

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which stuffed with turkey and shopped out from Black Friday  had traders and investors seeing the equity markets looking strong heading into December 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue lower while crude oil consolidates with a short term bias higher  The US dollar index continues to look strong as while US Treasuries are biased lower but may be finding support  The Shanghai Composite continues to look strong and Emerging Markets continue to consolidate in their downtrend 
Volatility looks to remain very low keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   The SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY  looks strong and ready for more while the IWM may be getting overheated and should garner close attention for a possible short term pullback  The QQQ is sitting just under highs and could be the beneficiary of any short term rotation  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

miss and shares of the company fell 3 4  at the close of market on Feb 25    On a reported basis  including one time charges and legal fees   the company s loss came in at 61 cents per share  compared to earnings of 29 cents per share in the prior year tally The loss during the reported quarter stemmed from restructuring charges and a drop in gross profit from an increase of  94 million in the projected costs for completing a downstream EPC project  In addition  a reduction in the percentage of completion estimated on an LNG project joint venture in Australia affected the timing of profit recognition  The negative impact of these factors was somewhat offset by growth in the Government Services business and steady earnings from the Technology   Consulting segment For full year 2016  the company posted a loss of 43 cents per share  in stark contrast to earnings of  1 40 per share in the prior year Inside the HeadlinesRevenues inched up 1  year over year to  1 190 million  missing the consensus mark of  1 222 3 million  The top line was driven by the expansion of heritage U S government contracts and also by contribution from the two recent acquisitions in the Government Services segment Segment wise  Technology   Consulting revenues fell 8 6  year over year to  85 million  The segment s upstream oil consulting portion continued to be challenged by reduced business volume ensuing from low oil prices Also  Engineering   Construction revenues continued their weak trajectory and plunged 23 9  year over year to  530 million  Reduced activity on several projects including one of the major LNG projects in Australia played a spoilsport  Furthermore  sluggish activity on KBR s offshore maintenance joint venture in Mexico hurt segmental results However  Government Services revenues charted phenomenal growth as it soared 198 3  to  519 million on a year over year basis  Revenues benefited from solid expansion of the existing U S  government contracts and task orders in support of the U S  Military  In addition  the two recently completed acquisitions contributed to the segment s revenues Moreover  Non strategic Business revenues plummeted 52 1  year over year to  56 million owing to the completion of two power projects in 2015 and elimination of  9 million of revenues related to the sale of the Infrastructure Americas business in fourth quarter 2015  KBR is now nearing completion on the last power project before it completely exits the fixed priced EPC power business As of Dec 31  2016  the company s total backlog was  10 9 billion  down 11 3  on a year over year  y o y  basis  Of the total backlog  about  7 8 billion is booked under the Government Services segment  up 20  on a y o y basis  and around  2 8 billion under the Engineering   Construction segment  down 46 2  on a y o y basis   While Technology and Consulting accounted for  313 million of the backlog  down 27 2  on a y o y basis   non strategic Business had  35 million in backlog  down 85 4   Major Contract WinsDuring the quarter  KBR won multiple contracts for infrastructure projects in Australia  a contract from a state owned power generation company in Indonesia and another from the Royal Australian Navy  RAN  at HMAS Cerberus The infrastructure projects in Australia include aiding expansion of the AU 600 million Mernda Rail Project and the Doric Contractors award to upgrade water infrastructure at the HMAS Stirling Navy base  The other infrastructure project includes providing marine and maritime structural engineering services to the Laing O Rourke Managing Contractor team KBR also secured two global agreements from BP  LON BP  International Limited   one contract for conceptual engineering services  and the other for providing front end engineering design  FEED  and pre FEED services These services would be provided in the offshore  onshore  subsea  greenfield  drilling and brownfield upstream domains in Angola  Alaska  Indonesia  Oman  Trinidad  Azerbaijan and the UK AcquisitionsLast quarter  the Engineering and construction giant completed the buyout of Honeywell International Inc  s   NYSE HON   technology development and engineering unit   Honeywell Technology Solutions  Inc    HTSI     for about  266 million  KBR expects the transaction to result in earnings accretion right from the next year HTSI was integrated into KBR s wholly owned subsidiary   KBRwyle   augmenting its  2 5 billion government business  This strategic buyout fortifies KBR s position as a government services organization  Further  it unlocks opportunities to foray into new services in the aerospace logistics and intelligence domain Additionally  in the third quarter  the company concluded the  570 million acquisition of Wyle Inc   a provider of specialized engineering and technical services  Wyle is set to unlock synergistic opportunities in markets where KBR can combine its large scale logistics and project management capabilities During the reported quarter  KBR s subsidiary Brown   Root Industrial Services  LLC  has acquired the MEI Group  LLC  a provider of turnaround  specialty  and construction related services  This strategic buyout will help KBR s subsidiary reinforce its maintenance business and achieve sustainable growth opportunities  going forward 2016 was  thus  a noteworthy year for KBR  as it completed several strategic acquisitions  including two established and highly technical government services companies  a portfolio of complementary technologies  and a specialty welding and turnarounds company through its Brown   Root joint venture KBR  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Liquidity   Cash FlowAs of Dec 31  2016  KBR s cash and equivalents were  536 million  down from  883 million as of Dec 31  2015 For the quarter  cash flow generated from operating activities came in at  61 million  up from  47 million in the year ago quarter GuidanceConcurrent with the earnings release  KBR provided its guidance for full year 2017 results  The company projects earnings per share within  1 10  1 40  excluding legal costs associated with the legacy U S  government contracts  The company s EBITDA is expected to come in the range of  300  350 million  Over 70  of the projected earnings are expected to be generated from contracts already secured in KBR s backlog at year end 2016 The company anticipates incurring legal costs of around  9 million or 7 cents per share for 2017  This estimated legacy legal fees exclude any future cost reimbursement from the U S  Government To ConcludeOf late  KBR s Government Services business has been acting as the major profit churner  helping the company brave past formidable macro headwinds  The company continues to believe that the Government Services and Technology businesses will provide it some balance between hydrocarbons and government projects We expect the company to become more competitive after reducing over  200 million in annualized costs over the past two years  KBR is also close to completing its last domestic EPC power project  after which it can exit the fixed price EPC power business  These strategic actions and recent awards will likely drive long term earnings growth  and help the company generate greater free cash flow  in the coming times Despite these positives  three back to back quarters of earnings miss are unlikely to go well with the investors  The overall macroeconomic sluggishness remains a major concern for the company  Moreover  the restructuring actions  though profitable for the long run  are restricting

149232,370748,HON,Honeywell  HON  Q1 Earnings  What s In Store For The Stock ,opinion,Industrial goods manufacturer Honeywell International Inc    NYSE HON   is scheduled to report first quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Apr 21  In the last reported quarter  the company s adjusted earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 74  Over the trailing four quarters  the company reported an average positive earnings surprise of 1 9   beating estimates on three occasions Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Key Factors in the First QuarterOn Feb 14  the company announced that it was selected for the Largest Petrochemicals Project in China to provide a range of process technology from Honeywell UOP  Per the deal  Honeywell UOP will offer a wide range of technologies in the form of license  design  key equipment  and state of the art catalysts and adsorbents while its Process Solutions will provide the process controls and automation systems  This deal is likely to have an impact on the company s revenues in the to be reported quarter On Mar 1  Honeywell debriefed investors about its earnings and sales expectations for the future quarters  At the same time  the company reiterated its guidance for the first quarter and full year 2017  For 2017  Honeywell expects its earnings per share in the range of  6 85  7 10  excluding pension mark to market expense   significantly up from  6 46 in 2016  For the first quarter  earnings are projected to be in the range of  1 60  1 64 per share   On Mar 17  Honeywell announced that its UOP s Ecofining process technology  developed in unison with Eni SpA   TO E    will be utilized by the Diamond Green Diesel facility in Norco  LA  to augment its renewable diesel production capacity from 10 000 barrels per day to 18 000 by the second quarter of 2018  With such state of the art products  Honeywell UOP aims to gain a competitive edge over its rivals and augment its revenues However  given its international presence  the company often faces unfavorable foreign currency movements  impacting its top line growth  Any slowdown in the global economy  particularly after the Brexit referendum or the manufacturing industry as a whole will have an adverse impact on its business and hamper its long term growth potential  A geopolitical impasse due to various conflicts and disruptions may further affect its international operations in the key markets  In order to fend off competition  Honeywell has to continually develop and maintain competitive products by adding innovative features that differentiate its products and prevent commoditization  These increase R D expenditure and have often resulted in margin contraction and reduced bottom line growth The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of products  particularly in Performance Materials and Technologies  cumene  fluorspar  perchloroethylene  natural gas and ethylene   Transportation Systems  nickel  steel and other metals  and Aerospace  nickel  titanium and other metals  segments  Honeywell is susceptible to material price inflation  which affects profitability  In addition  major components  product equipment items and raw materials are procured or subcontracted on a single source basis with a number of domestic and foreign companies  As such  Honeywell is highly dependent on its supply chain to scale production and adjust delivery of long lead time products during times of volatile demand  High operating risks in one of the key segments of its business might be a drag on its long term sustainability Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Honeywell is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is currently at  0 62   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Honeywell International Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Zacks Rank  Honeywell has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or  5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Capital Bank Financial Corp    NASDAQ CBF    with an Earnings ESP of  6 82  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  Kansas City Southern   NYSE KSU   has an

149253,370769,HON,KBR Inc   KBR  Misses Q3 Earnings   Revenues  Guides Down,opinion,Premium technology  engineering  procurement and construction company  KBR  Inc    NYSE KBR    missed earnings expectations after six quarters  as it reported earnings of 30 cents for third quarter 2016  The figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 34 cents by 11 8   Investors were disheartened with the earnings miss and shares of the company fell almost 4 0  at the close of market on Wednesday On a reported basis  including one time charges and legal fees   the company s loss came in at 44 cents per share  compared an earnings per share of 38 cents in the prior year tally  Results in third quarter 2016 include  126 million in previously announced charges related to forecast cost increases on two projects  the majority of which is for an electric power generating facility within our Non strategic Business segment The loss during the reported quarter stemmed from inflated charges related on two projects  the majority of which is for an electric power generating facility within Non strategic Business segment  Further  poor revenue performance added to KBR s woes Inside the HeadlinesRevenues were down 10 5  year over year to  1 073 million  Deconsolidation of Industrial Services business and absence of revenues from the Infrastructure business divesture resulted in the top line decline  Also  low oil prices have been restricting capital spending by clients  which  in turn  hurt revenues  Also  the top line lagged the consensus mark of  1 194 million Segment wise  Technology   Consulting revenues fell 15 2  year over year to  67 million  A greater presence of lower margin proprietary equipment revenues instead of the higher engineering services and license fees resulted in the overall revenue decline Also  Engineering   Construction revenues continued their weak trajectory  and deteriorated 28 1  year over year to  595 million Reduced activity on several projects including one of the major LNG projects in Australia played a spoilsport  Also  deconsolidation of KBR s Americas Industrial Services business proved to be a major headwind However  Government Services revenues charted phenomenal growth as it soared nearly 127 8  to  401 million on a year over year basis  Revenues benefited from the solid expansion of existing U S  government contracts and task orders in support of the U S  Military  In addition  strategic acquisitions contributed  200 million to the segment s revenues Moreover  Non strategic Business revenues plummeted 91 4  year over year to  10 million owing to the completion of two power projects in 2015 and elimination of  9 million of revenues related to the sale of the Infrastructure Americas business in fourth quarter 2015 As of Sep 30  2016  the company s total backlog stood at  11 4 billion  down 14 3  on a year over year  y o y  basis  Of the total backlog  about  7 4 billion is booked under the Government Services segment  down 10 4  on a y o y basis  and around  3 6 billion under the Engineering   Construction segment  down 36 8  on a y o y basis   While Technology and Consulting accounted for  340 million of the backlog  down 19 6  on a y o y basis   non strategic Business had  75 million in backlog  down 78 8   Major Contract WinsDuring the quarter  KBR managed to clinch some prestigious awards in its Government Services and Hydrocarbons segments  These include the Kuwait Base Operations and Security Support Services for the U S  Army  award of one of five seats on the U S  Naval Facilities Engineering Command and Pacific s Global Contingency Services Multiple Award Contract  GCSMAC  II Major awards in the LNG market include a confidential FEED services contract for a LNG project in North America  a high level feasibility study for SLNG s Jurong Island LNG Terminal and a pre FEED study for AALNG s new proposed LNG Hub terminal in Indonesia  Further  KBR won multiple contracts for major Australian civil infrastructure projects Going forward  the company remains positive about winning the contract for extension of the existing Allenby Connaught project of Army 2020 and a 25 year facilities maintenance contract for the major military garrisons in the UK  Currently  most of the company s backlog comprise low risk and reimbursable contracts  which signals robust margins and greater free cash flow for the upcoming quarters Acquisitions to Boost Government UnitDuring the quarter  the Engineering and construction giant announced that it has completed the buyout of Honeywell International Inc  s   NYSE HON   technology development and engineering unit  Honeywell Technology Solutions  Inc    HTSI    Completion of the acquisition comes a little ahead of its October end deadline  KBR had inked an agreement to buy HTSI for  266 million  subject to some adjustments  and projects the transaction to result in earnings accretion right from the next year Post the buyout  HTSI will be integrated into KBR s wholly owned subsidiary   KBRwyle   augmenting its  2 5 billion government business  This takeover expands KBR s lifecycle service capabilities  such as cyber security and IT expertise  enabling it to take care of all the steps involved in the life cycle of aerospace and defense programs  This strategic buyout fortifies KBR s position as a government services organization  Further  it unlocks opportunities to foray into new services in the aerospace logistics and intelligence domain Also  during the quarter  the company concluded the  570 million acquisition of Wyle Inc   a provider of specialized engineering and technical services  Wyle is set to unlock synergistic opportunities in markets where KBR can combine its large scale logistics and project management capabilities KBR INC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Liquidity   Cash FlowAs of Sep 30  2016  KBR s cash and equivalents were  569 million  down from  883 million as of Dec 31  2015 For the quarter  cash flow generated from operating activities totaled  20 million  down from the cash generation of  54 million in the year ago quarter Guidance CutConcurrent with the earnings release  KBR has revised its guidance for full year 2016 downward  The company now projects earnings per share within 30 50 cents  excluding legal costs associated with the legacy U S  government contracts  compared to the earlier guided range of  1 20  1 45  Expected cost increases on the EPC power project in the Non Strategic Business segment and on the ammonia project in the E C segment is attributable to the guidance cut The company has reiterated its Legal costs expectations  which are projected at around  15 million or 11 cents per share for 2016  This estimated legacy legal fees exclude any future cost reimbursement from the U S  Government To ConcludeOf late  KBR s Government Services business has been acting as the major profit churner  helping the company brave past most of the formidable macro headwinds  Though the Technology   Consulting segment had a dismal performance during the third quarter  KBR remains positive about its long term prospects  The company believes that the Government Services and Technology businesses will provide it some balance between hydrocarbons and government projects  This will allow it to mitigate cyclicality and maximize growth Also  we believe that KBR s strategic acquisitions are helping the company bolster its inorganic growth and expanding market share  The two recent acquisitions of Wyle and Honeywell Technology Solutions highlight the company s attempt to fortify the foothold of its already thriving Government Services business  Furthermore  we perceive that investments undertaken around the world in refining and petrochemicals market represent lucrative prospects for this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company Despite these positives  two back to back quarters of earnings miss and precipitous revenue

Ratios to Identify an Efficient Company
We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive return 
Inventory Turnover
Inventory level is one of the key indicators of a company s business health  While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales  a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition  This is where inventory turnover comes into play  It is the ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a 4 quarter average inventory  Thus  a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS  while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory 
Receivables Turnover
This ratio is used to measure a company s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit  Receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or the  debtor s turnover ratio  is calculated by dividing 12 month sales by four quarter average receivables  While a high ratio may indicate that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers  a low ratio may signal that the company has inefficient collection procedure or has low quality customers or an inefficient credit policy 
Asset Utilization
This is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  Asset utilization indicates a company s potential to utilize its assets  It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4 quarter average of total assets  So  the higher the ratio  the greater the possibility is that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently  On the contrary  a low value of the ratio may signal that it is failing to use its assets effectively 
Operating Margin
Another popular efficiency ratio is operating margin  Operating profit margin  which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period  indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses  If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors  it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses 
All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry  This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have these ratios higher than their respective industry averages 
Screening Parameters
In addition to the above mentioned ratios  we have added a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or a Zacks Rank  2  Buy    to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable

The chart below shows how the stock price went through a broad consolidation and chop in 2015 before racing to new highs after the February bottom  But since making an all time high April 19th  it entered another consolidation phase  this one much tighter  A brief dip under the 50 day SMA in May and it is right back at the April high Thursday 


As it hits resistance at 116 50 there are 4 positive signs that it will break the consolidation to the upside and continue  The first is the RSI moving above 60 again  a higher high  The next is the MACD has crossed as it hit zero and is rising and positive now  Third is the Bollinger Bands  opening to the upside  Finally and most important  the price itself is showing strong intraday action at it moves higher  A close at the top of the day Thursday will be a great sign of strength  A push and close over 116 56 can be used as a trigger

149396,370912,HON,This Dividend Yielding Play Is Well Built,opinion,"Honeywell International  NYSE HON  is a diversified manufacturing and technology company making things as complex as aircraft engines HVAC thermostats  And the mix is serving it well  The stock price is up over 200  since making a low in 2011 and over 20  since the January low 3 months ago  Needless to say  the chart looks good  But even the most recent price action warrants a look for adding this stock to your portfolio 
The chart below shows the last 6 months  After a sideways action through the end of the year  the price pulled back with the market in January  Since then the price has risen against rising trend support mirroring the 20 day SMA with a one day exception at the end of February  The last 3 weeks have seen consolidation in that uptrend under 113 25  which is proving to be resistance 

The rest of the information on the chart sets up for a positive move out of that consolidation  Momentum has held bullish as the price moves sideways  The RSI remains in the bullish zone and the MACD has leveled in positive territory  Should it cross back up through the signal line  that would add even more weight to the upside case  There was a golden cross at the start of March as well  A break of the price up over resistance would give a measured move to 124 against that  oops  at the end of February  And the stock sports a 2 1  dividend yield while you are watching it go ",2016-04-12,Gregory W.

149399,370915,HON,What Lies Ahead For M A ETF ,opinion,"Merger and acquisition  M A  activities across a number of sectors were on a tear last year  with a record level of such activities  But the momentum for M A   one of the major drivers of the stock market ascent in recent times   seems to be fading this year  At least  the numbers are giving such cues  The volume of  is  US822 2 billion   1 1 trillion  so far this year  which represents a decline of 17  year over year  read    
	In addition to this data  there has been a surge of failed M A deals lately  As per data    US targeted withdrawn M A volume is up 64  on full year 2015   231 1bn  to  378 2bn in 2016 YTD  as of May 4  2016    This is because several mega deals have been called off lately which took the size of U S  oriented withdrawn M A to a record level 
	Drugmaker Pfizer s decision to abandon its  160 billion deal to unite with Botox maker Allergan  NYSE AGN pa  plc due to the new Treasury guidance related to tax inversion is the largest called off deal on record 
	The  103 billion deal between Honeywell International  NYSE HON  and United Technologies  NYSE UTX  is also out of action  There was also a proposed  38 7 billion merger deal between Halliburton  NYSE HAL  and Baker Hughes  which finally fell apart in April 
	As per Dealogic  with the termination of these likely deals  investment bankers were hard hit as they lost about   investment fees What s Next  
	It looks like that the removal of mammoth deals in the U S  actually inflated the size of withdrawn M A data   357 8 billion   the data speaks less about the diminishing number of activities  As per financial review  though there was a plunge in global M A deal size  the number of announced transactions is 8 025  versus 8 085 last year  indicating that the number has just moderated  and is far from completely losing momentum   
	The stringency in the U S  tax inversion rule is less likely to put an end to cross border deals  Yes  it could slow the momentum  but cannot stop them altogether  read   
	Another reason for the M A slowdown is the underperformance of hedge funds in recent times  Notably  activists  hedge funds play a huge role in companies  merger and acquisition decisions  If the climate improves in this area  maybe M A sector will receive a fresh lease of life  Also  being an election year  activities may remain slightly subdued in the U S 
	Plus  the banking sector is facing stringent regulation and is also caught in a trap following energy sector issues  This is because banks have considerable exposure in the energy sector  which may default on persistent low oil prices 
	This scenario made the banks unsure of  how much leverage they should supply to private equity transactions  which has caused them to shy away from lending to   
	If the banking sector recovers in the near term  mergers and acquisitions may also perk up and investors could easily take advantage of the merger arbitrage strategy 
	This strategy looks to tap the price differential  or spread  between the stock price of the target company after the public announcement of its proposed acquisition and the price offered by the acquirer to pay for the stock of the target company 
	This is especially true given that investors should go long on the target or the acquired company and short on the acquiring company  When the deal is completed  shares of the target company will increase to the full deal price  in some cases slightly below the deal price   giving investors a nice profit  see  all  here  How to Play  
	Here are three merger arbitrage ETFs  any of which could make compelling options for investors seeking to play this area  These are IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF     ProShares Merger ETF    and Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  Merger Arbitrage Index ETN     read

Honeywell  Ticker  HONHoneywell  HON   is a stock set up for both the bears and the bulls  The symmetrical triangle that has been in play since February  reflecting tightening expectations by both buyers and sellers  is near the optimal break out point  The long run trend is clearly higher  but with all the banter about large caps following the small caps lower this is a possibility to take advantage of which ever the market gives  The Measured Move out of the triangle targets a  7 30 move and the triggers are a move over 94 25 or under 91 25  The RSI is right at the mid line giving no clear bias and the MACD is tightening its oscillation on the zero level  but about to cross up  A slight bias higher 
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a break over 94 25 with a stop at 93 50 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the June 95 Calls  offered at 71 cents late Friday  on the same trigger

Trade Idea 6  Buy the June 90 85 Put Spread  74 cents  on the same trigger 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Saturday which  heading into next week sees the equity markets becoming bifurcated  Elsewhere look for Gold to continue in a range along with Crude Oil although the latter has a bias to the upside short term  The US Dollar Index looks to continue to gain strength while US Treasuries are biased lower in the short term in their uptrend  The Shanghai Composite looks weak and is biased lower while Emerging Markets are biased to the upside in their consolidation range  Volatility looks to remain quite low keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  IWM and QQQ  Their charts are not so enthusiastic though with the SPY the strongest and only looking to continue consolidation while the QQQ consolidates with a downside bias and the IWM looking for more downside  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

149444,370960,HON,Why Honeywell May Miss Earnings  First Time In 2 Years,opinion,"Honeywell International Inc   NYSE HON   a 100 year old American multinational conglomerate that sells engineering related products and services is set to report FQ2 2014 earnings before the market opens on Friday  July 18  Over the past couple years Honeywell has established a flawless track record of growing profits and beating the Wall Street consensus  However  this quarter contributing analysts on Estimize com are forecasting that the trend may be about to be broken  
This quarter 15 contributing analysts on Estimize com have come to a consensus earnings expectation of  1 35 EPS and  10 138B in revenue compared to a consensus of  1 36 EPS and  10 165B from Wall Street  This is the first time in two years that the Estimize profit consensus is below the Wall Street forecast  even if it is only 1c per share lower  
As shown in the chart above Honeywell has beaten the Wall Street EPS consensus in each quarter over the past 2 years  Honeywell has also posted promising and consistent year over year EPS growth  posting an increase between 5  and 16  in each of those quarters  The Estimize community expects Honeywell to report near the bottom of that range by growing earnings by 7c  6   per share this quarter from  1 28 in FQ2 of last year to  1 35 this quarter 

Estimize com ranks and allows the sorting of analysts by accuracy  the analyst with the lowest error rate on Honeywell with at least 2 estimates scored is an anonymous independent financial research professional who goes by the username PCLA  Over 2 previously scored estimates PCLA has averaged an impressively low error rate of 1   Estimize is completely open and free for anyone to contribute  and the base of contributing analysts on the platform includes hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  non professional investors  and students 
The Estimize consensus was more accurate than the Wall Street consensus 65  of the time last quarter on the coverage of nearly 1000 stocks  A combination of algorithms ensures that the data is not only clean and free from people attempting to game the system  but also weighs past performance and many other factors to gauge future accuracy 

Contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform are forecasting that on Friday Honeywell will report earnings a penny  1   behind Wall Street s EPS forecast and miss the Street s revenue consensus by  26 million   1    Since the market s expectations as represented by the Estimize consensus are slightly below the Wall Street consensus  a report in line with the sell side s forecast will likely be enough to keep investors satisfied ",2014-07-17,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-honeywell-may-miss-earnings,-first-time-in-2-years-219800",219800
