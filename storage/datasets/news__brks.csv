StrategyIn good markets or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank of  1 continue to outperform But  since there are over 200 stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 at any time  it s important to know what other filters to apply to the Zacks Rank to generate a smaller  more tradable list of stocks Two filters in particular  when added to the Zacks Rank of  1  not only narrows down the number of qualified stocks to a more practical portfolio size  it often times increases its performance as well ParametersThere are only three items to this screen  But together  they make for a powerful combination   Zacks Rank equal to 1 With an average annual return of over 26  per year over the last 26 years  there s no better way to start off a screen     Change  Q1  Est  over 4 Weeks greater than 0Positive current quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks The Zacks Rank already looks at earnings estimate revisions for the current year  F1  and the next year  F2   But this added component looks at the more immediate future  which is the current quarter  Q1  If a company s current quarter is seeing downward revisions  this is a potential warning sign that more downward revisions could follow  On the other hand  a company receiving upward earnings estimate revisions should see even more upward earnings estimate revisions  making it an attractive stock to buy      Broker Rating Change over 4 Week equal to Top   5 Top 5 stocks with the best average broker rating changes over the last four weeks We re looking for positive broker rating changes or upgrades over the last four weeks  And to limit the number of stocks that come through  we ve constructed the screen to select the top 5 stocks with the best broker rating upgrade Since broker ratings are typically skewed to the upside  this makes sure that the brokers are getting more bullish or  at the very least  not getting less bullish  or even bearish  on the stock And while I don t care so much for the actual broker rating per se   I do care about the change  And stocks with broker rating upgrades have proven to outperform those with no broker rating changes and downgrades These two items added to the Zacks  1 Rank produce powerful results ResultsOver the last 17 years  2000 thru 2016  using a 1 week rebalance  it showed an average annual return of 55 6  vs  the S P s 4 2   It was up 70 7  in 2016  And so far in 2017  thru August 11th   it was up 41 9  You can also successfully trade this strategy using a 2 week or 4 week rebalance as well  Regardless of how often you trade it  once a week  every two weeks  or four weeks  etc    trading 5 stocks at a time is a lot easier than 200 stocks So for a great and reliable way to trade some of the best Zacks  1 Ranked stocks  try the Filtered Zacks Rank 5 strategy and

33386,254901,BRKS,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Thursday  November 9 
1  Tax Reform Uncertainties  Trump Asia Tour Keep Dollar in Check
Sentiment on the dollar was fragile on Thursday  as a U S  Senate tax cut bill  which differs from one in the House of Representatives  was set to be unveiled later Thursday 
The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that Senate Republican leaders were thinking of postponing the implementation of major corporate tax cuts to comply with Senate rules 
Traders are concerned over any potential delays in the implementation of the tax cuts or the possibility that proposed reforms end up being less drastic than hoped for 
Market participants were also monitoring President Trump s trip throughout Asia  In a meeting with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Wednesday  Trump said he aims to address what he considers to be unfair practices from China that have led to a mismatch of benefits from U S  China trade 
The president went on to say that the current relationship between the two countries is a  very one sided and unfair one  
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a trade weighted basket of six major currencies  was down 0 09  at 94 683 by 05 50 a m  ET  09 50 GMT  
2  Crude Prices Steady Near Multi Year Highs as Optimism Dominates
Crude prices steadied near multi year highs on Thursday  after posting losses in the previous session when the U S  Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories increased by 2 2 million barrels in the week ended November 3 
Market analysts  expected a crude stock loss of around 2 9 million barrels 
However  losses were limited by mounting expectations that oil producing countries will agree to extend an output cut at their meeting at the end of this month 
Under the original terms of the deal  OPEC and 10 other non OPEC countries led by Russia agreed to cut production by 1 8 million barrels a day  bpd  for six months  The agreement was extended in May of this year for a period of nine more months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices 
Discussions are continuing in the run up to the Nov  30 meeting  which oil ministers from OPEC and the participating non OPEC countries will attend 
The U S  West Texas Intermediate crude December contract was up 7 cents or about 0 12  at  56 88 a barrel by 05 50 a m  ET  09 50 GMT   not far from the previous session s fresh two year peak of  57 91 
Elsewhere  Brent oil for January delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was up 7 cents or about 0 11  at  63 56 a barrel  just off a new two year high of  64 65 hit on Wednesday 
3  Brexit Talks Set to Resume Amid Hopes for Year End Deal
Brexit talks were scheduled to resume in Brussels later Thursday amid growing concerns amid European Union negotiators that London will fail to meet EU conditions next month for opening future negotiations 
EU representatives even discussed on Wednesday the possibility of delaying into next year the launch of talks with London on a post Brexit relationship 
Germany and France in particular have demanded that British Prime Minister Theresa May agree in principle to pay an exit bill of several tens of billions of euros before EU leaders agree to open a second phase of Brexit negotiations 
The fresh round of talks comes after the UK government on Tuesday said it would submit legislation to parliament to let the country pursue an independent trade policy once it leaves the EU 
The pound edged lower  with GBP USD down 0 15  at 1 3095 by 05 50 a m  ET  09 50 GMT  
4  Gold Holds Steady With Eyes on U S  Developments  Palladium Near 16 Year Highs
Gold prices held steady near the previous session s almost three week highs thanks to a softer U S  dollar and lingering geopolitical tensions 
Speaking in South Korea on Tuesday  U S  President Donald Trump addressed tensions with North Korea  saying that Pyongyang  has interpreted America s past restraint as weakness  and that  this would be a fatal miscalculation  
The rogue nation responded to Trump s remarks by calling the U S  President a  lunatic old man  and saying that the U S  must remove him from power  to get rid of the abyss of doom  
Markets were also jittery as Saudi Arabia continued to conduct an anti corruption purge among the highest levels of the establishment 
After a first crackdown over the weekend  Saudi authorities said on Wednesday that they had made additional arrests and frozen more bank accounts among the kingdom s political and business elite 
Comex gold futures were little changed at  1 284 40 a troy ounce by 05 50 a m  ET  09 50 GMT   just off Wednesday s nearly three week high of  1 287 52 
Meanwhile  palladium prices hit their highest level since 2001 at  1 020 90  boosted by the progressive transition to petrol engines and expectations for growth in hybrid electric vehicles

Despite a strong move over the past two years and its 4 7  run follow earnings yesterday  Orbotech is still trading 16  below fair value  Finbox io values the company using ten models  eight of which see upside in the stock  The average 1 year price target from seven Wall Street analysts also shows nearly 10  upside 

Orbotech s peer group includes Fabrinet  NYSE FN   AU Optronics  NYSE AUO   Brooks Automation  NASDAQ BRKS  and II VI Incorporated  NASDAQ IIVI   According to finbox io s fair value estimates  all of these companies are trading at a premium or near fair value 
When comparing valuation multiples  Orbotech is in the middle of the pack relative to its peers  Its trailing P E is 22 7x after 12 month earnings growth of 30    so the trailing PEG ratio is below 1 
And when ranking Orbotech and its peers using EV EBITDA it looks even cheaper 
Analysts are expecting earnings growth of 20  a year for the next five years  Yesterday s results reiterate that the company is on track to hit that target for fiscal year 2017  implying a forward P E multiple of 11 5x  That s a bargain for this high growth tech stock 
One reason Orbotech trades at a discount to many of its peers is that its performance has historically been a little lumpy  Whether a contract gets booked in one quarter or the next can have a dramatic impact on its reported performance  However as the company grows  their performance should become less lumpy with more individual contracts smoothing the curve 
The gross margin in the second quarter was 46 8   Q2 16 was 45 9    and management expects this to expand further in the second half of the year  This should help improve the company s already impressive return on invested capital of 8 3   Among its peer group  only Fabrinet has been able to create more value for all its stake holders 

Stock Still Has Upside Following Earnings
Orbotech is a quality growth stock trading at a more than reasonable price  Investors can also expect the company to be resilient in any market downturn  The tougher the business environment becomes  the more its customers will need its products  Furthermore  Orbotech has customers with big pockets  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  being one 
Semiconductor manufacturers have been focusing their efforts on increasing capacity as a result of memory companies transitioning their technology to more advanced nodes  The next step for these manufacturers will be to increase the efficiency processes of the newly created capacity  This is where Orbotech can help and why investors may want to start taking a closer look at the stock ",2017-08-03,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-orbotech-can-trade-much-higher-200205082,200205082

33418,254933,BRKS,5 Liquid Stocks To Put Your Money On ,opinion,"Companies with favorable liquidity levels are generally speculated to have impressive business growth  which in turn has a positive impact on their price performance  Liquidity indicates a company s capability of meeting its debt obligations by converting its assets into liquid cash and equivalents 
However  one should be careful about investing in a stock with a high liquidity level as it may also indicate that the company is failing to utilize its assets efficiently  Therefore  in addition to the liquidity level  an investor may also consider the efficiency of the company before investing in the stock  An efficient company with a favorable liquidity level may prove to be a profitable addition to one s portfolio 
Measures to Identify Liquid Stocks
Current  quick and cash ratios are considered as the main pointers of the liquidity level of a company  Current ratio or working capital ratio indicates a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations by measuring current assets relative to current liabilities  Contrastingly  the quick ratio or acid test ratio or quick assets ratio only seeks to measure a company s ability to pay short term obligations  Due to this  current assets excluding inventory are considered in calculating the quick ratio 
Separately  the cash ratio   the most conservative of the three ratios   indicates a company s potential to convert its most liquid assets to pay current debt obligations  This is the reason why it only considers cash and cash equivalents relative to the company s current liabilities  Values of all these ratios above 1 may signal that the company is in good financial shape  However  high values of these ratios may also indicate that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  we consider liquidity ratios between 1 and 3 for healthy choices 
Screening Parameters
In order to avoid selection of inefficient companies  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Though this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be called efficient 
In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential too  we have added our proprietary  to the screen 
Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency     
Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency

 Growth Style Score less than or equal to B
 Back tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or  2 handily beat other stocks

33420,254935,BRKS,5 Top Ranked Liquid Stocks To Buy Now ,opinion,"Liquidity indicates a company s ability to meet its short term debt obligations  Thus companies with favorable liquidity positions are poised to provide significant returns during any circumstances  However  companies with high liquidity may not always be financially strong  It may also indicate that the company is failing to utilize its assets efficiently  It is therefore important to also focus on efficiency alongside liquidity to build a profitable portfolio  
Liquidity Ratios 
Liquidity ratios like Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio are primarily used to identify companies with strong liquidity 
Current Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered to be ideal 
Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable 
Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to pay its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials  a high number may indicate inefficiency in using cash 
So  a ratio of greater than 1 is always desirable but it may not always underline a company s financial health 
Screening Parameters
In order to avoid selection of inefficient companies  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Since this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be called efficient
