and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Marty  Good morning and thank you for joining us today  I m going to start by giving a quick overview of our business and investment activities  And then I will turn the call over to Michael Manelis  our Chief Operating Officer for a discussion of our 2019 operating results and 2020 revenue guidance  as well as giving you some detail on the exciting operational initiatives that we are pursuing  Then we ll pass the call over to Bob Garechana  our Chief Financial Officer  who ll give you color on 2020 expense and normalized funds from operations guidance and a bit about our balance sheet activities 2019 was a very good year for Equity Residential  We saw continued strong demand delivered in our well located urban and dense suburban properties in the nine metros in which we do business  And our excellent customer service led to record levels of customer satisfaction and resident retention  A big thank you to all my colleagues at Equity Residential for delighting our customers every day and for working together as one team As we predicted  the fourth quarter of 2019 reverted to the normal lower seasonal demand  that is common at the end of each year  Slightly weaker conditions than projected led us to slightly underperform on same store revenue versus our October guidance  but still performed at the top end of our expectations from the beginning of 2019  And we saw our normalized funds from operations increase in 2019 by an impressive 7 4   exceeding our expectations as we continue to produce strong reliable growth 2020 looks to us to be more of the same  a slow but consistently growing economy and continuing positive demographics  leading to good demand and to steady revenue growth  albeit at a somewhat lower overall level than in 2019  We expect the East Coast markets to continue to improve on a relative basis  And overall  we expect the average revenue performance difference between the East Coast and West Coast markets to be only about 25 basis points in 2020 Except for New York  we see supply is similar to or slightly higher in our markets in 2020 versus 2019  In New York  supply across the area in which we operate  has been declining in the last two years and we expect it to fall by a further 40  in 2020  In fact in Manhattan  where we have 70  of our New York metro revenue  we see fewer than 1 000 market rate units being delivered in 2020  Also  as we discussed on prior calls  we will be facing a headwind of 20 basis points or so from new rent control regulations in California and in New York On the innovation front  we are very excited about the benefits to revenue and expense  as well as the customer satisfaction that can be gained from the continued rollout of the various initiatives that Michael will discuss  These benefits will be modest in 2020  but we believe will accelerate and compound over time Switching to investments  we had a busy 2019  As we have stated previously  increased demand for apartment assets was led to cap rate compression between newer and older properties  This led us in turn to accelerate the sale of some of our older lower return properties and to reinvest that capital in newer properties  that we think will provide considerably better long term returns  We were particularly successful at doing this in 2019  We have reallocated  1 1 billion of capital from assets that were on average 35 years old  the assets that were on average two years old and incurred no cap rate dilution in doing so  We think owning these newer higher growth assets will benefit our NFFO growth  and because we expect much lower capital spending at these newer assets  the level of our capitalized expenditures  which is already much lower as a percentage of revenues  compared to most of our peers  should be lower and our unlevered IRRs higher going forward The fourth quarter was a microcosm of this  as we sold two older suburban Washington DC assets that averaged 41 years old for total proceeds of  374 million at a 4 8  cap rate and acquired  370 million in newer assets  one in Central Seattle  one in suburban Seattle and one in suburban Washington DC  that were on average one year old at 4 8  cap rate We also acquired more than we sold in 2019  and have guided for the same outcome in 2020  While cap rates and IRRs are certainly lower than historical averages  so is our cost of capital  The spread between the unlevered IRR we can achieve on new deals we see for sale versus our weighted average cost of capital is relatively high  We intend to finance this increase in our assets with a combination of new debt and net cash flow  our strong balance sheet gives us ample capacity to do so  but as always  we ll be prudent in managing our balance sheet Switching to new development  the equity capital availability story since early 2019 has somewhat improved for large established developers  while smaller local and regional developers continue to work hard to put their equity capital stacks together  We have been pursuing a few of these opportunities with smaller developers as joint ventures and believe that investing our capital in shovel ready deals with sound deal structures that provide some protection to our capital is a good way to source new properties  while managing the risk inherent in development  You should expect us to announce new joint venture development activity in 2020  as well as new wholly owned development deals including some lucrative density plays  where we are taking down a low density portion of an existing property and replacing it with higher density housing We expect 2020 development starts at  500 million   650 million depending on construction timing and development spending in 2020 of about  300 million  We continue to believe that development makes sense in selective locations in our markets  where acquiring new properties is difficult or where existing properties trade materially over replacement cost  We have no imperative to start a certain amount of development per year and we ll always compare development opportunities to the market to acquire existing assets and look for the best risk adjusted return opportunity for our capital  We will also seek to keep the amount of capital we expect to spend on development in any one year  roughly equal to our annual net cash flow and expected new debt capacity Finally  let me finish by talking about our dividend  we believe one good way to use our growing cash flow to reward our shareholders  In 2020  we plan to increase our common share dividend by 6 2  Now  I ll hand the call over to Michael Manelis Michael L  Manelis    Executive Vice President Chief Operating OfficerThanks  Mark  So today  I m going to provide a quick recap of 2019 performance  share insights into our 2020 same store revenue guidance  discuss what we are seeing today across our markets and end with updates on our current operating initiatives Let me start by acknowledging the dedication and hard work of our employees in 2019  For the full year  we reported 3 2  same store revenue growth  Highlights for the year include 96 4  occupancy  which was 20 basis points higher than 2018  every market except for San Francisco was able to grow occupancy on a year over year basis  Strong achieved renewal rate increases of 4 9  for the year  which was the same as 2018  Turnover declined by nearly 200 basis points to 49 5  for the year  which is the lowest full year reported turnover in the history of our company Strong absorption of elevated supply in many of our markets delivered slightly more pricing power than we originally expected at the beginning of 2019 and resulted in 0 3  new lease change for the year  which was a 50 basis point improvement from 2018 And finally  in addition to the areas just mentioned  the company continued its trend of record breaking customer satisfaction and online reputation scores  This strong positive feedback from our customer and the progress being made on innovation we shared in the release demonstrates that we have some of the best employees in the industry  who are passionate about meeting the ever changing needs of our prospects and residents  Looking back  it is clear that the fourth quarter of 2019 reflected a return to seasonal softness  which in some markets was greater than expected  And this was very different than the upward acceleration felt in the fourth quarter of 2018  The good news is that the portfolio demonstrated resilience and we are starting 2020 well positioned to achieve our revenue expectation Moving into 2020  our same store revenue growth guidance range is between 2 3  and 3 3   at the midpoint of 2 8   we are 40 basis points lower than our 2019 actual results  This guidance assumes a similar occupancy of 96 4   an improvement in New Lease Change of 30 basis points to a positive 0 6  for the year  and anticipated renewal rates achieved of 4 7   which is 20 basis points less than 2019  Recall that these renewal rates will be impacted by recent rent regulations that we have discussed on prior calls In 2020  supply will be down considerably in New York  up in Boston and LA and mostly comparable in our other markets year over year  We expect consistent demand that should aid in the absorption of this new supply  High market  New York  DC and Seattle are expected to deliver better revenue growth this year  while Boston  San Francisco and Southern California markets will be worse So let me take a minute to reconcile the 40 basis point decline at the midpoint in the expected same store revenue growth for 2020  As stated on our last call  rent control in both the California and New York markets is expected to negatively impact our overall same store revenue results by approximately 20 basis points this year  The remaining 20 basis point comes mostly from the incremental impact from competitive supply in our markets and a view that it will be difficult in 2020 to replicate the occupancy gains we had in 2019  given the current high occupancy of the portfolio Attaining the upper end of our guidance range of 3 3  will be mostly dependent on rate  meaning that in order to achieve this outcome  we will need to have strong pricing power on new leases early in the year and through the peak leasing view  The bottom end of our revenue guidance range of 2 3  would likely result from declines in occupancy due to softening in overall demand  Sitting here today  the portfolio is 96 3  occupied  the same as what it was at this time last year  Achieved renewal increases for January and February are expected to be around 4 2  So now let s move on to the individual markets beginning with Boston  So Boston continues to be a power center of the knowledge economy  overall demand drivers are strong and the long term outlook for this market remains positive  Our 2019 results of 4  revenue growth includes gains in occupancy of 30 basis points and strong growth from other income mainly parking that will be difficult to repeat this year  Boston is expected to deliver more units as we are tracking close to 6 000 new units in 2020  compared to 1 700 in 2019  These new units will be concentrated in the CBD and Seaport and are likely to have more of a direct impact on our portfolio performance Our expectations for the market is about 3  revenue growth and assumes occupancy remains flat at 96 2   We anticipate less growth from renewals and new leases  given the increased levels of competitive new supply and we expect the first half of the year performance to be stronger than the second half  given the strong embedded growth that we have entering the year  New York had a busy year end with plenty of press surrounding growing tech expansion in the market and significant office leasing  This activity is fueling continued diversification of the local economy  which we view is a long term positive As 2019 progressed  operating fundamentals continued to improve in this market  We finished the fourth quarter with seasonal softness that resulted in a concessionary environment that was greater than we expected  However  during the month of January  operating fundamentals have improved each consecutive week reducing concession use and improving occupants For 2020  we are forecasting better revenue growth  which should be a little north of 2 5   Our guidance assumes slight improvements in occupancy and renewal rates achieved  but the majority of growth is expected to come from gains and new leases as pricing power returns to the market  given the almost complete lack of new supply that Mark mentioned earlier  Overall demand for our product remain strong with foot traffic or tours in January being up year over year  The portfolio is 96 7  occupied today and we are well positioned to seize improving market conditions Washington DC continue to demonstrate strength in operating performance  despite the 12 000 plus deliveries that we have become accustomed to in this market  Last year at this time  we were discussing the longest government shutdown on record  But today both Congress and the President have signed a spending bill  which includes over  50 billion of new spending  This budget clarity and increased spending is expected to positively impact the region and continue to aid the absorption of 12 000 plus additional units expected in 2020  Northern Virginia continues to be the economic driver for the region  having captured seven out of every 10 jobs created in the last 12 months in the area Our portfolio results in DC validate this  as same store revenue growth in the District  which was near 1   while the Northern Virginia sub markets with approximately 50  of our revenue averaged above 3  growth in the year  Overall  the market delivered 2 3  revenue growth in 2019  Our forecast for 2020 is a little better than 2 5  revenue growth  with improved results  mostly driven by stronger embedded growth starting the year as operating assumptions for occupancy  new lease change  and achieve renewal increases are expected to be relatively flat year over year Moving over to the West Coast  Seattle finished 2019 strong  with 3 4  full year revenue growth driven by 70 basis point gain in occupancy and consistent improvement in pricing power and revenue results throughout the year  We did experience concentrated supply pressure on the east side that we expect to continue into the first half of this year  Supply in the CBD  which was not particularly impactful in 2019 will return in 2020 during the back half of the year  This provides an opportunity to establish rate growth early in the year and through the peak leasing season  It s also possible that some of these units get pushed into 2021  If this were to happen  it could strengthen our anticipated results this year Overall  we expect 2020 to deliver better revenue growth of around 4   with similar occupancy  slight improvements to achieve renewal rates  and the majority of growth coming from gains and new leases as we capitalize on the current and near term pricing power in the portfolio San Francisco delivered 3 7  revenue growth in 2019  which was driven by gains made early in the year offset by declining occupancy in the second half of the year that resulted in a full year occupancy of 95 9   As we discussed on the last call  we felt deceleration in this market as the year progressed and that trend continued through the fourth quarter  The East Bay with approximately 40  of our 2019 new supply and approximately 20  of our San Francisco revenue was our lowest performing sub market in both the quarter and full year  with revenue growth below 2   All of our other sub markets produced growth above 3  for both the quarter and full year  New supply in 2020 will be relatively flat year over year  with the concentration of competitive supply impacting the downtown San Francisco SoMa and South Bay sub markets the most Overall  we expect 2020 to have lower revenue growth of around 3   as we continue to work through the impact of supply and the impact of new rent regulation  Our guidance begins with around 50 basis points of lower embedded growth than last year  occupancy at 96 4   which is a 50 basis point improvement over 2019  similar new lease change in the decline and achieved renewal increase  As we sit here today  leasing velocity in San Francisco is good  Rates are growing  foot traffic is up and occupancy has recovered to 96 4   which is the same place we were at last year at this time This market has the critical mass of tech talent and while we expect some softness when supply is concentrated around us  the long term drivers for this market remain very strong  Los Angeles finished the year with 3 7  revenue growth  which was driven by a strong performance in the first half of the year  As noted on our prior call  deceleration occurred in the second half of the year  as deliveries came online and put pricing pressure on a number of our core sub market For 2020  we expect Los Angeles to be our most challenged market as we continue to deal with the elevated new supply  implementations of new rent regulation and restrictions on short term lease pricing  put in place as a result of the wildfires  We expect to deliver lower same store revenue growth in 2020 of around 2 5   with slightly lower occupancy  modest gains in new lease change that are back half loaded  and a decline in achieved renewal rate growth As we sit here today  we are 96 2  occupied in LA and while our foot traffic is on par with last year  we feel pricing pressure  One of the bright spots continues to be West LA  which is home to the changing dynamics of Los Angeles  as Silicon Beach flourishes and online media content takes hold in the entertainment sector  leading to good absorption of the new product in this sub market Our other Southern California markets  both Orange County and San Diego are expected to deliver strong  but lower same store revenue growth in 2020  averaging around 3  with similar occupancy  slight gains in new lease change that are back half loaded  given the anticipated pricing pressure early in the year and a decline in overall renewal rate growth based on the impact of new rent regulation  In both Irvine and downtown San Diego  we expect to feel the impacts from new supply delivered in areas that will be very competitive to our community  With both markets sitting at 97  occupancy  we are well positioned heading into a competitive environment Moving on to operating initiatives  as you know we have long been focused on running a best in class operating platform  which included development of some of the original  pricing  renewal and online leasing tool widely used in the business today  As our industry undergoes another phase of significant change  we continue to identify opportunities to utilize new technology that will shape how we interact with our customers and manage our day to day operations going forward  Our focus is to harvest technology that best serves our customers  provides enhanced career opportunities for our employees  and creates efficiencies in our platform We are currently in the process of executing a number of initiatives that fall into three primary areas  Smart Home technology  sales focused improvement  and service enhancement  And while there are many opportunities in the industry to rollout new system  we are taking a methodical approach to implement only the tools and processes that we believe will create the best long term benefit and value in our portfolio So let s review some of the initiatives in these three areas  So first  Smart Home technology  we have already installed over 2 100 units and thus far have had success in generating a rent premium of  30 per month on these units  During 2020  we plan to install smart home technology in an additional 10 000 apartment units at an average cost of approximately  1 000 per unit  We are focusing on properties where we think this technology will yield the greatest immediate results  This technology includes smart lock  a thermostat  a light switch  water leak sensors and a hub that connects it all Moving to sales  Our focus continues to be on improving the customer experience by leveraging technology  automation and centralization to meet their ever changing needs  We currently have deployed Ella  our AI enabled sales tool to over 200 communities and we will be fully deployed by the end of March  We have over 60 communities offering self guided tours and have been receiving very positive feedback from both our customers and our employees on this new process  During 2020  we will continue to rollout the self guided tour option to the majority of our communities and we will be deploying a new mobile customer relationship management platform to improve efficiencies in the sales process and provide flexibility to our sales team Finally  on the service side of the business  we are now fully deployed on our new mobile service platform  which means our service teams now use a mobile app to manage all of their work in real time  This allows us to use shared resources across assets and improve service personnel utilization by having specialists become focused on being subject matter experts  This will deliver operating expense savings through less dependence on over time and contractor use  as well as improves the customer experience to real time notification and resolution of maintenance requests Overall  the impact of these initiatives are expected to deliver approximately  15 million in annual NOI contribution once fully deployed  it will take into 2021 to fully realize that contribution  but we have included approximately  5 million of net NOI benefits in our 2020 guidance  We believe these early stage initiatives will provide a foundation upon which to continue to build our platform Thank you  I will now turn the call over to Bob Garechana  our Chief Financial Officer Robert A  Garechana    Executive Vice President Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Michael  This morning  I ll discuss our 2020 guidance assumptions for same store expenses and normalized FFO along with a couple of brief remarks on our balance sheet and capital markets activity First  a couple of quick highlight on 2019  Our same store revenue grew 3 2   expenses grew 3 7  and NOI grew 3   which was mostly in line with our expectations from the third quarter call  For normalized FFO  we delivered  0 91 per share in the quarter  which is  0 03 higher than the midpoint of our expectations  This outperformance was primarily driven by higher than anticipated NOI from higher than expected acquisition activity during the quarter  lower than anticipated overhead stemming from lower than expected employee benefit costs  that also impacted same store payroll expenses described on Page 16 of the release  and better than forecasted interest expense Michael provided color on 2019 same store revenues  So  let me briefly touch upon 2019 same store expenses  Full year same store expenses grew 3 7  in 2019  compared to our forecast of 3 8   Notably  real estate taxes ended the year higher than anticipated at 4 3  as we had fewer successful appeals conclude during the fourth quarter than we had expected  This was offset by lower anticipated payroll expense  which grew only 80 basis points for the full year  This outperformance was due to the significant improvements in employee benefit costs like the ones impacting overhead that I just discussed Now moving to 2020 guidance  For the full year 2020  we expect same store expense growth between 3  and 4   This forecast incorporates the anticipated 2020 savings from the initiatives that Michael outlined earlier  Let me walk you through the major categories and drivers of our forecasted growth  At a little over 40  of overall same store expenses  property taxes driving significant portion of expense growth  We currently anticipate growth between 3 75  and 4 75   driven by the continued burnout of the 421A tax abatements in some of our New York properties  a slight decline in forecasted year over year appealed activity and a relatively healthy increase anticipated in Seattle For the full year 2019  same store property taxes declined in Seattle  as the state legislature took on more of the educational funding burden from local municipality  We have not incorporated this recurring in 2020 for our guidance  In on site payroll  our next largest category  we anticipate growth between 2 25  and 3 25  for 2020 This expense really consists of two key drivers  direct salary bonus and commissions for our on site staff  and the employee benefit costs like medical insurance  We expect to see a benefit in this first driver from the operating efficiencies that Michael and his team are working on  This will mute total payroll growth for the year  As a result  nearly all of the 2 75  expected growth in payroll is coming from anticipated increases in medical insurance and other employee benefits Finally our last two major categories  utilities and repairs and maintenance  Each of these line items individually contributes about 13  to total expense  each of those are expected to grow between 2 5  and 3 5  in 2020  Drivers of utility growth are expected to remain the same in 2020 as they were in 2019  While we continue to benefit from relatively low commodity prices and efficient usage  given our sustainability investments  we see price pressure in the service related categories like trash and sewer  particularly on the West Coast  which we expect to continue On repairs and maintenance  we expect to see another relatively modest growth year  This line item has seen significant pressure from increases in minimum wages across nearly all the states we operate in  driving up costs for contract labor  However  improvements in the utilization of our workforce stemming from service mobility and other initiatives Michael discussed are offsetting this growth  Our guidance range for normalized FFO in 2020 is  3 59 per share to  3 69 per share Major drivers for the change between our 2019 normalized FFO of  3 49 per share and the mid point of  3 54 from our 2020 guidance include an  0 11 contribution from same store NOI and our same store properties based on the revenue and expense assumptions that Michael and I just outlined  A  0 01 year over year contribution from lease up NOI with our lease up properties generating  10 million in NOI for 2020  a  0 07 contribution from lower anticipated interest expense  predominantly driven by the favorable refinancing activity we undertook in 2019 that I ll discuss in a moment  offset by  0 01 per share related to higher anticipated overhead  which we define as G A and property management expense  and finally  an additional  0 03 offset related to other items net  which mostly consists of other individually immaterial items like interest and other income A final note on the balance sheet  Our financial position remains the strongest in the company s history and one of the strongest in the REIT industry  2019 with a busy year on the balance sheet front  having issued nearly  1 5 billion in debt  including the lowest yield in 10 year unsecured bond in REIT s history Upsized and extended our revolving credit facility with incredible support from our banking partners and with market leading terms and finally increased the size of our commercial paper program to  1 billion  We also paid off approximately  1 8 billion in debt during the year  including the early redemption of the 2020 maturity described in last night s release  These favorable financing activities are the drivers in year over year interest savings I discussed earlier For 2020  we anticipate issuing between  600 million and  1 billion in debt capital  terming out debt that is currently on our commercial paper program or revolving line of credit  These outstandings are mostly the result of our net investment activity in 2019  and our early retirement of 2020 maturity  We have very manageable development spend that we would anticipate being funded from free cash flow With that  I ll turn it back to the operator for the Q A Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America Jeff Spector    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGood morning  congratulations on a great  19  just one or two questions on 2020 comments  Can you talk about the latest concession environment  I guess  in markets like San Francisco or other markets where you described some heavier supply in the first half of the year  because I m trying to connect  I heard a comment that the first half should be better than the second half  but I didn t know if that was just in general  but it seems like at the same time  there were some comments that supply is currently pressuring where there is some heavy supply pressure in select markets in the first half Michael L  Manelis    Executive Vice President Chief Operating OfficerYes  Sure  Jeff  Good morning  this is Michael  So I guess first I d just say  at the top of the house  So concessions for us in our portfolio  we tend to be more of a net effective shop  So even though I described that concessionary environment did cause us to use a little bit more concessions than we expected  on the quarter  we were talking about  500 000 to  600 000 in total concession used across the portfolio with the large majority of that kind of still centered in the New York market  So I think when we think about markets like San Francisco or anywhere that we have this concentration of new supply  we expect to see concessions in the new supply  typically offering between    anywhere between four weeks and six weeks and we monitor those concessions that they were offering in the marketplace as an indicator of their own velocity So when we see concessions on new supply in San Francisco start ticking up to eight weeks or they start going longer  that s an indication that overall the velocity is kind of fueling some pressure and that s what we re  kind of    we re responding too in the fourth quarter  As I think about the first half of the year  what we ve seen is a lot of the concessions that we saw in pockets of New York and some pockets of San Francisco on the East Bay start to abate  meaning it s still present at those lease up properties  But the stabilized assets around them are starting to use less and less concession and I ve seen this now for the last four weeks  we ve been monitoring this as we progress through 2020 So I think what you re going to see as demand continues to grow throughout the year like it normally does in the seasonal year  you should expect to see less and less concession  In our portfolio for the full year  we would expect concession use to be very comparable to 2019  And I think just given what we just saw in fourth quarter  probably we ll be more front half loaded than back half loaded Jeff Spector    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  great  that s helpful  sounds like some positive news on the concessions at least so far this year  Can we talk    you talked about strength in foot traffic  demand remained strong  can you talk a little bit more about move outs and anything new move outs to home buying Michael L  Manelis    Executive Vice President Chief Operating OfficerSure  So I would just  I guess I would say with turnover being down almost 200 basis points for the year  the absolute number of move outs is less than a year over year basis  but when you start to look at those that did move out and the reasons they site to move out  we really saw no change across our    across any of the reasons  Homebuying runs roughly about 12 5  of the reasons cited for those people that are moving out to buy homes and we saw no change across any of the markets that we re operating in Jeff Spector    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  great  thanks  Because we noticed that some of the homebuilders have cited success with the entry level homes and just confirm if you re seeing any change  It sounds like not  Great  thanks for your comments today Michael L  Manelis    Executive Vice President Chief Operating OfficerThank you Operator Operating Instructions  Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citigroup Nick Joseph    Citigroup    AnalystThanks  How does the  5 million net benefit the same store NOI in 2020 from the operating initiatives break down between the revenue benefit in the expense savings  And then what s the impact on both same store growth rates this year Michael L  Manelis    Executive Vice President Chief Operating OfficerSo I guess I would say it s about probably a 50 50 split  When you look at the  5 million between revenue and expense  and on the revenue side  it s probably going to equate to roughly 10 basis points of improvement across the various markets that we re doing those operating initiatives in there Nick Joseph    Citigroup    AnalystThanks  then Mark  you talked about the cap rate compression between older and younger assets  what percentage of your portfolio or GAV would you consider older and that you could ultimately trade for newer assets if the opportunity exists Mark J  Parrell    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  thanks for that question  We don t have any more in the portfolio a lot of must sell if any must sell assets are some of the older assets or some of our best assets in places like New York and Boston  So it is an always age  but I did use that in my remarks as an indicator of quality to some extent  I don t think there is a grand reservoir we have of capital  There are few assets in every market when you have a  40 billion portfolio that have become less competitive and we ll look to sell those  especially when cap rates of this close between value add and brand new product  we ll look to trade out to the new product  So I don t have exact percentage  but it s a low single digit sort of number and then it s    for us it s just opportunistic when we see cap rates like this so close together  we re going to take advantage Nick Joseph    Citigroup    AnalystMakes sense  Thank you Mark J  Parrell    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank Nick Yulico    Scotiabank    AnalystThanks  So just going back to the guidance  I appreciate all the building blocks you gave on to explain why there is a modest slowdown in same store revenue growth  I think you said you re assuming better new lease pricing and stable occupancy  So to me that seems like a kind of bullish indicator for the business that would suggest you guys could even push pricing  even more  So I guess what I m wondering is  are you just being conservative in how you re forecasting your pricing this year  Or is there something else that s creating this dynamic that s not allowing you to push pricing even more Michael L  Manelis    Executive Vice President Chief Operating OfficerWell  I guess  this is Michael  So I guess I would just start by saying I think the 30 basis point expectation in growth in new lease change is demonstrating that we experiencing    or we expect to experience growth  It s really just coming off of the deceleration in the back half of  19  and the fact that now we re expecting kind of to recover and looking at where the supply is on  as we think some of that recovery is going to be more back half loaded  So I think when you think about our guidance  you got to look at the full range that we have out there and understand that Sure  In markets like New York  if we continue to see pricing power return to us quickly and in front of the leasing season  we ll outperform that expectation  but I don t think it s prudent for us to sit here and think about all of the markets with all of the supply that we have coming on us to think that we re going to outperform those expectations early in the year Nick Yulico    Scotiabank    AnalystOkay  that s helpful  I guess just following up on that  I mean  if I look at the track record of the company in the last three years  you gave initial guidance on the same store revenue that you ended up hitting pretty much close to the top end for three years in a row  And so I guess  I m wondering is what dynamic is different this year as we think about the starting point versus prior years  I think last year  you got    you and a lot of the industry got an occupancy benefit  This year  it sounds like it s more of a better pricing dynamic and I guess I m just wondering what s    is one more difficult than the other to achieve Mark J  Parrell    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  Nick  It s Mark  Each year  it s kind of a different year and stands alone  I mean our process this year in  20 wasn t very different than  19 or  18  We ask the field for specific feedback and what they see maybe there is a lease up right next door or they you have renovations in the property  and get a little little boost there  We also look at the top and think about macroeconomic conditions  as Michael said this year  Again  we feel well positioned going into the year  We worry about the supply  particularly in some of our bigger markets  We did see some weakness as we ve said in New York late in 2019  So that positions us where we ended up going out with guidance  Could we do better  We certainly hope so  but looking at it  we try to balance things out and don t assume that everything will go perfectly well Nick Yulico    Scotiabank    AnalystAll right  Thanks  Mark Mark J  Parrell    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Nick OperatorOur next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors John Pawlowski    Green Street Advisors    AnalystThank you  Maybe just a quick follow up to the first question  Michael  did I hear it right that concessions in the Bay Area on lease ups pushed to eight weeks free in the fourth quarter  I m curious  if it gotten any better or worse in January Michael L  Manelis    Executive Vice President Chief Operating OfficerYes  So  I mean  I think they ve stayed pretty consistent and stable  When I say weeks that s on longer term leases  so we saw them  kind of  move around with the four to six  on just conventional terms and then they started offering some longer terms and kind of  we re just monitoring that  I mean primarily now you ve got Oakland  where you ve got more assets coming online  So it s a great kind of pocket of assets for us to watch the concessionary environment and it s been fairly stable  They have not been volatile on what they ve been doing  but they clearly started going long and offering a little bit higher concession rate for those longer term leases and that s what we ve been watching John Pawlowski    Green Street Advisors    AnalystOkay  And then turning to New York  curious from your lens how the kind of organic operating backdrop is going to be different these next few years after the rent control package was implemented or the rent control laws changed and curious if you re seeing anything right now in terms of market turnover  your game plan on marketing expenses  kind of  vacancy and any early indicators that could play out in the next two or three years in New York that you re seeing happen today Mark J  Parrell    President and Chief Executive OfficerHey  John  Before I let Michael launch into giving you that detail  which is very important  I think that overall comment about New York and what we ve all read about just increased demand that s coming  all of these tech relocations into New York  particularly the west side of New York  where we have a lot assets is very encouraging us  Now when they announced something  it doesn t happen right that moment that they hire  but we see that and in fact our research is indicating  research we ve seen is indicating there is actually more tech jobs in the New York metro areas than there is in the Bay Area now  So we re excited to be involved in that  And again  you re right  we have to adjust to these rules  But the overall demand drivers in New York  the next few years is really good to us Michael L  Manelis    Executive Vice President Chief Operating OfficerYes  and I d say right now  we have not noticed any material changes from this  looking at the rent stay properties versus kind of the market rate units  our market rate building  So we re not seeing any differentiation on turnover  we re not seeing kind of from an operation standpoint anything yet that is manifested itself where we re going to be running those buildings differently Mark J  Parrell    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  and I was suggesting  John  I think on prior calls and our meetings that we thought turnover might start to decline in New York  because with lower renewal increases there ll be more reason for people to stay  Obviously  we only have a couple of quarter sample size  we really haven t seen that yet  we re looking more carefully at our capital spending in New York  But we have a high end clientele  so continue to maintain those assets well  So  I don t have anything to add there in terms of  again  it seems to us intuitive that turnover should get even lower  And the term of our residents should get even longer  but we haven t quite seen that yet John Pawlowski    Green Street Advisors    AnalystOkay  thank you OperatorOur next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI Steve Sakwa    Evercore ISI    AnalystThanks  I guess two questions  When you sort of think about New York  how does sort of the Jersey  kind of  Gold Coast play into sort of your outlook in terms of the rent growth that you ve got in that part of the region versus maybe the city Mark J  Parrell    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I mean for  19 it was pretty comparable  right  When you just think about the various sub markets between Manhattan  Brooklyn  as well as the Hudson Waterfront and I think going forward  we would expect  kind of  hopefully start to see pricing power return to Manhattan and see some market rate growth that could accelerate that beyond what we re going to see kind of from the Hudson waterfront  But right now  they re pretty packed  like really close together from a result standpoint in our expectations  But I think you will see Manhattan start to differentiate itself over time Steve Sakwa    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  And I guess second question maybe Mark  if you think about new development  it looked like you were able to buy some relatively new assets and call it up at the high fours and you re thinking about some new development starts  Where are those yields on the new starts and how is that spread contracted and how narrow would it need to be for you sort of not to pursue new developments Mark J  Parrell    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  it s a great question  So we are just constantly  Steve comparing  because we are not committed to being either a developer or an acquirer  we can do either or both  Then we constantly compare the two to see if it s sort of on a risk adjusted basis you d rather just buy the assets  Even if it s at a slight premium to replacement cost  because there is fair amount of risk in development  As we look at our development pipe now  you heard me say we re going to refill it  Some of those are special events  like we own the land already  then we have an apartment building on it  we re doing the density play  And so those sorts of things especially because on a GAAP basis  you have very low basis in the land  You bought it many years ago  those returns look great and even when you market to market they look really good So I d tell you  in some cases for us  we re building all the way down the yields in the middle fours  there s a tower  we re thinking of building on the West Coast  that s more in that range  and our thought processes is  it s just terrific product  we like the per unit cost  We like the location and because we re not a merchant builder  where we have to hit the cycle perfect  And if we don t hit it when we get to CFO in a year or two  we can get pushed out of the deal and then we can kind of build for the long run So I think I d tell you  I don t worry about spreads  all together  I worry about just are we getting the right location  Do we have exposure in that sub market  Can I buy in that sub market  Those sorts of things  And then do I like the per pound kind of cost and how are we funding it Steve Sakwa    Evercore ISI    AnalystWell  maybe there would be a little more specific on that  I think you said you were going to start a couple of hundred million dollars in 2020 Mark J  Parrell    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  So we ve got about 500 or 600 maybe 650 will start Steve  And so I would say when you talk about these JV deals that we ve spoken about  those deals tend to have yields around 5  on current rents  So current construction costs and current rents The tower I m talking about is  call it a 4 6  yield on current and again  we re still in the underwriting process  so that may change a little bit  But we feel  again that we like the location and we like how that feels  And then you ve got a few of these other density plays that we re doing that I would say on your mark the land to market  feel like 5  plays or so on current rents  so that gives you a general feel Steve Sakwa    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  Great  thanks Mark J  Parrell    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley Richard Hill    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHey guys  thanks for taking my call  Quick question  look    resonates with me about maybe occupancy being stable  and so I think that new and renewal leases and disclosure that you gave on leasing pricing statistics are increasingly important in 2020  So I m wondering  if you can maybe give us a little bit of color do you    as revenue growth maybe decelerates a little bit  compared to last year  Do you think that s equally from new and renewal leases  Are you seeing more strength in newer and renewal leases or vice versa Mark J  Parrell    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I guess I d say we gave the top level guidance that would suggest that renewals are going to grow 20 basis points lower than just down to  4 7 million versus the  4 9 million and we re improving new lease change in the overall guidance  So  it s our expectation that you re going to continue to see this kind of convergence between new lease rates and renewals  So our expectation is  we should start to demonstrate better new lease rate growth and kind of take the impact on the renewal  mostly from the rent regulation Richard Hill    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  Understood  That s helpful  And look  you know  still 4Q  19 seemed weak  well it relative to the other quarters  you obviously noted that  that was a return to seasonality  We had also heard some color that  that was a broad trend  Do you expect 4Q is going forward to be equally as weak or what  I guess what really drove that weakness  compared to the strength that you saw in  18 Mark J  Parrell    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I guess  I don t know if I would say this  we got to look back almost like at 2017  we ve gone back over multiple years to understand just rent seasonality  demand seasonality  And really what we saw in  19 is a kind of just return back to the norm and  18 was the anomaly where you just had that strengthening of demand in that kind of later part of the year that allowed you to accelerate  when otherwise you won t expect to  So I think embedded in our normal guidance process right now for  19 is normal seasonal declines in the fourth quarter of    for  20 normal seasonal declines for that quarter Richard Hill    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  Okay  that s helpful  guys  That s it from me OperatorOur next question comes from Hardik Goel with Zelman   Associates Hardik Goel    Zelman   Associates    AnalystHey guys  thanks for taking my question today  Bob  if you could talk about a little bit  that the expense guidance  you know  how those ranges work  And maybe talk about the big components like real estate taxes  and what you guys are underwriting in your guidance for that Robert A  Garechana    Executive Vice President Chief Financial OfficerYes  So I mentioned in my prepared remarks there s really four large categories and real estate taxes is by far the largest  So that s at 40   At the moment we re expecting 3 75  growth to 4 75  growth  so very similar year at the midpoint relative to 2019  The drivers of that continue to be a lot of the same conversation  So that s the 421A tax abatement growth that we re experiencing in New York  But also what s unique in 2020 relative to 2019 and you ve heard other companies talk about this in 2019  is that we saw a good meaningful benefit in Seattle  wherein in Seattle absolute real estate tax growth was actually negative in  19  and we re not expecting that or forecasting that to be the case in  20 On payroll  it s    which is the next largest category  it s 2 25  to 3 25   I talked in the prepared remarks about some of the drivers there  It really is mostly the medical benefit piece  The initiatives that Michael is putting in place is really helping us curtail some of that salary growth that we would otherwise have expected  And then finally on the third piece  which is really    or the third and fourth piece  which is utilities and repairs and maintenance we re expecting normal growth 2 5  to 3 5  Hardik Goel    Zelman   Associates    AnalystGot it  And just one quick follow up  If you could share  kind of  the blended rent growth you re getting in early in the first quarter relative to last year that would be really helpful Robert A  Garechana    Executive Vice President Chief Financial OfficerSo I don t have that  I have for the renewals that we re  kind of  expecting to be around 4 2   I d tell you from a new lease change standpoint  we kind of wait until the quarter end is to really look at that  But I    just based on where rents are moving each and every week in our asking rents  I could tell that we re seeing improvement in those stats as well Hardik Goel    Zelman   Associates    AnalystWell  I guess  how about just January over January the new lease rate  because I know you mentioned every week was improving  So I m just trying to get a sense for how much the improvement is Robert A  Garechana    Executive Vice President Chief Financial OfficerSure  Just from a base rent or amenitized rent standpoint  our rents today are  up 2 5  over the exact same time    exact same week last year  And they ve been improving each and every week Hardik Goel    Zelman   Associates    AnalystThat s great Robert A  Garechana    Executive Vice President Chief Financial OfficerYes Hardik Goel    Zelman   Associates    AnalystThank you  That s really helpful Robert A  Garechana    Executive Vice President Chief Financial OfficerOkay OperatorOur next question comes from Haendel St  Juste with Mizuho Haendel St  Juste    Mizuho Securities    AnalystHey  good morning  So  I guess  the call wouldn t be complete if there weren t any questions on the regulatory environment  So I guess I could help on that front  My question specifically is on SB 50  the California law that would allow for denser apartment buildup around public transportation areas in the state  I guess  I m curious first of all  if you expect that to be ratified on January 31st  And if so how might that impact your viewer plans for California development Mark J  Parrell    President and Chief Executive OfficerHey  Haendel  it s Mark  Thanks for continuing the tradition  We appreciate that  Comment on SB 50  I think you described it pretty accurately  We re not sure of its prospects  We certainly are a big supporters of it both the company and the industry  I think having additional density near transit hubs and having that state mandate it is a good idea  I know the sponsor that measures made some changes to try and get support And having talked just recently to our experts on this  I could tell you we hope it passes  We aren t sure it will get through the state House  And we re sort of waiting to see what will happen in the next few days as you said  but certainly think it s a good idea  We don t think it will add to the road traffic much by putting it near transit hubs  And if you want to make an impact  and you want to have 3 million or 3 5 million more housing units in New York as a lot of policymakers have said in that state  you need to start somewhere and starting with putting more density near transit hubs is a good idea Haendel St  Juste    Mizuho Securities    AnalystI appreciate that  Thank you Robert A  Garechana    Executive Vice President Chief Financial OfficerThank you Haendel St  Juste    Mizuho Securities    AnalystOne more  I appreciate the comments earlier on your portfolio recycling plans selling older and buying younger  But curious perhaps where you re looking to add and I know it might be a bit unfair on you  but just curious about the opportunity set in front of you and how much of the volume that you re contemplating this year that could come from new markets  You talked about perhaps Austin a quarter or so ago  And then maybe some comments on how the underwriting in some of those newer non coastal markets would compare from an initial cap rate and IRR perspective versus your coastal markets  Thanks Robert A  Garechana    Executive Vice President Chief Financial OfficerAll right  A lot of questions bundled up into there  But    so our average age of our assets is about 18 years old  So the portfolio is relatively young  and then again there is some SKU in some of our markets like Boston  New York where we own some great assets  but they re older properties  So I would    like I said to the prior question say there s always a handful of assets that probably should be sold and we do have a handful of those  And especially when you get the opportunity to do that in a non diluted basis  you should do that  And we hit the gas on that and we hope to do more of the same Based on what we heard coming out of National Multi Housing conference last week  there seems to be a lot of demand  Some of the deals we re talking about are deals where the buyer may have a value add thought process so we ll push that  In terms of just moving capital around a little  which I ll take as the middle part of your question we ve talked in prior calls about having a little bit less exposure in Washington DC  maybe shifting some of that capital to Denver  That s really a reaction to what has been consistent high levels of supply in Washington DC That said  we re both a buyer and developer in that market and have announced both in 2019 and expect to do the same next year  We ll keep freshening up the portfolio there  But it is an area where we think the supply is pretty continuous  We d like to own more in Boston and Seattle and we ve said that on the call and maybe you ll see us lighten our load a little in California that fund those In terms of new markets  we do like Austin  There has to be an entry point that makes sense  Obviously when you do an investment pro forma  you ll start with your price at the beginning  And the price at the beginning for Austin is quite dear  There are assets that are we understand to be trading inside a four cap rate on current rents  That s pretty tight for us to buy and to a new market  So there s a lot of markets  several markets that we re monitoring And I guess I d say in terms of how the underwriting will differ  well there s probably if you re being really honest some additional property management costs and running an asset away from your main platform  And we often take that into account  And then the rest of it s market specific  how do you feel about cap rates  how do you feel about values  how do you feel about growth rates  We had an advantage with Denver because we knew it so well from being in the market for most of our existence  But these other markets Austin included we were in as well and have a recollection of how that market cycles  So I ll pause there  I don t know if I addressed what you wanted to address Haendel St  Juste    Mizuho Securities    AnalystNo  it s very helpful  But I guess ultimately I m curious what type of IRR spread would you be willing to accept understanding that some of those markets might have in the case of Austin a lower initial yield  but perhaps operating efficiencies  maybe even better growth given some of the overall in migration job growth etc  So just curious how you think about the acceptable IRR spread perhaps versus the coast Mark J  Parrell    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  great question  So in our investor materials  this heat map we ve had for a long time  which tends to be on Page 16 of our materials for some reason every year has all the factors we take into account  I don t know that a market needs to have a higher IRR or a much higher IRR just for us to move into it  Maybe it has other benefits regulatory and diversification benefits for example  So I guess I d say you ve got to underwrite your starting point  And Austin is a pretty expensive starting point And then maybe to your point  you make it up because you think growth there is better than some of your other markets  Then you ve got to think about how is it going to feel in 10 years with the amount of supply in market like that gets  So again  I wish I could be absolutely clear about what that margin needs to be  But there are markets we go into that don t need to do a lot better on an IRR basis  they just need to provide some benefits overall in terms of diversification of risk and their IRRs can be comparable to those in our main markets Haendel St  Juste    Mizuho Securities    AnalystGot it  Got it  All right  Thank you  Mark Mark J  Parrell    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler Alexander Goldfarb    Piper Sandler    AnalystThank you  Thank you  and good morning out there  So just following up from Haendel actually on two fronts  So first Mark  just continuing on the markets  if you look across    I mean a lot of the markets have converged around similar NOIs and similar cap rates  you guys obviously a number of years ago made an effort to focus on certain key gateway markets  And now you re sort of going back and looking at    you invested in Denver  you talked about Austin Do you feel that this convergence that we re seeing is going to sustain where your    the idea to go to the certain gateway coastal markets may not be appropriate for the next decade  Or you think this convergence is just temporary and the markets ultimately will go back to the ones that you guys have really focused on over the past number of years Mark J  Parrell    President and Chief Executive OfficerI guess that is just an outstanding question and something we think can talk about a lot  You should always be thoughtful about your markets  while you were there before  while you re there now  So I appreciate the question  I think one of the things we think about is you ve got such a wall of money going into the apartment industry is it distorting perceptions of returns and risk  Are there markets that are frankly overvalued relative to what they normally and probably should trade for on a go forward basis So we look at the nine metros we re in now and say we like our customer  we like our capex spending  we like in most cycles the supply picture in these markets and nothing there has changed for us  To me  it s more like are there other new markets  where we can find our customer in abundance  someone Alex  who is relatively affluent  renter by choice  who wants to live in an urban dense suburban setting with a lot of walk to amenities  Where we find those people  we will go to them if the competition makes sense  the supply and demand picture makes sense So I guess that s the way I think about it is are there cities that are sort of being promoted into the ranks or the markets in which we do business as opposed to saying all markets are equal  I think some markets are definitively not equal  And what s going on is just the wall of capital is moving cap rates and stuff to a convergence point and I don t necessarily believe that s permanent Alexander Goldfarb    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  And then the next question is on the regulatory front  yes switching coasts here in New York  I m sure you guys have seen the press that Albany wants to go back even tighten the capex restrictions on rent control units even more to talk of a marketwide CPI plus cap  I think I read 1 5  I don t know where  Ultimately they have it  But given what happened lessons learned from 2018  how are you guys thinking about approaching this year s Albany session  which I think expires in    or ends in June Mark J  Parrell    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Well  I think in terms of recent good news the Governor and the State of the State Address didn t mention affordable housing  Our sense from what we ve heard from some of our context is that  many in the legislature would like to see these new rules play out a bit and see what the impact is  before adding even more to it  We d hope that would be the case And obviously it s difficult for us whether you re in New York or you re here in Chicago to predict the action of politicians  But we re working hard through our trade association  I think they ve got real new energy and focus on this issue and having the right kinds of conversations to just educate people  because this is going to do and already is doing the exact opposite of what they intend  it s going to cause disinvestment in housing  less supply and make the city less of the energetic place we all want it to be  And that s just what s going to happen and is happening  And I just would say I think the trade association is even better positioned this year than they were before  But what exactly happens  it remains to be seen Alexander Goldfarb    Piper Sandler    AnalystThanks  Mark Mark J  Parrell    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Alex OperatorOur next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney Rob Stevenson    Janney    AnalystGood morning guys  So turnover was 49 5   I think in  19  What s the expectation for 2020  And how much of the 200 or so basis point decline that you guys talked about earlier what s the benefit to earnings from that given those spread between new and renewal leases Michael L  Manelis    Executive Vice President Chief Operating OfficerSo this is Michael  I ll start by saying I think our expectations for the year is very similar  We re not expecting it to continue to go down  But we don t anticipate  kind of  some reversal in the trend and all of a sudden see a spike in turnover  As far as the contribution goes  clearly if renewals were producing a 49  and you had some subset of your resident    more residents renewing with you that contribution was boosting the revenue lift for the year versus replacing them and absorbing the vacancy  as well as kind of the new lease change at 30 bps  I don t have a quantified number  but I do know that lower turnover at higher renewal rates is a positive Rob Stevenson    Janney    AnalystOkay  And then what s driving the gap between NAREIT and normalized FFO guidance  I think it s like  0 02 Robert A  Garechana    Executive Vice President Chief Financial OfficerYes  So there s    you can kind of see that on Page 30 of the release there s two items that are forecasted  There s  0 01 associated with write off of pursuit costs  And then there s another  0 01 of other miscellaneous items that includes advocacy costs  which we had in historical periods etc  so those are the two main drivers Rob Stevenson    Janney    AnalystOkay  Thanks  guys Robert A  Garechana    Executive Vice President Chief Financial OfficerOkay  Thanks  Thank you OperatorOur next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel John Guinee    Stifel Nicolaus   Co    AnalystJohn Guinee  Thank you  Big picture question  It looks like at the midpoint almost half of your FFO growth is coming from interest savings  0 07 a share  27 million in interest cost reduction  Should this make us nervous  one  And two the end result is you basically are getting about 2 3  FFO growth from everything else while your midpoint of your same store NOI growth is 2 5   which seems a little unusual    that 2 5  same store NOI growth translates to a 2 3  FFO growth ex the interest cost savings  Any thoughts Mark J  Parrell    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  John  I m going to start  it s Mark  What happened in the prior year 2019 influences the numbers in 2020  So in 2019 we acquired things early in the year and we sold late  This year you re going to see    we have a number of assets lined up for disposition that are going to occur relatively early in the year  So even though we re a net buyer and that is going to fuel FFO growth in future years  this year some of that    like the math you re doing is absolutely right  There should be a bigger    your fundamental growth on NOI is in that 2 5  right  Your numbers should be higher on NFFO  but you re getting a little dilution from transactions And I think we pointed that out in the release you re getting a little bit of a headwind from transactions that is going to offset some of that benefit  The interest benefit I ll tell you just    we continue to be able to borrow cheaper  I mean that s all very real  And I m not sure why that s concerning in any regard  I mean the company s balance sheet is really strong and the percentage fixed  the float is sensible and we have great access to all forms of capital  So I m not     0 07 to me is good money and it s something we ve executed on before Michael L  Manelis    Executive Vice President Chief Operating OfficerSo the vast majority of that  0 07 too John just so you know is    so we re not changing the profile of the overall credit metrics  We d expect the credit metrics at the end of 2020 to be very similar to 2019 on kind of all regards  So very healthy very strong  And the bulk of that gain if you will is already locked in by having paid off debt that was in    five handled coupons with new long term debt that s in the 2 5  to 3  range John Guinee    Stifel Nicolaus   Co    AnalystNo  thank you  The obvious issue is that you re benefiting a lot from paying off above market debt and borrowing at market  So my question really is how much longer can that last  Is there still a lot of    debt that on the balance sheet Michael L  Manelis    Executive Vice President Chief Operating OfficerYes  So if you look at Page 18 there    we disclosed for you in each of the maturity buckets what our weighted average coupons are  And you can see in kind of 2021  4 64  as an example  To give you a point of reference  if we were to issue a 10 year unsecured bond today I would expect that to be at 2 5  or lower  So there is still a fair bit of runway going forward  Certainly  a longer runway than we had anticipated a few years ago because we didn t anticipate rates continuing to be this low for this long  but there is still some favorable refinancing opportunities which we ve taken advantage of in the past and we would expect to take advantage of in the future John Guinee    Stifel Nicolaus   Co    AnalystGreat  Thank you very much  Thank you Michael L  Manelis    Executive Vice President Chief Operating OfficerHey  Thanks  John John Guinee    Stifel

157187,378703,EQR,3 Investing Facts About Required Minimum Distributions You Need To Know   January 28  2020,opinion,"If you do not make a required minimum distribution  RMD  from your own or an inherited IRA by the specified deadline  the IRS could hit you with a big penalty   50   For example  if you were required to withdraw a minimum of  4 000 and you did not  you would be obliged to pay  2 000  Plus  beginning January 1  2020  the rules concerning RMDs were updated 
In case you re like most investors  you re probably trying to build a financial portfolio that is solid enough to guarantee a comfortable retirement  Among retirement financial planners  this is known as the  accumulation phase   In this stage  your objective is to carefully invest by selecting stocks with long term potential for your retirement nest egg  For example  you might choose Equity Residential  NYSE EQR   which is a current top ranked dividend stock 
There is also a second phase of retirement planning that gets less focus   despite the fact that it s the more interesting part  It s the  distribution phase   which essentially means spending the wealth you ve worked hard to amass 
Preparing for the distribution stage is where you may settle on choices about where you ll live in retirement  whether you ll wish to travel  interests you may seek after  and different choices that will influence your retirement spending 
Along with those choices  you need to be mindful of the RMD  because it applies to the majority of retirement accounts  This IRS rule requires you to withdraw a specific minimum amount from any qualified accounts you have when you reach a certain age  previously it was 70 1 2  but beginning in 2020  it is 72 
What is the point of this mandatory withdrawal by the IRS  Not surprisingly  it s to be sure that the government gets their tax money  Without the RMD requirement  individuals could live off other income and never pay tax on retirement account gains  That cash could be left to family or friends as an inheritance and the IRS would not receive taxes from it 
Key Facts to Know About RMDs
Which types of retirement accounts have RMDs  Qualified retirement accounts like IRA accounts  401 k s  457 plans and other tax deferred retirement savings plans like a TSP  403 b   TSA  SEP  or SIMPLE IRA plan require withdrawals in retirement 
When do I need to begin withdrawals  For most accounts  you should take your first distribution by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you turn 72  If you retire after 72  you must withdraw your first RMD from your 401 k   profit sharing  403 b   or other defined contribution plan by April 1 of the year following the calendar year that you retire 
For each year after your required starting date  you must take your RMD by December 31  Note that you don t need to take an RMD on a Roth IRA since you covered taxes before contributing  Other varieties of Roth accounts require RMDs  But  there are approaches to avoid them   for instance  you can roll your Roth 401 k  into your Roth IRA 
What happens if don t take my RMD  The penalty for not taking a required minimum distribution  or if the distribution is not large enough  is a 50  tax on the amount not withdrawn in time 
How much cash do I need to withdraw  To figure out a particular RMD  you should divide your earlier year s December 31st retirement account balance by a  distribution period  factor dependent on your age 
Here s an example to give you an idea of the math  Ann is 71 and will take her first RMD in the year following the year she turns 72  Her IRA balance toward the end of the preceding year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  Dividing  100 000 by 27 4 equals  3 649 63  This is the amount Ann is required to withdraw for her first RMD

157214,378730,EQR,What Makes Equity Residential  EQR  A New Buy Stock,opinion,"Equity Residential  NYSE EQR  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Equity Residential basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Equity Residential imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Equity Residential
This real estate investment trust is expected to earn  3 47 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 6 8  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Equity Residential  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 7

157215,378731,EQR,Here s Why Equity Residential  EQR  Is Worth Betting On Now,opinion,The latest  from real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage  Inc    NASDAQ RP   suggest that following a robust prime leasing season in 2019  the U S  apartment rental market put up a decent show in October and November  Usually demand for apartments slows down during colder months as renters usually prefer less to move in the winter Occupancy remained as high as 95 7  in November  reflecting rise of 40 basis points  bps  year over year but fall of 20 bps sequentially  This also marks the highest rate in any November on record  Moreover  annual U S  rent growth remained decent in the month at 2 9   same as October Amid healthy industry fundamentals  Equity Residential   NYSE EQR   appears to be a promising pick as it is poised for growth with job market gains and favorable demographics  Further  it is anticipated to benefit from portfolio repositioning efforts in high barrier to entry core markets Equity Residential not only beat estimates for funds from operations  FFO  per share in the last reported quarter  but has also been witnessing upward estimate revisions  reflecting analysts  optimism  Over the past 30 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 and 2020 FFO per share has moved north marginally Further  shares of Equity Residential have outperformed the  it belongs to over the past six months  This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company s shares have gained 6 8  compared with the industry s 6 5  growth Here s What Might Drive the Stock HigherStrategic Efforts  Equity Residential focuses on the acquisition and development of residential assets primarily in key markets like Boston  New York  Washington DC  Southern  NYSE SO  California  San Francisco  Seattle and Denver  The company emphasizes more on the acquisition  development and management of rental apartment properties in urban and high density suburban markets  which are close to public transportation  dining  culture and education  as these have scope for greater demand  Also  Equity Residential is undertaking efforts to reposition its portfolio from low barrier to entry non core markets to high barrier to entry core markets  Apart from the buyouts  the company is resorting to timely dispositions  Such efforts are likely to drive its growth over the long term Resilient Economy and Favorable Demographic Growth  Decent consumer confidence on the back of a healthy labor market is likely to drive demand for the Equity Residential s properties  Moreover  demographic growth continues to be strong in the young adult age cohort  who have a higher propensity to rent  Also  high home ownership costs in several of the company s markets are hindering the transition from renter to homeowner  Thus  demand for rental housing units is likely to be high  boosting the company s prospects Healthy Capital Position  On the capital front  Equity Residential is actively taking advantage of the favorable environment  During the third quarter  the company issued  600 million of unsecured notes at a coupon rate of 2 5  and a yield of 2 56   marking the lowest 10 year yield in the company s and the REIT industry s histories  Also  in November  it entered into a  2 5 billion multi currency revolving credit facility  replacing its prior  2 billion credit agreement  Further  the company has raised the maximum size for its unsecured commercial paper note program from  500 million to  1 billion  Such initiatives are aimed at strengthening the company s balance sheet  improving liquidity and enhancing financial flexibility Consistent Dividend Payer  Solid dividend payouts remain the biggest enticement for REIT investors  and Equity Residential remains committed to boosting shareholder wealth through dividend hikes  In each of the first  second and third quarters of 2019  Equity Residential had paid a dividend of 56 75 cents per share  marking 5 1  hike from the amount paid in 2018  This move was backed by the company s solid growth in property operations following the economic downturn and considerable upsurge in its available cash flows  Such trends are likely to continue and support its dividend payouts Superior Return on Equity  ROE   Equity Residential s ROE of 7 73  compares favorably with the industry average of 4 39   This highlights the company s commendable position over its peers in using shareholders  funds Other Key PicksOther top ranked stocks in the REIT space include Spirit Realty Capital  Inc    NYSE SRC   and Sun Communities

Site rental revenues came in at around  1 3 billion  up 6 4  year over year  which included organic growth  as well as contributions from straight lined revenues  Particularly  site rental revenues during the September end quarter recorded 6  organic growth  driven by new leasing activity  as well as contracted tenant escalations

157253,378769,EQR,Fed Makes Another Rate Cut  What Lies Ahead For REITs Now ,opinion,As anticipated  the Fed cut the federal funds target rate by a quarter point to 1 75 2 00  this time  The latest cut  which comes for the second time this year as well as in more than a decade  is aimed at sustaining the record long economic expansion  Particularly  the central bank cited  the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures  as the key reason for lowering the target range However  in describing the current economic environment  the central bank recognized the labor market s strength and indicated that economic activity has been rising at a  moderate  pace  With solid job gains  unemployment is hovering at low levels and household spending growth has been strong  though business fixed investment and exports have weakened  per the Fed s press release post its two day meeting  Nevertheless  whether or not there will be another cut this year remains a question as the central bank members appear divided on the future course While the  suggest a general trend of lower rates in the upcoming years  the longer run expectations for fund rates remained unchanged at 2 5   There has been a slight uptick in 2019 GDP growth rate expectations to 2 2  as against the 2 1  projected in June  Core inflation projection remained stable at 1 8  for 2019   No doubt  the historical dependence of REITs on debt for their business traditionally keeps them in the headlines when rate related announcements occur  Moreover  REITs are often treated as bond substitutes for their high dividend paying nature Nonetheless  over the years  REITs have fortified their balance sheets  inclining more toward equity capital raisings and lowering interest rate exposures  Encouragingly  both in terms of book value and market value  leverage for the sector has declined to a two decade low  per the  Particularly  in 2007  40  of REITs had a coverage ratio greater than 3x  while in 2019  80  of REITs have a coverage ratio greater than 3x  highlighting the sector s robust improvement in ability to cover fixed charges  Furthermore  in 2007  81  of REITs had interest expenses that were higher than 40  of net operating income  Nonetheless  only 10  of REITs have such high interest expenses in the current year Low interest rate has  undoubtedly  played its part  but solid fundamentals and strong returns fueled its growth engine  Particularly  funds from operations  FFO  totaled  16 5 billion in second quarter 2019  13 5  higher than three years ago Moreover  the REIT sector has emerged as one of the most brilliant performers this year  with  of the FTSE Nareit All REITs Index rallying 26 08  since the beginning of the year through Sep 18  outpacing the S P 500 which gained 21 71  during the same period  Low unemployment  increasing wages and decent consumer sentiment are positive indicators for a number of asset categories  and the occupancy levels of properties are hovering near the record high marks   indicating solid demand as well as scope for generating steady revenues With a favorable outlook  REITs were also able to issue  19 2 billion in secondary offerings of common equity during the first half of 2019  This is more than what the sector raised in full year 2018  and if the trend continues in the second half of the ongoing year as well  there are possibilities of reaching a new record with respect to issuance for the sector Our ChoicesNevertheless  not all REITs are equally poised to excel

157281,378797,EQR,UMH Properties Closes Portfolio Buyout  Adds New Community,opinion,"UMH Properties  Inc    NYSE UMH   recently closed the acquisition of Northtowne Meadows  a high quality community  situated in Erie  MI  for roughly  25 2 million 
This community consists of 386 developed homesites and spans nearly 85 acres  Further  the property is 88  occupied  Management believes  given the strong demand for the company s recently acquired properties in this MSA  Northtowne Meadows too will exhibit similar fundamental strength 
The transaction marks the completion of the acquisition of a four community portfolio consisting of around 1 500 homesites  This portfolio was acquired for nearly  55 million  The company has the ability to boost occupancy and property value through the execution of its value creation strategy that entails upgradation and improvement of communities   
During the second quarter  UMH Properties raised  100 million through a preferred equity offering  The company aims to deploy the remaining capital into rental homes  financing homes  capital improvements and expansions  Furthermore  capital provided through this issue will enable the company to pursue any accretive acquisition opportunities 
Notably  the rising housing shortage has likely benefited the manufactured housing sector  and REITs  including Equity Lifestyle Properties   NYSE ELS   and Sun Communities  Inc     NYSE SUI    In fact  it is one of the cheapest  non subsidized housing options in most markets  and has spurred demand for manufactured houses  In addition  the increase in wage among blue collar workers has supported the latest stellar growth for the manufactured housing sector 
Banking on this favorable trend  companies are expanding their manufactured housing footprint  In fact  recently  Sun Communities entered into an agreement to acquire a portfolio of 31 community manufactured housing properties  for  343 6 million   Read more   
As for UMH Properties  the rising national demand for affordable housing provides the company an opportunity to use available vacant sites  and improve its earnings and property value 
However  competition has been intensifying amid attractive fundamentals of the manufacturing homes sector and a favorable demand supply environment  This has resulted in a challenging acquisition market  making such opportunities scarce and less accretive 
Moreover  while funds raised through preferred equity offering will be used to enhance property quality and strengthen the company s portfolio  the near term dilution from this offering is a concern 
Zacks Rank and A Key Pick
UMH Properties currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Shares of the company have declined 5 2  as against the  s growth of 8 5   over the past three months  You can see

157282,378798,EQR,4 Reasons To Buy Extra Space Storage  EXR  Stock Right Now,opinion,Extra Space Storage Inc    NYSE EXR   has earned a solid recognition in the self storage industry  The company has been putting in efforts for the expansion of its geographical footprint through accretive acquisitions and third party management platforms  It enjoys solid presence in key cities and opts for strategic joint ventures to drive long term profitability Also  shares of Extra Space Storage have outperformed its  in three months  time  The company s shares have gained 13 8   while the industry has rallied 5 9  during this time frame Currently  the trend in estimate revisions for 2019 funds from operations  FFO  per share indicates a favorable outlook for this self storage REIT  In fact  this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock is likely to rally further in the near term on a number of favorable factors  and the current price offers a good entry point Let s explore what makes it a solid choice Expansion Efforts  Extra Space Storage has grown its branded store count from 820 in 2010 to 1 752 in second quarter 2019  Also  total stores managed for third party owners increased from 181 in 2012 to 595 in second quarter 2019  Moreover  over the past five years  Extra Space Storage acquired  4 6 billion in properties  The company gained an increased scale in several core markets on the back of these acquisitions as well as fortified its presence in a number of new markets These efforts have helped this Salt Lake City  UT based self storage real estate investment trust  REIT  emerge as the second largest self storage owner and or operator and the largest self storage management company in the United States  Majority of this REIT s stores are situated around large population centers which enjoy above average population and income demographics for stores Furthermore  the industry is characterized by fragmented ownership  and only around 30  of the total self storage square footage is under REIT s ownership  This creates solid scope for consolidation at some level in the future and with a solid balance sheet  Extra Space Storage is well poised to compete for acquisitions Healthy Asset Fundamentals  The self storage asset category is basically need based and recession resilient in nature  This asset class has low capital expenditure requirements and generates high operating margins  Furthermore  the self storage industry continues to witness solid demand  backed by favorable demographic changes  Specifically  the downsizing trend  an encouraging labor market  increase in the number of people renting homes have escalated the needs of consumers to rent space at a storage facility to park their possessions  In addition  self storage assets are benefiting from adoption of technology  and serving the millennial generation Balance Sheet Strength and High ROE  Extra Space Storage remains focused on improving its balance sheet  The company exited the June end quarter with roughly  47 7 million of cash and cash equivalents  Moreover  as of Jun 30  2019  Extra Space Storage had  399 9 million available for issuance under its ATM equity program  Over the years  the company has increased the size of its unencumbered asset pool  Also  it has staggered its maturities  Further  Extra Space Storage s Return on Equity  ROE  is 16 71  compared with the industry s

157285,378801,EQR,Here s Why Momentum Investors Will Love Equity Residential  EQR ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us

Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for EQR that show why this real estate investment trust shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For EQR  shares are up 2 43  over the past week while the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Residential industry is up 1 35  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 6 37  compares favorably with the industry s 2 06  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Equity Residential have risen 10 34   and are up 26 47  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 5 81  and 5 06   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to EQR s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  EQR is currently averaging 1 262 996 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with EQR 
Over the past two months  10 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost EQR s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 39 to  3 45 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  10 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that EQR is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Equity Residential on your short list ",2019-09-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-momentum-investors-will-love-equity-residential-eqr-200462441,200462441

with the intention of earning a return on investment  either through rental income or through future resale of the property When inflation is high  the value of paper currency tanks in terms of goods

positive surprise of 1 23  in terms of FFO per share  Results displayed improved same store net operating income  NOI  and lease up NOI Over the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice  met in another and missed in the other occasion  recording an average positive surprise of 0 33   The graph below depicts this surprise history Equity Residential Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for Equity Residential prior to this announcement Factors at PlayThe latest  from real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage  Inc   RP  suggest that during the current year s prime leasing period  the U S  apartment rental market was able to capitalize on stellar demand for rental units Per the RealPage report  from April through June  net move ins aggregated 155 515 units  which came in 11  higher than the second quarter 2018 product absorption  as well as touched a five year high  Occupancy reached 95 8  during the second quarter  up from the prior year quarter s 95 4  despite steady delivery of new units  Moreover  the market has achieved a 3  increase in rents from the prior year level  attaining an average of  1 390 per month Amid these  Equity Residential too is expected to benefit from its efforts to reposition the company s portfolio in high barrier to entry core markets  Particularly  in the to be reported quarter  the company is likely to have witnessed healthy demand for its properties amid stable economy  healthy job market  household formation and high home ownership costs in several markets hindering transition from renter to homeowner However  Equity Residential has been experiencing high new supply across a number of its markets  This elevated supply level will likely keep putting pressure on new lease rates  occupancy as well as retention  and affect revenue growth  Furthermore  concession activity remains high amid higher supply  which remains another concern This apart  as Equity Residential is repositioning its portfolio to focus on key markets  the company continues to acquire as well as dispose assets  At times  such transactions lead to dilutive impact in the near term  which cannot be bypassed  In fact  for the second quarter  Equity Residential projects normalized FFO per share at 82 86 cents  Results are likely to reflect positive impact from higher same store net operating income  NOI   Nonetheless  the company s 2019 and 2018 transaction activities are likely to have an adverse impact on normalized FFO per share The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter FFO per share is currently pegged at 85 cents  indicating a projected increase of 4 9  year over year on the back of healthy revenues  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s quarterly revenues is pinned at  667 5 million  highlighting anticipated growth of around 4 3  year over year In addition to the above  Equity Residential s activities during the April June quarter were inadequate to gain analyst confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the quarter under review remained unchanged over the past month Here is what our

157327,378843,EQR,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Essex Property  Equity Residential  Federal Realty And Kimco Realty,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  July 24  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Essex Property Trust   NYSE ESS    Equity Residential   NYSE EQR    Federal Realty Investment Trust   NYSE FRT   and Kimco Realty Corp    NYSE KIM   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog 4 Top REITs Buoying Investor Optimism This Earnings SeasonOf late  the Fed chairman Jerome Powell and other officials of the regulatory body have been dropping hints about more aggressive policy easing  Earlier  Powell  in a prepared testimony to the House Financial Services Committee  had emphasized that the central bank is prepared to  act as appropriate  in order to sustain economic expansion that is challenged by a slowdown in global growth and trade disputes Later  the New York Federal Reserve president John Williams  NYSE WMB  and Fed vice chair Richard Clarida also gestured a dovish tone  However  a New York Fed spokesperson later clarified that Williams was drawing from academic research and not hinting at potential policy actions at the upcoming FOMC meeting The latest turnout of events has  undoubtedly  put REITs back in the limelight as a soft rate environment benefits the rate sensitive industry  This is owing to the companies  dependence on debt for their business  Additionally  REITs are considered as bond substitutes for their high dividend paying nature Further  the fundamentals of a number of underlying asset categories of REITs displayed strength during the June end period amid low unemployment level and rising wages  and still resilient consumer sentiment  This again translated into elevated demand for real estate and resulted in higher occupancy levels One of the cases in point is residential REITs  The latest  from real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage  Inc   RP  suggest that during the current year s prime leasing period  the U S  apartment rental market was able to capitalize on stellar demand for rental units Per the RealPage report  from April through June  net move ins aggregated 155 515 units  which came in 11  higher than the second quarter 2018 product absorption as well as touched a five year high  Occupancy reached 95 8  during the second quarter  up from the prior year quarter s 95 4  despite steady delivery of new units  Moreover  the market has achieved a 3  increase in rents from the prior year level  attaining an average of  1 390 per month And if you assumed that retail REITs are falling behind due to store closures  then you should reconsider your decision  This is because though the retail real estate market is undergoing structural changes  the recent  from Reis indicates stability in the vacancy rate and rent levels  It also suggests that the sector has been able to weather such challenges to some extent In fact  the vacancy rate of neighborhood and community shopping center shrunk 10 basis points sequentially to 10 1  in the second quarter   denoting the first decline since first quarter 2016  The Regional Mall vacancy rate remained flat at 9 3  in the second quarter  Also  both  national average asking rent and effective rent  which nets out landlord concessions  inched up 0 4  sequentially and 1 7  from the year ago quarter Though store closures have been making headlines  retail REITs are making continued efforts with the transformation initiatives of their traditional retail hubs into entertainment destinations and lifestyle resorts  This apart  minimal construction activity in the pipeline has resulted in the stability in vacancy rate and rent levels The Zacks MethodologyHowever  picking the right stock could be difficult unless one knows the proper method  To make the task simple we rely on the Zacks methodology  combining a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  or 3  Hold    and a positive  Our proprietary methodology  Earnings ESP  shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  And research shows that for stocks with this combination of rank and ESP  chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Therefore  rather than accumulating the stocks later  investing in the ones that are yet to report and poised for a beat  can generate higher gains  Because earnings beat usually serves as a catalyst  raising investors

This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 1 18   A quarter ago  it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of  0 81 per share when it actually produced FFO of  0 82  delivering a surprise of 1 23  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates two times 
Equity Residential  which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Residential industry  posted revenues of  669 52 million for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 30   This compares to year ago revenues of  639 81 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Equity Residential shares have added about 20 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 5  
What s Next for Equity Residential 
While Equity Residential has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s FFO outlook  Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Equity Residential was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

157360,378876,EQR,Equity Residential  EQR  Upgraded To Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Equity Residential  NYSE EQR   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Equity Residential basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Equity Residential imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Equity Residential
This real estate investment trust is expected to earn  3 40 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 4 6  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Equity Residential  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 2  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Equity Residential have risen 6 62   and are up 11 51  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved  5 93  and 4 46   respectively 
Investors should also take note of EQR s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  EQR is averaging 1 560 174 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with EQR 
Over the past two months  11 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost EQR s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 24 to  3 26 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  11 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that EQR is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Equity Residential on your short list ",2018-12-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-equity-residential-eqr-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-200366093,200366093

Our Take
Although SL Green has high quality office properties and a diverse tenant base  the prevalent office space efficiency trends have been limitingany robust recovery in the office sector fundamentals  This restricts the company s ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents  and hence limits growth in rental revenues 
SL Green currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   You can see

157625,379141,EQR,Collect A 9 3  Dividend Yield From This Growing Trend,opinion,"This week s chart is screaming opportunity 
How does a chart showing the decline of U S  homeownership create opportunity for anyone  For many  it signals the death of the  American Dream  
But anyone who owns rental properties  like me  can tell you why this trend is absolutely your friend   
It s because rent is going up  Way up  And today I will show you an easy way to get in on the game without putting a single dollar into a physical property   

How Low Can It Go 
As you can see in our chart  homeownership is at a 48 year low  You have to go back to 1967 to find another point when the homeownership rate stood at 63 4  
Back then  the average cost for a new house was  14 250  The average income per year was  7 300 and the average monthly rent was  125 
Today  homeownership has become unaffordable for many young people    stringent mortgage lending standards and a subpar  are mostly to blame 
And when you can t afford to buy a house  you have to rent  Shelter is a necessity  after all  As a result  the number of renters has skyrocketed 

As you can see above  a record number of households are now renters  And this demand has sent the cost of rent to an all time high  True  these numbers haven t been adjusted for inflation  But even so  the trend is clear 
According to the Census Bureau  the median asking rent is now  803 

If you are in the house and apartment rental industry  the last chart tells you one thing  business is booming 
The good news is that everyday investors can get in on the game  And you can do it without putting big money down on a rental property 

Become a Landlord Without the Deed
One of the best ways to profit from all time high rental demand is with apartment real estate trusts  REITs   REITs allow you to get in on the rental game and be paid a nice juicy dividend along the way 
You see  REITs are required by law to pay at least 90  of their taxable income to shareholders 
How nice are the yields  Equity Residential  NYSE  N EQR  is one of the bigger apartment REITs  and yields over 2 7   But if you are looking for some bigger payers  check out Independence Realty Trust Inc  N IRT  or Preferred Apartment Communities Inc  N APTS   They yield 9 34  and 6 39   respectively 
As the U S  transitions from a nation of homeowners to a nation of renters  rental properties will be one of the best ways to profit  And for those not looking to get into the property management business  apartment REITs are your next best way to collect consistent checks ",2015-11-01,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/collect-a-9.3-dividend-yield-from-this-growing-trend-269805,269805
157627,379143,EQR,How Millennials Can Lead You To Big Gains In 2016,opinion,"There is no denying it    2015 was a roller coaster  And August was the wildest part of the ride 

The S P 500 lost more than 11  from August 17 to August 25 

But even with that sudden drop  it looks like we will end up right where we started the year 

How will stocks do in 2016  No one really knows 

Or do they 

It s the time of year when everyone on Wall Street weighs in with their predictions  And one sector that keeps showing up is housing and real estate 

It should come as no surprise  Housing is stable  wages are improving and interest rates are low 

Consumers can borrow again   even if they do have to contend with the Fed s decision to boost its benchmark rate by 0 25    and that could be good news for mortgage lenders 

But the real winners in this sector will likely be real estate investment trusts  REITs   In fact  as you can see in this week s chart  they ve overtaken the S P 500 in recent weeks 

And 2016 should continue this trend  Millennials are a big reason why 
Unlike their parents  millennials show little interest in setting down roots  Instead  they seem to enjoy the mobility that comes with renting 

Property management companies make this an easy decision  Many new apartment complexes deliver luxurious amenities like pools  gyms and private theaters to young renters 

These communities aren t just appealing to millennials  either  Many in the hospitality and civil service sectors   teachers  police officers  government workers and healthcare employees   need affordable housing in notoriously expensive locales 

Apartments offer the affordable housing they are looking for  And one company  in particular  is already taking full advantage   

Equity Residential  NYSE  N EQR  engages in the acquisition  development and management of multifamily properties 

With units in hot markets such as Manhattan  Boston  San Francisco  Seattle and L A   among others   the company should see no shortage of tenants anytime soon 

Equity Residential has been part of The Oxford Communiqu  s All Star Portfolio for years  And since December 2013  it s returned more than 50  

In 2016  we re expecting more of the same  But that s not all we have lined up for the new year   ",2015-12-27,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-millennials-can-lead-you-to-big-gains-in-2016-377450,377450
