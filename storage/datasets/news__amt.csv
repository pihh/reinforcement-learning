137414,358929,AMT,3 Secure Funds Yielding 7  That ll Fund Your Retirement,opinion,"The  race to zero  heats up again  You ve surely heard that Vanguard is now slicing and dicing its already low fees and commissions  That sounds great  but in reality  the low fee race is pennywise yet dividend foolish for us income investors 
To retire on secure  high yielding long term investments  we actually prefer to pay a fair management fee  I ll outline this in a moment via a trio of secure 7  payers  Their generous yields tower above mainstream low fee options 






More on these three dividend funds in a minute  First  let s review why we prefer to pay for professional management 
Vanguard kicked off the new trading year by joining the  no commission  fray that caught the likes of  Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW  and E Trade  ETFC  by surprise in 2019  The brokerage provider previously offered all Vanguard mutual funds and exchange traded funds  ETFs   as well as most other ETFs  commission free for years  Starting Jan  2  it extended that out to stocks and options 
That follows a 2019 in which Vanguard lowered expense ratios on 60 of its ETFs and mutual funds 
While these moves made mainstream financial headlines  one of my favorite retirement vehicles    received no ink whatsoever  This is typical  as CEFs are workmanlike income investments  They pay big yields and deliver retirement worthy total returns without the flash or panache of more mediocre funds 
Here s a quick refresher  CEFs trade on exchanges just like ETFs  but they act a little differently 
Their set number of shares mean they don t always trade at net asset value  NAV   Sometimes they re more expensive  and sometimes you can buy their assets at a significant discount They also use leverage to turbocharge their gains  often making them far more powerful return vehicles than glory hogging ETFs  Even better  CEFs can turbocharge their dividends  too  resulting in significantly higher quarterly  or better yet  monthly  distributions that top almost every area of the market   When money is as cheap as it is today  leverage is a no brainer  CEFs  active management usually can find inefficiencies and values that indexed ETFs can t exploit The best funds to buy deliver excellent total returns over the long run  Most of their investors  profits come in the form of monthly or quarterly payouts  And those who buy these funds at significant discounts to their net asset values  NAVs  can enjoy price upside to boot 
With this  income plus upside  goal in mind  let s review a trio of 7  yielding  super funds  
Aberdeen Global Premier Properties Fund  AWP 
Dividend Yield  7 4 
Discount to NAV  10 5 
Real estate investment trusts  REITs  typically are tough to beat from an income standpoint  These specially structured companies are literally compelled by design to dole out most of their profits as dividends  which often translates into sky high yields 
But a strong run for the sector has left REITs with skinflint yields of late  The Vanguard Real Estate ETF  VNQ  offers 3 4  at the moment  the Schwab US REIT ETF  SCHH  is even less  at a mere 2 9  
If you want real estate to pay in 2020  you ll have to get your passport 
The Aberdeen Global Premier Properties Fund  AWP  is  as the name suggests  a  global  fund  which means that it holds international and American REITs  It s a 55  45  split between the U S  and the rest of the world at last check  AWP holds well known American REITs such as Welltower  WELL  and Prologis  PLD   but also overseas names like U K  business real estate operator Segro plc and Germany residential specialist Vonovia 
International real estate simply pays more right now in part because global real estate companies haven t been as productive as they have been in the U S   but also because yields on European dividend stocks tend to outstrip their American brethren  Indeed  the Vanguard Global ex U S  Real Estate ETF  VNQI   which holds no American REITs  has the yield edge at 7 6  
But Aberdeen s fund has Vanguard s ETF beat just about everywhere else  You can t buy VNQI at a discount  whereas you re getting AWP s assets for roughly 90 cents on the dollar  VNQI s indexed structure means it can t take advantage of mispriced REITs  And the fact that Aberdeen s global REIT ETF yields so much despite being heaviest in U S  real estate demonstrates how closed end funds can squeeze the most out of their holdings 
The downside  Global REITs haven t offered very good performance in quite some time    and Aberdeen s fund has gone on to more than double up Vanguard s ETF  But a 24  total return over that time still isn t much to crow about 
Aberdeen Global Premier Property Fund  AWP  Pulls Away






It s not the vehicle  It s the asset class  Let s find something more promising 
Cohen   Steers Infrastructure Fund  UTF 
Dividend Yield  7 1 
Discount to NAV  5 3 
Many of my  subscribers will know Cohen   Steers Infrastructure Fund  UTF   as we recently sold out of it for a 95  total return 
First  a quick explanation for those who aren t familiar with UTF  This closed end fund is unique among so called  infrastructure  products in its vision  While many of them will hold companies such as utilities  pipelines and railroads  Cohen   Steers  fund stands out in holding other types of infrastructure  like communications REITs such as Crown Castle International  NYSE CCI  and American Tower  NYSE AMT   or Australian toll roads operator Transurban Group 
This winning combination has driven returns that would make many of its exchange traded competitors chartreuse with envy 
My reasons for exiting had nothing to do with the quality of the fund and like most good trades everything to do with timing 
When we bought in  UTF sold for a ludicrous 16  discount to NAV  but near the end of 2019  it traded for an extremely rare premium   The  free money  has been made   as I said at the time  and we locked in our profits 
Cohen   Steers Infrastructure Fund  UTF  Served Us Well






The discount isn t quite there yet  but it s opening up once again  Keep an eye on UTF 
Tekla Healthcare Opportunities Fund  THQ 
Dividend Yield  7 2 
Discount to NAV  9 7 
Healthcare is one of the better  go anywhere  sectors you can buy 
On one side  healthcare growth is being powered by a number of trends  You re certainly already familiar with the aging of America s boomers but did you know this trend is playing out worldwide 
The  says that in 2017  the global population aged 60 years or older reached 962 million more than twice the figure from 1980  And the U N  further sees the number of older people more than double by 2050  to almost 2 1 billion 
If the  Tekla  name sounds familiar  that s because it provides several health focused CEFs  some of which  
Tekla Healthcare Opportunities Fund  THQ  is a well rounded healthcare fund that primarily invests in normal publicly traded companies  but can put 10  of its assets into  venture and restricted securities  essentially pre public companies  It s more conservative than the likes of Tekla Healthcare Investors  HQH  and Tekla Life Sciences Investors  HQL   which can invest up to 40  in VC and restricted stocks  So  THQ s portfolio looks like many healthcare ETFs  big chunks of pharma  biotech and health insurance companies  thick weightings in Merck  MRK   UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH  and Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  
The vital stats look great  THQ yields roughly triple what you ll find in a run of the mill healthcare ETF  and you can buy its assets for roughly 90 cents on the dollar  There s just one problem 
Tekla s THQ Isn t Walking the Walk






Management hasn t made the right bets since inception in 2014  Its five year average annual total return trails the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund  XLV   9 7  6 7   and has underperformed in three of the past five years 
 Second level  research is what allows you and I to score monster returns like we did with UTF  while avoiding shiny but ultimately substance light funds such as THQ 
And that same deep dive research has turned up a few new retirement dynamos 
How to Collect  3 000 in Dividends Each and Every Month
The three funds I just highlighted have some of the qualities we want out of our income generating holdings  They pay generous distributions  they have advantages that index funds don t  and they re positioned in sectors that at least have a chance at success 
So they re close  They re almost there 
But do banks settle for  close  on your mortgage payments  Will the grocery store clerk accept  almost  enough to cover your total 
They ll never settle  and neither should you not when it comes to the income you need to retire prosperously and comfortably over the next few decades  Now is the time to lock in the dividends that will carry you over the finish line 
My  tick off every checkbox in the retirement wish list 
High annual yields nearing 8   That translates into  3 125 in monthly income   on a nest egg of just  500 000  It s all gravy from there if you ve saved up even more Real upside potential of about 10  annually  That will keep your nest egg growing in retirement  protecting it against any sudden financial  shocks  Hidden value  There s such a thing as  too popular   If too many investors crowd into a stock  it becomes grossly overpriced  making more upside difficult to come by and increasing the risk of hyper aggressive selling if investors get nervous  My  Dividend Superstars  are too small to be flush with institutional money  and far off the radar of many analysts  creating price inefficiencies that you and I can exploit This is the path less traveled 
Most finance TV pundits will tell you to sink your hard earned retirement money into  can t miss  blue chips like the Dividend Aristocrats  They ve grown their dividends for decades  and probably will for decades more 
Ignore that nonsense  Those same Dividend Aristocrats only yield about 2  on average  and the most established Aristocrats have slowed their dividend growth to a sloth s pace  When you retire with those stocks  your income stream will dry up so quickly that within just a few years  you ll be forced to hack away at your savings to pay your monthly bills 
Don t take that gamble  Pay your monthly bills with outsize monthly dividend checks  and use the leftover cash to take a couple trips  build that backyard pool or spoil your grandkids rotten

137415,358930,AMT,Goldman Sachs  3 5G Stocks to Snap Up Now,opinion,In a set of interesting reports  Goldman Sachs telecom expert Brett Feldman turns his eye on the American wireless market   and its growing rollover to 5G technology  Feldman notes five reasons why 5G will drive a period of sustained growth for companies with an  in   While the analyst focuses on tower leasing REITs  his basic point applies to most companies with a strong connection to the 5G switchover  wireless providers  device makers  chip makers A look at three of Feldman s points outlines what we can expect in the next couple of years  as 5G networks expand across the country  First  he notes the obvious   that 2020 will see an expansion of 5G coverage by the Big 4 mobile providers  Second  Apple will launch a 5G capable iPhone this year  which should help drive adoption of the new technology for the next several years  Third  as more users switch to 5G devices  data usage will increase  driving increased cell site density   it will be a virtuous circle Feldman s final two points touch on what he sees as the bottom line for investors interested in 5G stocks  that cell tower owners and operators are the best stock position to take as the switch begins and expands  For his fourth point  he notes that auctions this year and next will open up the mid band spectrum  and drive tower new tower leases  And finally  in point five  Feldman sees the deployment of new antennas and consequent increase of mid band spectrum use  driving the expansion of towers and the increase in tower loading and usage going forward The move to 5G has potential to turn wireless markets upside down  The Big 4 have all initiated coverage in the new network  but so far only T Mobile has launched it nation wide  AT T  Sprint  and Verizon are initiating 5G coverage on the high band spectrum in limited  dense  urban markets  And a group of REITs that specialize in tower properties are positioned to gain  no matter how the chips fall out for the wireless providers In this article  we ll look at three Goldman Sachs 5G stock recommendations  All three score high on TipRanks  Smart Score system   rating a 9 or 10  The Smart Score brings together collects and collates data on more than 6 500 stocks  information drawn from across the TipRanks database  and distills it down to a single number  A 9 or 10 rating indicates that the stock is likely to outperform the broader markets in the coming months SBA Communications Corporation  SBAC First up is SBA Communications  a real estate investment trust  REITs are companies that buy  own  and operate various residential and commercial properties  making their profits on through rents and management fees  Cell tower properties are a common commercial investment for REITs  and as pointed out above  this combination is Brett Feldman s favorite 5G investment  SBA is exactly that type of REIT  it owns and operates wireless infrastructure  including small cells  distributed antenna systems  and traditional cell sites The popularity of wireless systems  the necessity of the tech infrastructure to modern life  and the switch to 5G have all put SBA on an upward trajectory  The shares gained 50  in 2019  The company has consistently beaten the expectations in the quarterly earnings reports The numbers show that  as far as they can  In Q3 2019  the most recent reported  SBAC showed funds from operations  FFO   the REIT equivalent to earnings per share  of  2 15  opposed to the expected  2 08 and up 12  from the year ago value  Revenues were equally strong  At  507 55 million  revenues were 2  higher than forecast  and up 8 6  year over year This strong stock performance got Feldman s full attention  He upgraded SBAC to a Buy rating  writing   We expect acceleration in domestic organic leasing growth as carriers expand their 5G coverage and begin to overlay mid band spectrum  and as SBAC sees a material decline in M A driven churn  We estimate that over the next five years  SBAC can repurchase  7 1bn of stock and return  1 3bn in dividends to shareholders  while maintaining leverage at 7 0x net debt EBITDA  Feldman put a  280 price target on SBAC  indicating room for 12  growth in the next 12 months SBA gets a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus  based on 2 Buys and 1 Hold  The relatively small number of reviews reflects the  under the radar  profile of most REITs in the markets  these stocks  while frequently strong on fundamentals  tend to get passed over in favor of bigger  flashier companies  Shares in SBAC sell for  248  and the  261 33 average price target suggests a modest 5  upside potential   See SBA stock analysis at TipRanks American Tower Corporation  AMT The second stock on our list takes the tower oriented REIT model a step up in size  American Tower is another owner operator of wireless infrastructure   but this company has a  103 billion market cap and a global investment footprint  AMT owns over 170 000 telecom infrastructure sites  The company s portfolio includes over 75 000 sites in Asia  40 000 in the US  and 37 000 in Latin America  Another 16 000 sites in Europe  Africa  and the Mid East round out AMT s holdings The full year 2019 numbers are not available yet  but the value of the tower oriented REIT is shown by AMT s  7 44 billion in 2018 revenues  The most recent quarterly on record is from Q3  and shows a  2 FFO  2  over expectation  and revenues of  1 95 billion  a 5  forecast beat  Both FFO and revenues were up significantly year over year  In reaction  AMT showed a 49  share appreciation last year Feldman writes of AMT   We believe that AMT should trade at a signi cant premium to the median of high quality REITs  We have also increased the terminal growth rate   to re ect our view that the 5G cycle is likely to support leasing activity well beyond our 5 year forecasting period  In line with his upbeat outlook on the company  Feldman gave AMT shares his second upgrade   to a Buy rating  His  270 price target implies an upside potential of 15  Like SBAC  American Tower has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus  This is based on 6 reviews  including 4 Buys and 2 Holds  The  243 83 average price target suggests an upside of 4  from the  233 current trading price   See American Tower s stock analysis at TipRanks Verizon Communications  VZ With Verizon  the third stock on our list  we shift gears from wireless infrastructure to a major wireless provider  Verizon is the second largest US wireless services company  by subscriber count  with over 118 million customers as of September 2019  The company s  130 billion in 2018 revenue shows the both the size and income potential of the mobile market in the US Verizon hasn t seen the magnitude of gains that the tower REITs have  but the growth in wireless has given a boost to the company s top and bottom lines  Revenues in Q3 last year were  32 9 billion  a half percent above the forecast  and the  1 25 EPS was 1  above the estimates  In a key metric   net retail additions   the 601 000 reported was up more than double year over year Solid quarterly results and a firm position in a growth market attracted Feldman to Verizon  In his comments on Verizon  he writes   How much could 5G boost postpaid ARPU ARPA  Our analysis of Verizon s unlimited pricing implies that its consumer accounts with unlimited plans generate monthly ARPA  average revenue per account  that is 11 48  higher than its reported consumer ARPA of  113 39 in 3Q19   We see  signi cant revenue growth opportunity for Verizon if the 5G upgrade cycle does indeed stimulate more customers to upgrade to unlimited plans  or to migrate to higher unlimited tiers  Feldman reiterates his Buy rating on this stock  and raised his price target by 3  to  67  His new price target implies an upside for the stock of 7 6  in the coming 12 months   To watch Feldman s track record  click here Like the two stocks above  Verizon holds a Moderate Buy consensus rating  In the case of VZ  this rating is based on 4 Buy and 6 Holds given in the past 3 months  Shares are selling for  59 04  and the average price target of  63 56 suggests an upside of  8    See Verizon s stock analysis at TipRanks ,2020-01-15,TipRanks,https://invst.ly/picp9,200498873

137417,358932,AMT,American Tower  AMT  Stock Moves  0 02   What You Should Know,opinion,"American Tower  NYSE AMT  closed at  237 47 in the latest trading session  marking a  0 02  move from the prior day  This change was narrower than the S P 500 s 1 57  loss on the day  Meanwhile  the Dow lost 1 57   and the Nasdaq  a tech heavy index  lost 1 89  
Heading into today  shares of the wireless communications infrastructure company had gained 4 23  over the past month  outpacing the Finance sector s gain of 0 29  and the S P 500 s gain of 2 35  in that time 
Investors will be hoping for strength from AMT as it approaches its next earnings release  In that report  analysts expect AMT to post earnings of  1 90 per share  This would mark a year over year decline of 20 83   Meanwhile  our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of  1 93 billion  down 9 32  from the prior year quarter 
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for AMT  These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short term business trends  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook 
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near term share price momentum  To benefit from this  we have developed the Zacks Rank  a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system

137418,358933,AMT,How To  Inoculate  Your Portfolio From Coronavirus And Get 6   Dividends,opinion,"I m sure you ve noticed stocks whipsawing in the past week on fears of the spreading coronavirus  We ll talk income investment strategy shortly  with a specific focus on safe dividends and profits  regardless of where the markets go from here 
First  I should say that I m not going to go into the health or political implications of this outbreak  which has infected thousands as I write this  with 99  of those in China 
As investors  we need to look at the situation through a clear  logical financial lens  And the good news is that right now we have a great opportunity to safeguard  and even grow  our nest egg and our dividend income  too 
Because there s one group of stocks that s proven to hold steady  and even rise  in any crisis  Plus  these stout income generators pay dividends that double  and even triple  the S P 500 s average payout 
I m talking about   owners of apartments  warehouses and other properties  Right upfront  I can tell you that REITs mostly focus on the US  making them a good way to insulate your portfolio from whatever happens abroad a trade war  a virus  a  hot war  in the Middle East  whatever 
 I ll give you a three step test you can use to find the most resilient REITs below  I ll also name three specific REITs to put on your watch list  
How REITs Can Calm a Skittish Portfolio
First  REITs can be a shield when crises hit because they trade independently of the stock market  and can even move in opposition to it  This is something few people notice  but I ve seen it over and over during my income investing career 
Consider our best parallel to today s situation  the SARS outbreak  which we ll peg from November 16  2002  when the first case was reported  to July 5  2003  when the World Health Organization said SARS was contained 
How did REITs do 
Going by the iShares Real Estate ETF  IYR   they doubled the market  And they did so without falling as far as stocks  and with a smoother ride up  too 
REITs Were a Rock in the Last Outbreak  






You can see this resilience again today  REITs have surged since the first case of coronavirus hit the headlines on December 31 
  And Have Outperformed This Time  Too






The best part is that IYR yields 3  today  nearly double the 1 7  you get from the typical S P 500 stock  So you re getting more of your return in cash  not paper gains 
But we re not going to go the ETF route today  By going one step further  we can bag dividends that crush IYR s 3  payout  Plus we ll set ourselves up for greater upside  too 
I showed you a simple way to do this   with three REIT owning  trading at big discounts now  Those three funds  you may remember  pay a gaudy 7  average dividend  and two of them even pay dividends monthly 
But that was last week  Right now  I m going to show you how to find the steadiest individual REITs  with the highest yields  fastest growing dividends and biggest upside  too 
Step 1   Stress Test  Your REIT Before You Buy
It sounds obvious  but the best way to find REITs that will hold their own  or rise  in the next crisis is to look at how they did in the last one 
Lucky for us  National Health Investors  NHI   which finances seniors  housing and medical facilities across the US  was around when SARS hit 18 years ago  Back then  it returned 19  in eight months  beating the S P 500  in orange below  and REIT benchmark IYR  in red  
NHI Soared 19  in the SARS Scare  






Truth is  we don t have to go back nearly two decades to see NHI s    chops  Look at how it performed in the late 2018 crash 
  And the 2018 Pullback






That s right  while S P 500 investors watched their nest egg shrivel 14   NHI owners made money 
I know what you re thinking here  past performance isn t the be all and end all for gauging future performance  I get it so here s one more thing that ll give you peace of mind  NHI s  beta  rating  the stock sports a beta of 0 25  compared to the market  whose beta is  always  1  In other words  NHI is 75  less volatile than the typical stock 
We re not going to stop there  though  because we also want to make sure our REIT dividends are safe  Here s an easy way to do that 
Step 2  Use This to  Inoculate  Your Payouts
Earnings per share isn t the best measure for REITs  Instead  we want to focus on funds from operations  FFO  a snapshot of the cash a REIT is generating  And we can ensure our dividends are safe  and better yet primed for growth  by looking at a REIT s  payout ratio   its per share payout as a percentage of FFO 
To see how this plays out with an actual REIT  consider another senior care landlord  Omega Healthcare Investors  OHI   which has handed members of my  an outsized 62  total return since my first recommendation in August 2015  And thanks to its outsized dividend  current yield  6 2    more than 70  of that gain has been in cash 
In the last four quarters  OHI generated adjusted FFO of  3 02 a share and paid  2 64 in dividends  for an 87  payout ratio  That might sound high  but ratios like that are common in REIT land  because many REITs  including OHI  get steady  predictable cash flows from their investments 
Step 3  Buy  Dividend Rubber Duckies 
Our last step applies to any stock  not just REITs  And it s something that  if you ve been reading my articles for a while  you ll be able to recite by heart   A rising dividend is the No  1 driver of share prices  
Buying a surging dividend makes more sense in a crisis because dividend growers are the  rubber duckies  of the investment world  their share prices may fall in the short term  but in the long run  a rising dividend will pop them back up 
Consider one of my favorite  dividend rubber duckies   American Tower  NYSE AMT   a REIT members of my Hidden Yields service know well  AMT handed them a 48  return in a little over two years  thanks to the cell tower owner s relentlessly rising dividend  which gets hiked every quarter 
AMT s  Dividend Escalator  Rolls On






The late 2018 crisis  No problem  AMT rode its rising payout straight through 
Market Sinks  AMT Floats






To be honest  your timing couldn t be better here  because I ve just released my latest selection of stocks I see as perfectly positioned to thrive in this  or any  crisis  while paying you retirement changing dividends up to 9 8  
Let s move on to those now 
Yours Now  5  Pullback Proof  Dividends Up to 9 8 
Worrying times like these are precisely why I built my   The 5 ironclad stocks you ll find there give you 2 things you need to protect your nest egg in a meltdown 
Rock solid  and growing  8  dividends  on average enough to hand you  40 000 a year in income on a  500K nest egg  That could let you retire without selling any shares at all  so you can forget about having to watch the market like a hawk Share prices that don t crumble beneath your feet while you re collecting these massive payouts  In fact  I fully expect 7  to 15  average yearly price gains from these 5  steady Eddie  picks And  yes  REITs play a big role in this 5 stock portfolio  including one of my favorites  which yields an incredible 9 8  now 
It s a savvy lender that holds residential and commercial mortgages  It hedges its risk by devoting a large percentage of its portfolio to securities issued by Ginnie Mae  Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac 
That puts Uncle Sam on the hook for any defaults  not my pick 
And here s the ultimate  pullback proof  test  in 2018  a year most investors would rather forget  this steadfast REIT actually made money

137462,358977,AMT,Buy American Tower Corporation  AMT  Ahead Of Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"American Tower Corporation   NYSE AMT   is set to report its third quarter results Thursday  October 31 before the opening bell  The REIT has seen its shares climb over 35  YTD  outperforming the broader real estate market  The company is coming off a second quarter where revenue and FFO grew from the year ago quarter  which sent its stock to trade higher in the aftermath 
The low rate environment has boosted the company s performance and a potential third cut this week would be more good news for the REIT industry  With the development of faster mobile data speed  companies like American Tower may be a solid bet to make 
5G Data Provides Room to Grow 
American Tower s diverse portfolio of towers and structures for telecommunications equipment across 19 countries on four continents makes the company an enticing pick up as the development and implementation of the 5G network comes to fruition 
The company s presence in international markets allow it to cash in on regions such as Nigeria and India as they move from 3G to 4G and eventually 5G  According to management  smartphone data usage will grow 31  annually worldwide through at least 2023  Data usage growth nourishes AMT as it has grown its free cash flow by more than 15  annually over the past decade 
The company s large push into emerging markets in India  Latin America  and Africa allow it to get in on the ground floor of exponential data usage growth over the next several decades  The company s international expansion paired with the non cyclical demand for its services helps the company withstand economic downturns 
Outlook 
As fears of a global economic slowdown rise  dividend paying companies that can weather broader market volatility will be in demand  Regardless of the trajectory of the economy  consumers will still need their phones to be operational and ping data off their mobile carrier s technology installed on AMT s network of towers  The REIT s legally mandated dividend with a 1 8  yield can also cushion portfolios if markets go haywire 
Our Q3 consensus estimates project American Tower to see an FFO hike of 5 95  to  1 96 per share on the back of a 4 09  sales climb to  1 86 billion  Geographically  US net sales are projected to reach  1 01 billion for a 5 05  gain while the Asian region declines 9 27  to  293 million  The EMEA and Latin America regions are forecasted to make respective gains of 7 95  and 14 4  
Looking ahead to the firm s full fiscal 2019 figures  our estimates call for FFO to slip 1 25  to  7 89 per share and for net sales to miss fiscal 2018 s figure by a light 0 07   The Latin America region is estimated to lead the pack with a 18 2  gain to  1 38 billion while EMEA grows 14 3  to  715 6 million  US sales are projected to reach  4 02 billion for a year over year climb of 11 6  
Bottom Line 
American Tower is riding the global internet growth wave through the telecommunication towers it leases out to major wireless carriers  The company looks to be a solid growth stock to bet on as its non cyclical nature paired with the global shift towards faster data speeds should bolster the company s operations for years to come 
Furthermore  the firm s investments in expanding its presence in foreign markets positions the company to fill the growing demand for telecommunications equipment  Investors looking to get in on the rapid growth in mobile data usage while collecting legally insured dividends could consider AMT as a potential play to make

The U S  cell tower market is currently dominated by three companies  American Tower Corp  NYSE AMT    SBA Communications Corp   NASDAQ SBAC   and Crown Castle International  NYSE CCI  Corp 
The agreement announced on Monday shows that Verizon and AT T  the No  1 and No  2 biggest U S  wireless carriers  are willing to strike deals with other vendors to secure better prices for the towers they use to transmit wireless signals  analysts and company officials said 
Both carriers are seeking to add to their network capacity at a time when consumers are using increasing amounts of cellular data 
Carriers are  always looking for alternative partners to lessen their dependence on the big three guys   said Jonathan Chaplin  analyst at New Street Research 
As part of the agreement  Tillman will construct the towers and AT T and Verizon will serve as anchor tenants  Construction will begin in the first quarter of 2018 
 This is Verizon and AT T working together with a new provider to put some competition into the mix   said Susan Johnson  AT T s senior vice president of supply chain  in an interview  adding   we do really hope this will be a future model

137468,358983,AMT,Sprint in new talks to merge with T Mobile  sources,news,"By Greg Roumeliotis  Reuters    Sprint Corp  N S  has restarted talks to merge with T Mobile US Inc  O TMUS   people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday  the latest effort to bring together the fourth and third largest U S  wireless carriers  The combined company would have more than 127 million customers and could create more formidable competition for the No  1 and No  2 wireless players   Verizon Communications  Inc  N VZ  and AT T Inc  N T   amid a race to expand offerings in 5G  the next generation of wireless technology  T Mobile s and Sprint s previous round of negotiations ended in November over valuation disagreements  Since then  Sprint s shares have lost more than a fifth of their value amid questions about how the company can compete effectively under the weight of its long term debt of more than  32 billion   Sprint s majority owner  SoftBank Group Corp  T 9984   has been looking to trim its debt  which reached 15 8 trillion yen   147 billion  as of the end of December  It has said it is planning to raise cash by taking its Japanese mobile phone unit public this year  Sprint and T Mobile decided to restart talks partly because they want to share the financial burden of investing in their networks  the sources said  The negotiations are at an early stage  the sources added  A key consideration in the talks is Germany s Deutsche Telekom AG s  DE DTEGn  ability to consolidate T Mobile s earnings  one of the sources said  Deutsche Telekom owns 63 percent of T Mobile  which has emerged as one of its more prized assets  Deutsche Telekom would likely have to put in new money toward a merger for its stake to remain above 50 percent  The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential  Sprint declined to comment  while T Mobile did not immediately respond to requests for comment  Shares of Sprint closed off their intraday high but still up more than 17 percent at  6 02  giving the company a market capitalization of  25 billion  after the Wall Street Journal first reported on the new talks   Shares of T Mobile gained 5 67 percent to  63 13  giving it a market capitalization of  54 billion  Failure to clinch an agreement last November left SoftBank Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son  a dealmaker who raised close to  100 billion for his Vision Fund to invest in technology companies  in search of other options for Sprint   SoftBank has to change the way they approach this   Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner said   Unless they have changed their minds   and admitted  that they are indeed the junior partner  nothing has changed   Even though Sprint s customer base has expanded under CEO Marcelo Claure  growth has been driven by heavy discounting  Analysts have said that  without T Mobile  Sprint lacks the scale needed to invest in its network and to compete in a saturated market   It is impossible for Sprint to sustain on its own  and the same problems still exists with SoftBank and Sprint not comfortable with a minority stake   MoffettNathanson LLC analyst Craig Moffett said   But ultimately you have to believe that these two companies will end up together even if the path to get there is torturous    T Mobile has fared better than Sprint  even if it remains a distant third to Verizon and AT T  It has managed to score sustained market share gains  as innovative offerings  improving network performance and good customer service attract new customers  according to Moody s Investors Service Inc   T Mobile became the first major U S  carrier to eliminate two year contracts  a shift quickly embraced by consumers and copied by competitors  The company has also badgered rivals with its unlimited data plans  REGULATORY CONCERNS Another roadblock to the deal could be regulatory hurdles  Sprint s and T Mobile s first round of merger talks ended in 2014 after the Obama administration expressed antitrust concerns about the deal  The big four wireless providers have been heavily discounting their cellphone plans in a battle for consumers  and consumer advocates fret that a merger of T Mobile and Sprint could reverse that trend  It was not immediately clear how the Trump administration would view the combination  AT T agreed to acquire U S  media company  Time Warner  Inc  N TWX  in October 2016 for  85 billion  The U S  Department of Justice has sued to block the deal over concerns about the companies  pricing power in the media market  AT T and Time Warner are currently defending their deal in court  Caroline Holland  a veteran of the Justice Department s Antitrust Division who is now a Mozilla tech policy fellow  said that Sprint and T Mobile would likely argue that their combination would mean more effective competition for Verizon and AT T   They are probably betting that they can make a competent and convincing argument that it s more important to have a stronger No  3  They ll make a case that Sprint hasn t been a strong competitor   she said    I have a very healthy skepticism  I think four competitors has benefited consumers

137490,359005,AMT,1 REIT To Avoid And 2 Better Stock Picks,opinion,"Investors have finally pitched a tent above the  WeWork   NYSE WEWK  circus  Should we REIT  real estate investment trust  shareholders be concerned about a fallout 
The stock was touted in some circles as a potential savior for the office REIT market  As fewer and fewer employees work in traditional workspaces  co working spots have popped up all over the place in recent years 
Your income strategist knows from experience  Back in 2012 I was a founding tenant for a new tech focused co working location here in town  I m an introvert when I work and found it impossible to take a phone call with everyone yapping in the place  My pup Bianca  however  enjoyed her role as greeter 
Two Startups Ago  Same Pup




To her dismay  I soon started my next company and we bounced in three months to grab our own office space down the street  This was before WeWork made its way to the West Coast  Their locations are nice  but c mon  this is just white collar office space we re talking about 
Fast forward to today  and Mr  Market finally sniffed out that WeWork is nothing more than a REIT   NYU professor and entrepreneur Scott Galloway pointed this out as he picked apart the firm s comically poor corporate governance   And REITs trade as a multiple of their FFO  funds from operations   which is a problem when there is no FFO  WeWork s operations gobble up its funds and more  so the intrinsic value of the firm is closer to zero than the  20 to  30 billion valuation the business model less company was looking for from the public markets 
But this isn t our problem  WeWork doesn t pay a dividend  and it s nowhere close to initiating a payout  which means it is disqualified from our perfect retirement portfolio considerations  But are there REITs renting space to WeWork that we should now be concerned about 
Not really  Nareit  the association for REITs  reports that only 15 REIT owned properties rent to WeWork  The rapidly falling angel accounts for just 0 2  of REIT owned office space 
Does this mean we should look for dips to buy  No  because the offices are right up there with brick and mortar retail locations  I ve been warning income investors about retail REITs since 2016 because the business model of in person sales is permanently impaired by the Internet 
Same goes for office space  Who wants to commute when you can  telecommute  and work the entire morning in your pajamas  A 20 step commute to the home office beats the 20 minute drive to the shared office any day 
WeWork was all hype  We re better off focusing on real megatrends and identifying landlord opportunities that will benefit  Here are two  pick and shovel  REIT plays that most investors aren t considering   And unlike WeWork  these business models are recession proof to boot  
Industrial space is more nuanced  and in higher demand  than places to merely plug in a laptop  Industrial landlord  W P Carey Inc   NYSE WPC  has a nice portfolio that includes automotive  construction and warehouse properties 
While WeWork s tenants can leave whenever they want  WPC locks in its tenants long term  Virtually all  99   of WPC s leases include contractual rent increases  And 65  of them are linked to the consumer price index  CPI  for inflation protection  It s a rare REIT that is well positioned for any rate environment 
The leases are long ones  too  The average length  weighted by value  is more than a decade  If you re convinced we re going to have a recession in the next year or two  this is the lease portfolio for you  Less than 4  of WPC s leases expire before the end of 2020 
We added WPC to our Contrarian Income Report portfolio at a bargain this January when other  first level  investors were selling everything they owned  We ve enjoyed total returns  including dividends  of 44  in just ten months 
A REIT Run by Grown Ups




Moving back to the flashier side  I m hearing from subscribers who are asking me about ways to play 5G  Well  I m a tech guy who gets a new phone every two years  I just got my new Samsung  KS 005930  Note 10  and I did not opt for the 5G version because I don t anticipate my cell phone network being upgraded significantly between now and my next Note 

However  there s no arguing that we re doing more and more with our phones  Our tendency to stare at our phones all day may not be good for conversation but it s great for REIT American Tower Corp  NYSE AMT   The cell tower operator is a landlord for mobile phone traffic  collecting rents via its 170 000 towers  from carriers such as AT T  NYSE T  and Verizon  NYSE VZ   Think of AMT as a  toll bridge  for cell phone traffic 
I recommended AMT to Hidden Yields subscribers 11 months ago  and the stock has already run 41  higher  We ve also received not one  not two  but three dividend raises 
A REIT Play on 5G  and 4G 




AMT s price is a bit high for me to recommend adding new money here  I ve got a better idea  another dividend grower that I believe has the potential to return an AMT like 41  over the next 11 months 
I ll have the details for you in this Friday s edition of Hidden Yields  Unfortunately  if you re reading this  it s probably because you re not yet a subscriber to HY 
If fast 41  gains are not a problem for you  then I d like to invite you to take my dividend growth focused service for a spin  The service is a double digit return machine  as we re sitting on gains of 94   69  and 81

137491,359006,AMT,Has American Tower Corporation  AMT  Outpaced Other Finance Stocks This Year ,opinion,"Investors focused on the Finance space have likely heard of American Tower Corporation  NYSE AMT   but is the stock performing well in comparison to the rest of its sector peers  A quick glance at the company s year to date performance in comparison to the rest of the Finance sector should help us answer this question 
American Tower Corporation is one of 846 companies in the Finance group  The Finance group currently sits at  8 within the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different groups  measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the sector to gauge the strength of each group 
The Zacks Rank is a proven system that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions  highlighting a variety of stocks that are displaying the right characteristics to beat the market over the next one to three months  AMT is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  
Over the past 90 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMT s full year earnings has moved 1 92  higher  This means that analyst sentiment is stronger and the stock s earnings outlook is improving 
Based on the latest available data  AMT has gained about 40 32  so far this year  Meanwhile  stocks in the Finance group have gained about 13 48  on average  This means that American Tower Corporation is outperforming the sector as a whole this year 
Looking more specifically  AMT belongs to the REIT and Equity Trust   Other industry  which includes 117 individual stocks and currently sits at  83 in the Zacks Industry Rank  On average  this group has gained an average of 27 22  so far this year  meaning that AMT is performing better in terms of year to date returns

137492,359007,AMT,This Surprising Fund Has Soared 59 ,opinion,"If you own closed end funds  CEFs   I have great news  equity CEFs are doing exactly what we want them to  crushing the market while handing us 7   dividends 
 And if you re not yet in CEFs  or want to bulk up your CEF holdings  sit tight  I ll name a fund you can buy shortly  It has an extra kick in store  thanks to an over torqued corporate failure  I m looking at you  WeWork  
First  here s what stocks have done this year 
Stocks Soar  




And here s what CEFs are up to  with the beige line at the top being the equity CEFs tracked by  service  
  But Equity CEFs Skyrocket  with 7   dividends 




Source  CEF Insider
That s a 23   gain  And it includes an average dividend yield four times higher than what the S P 500 pays  If we go just a little bit deeper  we arrive at one corner of the CEF world  and one fund  that s primed for yet another gap higher 
Real Estate  50  Gains Are Only Act 1




The five best performing CEFs in 2019 have one thing in common  besides being up 50  year to date  on average   they all hold American real estate  specifically high yielding  
REITs are soaring this year  for good reason  as industry analysts NAREIT noted in early 2019  capitalization rates  or the ratio of the income a property generates compared to that property s value  were quietly rising as growing consumer spending drove companies to rent more real estate 
Of course  none of this means we ll see an end to panicky headlines about real estate  and any negative news would nicely set us up to buy REITs specifically REIT focused CEFs on dips 

Doing so is always a smart move  because REITs  shown below by the SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF  NYSE RWR   in orange  have crushed the market over the last 20 years 
REITs Reward Investors Especially on the Dips




Now let s get even more granular  with a specific REIT CEF to put on your watch list now  and the overhyped corporate collapse that could drive it to a double digit gain 

That would be the Cohen   Steers Quality Income Realty Fund Inc  NYSE RQI   which is up 59  year to date and gets us hundreds of REITs in one fund  from cell tower landlord American Tower  NYSE AMT  to warehouse operator  Prologis  Inc  NYSE PLD   RQI pays a 6 1  dividend yield that s set to rise  since the payout is a small fraction of RQI s total gains 
And then there s this 
Real Estate  Stocks  Doesn t Matter  RQI Beats It




Not only has RQI  in red above  crushed the S P 500 through its history  but it s also beaten the REIT index fund by a massive 70 percentage points  That makes RQI one of the best funds to buy whenever the market freaks out over non events  And its next freakout may be just around the corner 
This Crumbling Startup Could Give Us Our In
If you ve been following the world of startups  you ve probably heard about the latest IPO disaster  the fall of WeWork 
WeWork is a co working juggernaut that rents out space to freelancers and small businesses  It s spent billions to fuel its growth  has expanded internationally and is backed by the  100 billion Softbank Vision fund 
When the WeWork IPO recently collapsed due to its overpriced valuation of  47 billion  it seemed increasingly likely that the company would downsize  or maybe go bankrupt 
Here s where this ties into REITs  WeWork has signed multi year lease agreements with offices around the world  If it breaks those leases  the high profile nature of this failure could result in a REIT selloff 
And that would be a terrific buying opportunity  because while WeWork is big for the co working market  at 6 5 million square feet  there s 87 billion square feet of office space in the US  So a WeWork failure would affect just 0 007  of the total 
Of course  headline driven first level investors wouldn t take the time to find that out  and would likely be quick to sell any REITs on the news  That would give us a perfect chance to jump in and grab some upside and inflated dividend yields  too 
4 Big 8 8  Dividends to Grab as WeWork Implodes
Don t worry  we re not going to sit on our hands and wait for WeWork s demise to grab ourselves some nice 6   yields  and upside  
We re going to jump in now and start tapping an even bigger dividend  I m talking a massive 8 8  yield  and big price gains to the tune of 20   upside in the next year 
We re going to do it with the 4 incredible funds I m recommending to my paying CEF Insider subscribers now 
These 4 income plays hand you that 8 8  average payout I just mentioned  Some pay even more  like Pick No  4  which throws off an amazing 10 7  dividend now  Its team of pros  which  by the way  charge one of the lowest management fees in CEFs  has dominated the market 
These Managers Work Cheap and Pay You 10 7 




The kicker  This retirement changing fund comes to you at a ridiculous discount  setting us up for even more upside and fast

Pent up demand for single family rental homes  self storage units  data center space and cell towers are poised to boost performance for REITs this year  Real estate companies have used the low interest rate environment to refinance their debt at lower rates  reducing their overall debt and building up cash for investments instead of borrowing heavily like they did in the past  The industry is also less economically sensitive with investments in data centers and cell towers  which are not as dependent on consumer wealth  Let s take a look at what REITs can provide security for investors in a time of economic uncertainty

As far as 401 K  options go  VDIGX is a good one  It s outperformed the S P 64  to 57  over the last five years  largely thanks to its  pullback proof  qualities  It really shines in turbulent years like ours 
Why I Don t Diversify Beyond VDIGX
Now before you go looking for VDIGX  let s talk about two important things 
The fund closed itself to new money back in 2016  This means existing shareholders can buy more  but you can t if you don t yet own a share 
This is a blessing in disguise because you can do better than VDIGX 
How  By improving on its winning formula 
Step  1  Buy Only the Fastest Growing Dividends
Dividends drive the stock market  While current yields provide a significant part of today s return  it is the growth of these dividends that determines tomorrow s return 
Let s spy on VDIGX s holdings to see how this works  Its number five position  PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP   has made its investors rich thanks to its ability to grow its dividend  Check out the orange staircase below that s the payout that PepsiCo hikes every year  Its stock price  blue line below  is attracted to the payout curve like a magnet  Here s their relationship since the beverage maker began paying a dividend 
Every Pepsi Payout Refreshes the World
And we can see that over the last five years  its 46  payout growth has perfectly predicted its 46  price gains 
For the Love of It s Dividend 
PepsiCo s payout growth has slowed in recent years as it s filled the market for sugar water  Sub 10  annual dividend growth should be unacceptable for true dividend growth investors like us  I have no choice but to tolerate it with VDIGX  given my Vanguard restriction  but you don t have to take it  Here s an easy way to ditch the rearview mirror 
Step  2  Focus on Future Dividend Growth
PepsiCo s best years of payout growth are behind it  Same goes for many Dividend Aristocrats  the stocks that have hiked their dividends for 25 or more consecutive years  They are treated like royalty  so their valuations are always high and their current yields are rather low  But it doesn t make sense to reward past accomplishments since the stock market is a forward looking vehicle 
The best forward looking dividend growth tool that I am aware of is Reality Shares  DIVCON system  It ranks the dividend payers amongst the 1200 largest US companies across a variety of fundamental factors  including profitability  earnings growth  cash flow and leverage  As I write these are DIVCON s five favorite stocks 

A one click way to invest in this system s top ideas is the DIVCON Leaders Dividend ETF  LEAD   It holds the top 61 names and shuffles its deck yearly to boot any stocks that drop and buy those that rise in its rankings 
Since you ve read this far  I m sure you believe there is room for further improvement  You re right  My third secret goes beyond the machines and screens to require some human oversight  We re going to take the top ideas above and cherry pick opportunities where a  dividend magnet  is outpacing its price 
Step  3  Find the Runaway Dividend Magnet
My Contrarian Income Report readers will fondly remember Medical Properties Trust  MPW   a hospital landlord we bought and later sold for 105  total returns  MPW s dividend magnet was part of our secret  and the fact that we bought when the price was lagging dividend growth and sold after it had overtaken it  The  up  arrows below show good times to be a buyer  while the  down  arrows indicate times to hold or sell 
The Cues from a Dividend Magnet
VDIGX holding American Tower  NYSE AMT  had a runaway dividend magnet last November when I recommended the stock for my Hidden Yields subscribers  At the time  I wrote 
Investors have enjoyed 172  payout growth over the last five years  But they ve actually been shortchanged thus far in terms of returns  having to settle for  only  101  price gains 
AMT s Stock Price Has Further To Go
Sure enough  the dividend magnet didn t take long to pull AMT s price higher  The stock has popped 29  since that day  It s a big reason why VDIGX and my Hidden Yields portfolio have whipped the market in recent months 
Dividend Magnets Don t Care  About the S P 500 
National Storage Associates  NSA  is the best self storage stock that most investors have never heard of  While the share prices of its competitors have stagnated lately due to market saturation  NSA is more nimble and smarter 
The firm s unique strategy lets it  cherry pick  the best storage operators and locations  It puts its  stores  in high growth places  with its top 10 states  home to 92  of its facilities  being projected to grow 45  faster than the national average 
More Population Means More Demand for Self Storage
NSA the stock is too small to attract Vanguard s attention  which is a good thing for agile individual investors like us  Shares pay 4 3  today and management is in the habit of raising its dividend not once but twice per year  These  double raises  are a big reason we re well on our way to doubling our money in just a few years 
The Power of  Hidden  Yields  and Their Growth 
Would I put new money into NSA today  We can actually do even better by focusing on seven dividend growers that are flashing  buy  today 
Step  4  Seven More Stocks for 15  Returns Per Year  Forever
My research indicates each of these investments could easily pay you 15  per year  That s enough to double your money in under 5 years  Imagine  turning a retirement  pot  of  250 000 into  500 000  or   500 000 into  1 000 000  and on it goes

137563,359078,AMT,What s In Store For Crown Castle  CCI  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Crown Castle International Corp    NYSE CCI   is scheduled to release second quarter 2019 results on Jul 17  after the closing bell  The company s second quarter results are expected to reflect year over year growth in funds from operations  FFO  per share  as well as revenues 
The Houston based real estate investment trust  REIT   which is engaged in operation of wireless communication towers in the United States  surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in terms of adjusted funds from operations  AFFO  per share by 1 61  in the last reported quarter  Results reflected benefits from the company s extensive tower portfolio  high demand for infrastructure and healthy leasing activity 
Over the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions for as many misses  It delivered an average negative surprise of 0 14  during this period  The graph below depicts this surprise history 
Crown Castle International Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors at Play
Crown Castle makes money by leasing out its towers and other communication infrastructure assets  including small cell nodes to wireless service providers such as AT T   NYSE T   and Sprint   NYSE S    These providers then deploy their equipment on towers to support the wireless services  Amid growing demand for data volume and 5G network deployment  wireless carriers are expanding and enhancing their networks 
Further  the company enjoys incremental sales growth by adding new tenants to existing tower infrastructures  in turn  boosting profit margins  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter 2019 site rental revenues will likely marginally improve to  1 232 million  sequentially 
As mobile devices and connections are evolving from lower generation network connectivity to higher generation ones  like 4G  LTE and 5G  this is facilitating growth in carrier network investments  This secular growth trend in the cellular tower sector is benefiting tower companies  such as Crown Castle and American Tower Corporation   NYSE AMT   
Amid this  robust small cell deployments in 2018 are anticipated to boost the company s June end quarter network service revenues from small cell deployments by 12 5  to  4 5 million 
However  amid favorable industry fundamentals  the company is facing stiff competition from other tower companies  This will likely have impacted Crown Castle s booking volumes as well as pricing power in the quarter under review  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter network services revenues from towers is pegged at  190 million  indicating a 6 4  sequential decline 
Further  net revenues from network services and other segment are pinned at  190 million  calling for an 8 2  decline from the March end quarter s reported figure 
Moreover  a highly leveraged balance sheet is another concern for Crown Castle  In addition  as carriers are looking for opportunities to rationalize spending  merger between the company s major customers is a near term headwind 
Lastly  prior to the second quarter earnings release  there is lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overtly optimistic about the company s business activities and prospects  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the to be reported quarter remained unchanged at  1 43  over the past 30 days 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Crown Castle s results will likely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here as elaborated below  You can see

137566,359081,AMT, 5 Best CEFs For Yearly Gains And Dividends,opinion,"Something unusual has happened in closed end funds  CEFs  lately a lot of new names are showing up in the leaderboard of the top long term performers 
According to my CEF Insider service  there are now 36 funds that have delivered over 15  annualized total returns over the last decade  and three have delivered over 20  annualized returns  including their hefty dividend payouts 
And today we re going to dive into five that have returned 17  and up  annualized  over the last decade  They re powerful income generators for any market  with monster dividend yields all the way up to 10 5  
Let s get started 
Winning CEF  1  Cohen   Steers Quality Income Realty Fund  RQI 
RQI uses investors  money to build a diverse portfolio of real estate investment trusts  REITs   Top holdings include cell tower owner American Tower  NYSE AMT   apartment landlord Essex Property Trust  NYSE ESS  and senior center operator Welltower  NYSE WELL  
RQI s REIT focused strategy has paid off handsomely  putting the fund s 10 year annualized return at 23 1  
Big Gains Over the Long Term
Not only has RQI outperformed the S P 500 index  but it s also trading at a 2 7  discount to its net asset value  NAV  or the market value of the investments in its portfolio   That makes it more than worthy of your attention now  especially when you factor in its nice 6 8  dividend yield 
Winning CEF  2  Cohen   Steers REIT   Preferred Income Fund  RNP 
On the surface  RNP looks a lot like RQI  but there s a big difference  Although the same managers oversee both funds  RNP diversifies by mixing preferred stocks and REITs in a single high income fund 
This strategy gets you exposure to both REITs and financial companies  as financial stocks are the main issuers of preferreds  while giving you a 6 7  yield and a fund that s returned 21 4  annualized in the last 10 years 
REIT Preferred Stock Mix Pays Off
While RNP has returned slightly less than its cousin  a big part of its appeal is its discount to NAV  at 6 1   despite its massive outperformance  RNP looks primed to pop right now 
Winning CEF  3  Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund  NRO 
NRO is another REIT fund from a different management team  Neuberger Berman  As a more conventional asset manager based in New York  Neuberger Berman is well known among the elites and ultra wealthy  And they do a great job  which is why NRO has returned a solid 19 3  annualized over the last decade 
A Big Gainer With a Huge Dividend
NRO s main strength  Income 
With a 9 3  dividend yield  this is a cash machine that can sustain big payouts  thanks to its market outperformance compared to both the S P 500 and a REIT index fund like the Vanguard Real Estate ETF  VNQ  over the long haul  It also holds a collection of high yield REITs  such as senior care center operators Omega Healthcare Investors  OHI  and Medical Properties Trust  MPW   Plus  at an 8 2  discount to NAV  you can pick up NRO at a bargain 
Winning CEF  4  Gabelli Multimedia Trust  GGT 
Mario Gabelli has made billions for investors over the years using sound investing principles made famous by Warren Buffett  Gabelli uses his deep Wall Street connections and disciplined investing strategy to choose the best media stocks for his Gabelli Multimedia Trust  GGT   which is why it s up 18 1  annualized over the last decade 
Solid Returns Over the Long Haul
GGT s 10 5  dividend yield means this fund is a serious income generator  too  That s driven a lot of investors to jump into GGT over the last few months  placing the fund s market price right around par with its NAV  But that trend is showing no signs of ending expect GGT to command a huge premium to NAV in the next few months  just like it s done several times in the past 
Winning CEF  5  Liberty All Star Growth Fund  ASG 
While value investing works in the long term  growth investing has been the solid winner over the last decade  for an obvious reason  growth companies have been crowding out fossilized business models with new tech and new ideas  Those are the kinds of companies ASG invests in 
That approach has been paying off over the last decade  Just check out its amazing 17 5  annualized return 
Massive Returns for Growth Bets
Note that ASG is far from its all time high  even as growth stocks themselves are at all time highs  This is because a lot of investors sold out of the fund in late 2018  eradicating its premium to NAV  but those investors are trickling back in at a much slower pace  That means more price gains are likely  and you can take advantage of that and ASG s healthy 7 7  dividend yield while you wait for those gains to appear 
Must Read  This 929  Winner Yields 9   and it s still cheap for now 
I don t know why anyone would mess around with ETFs paying 2  or less when you can easily bag huge 6   payouts in CEFs 
And you may not even have to switch investments to do it 
Here s what I mean  many folks have big pharma names like Celgene  NASDAQ CELG   Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  or Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  in their portfolios now  either owned directly or through an ETF 
I think you ll agree that these are far from fly by night biotech speculations  they re all established players with market caps of at least  60 billion 
There s just one problem  ho hum dividends  The highest yielder of the bunch  Gilead  yields 3 7   And Celgene pays no dividend at all 
But with a few quick moves  you can hold these very same stocks through my favorite biotech CEF now and get one life changing  bonus   a 9  dividend 
This stealth fund is run by a dream team of researchers and financial pros from UCLA  MIT and Harvard who know which pharma companies have the drug pipelines to fuel the next generation of badly needed cures 
This expert knowledge has paid off handsomely for this fund s investors  Check out the drubbing it s laid on the market in the last 20 years  with most of that return coming in CASH  thanks to my pick s huge dividend 
All Star Managers Lap the Market Again and Again
I m ready to reveal the name of this fund and 4 other CEFs ripe for buying now  These 5 critical buys yield 8   on average  and thanks to their ridiculous discounts  I m calling for 20   price gains in the coming 12 months

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
American Tower shares have added about 31 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 2  
What s Next for American Tower 
While American Tower has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s FFO outlook  Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for American Tower was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

You can see 
Walmart s shares have outperformed the Zacks Supermarkets industry in the past year   20 1  vs   18 9    backed by focus on strengthening e commerce and store operations  The Zacks analyst thinks these factors aided the company retain sturdy comps trend in first quarter fiscal 2019  wherein earnings marked its fifth straight beat 
Further  U S  comps rose for the 19th straight time  E commerce sales surged on robust Walmart com and online grocery performances  Encouragingly  e commerce sales are expected to rise nearly 35  in fiscal 2020  The company is also making efforts to improve its International unit by shifting focus to profitable countries 
However  the addition of Flipkart was a drag on Walmart s operating income  Moreover  transportation costs  compelling pricing strategy and tariff related worries are threats to margins  Nonetheless  the Flipkart deal bodes well for the long term 
Shares of American Tower have outperformed the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust industry in the past three months   13  vs   4 4    The company s first quarter 2019 results were marred by year over year decline in revenues from the service segment and lower cash from operations 
However  the Zacks analyst thinks higher use of mobile data is fueling demand for space on the company s telecom towers  This is expected to enable American Tower to experience splendid leasing activity and organic tenant billings growth in the upcoming quarters  With higher investments in 4G and the upcoming 5G technology  wireless carriers will densify their respective network 
Hence  the company is strengthening its portfolio and focusing on innovation to capture underlying opportunities  Yet  it has a substantially leveraged balance sheet  However  the accelerated Indian carrier consolidation driven churn and high customer concentration are risks 
U S  Bancorp s shares have underperformed the Zacks Major Banks industry over the past six months  losing  6 7  vs  3   Yet  the company possesses an impressive earnings surprise history  having beaten expectations in three of the trailing four quarters 
First quarter results reflect top line strength and higher loans  partially offset by elevated expenses  The Zacks analyst thinks U S  Bancorp will likely get support from its solid business model  core franchise  lower tax rate  higher interest rates and diverse revenue streams 
Also  its capital deployment activities continue to enhance shareholder value  However  escalating expenses due to ongoing investments in technology and likely increase in legal expenses remain concerns  Also  significant exposure to commercial loans remains a headwind

Chicago  IL   May 22  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    AT T Inc    NYSE T    American Tower Corp    NYSE AMT    Crown Castle International Corp    NYSE CCI   and SBA Communications Corp    NASDAQ SBAC   
Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  
FCC Supports Telecom Consolidation  Winners   Losers
In a landmark decision on May 20  Ajit Pai  the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission  FCC   expressed his support to the  26 5 billion proposed merger deal between T Mobile US and Sprint  With this  it appears as though the FCC will clear the deal in a majority voting  which will result in significant consolidation of the telecom industry 
Ever since President Trump came to power  the telecom industry circle has been rife with speculation that his regime may pave the way for a merger between these two companies  Notably  T Mobile US and Sprint are the third and fourth largest national telecom operators of the United States  respectively   
Change in Regulatory Stance to Aid M As
The previous administration under Barack Obama was strictly against further consolidation of the U S  telecom industry  Back then  FCC had firmly stated that it wanted at least four powerful national telecom operators in the country 
However  the restructured FCC under Trump s presidency has given enough indications of its leniency compared with the Obama administration  The FCC has already rolled back a slew of stringent regulations of the previous regime  Notable among them are the Net Neutrality laws 
DOJ Still Reluctant to the Deal
T Mobile US and Sprint have agreed to a number of terms including deploying a 5G network on low band spectrum covering 97  of the country in three years and 99  in six years after the approval of the deal 
The two companies also pledged that 90  of rural Americans will access broadband speed of 50 Mbps within six years of the deal  They have also agreed to sell Boost Mobile   the prepaid wing of Sprint 
Despite a likely approval from the FCC  the U S  Department of Justice  DOJ  is yet to give its green signal  The DOJ is concerned that the reduction from four national telecom operator to three will reduce competition and raise prices  The antitrust body is forcing the two entities to offer more concessions in terms of selling additional assets like spectrums or business divisions 
The Winners
Both T Mobile US and Sprint will benefit significantly from the proposed merger  At present  Verizon Communications Inc  and AT T Inc  together control around 68  of the U S  wireless market  The merged entity with around 32  market share will be a formidable challenger to both Verizon and AT T  Consequently  stock prices of Sprint and T Mobile US jumped 18 8  and 3 9   respectively  T Mobile US carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Notably  Verizon and AT T will also benefit as these two large telecom carriers were facing severe pricing pressure from unlimited data offerings of T Mobile US and Sprint  If these two companies merge  Verizon and AT T will face lesser competition and won t have to invest as much in marketing and promotions to retain subscribers  A decrease in promotional expenditure will raise their operating margins  Share prices of Verizon and AT T increased 1 6  and 1 2   respectively  following the news 
The Losers
Major losers of the proposed merger will be wireless tower operators like American Tower Corp   Crown Castle International Corp  and SBA Communications Corp  Yesterday  these three stocks plunged by 2 1   3  and 3 2   respectively 
Consolidation of telecom operators generally results in lower capital spending  T Mobile US and Sprint are being facilitated by the same wireless tower operators to install their cellular networks  However  a merger of these two will result in elimination of many overlapping towers and consequently  tower operators will lose on lease rentals

Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Right now  Outfront Media is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while American Tower has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that OUT has an improving earnings outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
OUT currently has a forward P E ratio of 10 81  while AMT has a forward P E of 26 36  We also note that OUT has a PEG ratio of 1 47  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  AMT currently has a PEG ratio of 1 62

137633,359148,AMT,American Tower  AMT  Misses Q1 FFO Estimates,opinion,"American Tower  NYSE AMT  came out with quarterly funds from operations  FFO  of  1 84 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 86 per share  This compares to FFO of  1 73 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of  1 08   A quarter ago  it was expected that this wireless communications infrastructure company would post FFO of  2 30 per share when it actually produced FFO of  2 40  delivering a surprise of 4 35  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates three times 
American Tower  which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Other industry  posted revenues of  1 81 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 82   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 74 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
American Tower shares have added about 21 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 16 4  
What s Next for American Tower 
While American Tower has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s FFO outlook  Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for American Tower was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus FFO estimate is  1 95 on  1 84 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  7 78 on  7 37 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  REIT and Equity Trust   Other is currently in the bottom 30  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-05-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/american-tower-amt-misses-q1-ffo-estimates-200416700,200416700
137634,359149,AMT,2  Unicorn  Stocks Yielding Up To 10  And Set To Soar  In Any Market ,opinion," Brett  where the heck do I find cheap dividends in this market  
A desperate reader asks this question almost daily 
I ll be honest  with the market up double digits this year  it s been tough for me to sift out cheap  pullback proof  7   payers to recommend   But not impossible  I ve turned up two absurdly cheap funds yielding up to 10   see below  
 Pullback Proof  Dividends Are Endangered But Not Extinct
You probably noticed I said  pullback proof  a second ago  By that I mean stocks with the secret ingredient everyone craves  high dividends you can pocket without the underlying stock melting away in a meltdown 
That  by the way  is the opposite of what classic defensive food stock General Mills  NYSE GIS  does  This dividend dumpster fire boasts a so called  generous  payout  current yield  4   and is  too  widely seen as safe because people have to eat  no matter what the economy does 
The truth is  GIS is neither safe nor generous  But folks get lured in time after time  and I hate to see it 
GIS Steals Shareholders  Income
This chart shows the fate suffered by the poor souls who took the bait in January 2018  A year later  they d eaten a 34  loss  on a price basis   That s 10 years  worth of dividend payouts  GONE in just 12 months 
So much for safety 
The fix is in again  GIS rallied 32  in the last four months and now trades at a ridiculous 20 2 times earnings  nearly double its December multiple 
 Safe  Pick About to Inflict More Pain
I refuse to bet my golden years on a schizophrenic stock like this especially now   Click here for more on why GIS is a deadly dividend you must avoid at all costs  
How to Prevent a 2008 Portfolio Repeat
One proven way to shield your nest egg from the next crash is to add stocks trading below their true value  Even better if you can find these  unicorns  now  when almost everything is up sharply 
It only makes sense  If a stock is dirt cheap with the market on a high  it ll have a tough time getting cheaper in the next pullback 
Which brings us back to the question  where do we find these stout payers 
The answer is not with GIS and its ilk  We need to go further  to one of my favorite income plays  closed end funds  CEFs  
These funds are so far off the radar that 80  of them trade for less than they re worth today  That s crazy when you consider there are plenty of CEFs boasting steady dividends of 6  and up 
Let s dive into why these funds are such terrific bargains now  Then I ll show you two CEFs yielding up to 10  that have crushed the market and still have plenty of gains ahead 
An Income Hunter s Paradise
First off  don t let the jargon y name fool you  CEFs are dead ringers for mutual funds mostly  But they do boast a key difference  aside from their outsized 6   dividends  
Unlike mutual funds and ETFs  most CEFs trade wildly out of step and usually at a big discount to the value of their portfolios 
How big of a discount 
Deals of 15  and more are common  And when these markdowns snap shut  they  slingshot  the CEF s price to a huge gain  I ve seen it happen time and time again 
Which brings me to 
CEF Pick No  1  Gabelli s  Discount Slingshot 
Our first CEF pick  the Gabelli Dividend and Income Fund  NYSE GDV   a long time favorite of mine  demonstrates this  slingshot  perfectly 
On December 21  this fund run by famed investor Mario Gabelli and yielding a gaudy 6  today traded at a way oversold 12  discount to NAV 
Fast forward to today  and this discount has narrowed to 8 4   That doesn t sound like a big change  but it was enough to whip GDV past the S P 500 
Narrowing Discount Ignites GDV
Here s the best part  even today s 8 4  discount is still well below GDV s 7 3  average discount in the last 12 months  And this fund regularly trades for even slimmer markdowns than that  so our slingshot still has plenty of snap left 
Market Dominator Goes for a Song
This is a terrific deal for GDV  which relies on Gabelli s proven eye for bargains to hand us that nice 6  cash stream 
CEF Pick No  2  A Monster 10  Dividend at a Fire Sale Price
Our next CEF uses my other favorite income plays  real estate investment trusts  REITs   to hand us an incredible 10 3  income stream 
It s the Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund  NYSE NRO   and it holds REITs powered by megatrends that will be with us for decades  Think surging demand mobile data  cell tower owners Crown Castle  NYSE CCI  and American Tower  NYSE AMT  and aging baby boomers  senior care provider Omega Healthcare Investors  NYSE OHI  
Like GDV  NRO traded at an absurd 12  discount at the start of the year  ts discount has only narrowed slightly since 
NRO s Closing Discount  
But that small move was still enough to catapult NRO well past the S P 500 
  Powers a Fast Double Digit Return
The final word  Even with that big move up  the fund trades well below its 52 week average discount of 7 9  and miles below its peak of 3 1   NRO s gains are just getting started 
NEW  The 5 Best  Pullback Proof  7 5   Dividends to Buy Now
The wide discounts on NRO and GDV means both CEFs will likely hold their own in the next market brush fire  But neither makes my list of the very best pullback proof dividends to own now 
My team and I have scoured the market to come up with these 5 steady income plays  Unlike pretenders such as GIS  these 5 high yield buys are purpose built to fend off the next market tsunami and skyrocket when the dust settles 
These 5 just released picks give us two things you must have in any stock you buy now 
A rock solid  and growing  7 5  average dividend one of these 5 sturdy income plays even yields an amazing 8 5  
A share price that doesn t crumble beneath your feet while you re collecting those massive payouts  In fact  these 5 steady Eddie picks are so cheap I m calling for 7  to 15  price upside in the next 12 months 
One more thing about that 8 5  payer I just mentioned  check out how it performed on a price basis  not even including its massive 8 5  cash payout  in 2018 a year most folks would rather forget 
A  Pullback Proof  Superstar in Action
That s right  owners of this stock actually made money while the rest of the market fell on its face 
This is the kind of performance all 5 of these high yield plays are poised to deliver  I m ready to share the details on each one with you now

   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderAccording to a  by Arbor Realty  lending activity for new multi family loans picked up pace in the fourth quarter  resulting in year over year growth of 3 7   In fact  loan origination volumes  for loans with original balances between  1 million and  5 million  reached  51 7 billion in 2018  Notably  escalating demand for refinancing  stemming from the sector s high indebtedness likely aided this level of lending activity Amid these  we expect the company s Agency business to have closed significant loan originations that will help enjoy strong margins  Further  its servicing portfolio enjoys predictable annuity income Also  during the quarter  Arbor Realty closed three single family rental portfolio refinancing deals amounting to  66 4 million under the Freddie Mac Single Family Rental pilot  These efforts have enabled the company to strengthen its position in the single family rental market Importantly  for fourth quarter 2018  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s interest income is pegged at  69 2 million and represents an impressive jump of 50 3  on a year over year basis Additionally  the company raised fresh capital during the quarter by issuing common shares in a public offering  This transaction generated additional capital and the company intends to use the proceeds in business related investments However  high competition in the lending market is likely to result in aggressive pricing  thereby  impacting Arbor Realty s margins and bottom line growth Hence  there is lack of any solid catalyst prior to the fourth quarter earnings release  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of AFFO for the to be reported quarter remained unchanged at 27 cents  over the past month  Nonetheless  AFFO is projected to be up 8  year over year Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Arbor Realty is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Earning ESP  Arbor Realty s Earnings ESP is 0 00  Zacks Rank  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need a positive ESP to be confident of the earnings beat Stocks That Warrant a LookHersha Hospitality Trust   NYSE HT    scheduled to release earnings on Feb 25  has an Earnings ESP of  3 81  and a Zacks Rank of 2  You can see Sabra Health Care REIT  NYSE WELL   Inc    NASDAQ SBRA    slated to release fourth quarter results on Feb 24  has an Earnings ESP of  5 49  and a Zacks Rank of 3 American Tower Corporation   NYSE AMT    set to release earnings on Feb 27  has an Earnings ESP of  0 29  and carries a Zacks Rank of 3 Note  Anything related to earnings presented in this write up represents funds from operations  FFO    a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ",2019-02-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/key-factors-to-impact-arbor-realtys-abr-q4-earnings-200387391,200387391

137684,359199,AMT,Three Mutual Funds Paying Up To 8 6 ,opinion,"If you re worried that stocks are expensive again  well  they are  The current bull market is making a run at history  But it s also costly to stay in cash  and lock in zero income   Fortunately  it s possible to buy some downside protection with yield 
I understand the  I m worried so I m sitting in cash  concern  And I know many investors who continue to sit on their money and hope for a big pullback  But wouldn t it be nicer to bank 32  total returns with 8   9  or even 10  or more of it coming as dividends 
Those who stayed with Omega Healthcare Investors Inc  NYSE OHI    a big paying REIT   have done much better than their scared cash hoarder friends  as well as the broader market in general  Last year actually started inauspiciously as OHI announced a dividend  freeze   The stock slipped  But a freeze isn t the same as a cut   and OHI s payout was well covered by its funds from operations   FFO    more on why this matters shortly  
The misunderstanding would soon be our gain  as the stock yielded 10   thanks to years of previous dividend hikes   And anytime that OHI has paid double digits in the past  it marked a major bottom for the stock  So why would this time be any different 
OHI s Dividend Limits Its Price Downside
Let s  zoom in  to see how OHI rallied off its most recent double digit high to return 32  including dividends 
Better Than Cash   A Big Yield with Upside
Secure yields are truly the  rubber duckies  of the investing world  Mr  Market can push them underwater for a period of time  but eventually  they rocket up to the surface 
With that in mind  let s  zig  a zagging stock market by discussing three high paying mutual funds  Big dividends plus a human at the wheel   that s my idea of a bear proof payout powered portfolio 
Vanguard Real Estate Index  VGSLX Type  REIT  real estate investment trusts Assets Under Management   59 billionYield  4 2 Expenses  0 12 
At a yield of just more than 4   the Vanguard Real Estate Index  VGSLX    which has a twin fund  the Vanguard Real Estate ETF  VNQ    isn t knocking the socks off high income investors  But VGSLX actually is one of the best yielding equity mutual funds in the game 
In fact  most of the top mutual funds for equity income are invested in real estate investment trusts  REITs   No surprise there  REITs are naturally income friendly thanks to their mandate to redistribute 90  or more of their taxable income back to you and me as dividends  Better still  REITs were shackled in 2018  helping to drive up yields to their highest point in roughly a decade 
VGSLX Hasn t Yielded This Much Since the 2007 09 Bear Market 
Vanguard s indexed REIT fund is weighted by market cap  so the fund is filled with blue chips such as communications infrastructure play American Tower  NYSE AMT   mall operator Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG  and logistics REIT Prologis Inc  NYSE PLD 
It s a worthy fund that has served its shareholders well since inception in 2001  and it does allow investors to keep almost all of their returns with a cheap expense ratio  That said  if you re looking to bundle REITs together in a fund  this is one area where active management tends to shine  In fact  several CEFs yield far more than VGSLX and have bested Vanguard s offering over the long term 
Let s move on 
AB High Income  AGDAX Type  High Yield BondAssets Under Management   5 9 billionYield  7 6 Expenses  0 82  
Next up is a no brainer in the high yield field  junk bonds 
You can get plenty of yield out of just the American junk market  but AB High Income  AGDAX  takes things a step farther by breaking out its passport and delving into developed market and emerging market bonds  too 
AGDAX actually invests in more than just junk debt  High yield corporates make up 44  of the fund  with another 10  in collateralized mortgage obligations  9  in investment grade corporates  9  in emerging market sovereign debt  6  in  global governments  and the rest peppered among other types of income investments 
Of Course  Junk Has Had a Rough Go Of It Lately  
Unlike with the indexed VGSLX  AllianceBernstein s fund has plenty of managerial brainpower to go around  Its five manager team averages nearly 26 years of experience apiece  including 21 years apiece at AB 
But boy  is it costly  The 0 82  in annual fees isn t all that bad   you ll typically find that in CEFs   but what you won t find is an additional 4 25  sales charge that AB charges for these A shares  That will cost you literally thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars over the course of your investment 
Templeton Emerging Markets Bond  FEMGX Type  Emerging Markets BondAssets Under Management   35 2 millionYield  8 6 Expenses  1 17  
Emerging market bonds are one of the highest yielding assets you can invest in  The inherent enhanced risk of less developed countries   complete with higher levels of corruption  geopolitical risk and less regulated markets   forces sky high yields to compensate investors for their trouble 
In the case of Templeton Emerging Markets Bond  FEMGX   you re getting well north of 8  for that trouble  but you re also actually putting a cap on your risk  See  FEMGX   under the managing team of Michael Hasenstab  Calvin Ho and Laura Burakreis   holds 124 different positions across a number of EMs  such as Brazil  Argentina  Ghana  Indonesia and Thailand 
Management typically wants to invest 80  of the portfolio in EM bonds  but they can use their discretion should opportunity dry up  In fact  at the moment  less than 60  of the portfolio is invested in bonds  with the rest parked in cash 
But those managerial decisions will cost you   in fact  even more than AGDAX 
These Returns Look Even Worse After Costs
FEMGX charges a steep 4 25  maximum sales charge  as well as 1 17  in annual expenses  But it doesn t stop there  There s also a potential 0 75  CDSC  deferred sales charge   and a 0 25  12b 1 fee  marketing   to swallow 
Worse  
It s Not Even Beating the Index Fund
Management certainly earns its fees at times  but it s hard pressed to keep up with its own litany of charges 
I m keeping an eye on these three funds  but I don t think it s time to buy them just yet  I ve got three more high paying plays I like even better right now with great growth potential on top of their generous current yields 
The 3 Best Bear Proof Buys  with 8   Dividends  Right Now
With the recent market insanity you ve probably thought about dumping   or at least reducing   your stock holdings and focus on fixed income investments as you near and enter retirement  It sounds like a smart move  but going lean on stocks leaves you open to two big risks 
That you ll outlive your savings  and
You ll miss out on the long term gains only the stock market can offer 
So why not blend a portfolio of 8   bond funds with smart stock picks that provide you with similarly high yields with upside to boot  Sure  they may  sell off  a bit if the markets pull back  But who cares  Like a savvy rich speculator  you ll be able to step in and buy more shares when they are cheap   without having to worry about your next capital withdrawal 
Let s revisit healthcare landlord Omega Healthcare Industries  OHI   The firm s payout is usually generous  and always reliable   yet  for whatever reason  its sometimes manic price action gives investors heartburn 
But it shouldn t  It s actually quite predictable  Check out the chart below  and you ll notice 
When the stock s yield is high  orange line   its price is low  Investors should buy here 
When the stock s price is high  blue line   its yield is low  Investors should hold here and enjoy their dividend payments

137686,359201,AMT,What s In The Cards For Realty Income s  O  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,Realty Income Corp    NYSE O   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2018 results after the market closes on Feb 20  The company s results are anticipated to reflect year over year increase in revenues  while its funds from operations  FFO  per share might witness a decline In the last reported quarter  this monthly dividend paying real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a better than expected performance in terms of FFO per share  The company benefited from year over year growth in revenues and also enjoyed high occupancy levels Notably  Realty Income has a mixed surprise history  The company surpassed estimates in two occasions  met in another and missed in the other  over the trailing four quarters  resulting in average positive surprise of 0 63   This is depicted in the graph below Realty Income Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    For full year 2018  Realty Income expects adjusted FFO per share of  3 18  3 21  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pinned at  3 13 Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderThis freestanding retail REIT derives more than 90  of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants belonging to service  non discretionary and low price retail businesses  Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions  as well as competition from Internet retailing  Moreover  the company s portfolio is well diversified with respect to tenant  industry  geography  and property type  which contributes to the stability of its cash flow In addition  the healthy U S  economy and job market gains are important catalysts for the retail real estate industry s growth  Particularly  increase in corporate profits and tax cuts are pushing up wages  As such  consumer confidence is getting a boost  fueled by job growth and rising wages  And along with low gas prices  disposable income of consumers has increased as well which is likely to spur demand for retail goods  This is anticipated to have sent across positive ripple effects across the industry in the to be reported quarter In addition  the company focuses on external growth through exploring accretive acquisition opportunities  In the quarter under review  healthy property acquisition volume at decent investment spreads will likely aid the company s performance Realty Income s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisition has also helped the company maintain high occupancy levels consistently  Since 1996  the company s occupancy level has not moved below 96   This trend is likely to have continued in the soon to be reported quarter as well  Further  same store rent growth is likely to exhibit limited operational volatility These are anticipated to have helped the company enjoy higher revenues in the Oct Dec quarter  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter revenues is pegged at  343 2 million  indicating a year over year rise of 10 5   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for rental revenues of  328 million also denotes a projected increase of 9 7   year over year Nonetheless  despite all these efforts  the choppy retail real estate environment might limit its growth momentum to some extent  In fact  the recent  from Reis shows that the neighborhood and community shopping center vacancy rate remained flat in the fourth quarter at 10 2   However  it inched up from 10  at year end 2017  Mall vacancy rate edged down to 9  in the quarter from 9 1  in the third quarter  At year end 2017  the mall vacancy was 8 3   In addition  the company has substantial exposure to single tenant assets which raises its risks associated with tenant default Further  prior to the fourth quarter earnings release  there is lack of any solid catalyst  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the fourth quarter remained unchanged at 75 cents  over the past month  The figure also indicates a 1 3  decline from the comparable period last year Here is what our quantitative model predicts Realty Income does not have the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Earnings ESP

137718,359233,AMT,What To Expect From Welltower s  WELL  Earnings This Season ,opinion,Welltower  Inc    NYSE WELL   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2018 results on Feb 12  before the opening bell  The company s results will likely reflect year over year growth in revenues and funds from operations  FFO  per share In the last reported quarter  this Toledo  OH based healthcare real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a positive surprise of around 2   Results highlighted healthy same store net operating income  SSNOI  performance of the company s senior housing triple net  outpatient medical and long term post acute care segments Further  Welltower posted average positive surprise of 0 01   in the last four quarters  surpassing estimates twice for as many misses  The graph below depicts this surprise history Welltower Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    For 2018  Welltower expects normalized FFO per share to lie in the band of  4 02  4 07  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at  4 03 Let s see how things have shaped up for this announcement Factors at PlayThe aging baby boomer population has increased healthcare spending and is spurring demand for senior housing facilities  Hence  Welltower s efforts to fortify its portfolio of senior housing assets during the Oct Dec quarter  amid near term challenges affecting this real estate category  are a strategic fit In fact  in December  the company announced acquisition of senior housing assets  amounting to  725 million  at a blended cap rate of 6 6  across four deals  In addition  Welltower has jointly announced its plans with Hines to co develop a luxury senior living facility  enhancing the Manhattan portfolio of the former Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter revenues from senior housing operating portfolio is expected to be  885 million  underlining 4 2  sequential growth  Accordingly  net operating income is estimated to witness a sequential rise of 4 5  to  276 million  Also  with a solid portfolio of outpatient medical properties  the  for medical office buildings  MOBs  might have buoyed the company s operating performance in the quarter  In fact  revenues from medical facilities are projected at  130 million  flat quarter on quarter Nonetheless  supply of senior housing assets in the company s markets remained high during the to be reported quarter  Since this curtails landlords  pricing power and limits growth in occupancy level  we predict the prevalent oversupply situation to have impacted the company s fourth quarter performance In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter rental income is  341 million  indicating a marginal decline sequentially Furthermore  rising interest rates is another unfavorable development for the company  Since Welltower has substantial exposure to long term leased assets that are subject to annual escalations and depends on debt for its acquisition financing  we expect the company to witness higher interest expense for the Dec end quarter  This  in turn  is anticipated to have curbed bottom line growth Lastly  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter 2018 FFO per share has

137720,359235,AMT,Will Operator Transitions Hit HCP s Occupancy In Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"HCP Inc    NYSE HCP   is slated to report fourth quarter and 2018 results on Feb 13  after the market closes  Though the company s performance will likely reflect a year over year decline in funds from operations  FFO   its top line results are anticipated to display growth 
In the last reported quarter  this Irvine  CA based healthcare real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a positive surprise of 2 33   in terms of adjusted FFO per share  Results were supported by decent performance of the company s life science and medical office segment 
The company has an impressive surprise history  In fact  over the trailing four quarters  this REIT exceeded estimates in each occasion  coming up with average positive beat of 2 75   This is depicted in the graph below 
HCP  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    
Let s see how things are shaping up  prior to this announcement 
Factors to Consider
With exposure to a variety of healthcare real estate assets  HCP s fourth quarter performance is expected to be buoyed by strength of the underlying asset classes   
Notably   for medical office buildings is expected to drive revenues in its Life Science and Medical Office segment  In fact  segmental revenues are anticipated to marginally improve to  81 million sequentially in the quarter 
Also  per an  by National Investment Center for Seniors Housing   Care  fundamentals of the senior housing real estate assets improved in the quarter  but remained soft  In fact  occupancy rate for seniors housing  including properties still in lease up  expanded 10 basis points  bps  sequentially to 88   Further  net absorption came in at 5 149 units  indicating the highest quarterly units absorbed since first quarter 2006 
Amid these  net operating income from the company s senior housing operating portfolio is expected to witness sequential growth of 7 1  to  33 06 million 
However  revenues from interest and other income are pegged at  1 21 million  indicating a sequential decline of 2 4   Furthermore  marginal decline in tenant recoveries  as well as resident fees and services  is expected to curb top line growth  
Also  as the company remains focused on lowering its Brookdale portfolio concentration  operation transitions to new partners is expected to have impacted its portfolio occupancy 
Furthermore  rising interest rates remain an impeding factor for the company  Since HCP has decent exposure to long term leased assets that are subject to annual escalations and depends on debt for its acquisition financing  we expect the company to witness higher interest expense for the Dec end quarter  This  in turn  is anticipated to have curbed bottom line growth 
In fact  HCP s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analyst confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q4 FFO remained unchanged at 43 cents in a month s time  In addition  it indicates a 10 42  year over year decline

closes  Both its revenues and funds from operations  FFO  are anticipated to reflect year over year growth In the last reported quarter  this Jacksonville  FL based retail real estate investment trust  REIT  surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share by 1 05   Results reflected growth in same property net operating income  NOI  Further  the company has a decent surprise history  It beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and met in the other  with average surprise of 1 07   This is depicted in the graph below Regency Centers Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Regency expects 2018 NAREIT FFO per share of  3 76  3 79  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pinned at  3 79 Let s see how things have shaped up for this announcement Factors at PlayAt a time when store closures and bankruptcies have curbed growth tempo of the retail real estate industry  Regency is able to differentiate itself by strategically focusing on building a premium portfolio of grocery anchored shopping centers  Such centers are usually necessity driven and drive a dependable traffic  which augurs well for steady cash flows and long term growth  Along with the presence of leading grocers in its tenant roster  the company also has restaurants and service providers Additionally  a healthy U S  economy  job market gains  high consumer confidence and low gas prices have buoyed consumers  spending power  This is evident from the 5 1  year over year growth in the retail sales figure for the 2018 holiday season  which marked the highest level in six years  according to Mastercard s SpendingPulse  This is anticipated to send across encouraging signals across the retail real estate industry In addition  the recent  from Reis shows that the neighborhood and community shopping center vacancy rate remained flat in the fourth quarter at 10 2   but marginally inched up from 10  at year end 2017  Mall vacancy rate slightly edged down to 9  in the quarter from 9 1  in the third quarter  At year end 2017  mall vacancy was 8 3   Despite the store closure issue plaguing the market  the little stability indicates slowdown in new development Amid these  we anticipate the company to have experienced decent leasing activity and top line growth during the quarter under review  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter revenues is pegged at  269 9 million  indicating a year over year improvement of 4 6  Further  the company s strategy to sell nearly 1 2  of asset base yearly provides free cash flow that can be redeployed for developments and redevelopments  Such strategic moves are expected to enhance the company s portfolio quality and drive long term growth Nonetheless  the company has a significant development and redevelopment pipeline  Amid rising construction cost scenario  we anticipate Regency to have experienced cost overruns and compressed margins in the Dec end quarter  This  in turn  is expected to impact development returns on these projects  In addition  recent efforts of online retailers to penetrate deeper into the grocery business is a concern for Regency However  prior to the fourth quarter earnings release  there is lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company s business activities and prospects  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share remained unchanged at 94 cents  over the past month  Nevertheless  it indicates a 2 2  increase year over year Here is what our quantitative model predicts Regency does not have the right combination

growing popularity of cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data  as well as the use of third party IT infrastructure by several companies Further  estimated growth rates for the artificial intelligence  autonomous vehicle and virtual augmented reality markets will remain robust over the next five to eight years  In fact  demand has been outpacing supply in top tier data center markets  These markets are absorbing new construction at an accelerated pace despite enjoying high occupancy Amid these  accretive acquisitions and development efforts are anticipated to boost top line growth for Digital Realty  The merger with DuPont  NYSE DWDP  Fabros in 2017 enhanced Digital Realty s portfolio in the top U S  data center metro areas across Northern Virginia  Chicago and Silicon Valley  It helped upgrade its hyper scale product offering and grow the company s blue chip customer base Furthermore  the company has fortified its presence in Europe  Australia and Asia in recent years through strategic acquisitions and development of high quality facilities  Particularly  in December 2018  the company s Brazilian subsidiary  Stellar Participa  es Ltda   completed the previously announced buyout of a Brazilian data center provider   Ascenty  from Great Hill Partners   in a transaction valued at around  1 8 billion Moreover  in fourth quarter 2018  in an effort to expand its

consistently strived for attaining operational excellence  Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is nearly  790 0 million  indicating 8  year over year growth  Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share of  1 67 projects an increase of 7 7  from the prior year quarter However  competition has intensified given the solid growth potential in the data center real estate market  This is likely to have resulted in aggressive pricing pressure in the to be reported quarter  In addition to this  interest expense burden remains a concern  with the company having a substantial debt position Prior to the fourth quarter earnings release  there is lack of any solid catalyst  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the fourth quarter moved down marginally to  1 67 over the past month Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Digital Realty will likely beat estimates this season  This is because a stock needs to have

137804,359319,AMT,American Tower Grows In Africa  To Buy Telkom Kenya Towers,opinion,American Tower Corporation   NYSE AMT   is set to acquire transmission towers from Telkom Kenya  The move comes as part of American Tower s expansion plans and in fact  the Kenya market will represent the company s fifth in Africa and the 17th globally Specifically  up to 723 transmission towers will be purchased for an undisclosed amount  per the Reuters   Notably  Telkom Kenya is the third biggest telecom company  in term of user count  in Kenya  It is 60  owned by London based Helios Investment Partners and 40  by the Government of Kenya   This transaction  which is likely to completed in the second half of 2018  will help Telkom Kenya unleash capital from the sellout  which can be invested in its internet network and enhance service delivery  On the other hand  the move will enable American Tower to capitalize on the expansion of mobile broadband in Kenya and fetch long term gains    Notably  there is a rising trend of telecom companies to shrug off the tower infrastructure to wireless infrastructure companies like American Tower  Crown Castle International Corp    NYSE CCI   and SBA Communications Corp    NASDAQ SBAC    This is because it helps telecom companies to avoid huge outlay of money in maintaining the expensive infrastructure and rather channelize resources on service delivery And this growing trend is offering ample scope to these infrastructure REITs to prosper  In fact  wireless services are advancing rapidly in terms of additional features and capabilities  Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of towers and equipment  Moreover  with the advent of new technologies  especially 5G and Internet of Things  IoT   companies like American Tower and Crown Castle International have higher chances of growth However  consolidation in the wireless industry might reduce demand for cell tower deployments  In fact  take the example of the recent merger news of T Mobile US Inc    NYSE S   and Sprint Corp    NYSE S    If such a deal materializes  then it can be a concern for the tower operators  This is because T Mobile US and Sprint are being facilitated by the same wireless tower operators to install their cellular networks  However  a merger of these two will result in elimination of many overlapping towers and consequently  tower operators will lose on lease rentals Nevertheless  American Tower currently continues to benefit from increased investment of wireless carriers in 4G LTE and 5G networks  Its tower buyouts in emerging markets and long term tower leases with major wireless carriers lend it a competitive edge over rivals Nevertheless  the company has a substantially leveraged balance sheet  Further  high customer concentration is likely to affect the company s top line  Additionally  the company has been affected by change in rate of foreign currencies  stiff competition and integration risks  Additionally  flaring up operating expenses remain another challenge for American Tower American Tower currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Moreover  shares of company have gained 7 6  in the past year against 2 4  decline of its   You can see  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ,2018-05-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/american-tower-grows-in-africa-to-buy-telkom-kenya-towers-200314407,200314407
137821,359336,AMT,Here s Why You Should Hold On To Crown Castle Amid Risks,opinion,On Mar 5  we issued an updated research report on Crown Castle International   NYSE CCI   Crown Castle is a leading wireless communication tower operator in the United States  It owns  operates and leases more than 40 000 cell towers and approximately 60 000 route miles of fiber supporting small cells and fiber solutions in every major U S  market Let s have a look at what s affecting the tower operator s performance UpsidesCrown Castle has been continuously trying to reposition itself from a tower company to a fiber provider  focused on the small cell opportunity   through the purchase of several fiber operators  Over the last two years  Crown Castle purchased three fiber operators  FPL FiberNet Holdings  LLC  in January 2017   Quanta Fiber  called Sunesys  in April 2015  and 24 7 Mid Atlantic Network  in September 2014   On Jun 26  2017  the company gained ownership of more than 28 000 route miles of fiber with the purchase of privately held Wilcon Holdings LLC  With the buyout of LTS Group Holdings LLC  Lightower  on Nov 1  2017  Crown Castle attained ownership of more than 60 000 route miles of fiber  Crown Castle aims to leverage the fiber assets to serve two main business lines   small cell network deployments in top metro markets and other enterprise and adjacent wholesale opportunities Meanwhile  wireless services are rapidly gaining ground based on technological advancements and network upgrades  Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of cell towers and equipment  Crown Castle successfully addresses this opportunity as more than 90  of its quarterly revenues come from wireless service providers like Verizon  AT T   NYSE T   and T Mobile US  The company has acquired 9 700 wireless towers from AT T and taken over 7 200 wireless towers of T Mobile US The deployment of 5G network should also drive growth in the company s tower and small cell assets as wireless carriers are trying to expand and improve networks  The industry has become a battleground for the 5G race  Notably  completion of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project s  3GPP  first implementable 5G New radio  NR  specification has set the stage for the global mobile industry to initiate full scale development of 5G NR for large scale trials and commercial deployments in 2019 Dividend PayoutsDuring fourth quarter 2017  Crown Castle paid common stock dividends of approximately  427 million in aggregate or  1 05 per common share  up around 11  on a per share basis from the year ago quarter We are also impressed with Crown Castle s board of directors  decision to reward stockholders with a quarterly cash dividend of  1 05 per share  payable on Mar 30  2018  to stockholders of record at the close of business on Mar 16  2018  Notably  the company portrays an impressive record of dividend payouts As investors prefer an income generating stock  a high dividend yielding one is obviously much coveted  Needless to say  investors are always on the lookout for companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments Hiked 2018 OutlookApart from the positives  Crown Castle s bright outlook for 2018 is encouraging  The company expects Site Rental revenues in the range of  4 582  4 627 million  Site Rental cost of operation is projected in the  1 360  1 405 million band  Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated between  3 049 million and  3 094 million  Interest expense  inclusive of amortization  is estimated in the  642  687 million range  FFO is expected in the range of  1 965  2 010 million  AFFO is estimated between  2 219 million and  2 264 million  Net income is anticipated between  511 million and  591 million Positive Earnings SurpriseCrown Castle has a positive earnings surprise history  The company s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters  the average beat being 5 67  Estimates Trend UpWe note that sales and earnings per share  EPS  estimates for Crown Castle have moved up for the first two quarters of 2018 as well as full year 2018  Sales for first and second quarter of 2018 are estimated at  1 31 billion and  1 33 billion  respectively  indicating year over year growth of 29  and 27 7   For 2018  sales are projected at  5 34 billion  reflecting a year over year rise of 22 6  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first and second quarter 2018 EPS is pegged at  1 34 and  1 39  respectively  indicating year over year growth of 8 1  and 15 8   For 2018  EPS is estimated at  5 54  reflecting a year over year rise of 14 2  The upward estimate revisions reflect optimism on prospects of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  You can see  Price

compete against behemoths like American Tower   NYSE AMT   and SBA Communications   NASDAQ SBAC   in the global wireless tower market  Moreover  consolidation in the wireless industry has reduced demand for cell tower and is therefore expected to dent Crown Castle s top line  Further  new technologies are reducing demand for site leases and are driving costs  High customer concentration is also a concern for the company The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor

137825,359340,AMT,Crown Castle  CCI  To Report Q1 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,Crown Castle International Corp    NYSE CCI   is scheduled to release first quarter 2018 results  after the closing bell on Apr 18 For this Houston based REIT  which is engaged in operation of wireless communication towers in the United States  the bottom line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the previous quarter  Results were backed by 28 6  year over year increase in site rental revenues that included organic growth  as well as contributions from acquisitions and other items Over the trailing four quarters  the company delivered an average positive surprise of 5 67  in terms of funds from operations  FFO  per share  This is depicted in the graph below Crown Castle International Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors at PlayCrown Castle is well poised to benefit from the high level of investment activity of its key customers  The company s portfolio of assets is expected to witness decent demand in the quarter to be reported and leasing activity across towers  small cells and fiber solutions is likely to remain strong The company s continued efforts in repositioning itself from being a tower company to a fiber provider  focused on the small cell opportunity  look impressive  In 2017  the company fortified its portfolio with the acquisitions of FiberNet  Wilcon and Lightower that operate in top U S  markets  These markets have been experiencing high demand for network investment by the company s customers For the first quarter of 2018  Crown Castle expects Site Rental revenues of  1 132  1 142 million  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is  1 138 million  denoting a projected increase of 8 3   sequentially Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s site rental revenues for towers is currently pegged at  747 million for the first quarter  reflecting a projected increase of 0 8  sequentially  Site rental revenues for fiber are projected at  392 million  denoting an estimated surge of 26 5  Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter revenues is  1 31 billion  indicating year over year projected growth of 29 0   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the quarter is pegged at  1 34  reflecting a rise of around 8 1  In addition to the above  the deployment of 5G is expected to drive growth on both the company s tower and small cell assets  This is because the wireless carriers look to expand and enhance their networks to provide the coverage  capacity and speed needed to support mobile video  the Internet of Things  IoT   and fixed wireless broadband Remarkably  the IoT space is touted as the next big thing in the evolution of technology and higher investment by the wireless carriers  It is anticipated to boost the company s revenues However  Crown Castle competes in a highly competitive wireless tower operator industry  with incumbents like American Tower Corp    NYSE AMT   and SBA Communications Corp    NASDAQ SBAC    Consolidation in the wireless industry might reduce demand for cell tower deployments and therefore is expected to impact Crown Castle s top line performance Furthermore  customer concentration is very high for Crown Castle  Loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them will significantly affect the company s revenues  Evolution of new technologies might bring down the demand for site leases as well  Developments of satellite delivered radio and video services will likely weigh on the need for tower based broadcast transmission  In addition  frequent changes in demand for infrastructure support and network services will tend to increase volatility in Crown Castle s revenues Prior to the first quarter earnings release  there was lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overtly optimistic about the company s business activities and prospects  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the to be reported quarter remained unchanged at  1 34 over the past 30 days Crown Castle s shares have inched up 0 3   against the  s loss of 4 5  in the past three months Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Crown Castle is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here as elaborated below Zacks ESP  Crown Castle has an Earnings ESP of  0 00

137845,359360,AMT,Key Factors To Impact Prologis   PLD  Earnings This Season,opinion,Prologis  Inc    NYSE PLD   is slated to report fourth quarter 2017 earnings on Jan 23  before the opening bell Last quarter  this industrial real estate investment trust  REIT  reported an in line result in terms of funds from operations  FFO  per share  Though the company experienced improved operating environment in the quarter  it did not recognize any promote income However  Prologis has a mixed surprise history  The company surpassed the FFO per share estimates in two occasions and met in the other two  over the preceding four quarters  resulting in an average positive surprise of 2 33   This is depicted in the graph below The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter FFO per share is currently pegged at 66 cents Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors at PlayThe industrial real estate market has been experiencing solid growth  backed by the recovering economy and job market improvements  strengthening e commerce market and healthy manufacturing environment Amid this  Prologis has the capacity to offer modern distribution facilities at strategic in fill locations  The company also has solid balance sheet strength  Also  its build to suit activity remained impressive in the second half of 2017  with the company completing 13 development projects  With a total expected investment  TEI  of approximately  350 million  on a Prologis share basis   these projects included more than 4 7 million square feet of space Further  this industrial real estate investment trust  REIT  was awarded 21 build to suit development projects during the same period  denoting over 6 7 million square feet of space  The TEI of these developments totaled roughly  550 million on a Prologis share basis In fact  for full year 2017  the company completed 33 build to suit projects  covering more than 12 million square feet of space  During the year  it also commenced 38 projects with a TEI of nearly  1 1 billion Notably  this high number of build to suit development projects highlights the advantageous location of the company s rich land bank as well as the sturdy network of multi site customers which are increasingly focusing on e commerce  In fact  the company s ratio of built to suit activity to overall development starts has achieved the highest level since 2013 Nevertheless  recovery in the industrial market has continued for long and chances of any sound improvement in rent and occupancy growth in the to be reported quarter seem limited Rather  there is intense competition in the market  Also  a whole lot of new buildings are slated to be completed and made available in the market in the near term  leading to elevated supply  and lesser scope for rent and occupancy growth  Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter rental revenues is currently pegged at  532 million  denoting a drop of 5  from the year ago quarter Therefore  prior to the fourth quarter earnings release  there was lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overtly optimistic about the company s business activities and prospects  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the to be reported quarter remained unchanged at 66 cents per share over the past 30 days Furthermore  Prologis has underperformed the  it belongs to  in the past three months  The company s shares have dipped 4 6   while the industry incurred loss of 4 3  during this time frame Here is what our quantitative model predicts Prologis does not have the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Prologis is  0 10  Zacks Rank  Prologis carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  A positive Earnings ESP is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely beat in terms of FFO per share  However  we also need to have a favorable Zacks rank to be confident of a positive surprise Prologis  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter American Tower Corporation

137846,359361,AMT,Crown Castle  CCI  To Report Q4 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,"Crown Castle International Corp    NYSE CCI   is scheduled to release fourth quarter 2017 results  after the closing bell on Jan 24 While the company s bottom line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters  it lagged the same in the remaining two quarters with an average beat of 2 53  Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors at PlayCrown Castle competes in a highly competitive wireless tower operator industry with incumbents like American Tower Corp    NYSE AMT   and SBA Communications Corp    NASDAQ SBAC    Consolidation in the wireless industry may reduce demand for cell tower deployments and therefore is expected to have an adverse effect on Crown Castle s top line The merger between AT T  NYSE T  and Leap Wireless had a bearing on Crown Castle as it has 1 300 towers with both the carriers  Likewise  the combined entity of T Mobile US and MetroPCS negatively impacted Crown Castle that had 1 400 towers jointly shared by these companies  Also  the merger between Sprint and Clearwire served as a hurdle for Crown Castle as both share 2 700 of its towers Furthermore  customer concentration is very high for Crown Castle  Historically  the top four among its customers  Verizon  AT T  Sprint  and T Mobile  accounted for majority of its total revenues  of which AT T contributes a handful amount of site rental revenues  Loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them will significantly affect the company s top line Evolution of new technologies may reduce the demand for site leases as well  Developments of satellite delivered radio and video services are likely to weigh on the need for tower based broadcast transmission  In addition  frequent changes in demand for infrastructure support and network services will tend to increase volatility in Crown Castle s revenues On the flip side  Crown Castle s continuous efforts in repositioning itself from being a tower company to a fiber provider  focused on the small cell opportunity  looks impressive  Over the last two years  Crown Castle purchased three fiber operators   FPL FiberNet Holdings  LLC  in January 2017   Quanta Fiber  called Sunesys  in April 2015  and 24 7 Mid Atlantic Network  in September 2014  On Jun 26  2017  Crown Castle International completed the acquisition of privately held Wilcon Holdings LLC  Notably  Wilcon is the premier service provider of dark fiber  lit transport  Internet access and colocation services in Southern California  Currently  it owns 1 900 route miles of fiber in Los Angeles and San Diego  As a result  Crown Castle gained 28 000 route miles of fiber On Nov 1  2017  Crown Castle completed the buyout of LTS Group Holdings LLC  Lightower  from Berkshire Partners  Pamlico Capital and other investors for approximately  7 1 billion in cash  subject to certain limited adjustments   With this buyout  Crown Castle is anticipated to attain ownership over 60 000 route miles of fiber  These deals are expected to increase opportunities for small cell network deployments in top metro markets Moreover  the deployment of 5G is expected to drive growth on both the company s tower and small cell assets  This is because the wireless carriers look to expand and enhance their networks to provide the coverage  capacity and speed needed to support mobile video  the Internet of Things  IoT   fixed wireless broadband Markedly  IoT space is touted as the next big thing in the evolution of technology and higher investment by the wireless carriers  Going forward  it is anticipated to boost the company s revenues Buoyed by such tailwinds  Crown Castle s shares have gained 5 17   against the  s loss of 2 99  in the past three months Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Crown Castle is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here as elaborated below Zacks ESP  Crown Castle has an Earnings ESP of  0 16   This is because  the Most Accurate estimate is  1 07 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  1 06  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with the  Zacks Rank  Crown Castle has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Strong Sell  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

137870,359385,AMT,American Tower  AMT  On Growth Trajectory  Care To Invest,opinion,U S  wireless tower operators had a dream run in 2017  American Tower Corp    NYSE AMT   was certainly one of the major beneficiaries  We believe there are a number of reasons for this stellar show to continue in 2018  We will discuss the reasons in short Upcoming 5G Wireless NetworkFifth generation  5G  superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry  In September 2017  Moody s Investors Service stated in a report that the evolution towards 5G wireless networks will result in higher capital spending for U S  wireless carriers  In this context  Internet of Things  IoT  holds the potential of becoming the numero uno factor in driving growth in the space  Upcoming 5G mobile networks will be of utmost importance in the management of exponential growth in IoT Strong Business ModelWireless services are advancing fast in terms of additional features and capabilities  Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of cell towers and equipment  Tower operators effectively address this opportunity as more than 90  of its quarterly revenues come from wireless carriers  Tower operators generally have long term  typically 5  10 years  tower lease agreements with the U S  national carriers Moreover  wireless consumer demand is expected to increase considerably over the next several years  driven by increased innovation and adoption of data driven mobile devices and applications such as machine to machine  M2M  connections  social networking and streaming of video Importantly  American Tower has a highly diversified business model  Apart from its leadership position in the United States  the company has a strong foothold in Asia  especially in India   Latin America  Europe and the Middle East  In 2016  American Tower generated 41  of its total revenues from outside homeland  Management expects international revenues to top U S  sales in next three to seven years American Tower is highly enthusiastic about its India operation where the company already controls over 58 000 towers  In November  2017  American Tower entered into an agreement to buy about 20 000 towers from Vodafone Group  LON VOD  Plc s Indian business and Idea Cellular Ltd   for approximately  1 2 billion  The tenancy ratio is expected to rise to 2 9 times by March 2020  from about the 1 95 times average for India in 2015 Massive Spectrum Deployment by U S  CarriersWireless networks will be integral to the future growth of the overall telecom industry  T Mobile US Inc    NYSE T   has aggressively started deploying 600 MHz low band airwaves  This year  AT T Inc    NYSE T   will deploy 60 MHz of fallow spectrum and 600 MHz low band spectrum coupled with its ongoing network densification project Moreover  AT T will also install its FirstNet project to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America s police  firefighters and emergency medical services  As part of the 25 year contract  FirstNet will provide AT T with a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the entire duration  The company is expected to spend around  40 billion over the life of the contract to build  deploy  operate and maintain the network The market for U S  public safety network for first responders and civil protection services is becoming intensely competitive  In August 2017  Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   announced plans of dedicating network capacity to emergency services providers  The company will make Band 14 devices available and ensure full interoperability with any Band 14 radio access networks  RANs  deployed by FirstNet  Band 14 is the 700MHz LTE band allocated for the public safety network Additionally  major U S  telecom operators are exploring ways to commercialize usage of 3 5 GHz unlicensed wireless spectrum  Notably  the 3 5 GHz radio frequency is being considered in many parts of the world for the upcoming 5G wireless standard  thus increasing its chances of providing spectrum globally Entry of New Players in the U S  Wireless SpaceThe U S  wireless industry is likely to get competitive in 2018 with the entry of cable MSOs  multi service operators  in this space  Comcast Corp    NASDAQ CMCSA   has already entered this field with its Xfinity Mobile offering  At present the company is using its MVNO  mobile virtual network operator  agreement with Verizon to use the latter s wireless network coupled with its own WiFi network to offer mobile services  Importantly  the company acquired 73 licenses in the band of 600 MHz auctioned by the FCC  We believe that in the future Comcast will deploy this spectrum for extensive wireless coverage Charter Communications Inc    NYSE T   has reiterated its plans of launching wireless service in the first half of next year  Similar to Comcast  the company also has an MVNO agreement with Verizon as well as its own WiFi network to offer mobile services  It has also launched experimental field trials of the 5G wireless network DISH Network Corp    NASDAQ DISH   has created an extensive portfolio of spectrum  the most important component of wireless networks  The company boasts a portfolio of 80 MHz of radio frequencies of different bands  which will be utilized in deploying 4G LTE wireless network in top 100 U S  markets  DISH Network s CEO Charlie Ergen has hinted that the company is interested in the potential deal making to enter the wireless industry  At the same time  Ergen also stated that DISH Network has plans of building a wireless network on its own Strong FundamentalsAmerican Tower has strong fundamentals  Our analysis has been substantiated by the fact that over the past 60 days  six analysts have upwardly revised their estimates for American Tower s 2018 earnings per share  EPS   As a result  the consensus estimate for 2018 EPS has gone up

The industry underperformed the broader market  as indicated by the FTSE NAREIT All REIT Index s  of around 9 3  over this time frame versus the S P 500 s 21 8    Nevertheless  the performance was close to the long term average of 9 7  per year over the 46 year tenure of the Nareit index 
But what caught our attention is the underlying strength in some asset categories like data centers  cell tower and industrial  These categories not only posted stellar returns in 2017 but also have sufficient scope to grow going forward  This is because technological evolution is changing the dynamics of the real estate market and hugely benefiting these sectors 
Take the example of the e commerce boom that has hugely affected mall traffic and compelled retailers to reconsider their business model in recent times  That same boom has led to a significant opportunity for the data centers  cell tower and industrial REITs that offer the critical infrastructure in the e commerce value chain  This is because as demand is placed from smartphones  tablets or computers  the order is transmitted through cell towers and processed at data centers  Finally  the order is fulfilled through the industrial logistics facilities and delivered to the doorstep 
However  interest rates continue to affect the share price of REITs in the near term  and the December FOMC meeting indicates three more rate hikes this year 
Admittedly  REITs  dependence on debt for their business and consideration as bond substitutes for their high and consistent dividend paying nature still make their short term returns susceptible to the rate hikes and movements of treasury yields  to some extent  Particularly asset valuation  including bond coupons and stock dividends  experiences a decline as a hike in interest rate impacts the present value of future cash flows 
But for REITs  there is scope for increasing future cash flows along with the recent rise in rates  This is because  in the December meeting  along with increasing rates  the Fed has also offered a better outlook in terms of GDP growth for 2018  a positive revision in projected inflation and expectations of a  strong  job market  And when the economy gathers steam  REIT business usually buoys up 
But not all categories of REITs are equally poised to excel  Therefore  the fundamentals of the underlying asset category to which REITs cater to and the impetus the asset category will receive from a growing economy commands more attention 
And along with all this  the  on REIT dividends from 39 6  to 29 6  for taxpayers in the top tax bracket  as well as a number of favorable provisions under the recent tax reform  are likely to bring back investors  attention 
Dividends Stand Tall
Dividends are by far the biggest enticement to invest in REIT stocks  and income seeking investors still prefer them  This is because the U S  law requires REITs to distribute 90  of their annual taxable income in the form of dividends to their shareholders  This unique feature has made the industry stand out and gain a solid footing over the past 15 20 years 
In fact  as of Dec 31  2017  the  of the FTSE NAREIT All REITs Index was 4 27   which handily outpaced the 1 86  dividend yield offered by the S P 500 
Among the REIT market components  the FTSE NAREIT All Equity REIT Index enjoyed a  of 3 94  while the FTSE NAREIT Mortgage REITs Index had a dividend yield of 9 83   Over long periods  REITs have  the broader indexes with respect to dividend yields 
Capital Access
REITs have made concerted efforts to fortify their balance sheets and focus on lowering debt and extending maturities  In fact  REITs have been proactive in the capital market  and raised  92 1 billion of  in 2017  well ahead of the  69 6 billion generated in the prior year  This denotes investors  growing confidence in this industry  However  going forward  identification of growth scopes is likely to determine the inflow of capital in this industry 
Zacks Industry Rank
Within the Zacks Industry classification  REITs are broadly grouped in the Finance sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  and further sub divided into four industries at the expanded  aka  X   level  REIT Equity Trust   Retail  REIT Equity Trust   Residential  REIT Equity Trust   Other and REIT Mortgage Trust  The level of sensitivity and exposure to different stages of the economic cycle vary for each industry

However  the industry ranking is not encouraging for the majority of the REIT industry  In fact  the Zacks Industry Rank is  234  bottom 9  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  for Retail REIT   200  bottom 22   for Other REIT   183  bottom 29   for Mortgage REIT and  174  bottom 32   for Residential REIT 
Earnings Trends
Nevertheless  no discussion is complete until we weigh the performance of REITs in earnings  However  despite wide skepticism of investors toward this industry  the REIT industry emerged as a decent performer in third quarter 2017 
In fact  per a NAREIT   occupancy rates reached a record high in the third quarter  while funds from operations   FFO    a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs  reported growth from the year ago period  Specifically  the third quarter scorecard reveals that total FFO of  14 8 billion for the listed U S  Equity REIT industry increased 7 8  year over year  However  the figure was 4 5  lower sequentially 
Same store net operating income  NOI  increased 3 2  year over year  Results were driven by segments like Manufactured Homes  Diversified  Single Family Homes  Industrial  and Data Centers  which witnessed robust same store NOI growth of 7 1   7 0   6 8   4 7  and 4 2   respectively 
Importantly  properties owned by the listed Equity REITs enjoyed solid occupancy levels  In fact  the occupancy rate climbed 50 basis points to a record high of 94 0  
Further  the finance sector  of which REITs are part  is expected to grow in 2017  Total Q4 earnings for the S P 500 index members from this sector are expected to be up 3 1  from the same period last year on 2 4  higher revenues

REITs Worth Adding
In this mixed environment  sidelining the entire industry would not be prudent  Rather  instead of being bogged down by the current rate hike news  tap the many novelties in the REIT sector  Since individual market dynamics play a critical role in determining performance of REITs  favorable conditions only pump up chances of further growth 
Over the last six months  the industry has gained around 4 6   compared with the S P 500 s return of 13 3   As the industry underperformed the broader market  the stocks are good bargains now 
Investors can consider the following REIT stocks that have solid fundamentals to weather any rate hike  Also  their favorable Zacks Rank makes them solid picks

137908,359423,AMT,Verizon AT T Team Up With Tillman To Construct Cell Towers,opinion,"U S  telecom service providers Verizon Communications Inc   NYSE VZ   and AT T Inc   NYSE T   are collaborating over a cell tower deal  Although  they compete fiercely in the domestic wireless market  their partnership marks a new move in the lucrative wireless tower industry 
AT T and Verizon have inked a joint deal with Tillman Infrastructure to build cell towers in the United States  Privately held  Tillman is the owner and operator of towers  small cells and smart cities infrastructures  Per the deal  Tillman will construct customized towers and lease it to Verizon and AT T  Construction work of the towers will begin in the first quarter of 2018  Installation of equipment in the already completed sites will begin as soon as possible 
Currently  both Verizon and AT T carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
These new structures will add to the overall communications infrastructure in the country and will fulfill the availability of towers in newer locations  The build outs will also help the wireless carriers relocate equipment from their current towers 
The companies are focusing on technology innovation  with further investment in the updated software platforms to provide the best customer experience in their network 
The Motive
The partnership implies that the biggest U S  wireless carriers are willing to strike deals with other vendors to secure prices for towers  Moreover  carriers are always looking for alternative partners to reduce their dependence on specific customer base  thanks to the already saturated domestic wireless market 
Domestic telcos are moving away from traditional tower leasing model  in order to cut down spending as data consumption continues to rise  Notably  these companies plan to create a diverse community of suppliers and tower operators  to maintain a healthy market competition 
Additionally  AT T and Verizon are striving to expand their network capacity in order to meet consumers  demand for more cellular data  The companies are also reviewing their long term contracts for renewal and trying to gain new vendor partners to diversify their infrastructure lineup 
The Consequences
The U S  cell tower market is currently dominated by three companies   American Tower Corp    NYSE AMT    SBA Communications Corp    NASDAQ SBAC   and Crown Castle International Corp    NYSE CCI   
Customer concentration is very high for these tower companies as they heavily depend on the top four wireless carriers   Verizon  AT T  Sprint  T Mobile US   for a major part of their quarterly revenues  The loss of any of these customers or consolidation will have a negative impact on the companies  top line  Moreover  the ongoing consolidation trend among telecom and cable TV operators may generate significant financial fluctuations for the company 
In such a scenario  the joint venture move is sure to pose severe competitive threat to established tower companies 
Price Performance 
Despite such positives  the wireless carriers portray a disappointing price performance  In the past month  shares of AT T and Verizon have lost 4 9  and 10 9   respectively  compared with the  s decline of 8 4

137909,359424,AMT,Forget Rate Hike  Ride On The Tech Wave To Gain From REITs ,opinion,Investors in the REIT space are usually jittery when a rate hike is announced by the Federal Reserve and there is no exception this time too  However  instead of fretting over the rate that was increased by a quarter point in the recently concluded FOMC meeting  we ought to shift attention to the better outlook offered by the Fed in terms of GDP growth for 2018  a positive revision in projected inflation and expectations of a  strong  job market This can be far more rewarding because REITs business usually buoys up on a stepped up economy and job scenario  And why not  A fatter purse obviously gives tenants more power to demand real estate space and shell out for higher rents More importantly  the technology wave is not only helping tech companies but is also driving demand for the related real estates  Take for example the e commerce boom that has hugely affected retailers  business model No doubt  this has adversely impacted mall traffic in recent times  keeping retail REITs on tenterhooks  However  this technological evolution is changing the dynamics of the real estate market and substantially driving up demand for space at a number of asset categories In fact  right from the time we use our smartphones  tablets or computers for a purchase  demand for REITs get a boost  This is because as we place our demand  the order is transmitted through cell towers and processed at data centers  Finally  the order is fulfilled through the industrial logistics facilities and delivered at our doorstep Now  REITs happen to own many of these cell towers  data centers and logistics facilities  So without the offering of this critical infrastructure  the e commerce value chain simply cannot sustain Along with making purchases online  an increasing number of people are consuming digital content  Going by numbers  per a  from Cisco  from 2016 to 2021  global Internet video traffic and mobile data traffic are estimated to witness a CAGR of 31  and 46   respectively The estimated growth rate for the markets of artificial intelligence  Internet of Things  autonomous vehicle and virtual augmented reality are also anticipated to remain robust over the next five to eight years  All these only make us hugely optimistic about extensive growth in demand for space at cell tower REITs including American Tower   NYSE AMT   and Crown Castle International   NYSE CCI   and data center REITs such as Digital Realty   NYSE DLR    CoreSite Realty   NYSE COR   and others Moreover  amid economic expansion  e commerce development and heightened urbanization  companies are shifting their strategy toward services like same day delivery and other options  This is propelling demand for distribution facilities near population centers  which not only help in lowering delivery time but also reduce cost of delivery Further  according to a  from Prologis Inc    NYSE PLD    for a given level of revenues  online retailers require three times the distribution center space compared with traditional retailers  As such  demand from the e commerce sector has been escalating and per a  by Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated   NYSE JLL    in third quarter 2017  this sector accounted for nearly 25  of total U S  leasing demand compared with 14 7  in the previous year This is offering significant impetus for growth to industrial REITs like Prologis  Duke Realty   NYSE DRE   and others  So shareholders of such REITs have sufficient reasons to rejoice Therefore  instead of being bogged down by the current rate hike news  tap the many novelties in the REIT sector  Since individual market dynamics play a critical role in determining performance of REITs  favorable conditions only pump up chances of further growth Investor Alert  Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization  Billions of dollars in research have poured into it  Companies are already generating substantial revenue  and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight  and so are big potential profits for early investors  Zacks names 5 stocks to buy now ,2017-12-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/forget-rate-hike-ride-on-the-tech-wave-to-gain-from-reits-200273720,200273720

137946,359461,AMT,REIT Industry Stock Outlook   May 2017,opinion,"The first four months of this year were not favorable for the overall U S  real estate investment trust  REIT  industry  Uncertainty and restrained trading activity took a toll on returns 
The FTSE NAREIT All REITs Index registered a  of 3 5  in the first four months of 2017  lagging the S P 500 s stellar 7 2   Specifically  Equity REITs  which comprised a majority of the total REIT market  came up with a weak performance  with the FTSE NAREIT All Equity REITs Index finishing April with a total return of 2 99  
Admittedly  the concerns surrounding rate hikes and movements of treasury yields made investors skeptical about investing in REIT stocks  This is because REITs are typically dependent on debt for their business  Also  they are often considered as bond substitutes for their high and consistent dividend paying nature  Apart from these  fundamentals of some of the underlying asset categories provided headwinds and drove away gains 
Particularly  the retail REIT segment felt the heat with dwindling traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales  which checkered demand for the retail real estate space  Also  an increasing number of deliveries of new units in a number of key markets and elevated concession activity raised concerns over some apartment REIT stocks 
But sidelining the entire industry would not be prudent  as REITs cater to a wide range of real estate assets and each asset category has its own demand supply dynamics 
In the first four months of 2017  even though the overall returns from the REIT industry fell short of the broader market  a number of asset categories showed fundamental strength and the REITs catering to those asset classes reaped benefits 
Among them are the data center REITs that posted a  of 18 0  with growth in cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data  Moreover  infrastructure REITs gained 15 7  and Specialty REITs delivered returns of 14 3   handily outpacing the broader market 
In addition  any rate hike would eventually be backed by economic improvement  And when economic growth gathers steam and inflation rises  prices of real estate generally increase  and rent and occupancy of properties go up 
But not every category of real estate is likely to get an equal boost and not all locations are equally poised to flourish  Therefore  investors need to remain cautiously optimistic and assess the fundamentals of the underlying asset category before making any investment  Further  the capacity of REITs to absorb a rate hike should also be considered  Hence  things like lease durations and pricing power in the market would command attention 
Dividends Standing TallDividends are by far the biggest enticement to invest in REIT stocks  and income seeking investors continue to prefer them  This is because  as of Apr 28  2017  the  of the FTSE NAREIT All REITs Index was 4 14   which handily outpaced the 2 01  dividend yield offered by the S P 500

138049,359564,AMT,This Week s Top Trade Ideas   AMT  BWA  CMA  DPS  MA,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
American Tower Corporation REIT  NYSE AMT 

American Tower  AMT  started higher in February  stalling as it turned into April  The slowly rising consolidation brought it back in contact with its 20 day SMA  and then it pushed higher again at the end of June 
The price peaked in late July and it pulled back slowly  hitting the 20 day SMA again 2 weeks ago  Now it is seeing a positive momentum divergence with the RSI pushing up through the mid line and the MACD about to cross up  Look for a push over the 20 day SMA to participate to the upside   
BorgWarner  NYSE BWA 

BorgWarner  BWA  has been making a series of lower highs s it heads lower  But this time may be different  The bottom in July  at the same level as the February low could be making a double bottom  A move over the April high would confirm that 
Until then though  the price is at resistance and has support from a rising and bullish RSI and positive MACD for a continued push higher  Look for a move over resistance to participate to the upside   
Comerica  NYSE CMA 


Comerica  CMA  made a deep bottom with the market in February  But since then it made a strong move higher to a peak in June  A shorter pullback to a higher low found support at the end of June and it started higher again 
Last week saw it back at the early June level and consolidating  The RSI is in the bullish zone and the MACD is flat  but positive  Look for a push to a new high to participate to the upside   
Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc  NYSE DPS 

Dr Pepper Snapple  DPS  started higher off of a low in August 29015 and did not stop until year end  Since then it has moved mostly sideways but with a slight upward drift to it  Since April it has made a series of higher highs and higher lows 
The move up Friday looks to confirm another higher low  Withe RSI turning up and the MACD about to cross up look for continuation to participate to the upside   
Mastercard Incorporated  NYSE MA 

Mastercard  MA  made a low in February then bounced to resistance below 100  A smaller pullback to a higher low at the start of July reversed higher and is now back at prior resistance 
The RSI is in the bullish zone and rising and the MACD is crossing up  both supporting more upside  Look for a push through resistance to participate to the upside   
Up Next  Bonus Idea
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which as summer vacations end and the back to work mentality begins  sees the equity markets rested and ready 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue higher short term while Crude Oil also bounces and moves higher  The US Dollar Index looks to move higher in the broad consolidation while US Treasuries consolidate in their uptrend  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue a digestive drift lower while Emerging Markets reverse back to the upside 
Volatility looks to continue abnormally low keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  
Their charts show the SPY and QQQ continuing in consolidation  with the IWM breaking to the upside  taking the lead  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

Notably  talks between American Tower and Viom Networks have been going on for a couple of years now  Viom Networks operates around 42 000 towers  supporting nearly 100 000 tenancies  Interestingly  India is a lucrative market for wireless tower operators  American Tower owns more than 10 000 towers in the country apart from Viom s towers 
American Tower has been aggressively expanding its portfolio through acquisitions  In Aug 2015  the company announced the acquisition of nearly 4 700 mobile phone towers from India s largest telecommunications company   Bharti Airtel Ltd  Also  in Mar 2015  the company closed a deal pertaining to leasing rights of roughly 11 324 wireless towers and acquisition of 165 additional towers from Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   
Globally  the growth in mobile subscribers has significantly boosted the wireless tower industry  Moreover  future financials are likely to be propelled by strong demand for wireless voice  broadband wireless data and video networks  which require more tower space  Deployment of 4G mobile networks necessitates the expansion of coverage and infrastructure by carriers  At the end of 2015  American Tower owned or operated over 100 000 towers and nearly 500 distributed antenna system networks globally 
Going forward  we believe that American Tower s insistent buyout of towers especially in emerging markets should help drive its top line and also lend it a competitive edge over rivals like Crown Castle International Corp    NYSE CCI   and SBA Communications Corp    NASDAQ SBAC    American Tower currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

Screen of the Week written by Kevin Matras of Zacks Investment Research 

Your Best Stocks Will Be in the Best Industries

We ve all heard the old adage that 50  of a stock s price movement can be attributed to the group that it s in 

In fact  studies have shown that just getting into an average stock in a strong industry is likely to outperform a great stock in a poor industry 

Of course  this does not mean that you can just pick any stock in a top group and expect to make money  But  it does underscore the importance of sticking with the best industries 

If your last losing stock was in a poorly performing industry  the odds of success were against you the entire time 

But identifying the best stocks in the best industries is easy to do  And the Zacks Industry Rank is the ideal way to do that so you can put the odds of success in your favor on your very next trade 

Zacks Industry Rank

As you know  since 1988  the Zacks  1 Rank stocks have generated an average annual return of over 26  per year  That s nearly 3 times the S P 500  And it s beaten the market in 23 of the last 26 years 

That s because the Zacks Rank is based on the most powerful force impacting stock prices  which is earnings estimate revisions 

The Zacks Rank is also one of the best ways to rank industries  And this is done with the Zacks Industry Rank  After all  since an industry is nothing more than a group of stocks in a similar business  this is the perfect way to size up an industry 

The Zacks Industry Rank is determined by calculating the average Zacks Rank for all of the stocks in the industry and then assigning an ordinal rank to it  For example  an industry with an average Zacks Rank of 1 6 is better than an industry with an average Zacks Rank of 2 3  So the industry with the better average Zacks Rank would get a better Zacks Industry Rank 

Zacks classifies all stocks into 1 of 265 expanded  aka  X   Industries  The average Zacks Rank is calculated for every industry every day  So  if an industry has the best average Zacks Rank  it would be considered the top industry  1 out of 265   which would place it in the top 1  of Zacks Rank Industries 

The top 132 Zacks Ranked industries would be in the top 50  of industries  whereas the bottom 133 Zacks Ranked Industries would be in the bottom 50  of industries 

If an industry had a poor average Zacks Rank  it might be ranked 220th out of 265 industries  thus placing it in the bottom 17  of Zacks Rank Industries 

Putting the Zacks Industry Rank to the Test

To further illustrate the importance of picking stocks in the best industries  and how the Zacks Industry Rank is one of the best ways to do this  take a look at the test results and chart below 

We put our X industries  all 265 of them  into two groups  the top half  i e   industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank  

Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1  The top blue line is the performance of the top 50  of Zacks Ranked Industries  The orange line below is the performance for the bottom 50  of Zacks Ranked Industries  The maroon line is the S P 500 

Keep in mind that even the worst industries had some Zacks Rank  1s in them  And even the best industries had some Zacks Rank  5s in them  That goes to show the power of simply being in the best group 

The next chart shows what would happen if only the Zacks Rank  1s were applied to the top Zacks Ranked Industries 

The results were even better  adding to the already impressive returns by an additional factor of more than 1 5x the top industry  The top orange line is the performance of the top 50  of Zacks Ranked Industries with just the Zacks Rank  1s  The blue line below is the performance for the top 50  of Zacks Ranked Industries with all Zacks Ranks included  Once again  the maroon line is the S P 

It s clear that selecting the best stocks in the best groups can give your stock picking a decided advantage  increasing your portfolio s returns like never before 

Using the Zacks Industry Rank

Once again  the Zacks Industry Rank is calculated by averaging the Zacks Rank for all stocks within a specific industry  The industry with the lowest average Zacks Rank will be considered the top Zacks Ranked Industry  1 out of 265  while the industry with the highest average Zacks Rank will be ranked at the bottom of the Zacks Ranked Industries 

Remember  the Zacks Rank is a score of 1 thru 5 with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  being the best  and a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  being the worst 

If there were 10 stocks in an industry and five had a Zacks Rank  1  and the other five a Zacks Rank  2  the average Zacks Rank would be 1 5  That industry would receive a top Zacks Industry Rank 

An industry that had five stocks with a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   and the other five a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   would have an average Zacks Rank of 4 5  That industry would receive a low Zacks Industry Rank  Since you always want a diversified portfolio  don t select all of your stocks from the top Zacks Ranked Industry  You should populate your portfolio with stocks from groups in the top 50  of Zacks Rank Industries  top 133 industries  

5 Stocks from 5 Top Zacks Rank Industries

Below are 5 stocks within 5 of the top Zacks Ranked Industries 

I also included some of my other personal favorite stock picking items  including   Increasing Net Margins    increasing ROE   and a  Low Price to Sales Ratio  

Parameters

  Zacks Rank equal to 1

  Top 50  of Zacks Ranked Industries

  Price to Sales less than or equal to 1

  ROE  recent  greater than ROE  from 1 Quarter ago 

  Net Margin  recent  greater than Net Margin  from 1 Quarter ago

Summary

We said it before  but it s worth saying it again  50  of a stock s price movement can be attributed to the group that it s in  So it s of the utmost importance to make sure your stocks are within the top industries    specifically the top Zacks Ranked industries 

If you find yourself considering a stock that happens to be in one of the bottom 50  of Zacks Ranked Industries  move on  Sure  it may still go up  in spite of the drag the low industry rank has placed on it  But  why put yourself in a position where the odds are against you  And if you get in  against your better judgment  and it does go down  you ll be wondering why you ever did that in the first place  Instead  put the odds of success in your favor 

Remember  a top Zacks Industry Rank means more stocks within that group are receiving upward earnings estimate revisions  That means something positive is happening to that group  Not just that stock  but for the bulk of those stocks within that industry s business  If it has a poor Industry Rank  that means more companies within that industry are receiving downward earnings estimate revisions  In other words  conditions are tough for that industry s business right now  causing the analysts following that group to lower their estimates 

Simply put  your most profitable stocks will be those with upward earnings estimate revisions in the industries enjoying the same 

And there s no better way to increase your odds of success than by combining the Zacks Rank and the Zacks Industry together
