3918,225433,GRBK,Snapback Rally  Stocks To Watch,opinion,"It was an interesting  really strong snapback rally and reversal day on Tuesday  One of the best I ve seen in a while  The Nasdaq 100 alone was up about 85 points off the low and closing at the highs for the day  That s about as good as it gets  A lot of the stocks we follow and our swing trades  were acting great  so  we re going to cover a few of them  Even some of the biotechs of late  in the last day or two  that got a little dicey there  snapped back beautifully 
BioTelemetry  Inc   BEAT  nearly reached its target on Tuesday  We had a target in the 11 00 12 00 zone  and it reached 10 70  just 30 cents off the target  It closed up nicely off the low  a 10 15 low  10 68 close  on 42 cents  or 4   on 253 800  The volume wasn t exceptionally heavy  but not bad  Looking at the chart  you can see the base  breakout  a wedge  and an explosive move  a very nice one from about the 8 00 range up to near 11 00  That will be our swing trade  if it can get up there 
Cyber Ark Software Ltd   NASDAQ CYBR  had a very nice reversal on Tuesday going from 36 00 to 40 95  closing 4 cents off the high  up 2 76  or 7 23   on 1 3 million shares  It couldn t get much better than that  It came down and nearly filled the gap completely  It took out some weak ends  tested the 50 day  and the trendline  and reversed  If it can get up through the declining topsline on Wednesday  I would expect it to get as high as 43  Going forward the swing trade is 47  and upwards of 50 
NewLink Genetics Corporation  NASDAQ NLNK   one of our swing trades  is doing well  Looking at the chart  you can see the multiple session highs  and the lows that it came off of on Tuesday  reaching as low as 35  and closing at 38 29  up 1 45  or 3 9   on 3 4 million shares  That was a beautiful reversal  If it gets some more volume to take it definitively above 39 1 4  it may very well test the double top at 42  The next target is 46 47 
SunEdison  Inc   NYSE SUNE  had a big reversal day on Tuesday  It got down to the trendline at 18 53 and closed at 20 03  That s a big reversal there  Up only 2   but 14 million shares traded  the biggest volume in a couple weeks  If that s the case  Tuesday s low is key  I don t want this under to go 18 1 2 because it could be volatile down around the 15 16 range  It has four legs up  and I would like to see a fifth leg take it up near 25 26

3919,225434,GRBK,Stocks On The Move  ACHN  CLDX  OREX  TASR,opinion,"Stocks On The Move  ACHN  CLDX  OREX  TASR
The stock market had a wonderful session on Wednesday  and we had some beauties early on that did extremely well  Congratulations Tech Traders  It was a good day  indeed  Let s take a look at some of our stocks  recent swing trades  and day trades we put out on Wednesday 
Achillion Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ ACHN  was up nearly 10  on Wednesday  I love the way it s been holding support  The 50 day moving average is right at  12 24 
The low on Tuesday was  12 41  and on Wednesday it popped from  12 92 to  14 21  and closed just a penny off the high at  14 20  up  1 28 
That was a fabulous close  The volume picked up to 4 7 million shares traded  What we need is for it to rise above  15 31  and then I m looking at  19 00 
Celldex Therapeutics  Inc   NASDAQ CLDX  had a nice snap back on Wednesday  going from  16 60 to  18 14  and closed only 4 cents off the high at  18 10  up  1 27  or 7 5   on 1 7 million shares  There is still some resistance here  and it has not taken out the pattern yet 
The orderly channel has taken this stock down over a 3 week period from the  21 70 area  all the way back down to  16  and changed  right around the 50 day and lateral support  That was a nice snap back 
Can it get a follow through  What is key to me is that it takes out the moving averages and then rises again near the  19 00 range  That was good volume for this stock  but I want to see better volume  up to 5 10 million shares  It may very well get that 
The targets will be a retest of the highs around  21 70  then  23  and then  27 potentially  particularly if it s breaking out of a base  There s the breakaway gap  And you know how I am about the first pullback after a breakout  Right to the moving average  It could be an ideal candidate right now  of course  with a stop under  16 
Orexigen Therapeutics  Inc   NASDAQ OREX  had a nice pop late in the day on Wednesday  up 47 cents  or 8   on nearly 4 million shares  It has been going in fits and starts and really had disappointed a little bit in that it s gone on longer than I wanted  When you see a pop  pullback  and pop  a consolidation is expected  As soon as volume came in  this stock exploded 
I want to see a follow through  If it gets through the spike high at around  6 50  it could reach  7 50  7 75 pretty quickly  and that s my first swing trade target  Then afterwards   11 50  11 75  It s 4 waves up  the fifth wave should take it to about  7 75  and then we ll see what happens next 
TASER International Inc   NASDAQ TASR  did great on Wednesday  up  1 76  or 7 7   on 5 8 million shares  If you take a look at the wedge  it was forming inside the channel  It s a beautiful rising channel  indeed  folks  It has four waves up  The fifth way may be beginning  I m looking for this to get to  28  and then  32  33

22949,244464,GRBK,Should Value Investors Pick Green Brick Partners  GRBK  Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Green Brick Partners  Inc    NASDAQ GRBK   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Green Brick Partners has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 6 56  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 08  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Green Brick Partners  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 34  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that Green Brick Partners has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 8 35  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Green Brick Partners has a P S ratio of about 0 67  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 27 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  GRBK is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Green Brick Partners currently has a Zacks Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Green Brick Partners a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too   For example  the P CF ratio comes in at 6 12  which is lower than the industry average of 8 23  Clearly  GRBK is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall  Though Green Brick Partners might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of B  This gives GRBK a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to one downward  while the current year estimate has seen two upward revision compared to no downward in the same time period This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 4 3  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has increased by 9 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Green Brick Partners  Inc  Price and Consensus    Despite this positive trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  Green Brick Partners is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among top 41  of more than 250 industries  further instils our confidence However  a Zacks Rank  3 makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Real Estate   Development industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for industry trends to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick This Could Be the Fastest Way to Grow Wealth in 2019Research indicates one sector is poised to deliver a crop of the best performing stocks you

22950,244465,GRBK,U S  Housing Permits Hit Post Recession High  5 Picks,opinion,While building permits hit a post recession high  residential starts increased as builders felt confident enough to build more homes throughout the country  And it s primarily because of low mortgage rates following a series of rate cuts Given the positive development in the housing space  we have shortlisted five stocks that are poised to grow  Let s have a look Residential Starts AdvanceOn Nov 19  the Commerce Department reported that U S  housing starts jumped 3 8  in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 314 000  The October data was not only above the revised September estimate of 1 266 000  but also 8 5  above the October 2018 rate of 1 211 000 Additionally  housing starts for single family houses grew 2  due to increase in construction in the West and South  Also  construction of apartment buildings grew 6 8  from September Building Permits Rise at Fastest Rate Since 2007 Building permits  a measure for future home building  rose to 1 461 000 in October  The data beat the consensus estimate of 1 390 000 and was 5  higher than the previous month s revised value of 1 391 000 Building permits for future growth rose at the strongest pace since May 2007  This year  there has been a bulk gain in permits for apartment complexes  but October s gain was primarily driven by the single family housing segment  The segment has grown 3 2  to its highest level since August 2007 Building permits  by the way  rose 19 5  in the Northeast  which is the highest  though all other parts saw a significant rise Low Mortgage Rate to Propel Sale The lower mortgage rate due to the Federal Reserve s three consecutive rate cuts this year and a healthy job market have fueled the housing market in the past few months  The U S  central banks  rate cut in October lowered the lending rate to a target range between 1 50  and 1 75  This monetary easing from the Fed led the mortgage loan interest rates to fall  As per mortgage financiers Freddie Mac  the average 30 year mortgage loan has an interest rate of 3 75   which is lower than the 4 94  rate in 2018  This cheap borrowing cost has spurred higher demand from buyers Buy These 5 Stocks NowGiven the positive growth in housing starts and building permits  we have selected five stocks from not only the home building space

23030,244545,GRBK,Swing Trade Review  CLDX  LAKE  PLNR  UNIS,opinion,"Today is Thanksgiving and the markets are closed  I plan to reflect on the stocks that we ve looked at the last few weeks  This is going to be a list of most of the swing trades I put on  Let s take a look at where they are and how the patterns are occurring and setting up  I m sure some of the swing traders are looking forward to this 
Celldex Therapeutics  Inc   NASDAQ CLDX  is doing quite well  The base is in  the breakout occurred  there s a breakaway gap  a little pullback hold  it popped  and formed a 3 day flag  It looks to me like it wants to go higher  I m looking for a retest of this breakdown point  which is resistance up in the 22 23 range  That s my first target  Beyond that  you may see it back in the high 20s 
Lakeland Industries Inc   NASDAQ LAKE  was a little disappointing on Wednesday  It had a huge pop on Tuesday  It was a great trading day for it  wasn t it  It broke through all of the moving averages  On Wednesday  it backed off 1 76  or 13   on 4 million shares  That s substantial  Without a follow through  this one could be stymied right there  This is not even resistance  You can see the 3 day high in here  Let s call it 13 65  70  It s got to reverse  That one day pullback doesn t mean a breakdown  So we have to see if it consolidates for a couple three more days  and goes again  Our target is 16 
Planar Systems Inc   NASDAQ PLNR   Talk about a pop  Look at this breakaway gap on a monster earnings report  That beautiful wedge is forming  with low volume and a coil type shape  If this coil gets taken out it could rocket into the 12 13 range  Let s start with a target around 9 1 2 10  and then we ll talk about 11 3 4 12 
Unilife Corporation NASDAQ UNIS  may be turning it around after this ugly drop and breakaway gap in a downtrend  It did hold near the trendline and lateral support  It s moving up very slowly  Let me point out that it has been up five days in a row  and it needs to get going right through resistance  It ran up to 4 00  so take that out  and is headed up to 5 00  which is my target 
Stocks on the short side include  Achillion Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ ACHN   Avanir Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ AVNR   BioTelemetry  Inc   NASDAQ BEAT   Bristol Myers Squibb Company  BMY   Century Aluminum Co   NASDAQ CENX   Caesars Entertainment Corporation  NASDAQ CZR   Ekso Bionics Holdings  Inc   OBB EKSO   1 800 Flowers com Inc   NASDAQ FLWS   Green Brick Partners  Inc   NASDAQ GRBK   Groupon  Inc   NASDAQ GRPN   Integrated Device Technology  Inc   NASDAQ IDTI   Maxwell Technologies  Inc   NASDAQ MXWL   NewLink Genetics Corporation  NASDAQ NLNK   Orexigen Therapeutics  Inc   NASDAQ OREX   Pernix Therapeutics Holdings  Inc   NASDAQ PTX   Rackspace Hosting  Inc    NYSE RAX   Regulus Therapeutics Inc   NASDAQ RGLS   SunEdison  Inc   NYSE SUNE   TASER International Inc   NASDAQ TASR   and ZELTIQ Aesthetics  Inc   NASDAQ ZLTQ  ",2014-11-27,Harry Boxer,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/swing-trade-review:-cldx,-lake,-plnr,-unis-233915",233915
23031,244546,GRBK,Which Alternative Energy Stocks Will Benefit From Extreme Weather ,opinion,Scientists have long claimed that climate change can result in extreme weather conditions  ranging from hurricanes to droughts  A recent study on climate change from the National Climate Assessment and Development Advisory Committee adds even greater weight as it concludes that extreme weather events such as drought  floods  and hurricanes will develop more often and into far greater intensity in the future  According to the report  Sea levels are rising  oceans are becoming more acidic  and glaciers and arctic sea ice are melting  This has certainly not gone unnoticed in the financial marketplace  Both the public and private sector have responded with massive funding of alternative energy projects and companies for the events of climate change ahead that are predicted to feature Higher Sea Levels  If both poles melted from global warming the ocean would rise by 200 feet  which threatens wide swaths of coastal regions More and and Stronger Storms  A major prediction is that there will be increased storm activity and severity around the world  For the United States  hurricane seas in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico will be much more frequent and much more violent Heat Waves  Since 1895  the average temperature in the United States has increased by 1 5 degrees Fahrenheit  More than 80  of that rise has occurred since 1980  which is alarming  Temperatures are expected to rise 5 10 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century These types of weather result in alternative energy stocks becoming more attractive  This transpires as more businesses and residences endeavor to  move off the grid  into localized sources of power due the aging infrastructure in the United States that is challenged by extreme weather  This increases the appeal of solar power for homes  and cogeneration facilities for commercial purposes  This was demonstrated when Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast of the United States in late November  as the only power producer that continued working was Capstone Turbine  CPST   whose microturbines are powered by alternative energy  among other sources O1    Traditional power companies require natural gas or coal to generate electricity  But the turbines of Capstone Turbine can run on a variety of alternative fuels such as biomass and methane gas  emissions from landfills   SunPower Corp   SPWR  is also benefitting from solar power becoming more attractive as a result of extreme weather  among other factors   O2  Over the last month  MidAmerican Energy Holdings  a power company controlled by Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  BRK A   reached an agreement to pay  2 billion to  2 5 billion to SunPower Corp for two California solar projects  That increases Buffett s solar power holdings in California  as earlier a solar farm in San Luis Obispo was purchased by Berkshire Hathaway for  2 billion  MidAmerican Energy Holdings also owns 49  of an Arizona solar point in a venture with NRG Energy  NRG  and First Solar  FSLR   Overall  according to the Solar Energy Industries Association  SEIA   growth in the United States from 2011 to 2012 for solar power usage was over 50   from 1 9 gigawatts to 3 2 gigawatts  By 2016  SEIA estimates it will more than double to 8 gigawatts  There should also be a resurgence in biofuel stocks due to the impact of extreme weather on the energy sector  The biofuel industry has been decimated over the last year  But uber investor  recently established a huge position in Biofuel Energy  BIOF   Biofuels become much more attractive as extreme weather can knock out refining facilities  destroy offshore drilling platforms  and create additional havoc for the oil and natural gas industry  For the last six months of market action  Biofuel Energy is up by 58 15   For the last year  however  it is down by 65 00  Extreme weather results in alternative energy stocks becoming more attractive O3    The Grid  offshore oil platforms  refining facilities  natural gas pipelines  and other aspects of the fossil fuel industry are all very vulnerable to the hurricanes and the other aspects of extreme weather  As more consumers move to alternative energy sources  the share prices for these companies will rise  too ,2013-03-24,Marcus Holland,https://www.investing.com/analysis/which-alternative-energy-stocks-will-benefit-from-extreme-weather-160246,160246
23032,244547,GRBK,Is It Time To Sell Everything ,opinion,"With all the alarmist media coverage on Friday the market did just fine for the week  As a matter of fact the NASDAQ flipped the macro jokers the bird and made more highs  Gold is hilarious and did nothing Friday 
The pundits at MarketWatch and CNBC tried to scare you because Soros bought more SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY  puts  He also bought a crap load more Facebook Inc  NASDAQ FB  and Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   Could be a hedge  the more stock you buy  the more you hedge  You have no clue if its a directional bet or not  Soros is betting huge on fracking  but at the same time funds anti  fracking media companies  What garbage noise 
When you figure out what Soros  intentions are just let me know  I care nary a wit what he does anyway 
The ten year note closed the week at 2 34   If this keeps up you will be paying the treasury to hold your money  Why not  They re doing it in Europe  Its the new craze and it s what all the broken countries are doing  It s all a puzzle wrapped in an enigma

23033,244548,GRBK,The World Has Gone Crazy About Alternative Energy,opinion,"They say that the cure for high oil prices is higher oil prices  The so called alternative energy sources   solar  wind  biofuel  etc  did not need high oil prices in order to earn a spot among the best performing stocks in the past couple of years 
The biggest surprise in 2013 was the performance of solar stocks  After being the biggest dogs in the market for three years in a row  they suddenly started to report better than expected earnings  The market noticed that there might be an ongoing change in the solar industry s pricing power and started to bid up all solar shares  Stocks like SolarCity  NASDAQ SCTY   SunPower  NASDAQ SPWR   Sunedison  NYSE SUNE  and Canadian Solar  NASDAQ CSIQ  more than quadrupled in 2013 alone 

This trend has had its indirect continuation in 2014  The best performing stocks so far this year are biofuel producers  BioFuel Energy Corp  NASDAQ BIOF  is up 620  year to date  Pacific Ethanol Inc  NASDAQ PEIX  is up the more  humble  340  this year  Green Plains Renewable Energy Inc  NASDAQ GPRE  is up  only  131  this year 

The last time biofuels and solar stocks were market leaders was in 2007 early 2008  when the price of crude oil passed  100 per barrel for the first time in history and there was rampant inflation  Today  the price of crude oil is near  100 again  but its effect on public psychology has significantly diminished  We have seen this number before and we have paid for it at the gas pump   100 is the new normal  It is not something that people complain or talk about any more  We have accepted it and we won t notice until crude oil climbs above  150 per barrel 

What is interesting about the recent huge outperformance of alternative energy stocks is that there hasn t been a big spike in oil in 2013 or 2014  If anything  in 2014 crude oil is trading near its year to date lows as the new form of horizontal drilling called fracking has helped us to find ample new supplies of oil and natural gas 
Has the market run out of stocks to bid up so that it is going after them or is it seeing a bigger trend in the making  We are more inclined to believe in the latter  It remains to be seen  The truth is that you didn t have to know anything about big macro energy trends in order to profit from the moves in solar and biofuel stocks  All you had to do was to follow price and pay attention to stocks that were showing up on the 52 week high list

23034,244549,GRBK,StocKs To Keep An Eye On Now,opinion,"Thursday was a good day on Wall Street for trading  but not necessarily for the markets  BUT the afternoon rally was a beauty  Let s take a look at some of the stocks that are doing well and see where they re headed 
Anacor Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ ANAC  had another great day  Looking back to the little top in Jan  and another top April  those highs were taken out last week  it pulled back and tested  and on Thursday  it blew through it again  with a 25 48 high  and closed at the high going away at the highest level ever  a new all time high  It looks like it wants to go higher  Look for it to head up toward the 29 30 range  which is the next target for ANAC 
Enphase Energy  Inc   NASDAQ ENPH   is a new swing trade of ours  This stock was up 54 cents  or 3 3   on 1 1 million shares on Thursday  That s the best volume in five or six days  and the second best in a couple weeks  After the recent breakout  it looks like this one may be headed up toward 20 
FireEye  Inc   NASDAQ FEYE  is acting well  Since May this stock ran up in a 3 wave corrective move  it formed a bear flag  rolled over and tested the lows  that was followed by another move up  After the reversal a week and a half ago  I m a little skeptical  but with 5 up days in a row  and getting through two levels of resistance  it may very well test the 37 39 zone  It went as high as 36 85 on Thursday  If it did get a consolidation in that zone  it wouldn t be so bad  The target is 37 37 1 4 short term  and then upwards to 41 41 1 2  It has a very nice basing pattern  a surge in volume and good technicals 
RadNet  Inc   NASDAQ RDNT   a swing trade of ours  broke out of a 4 week coil on Thursday  and popped 79 cents  or 11   on 2 3 million shares  closing at the high end of the range  Look for a run of 10 dollars

23035,244550,GRBK,4 Stocks To Watch Now,opinion,"Wall Street had a nice day on Monday  The indices opened strong  and ran all day in a rising channel  Stocks that we follow did well  but it looks like the indices are still a little short term long in the tooth  Nevertheless  momentum is strong  and Apple Inc s  NASDAQ AAPL  earnings were pretty much blow out  and should be an impetus for the market on Tuesday  Let s take a look at some of the stocks we re following closely 
BioDelivery Sciences International Inc   NASDAQ BDSI  is one of our swing trades and is looking great  It spiked down  took out some stops  and ran right back up four days in a row  This rally is taking a lot of the biotech stocks up with it  The resistance on this stock is going to be at 18  and if it gets through that  look for it to head up to the 20 21 zone 
BioFuel Energy Corp   NASDAQ BIOF  had a good day  up 41 cents  or 56   on 809 700 shares  Anyone who has a question about this one  I strongly suggest seeking out the details about the deal  Basically  in a week or so it s going to become J D  Builders  The bottom line is  they have about 200 million dollars in revenue  and what I m hearing is that it should be worth something like 45 55 cents a share  It could spurt that stock to the 10 11 range again  maybe all the way up to 13 short term  If and when it gets through 10  that s the next target 
NQ Mobile Inc   NYSE NQ  had a nice day on Monday  After the spike down in July  the spike up  and then consolidation  this stock had gone from 5 68  all the way up to 9 35 in the last four weeks  More importantly  on Monday  it broke out over the August highs  Now we can set up a target around 10 1 2 11 
SunEdison  Inc   NYSE SUNE  is looking good  I am very pleased about how it had pulled back on Friday  and then snapped right back on Monday  holding support  and then moving up 1 28  or 7 7   on 25 million shares  That s very heavy volume  There may be some more upside up toward the 20 21 zone

Anacor Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ ANAC   another biotech that is acting phenomenal  is at the highest level I ve ever seen in this stock  It broke out across the trading range  and multiple tops on Monday  and followed through nicely on Tuesday  up 82 cents  or 3   If there s more upside  perhaps to 34 5 
Avanir Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ AVNR  has progressed well  and on Tuesday  it popped  getting as high as 12 36  right at resistance and backed off  It was up 11 cents  or  94   on 3 9 million shares  Volume needs to be higher  At the bottom of all this is a bullish flag  and if it breaks out  I could see 18 19 on this stock at some point

23037,244552,GRBK,Stocks To Watch  CYBR  GRBK  MXWL  RGLS,opinion,"It was another good day on Wall Street on Monday  A lot of stocks we traded and are looking at did well  We put out a few swing trades  So  let s take a look at some of them 
Cyber Ark Software Ltd   NASDAQ CYBR   which I put out a swing trade on Monday  did very well  It ran up at the high for the day going away at 47 01  up 4 20  or 9 8   I was very pleased with that  You can see the 5 wave flag  or coil  on 2 4 million shares  At this point  I would look at least for an extension toward the 49 50 area as my next target  but it could accelerate 
Green Brick Partners  Inc   NASDAQ GRBK  has been up nine out of eleven days  and is slowly but surely moving back up  The volume has receded a little  but it has crossed the moving averages  If it does get a pullback from the resistance zone without falling through  and gets right up to the 12 50 range  it could pull back and form a little flag in here  and then take off  Either way  I like the pattern and it looks very promising 
Maxwell Technologies  Inc   NASDAQ MXWL  had a great day on Monday  We put a swing trade out on it again  It opened at 10 67  ran up to 11 49  pulled backed to 10 60  popped  and closed at 11 46  up 83 cents  or 7 8   on a solid 508 800 shares traded  If it gets a follow through here we could see a quick 13 dollars a share 
Regulus Therapeutics Inc   NASDAQ RGLS  was looking really well on Monday  It snapped out of the little falling wedge that it was in  up 1 66  or 10 2   on 2 2 million shares
