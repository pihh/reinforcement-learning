160964,382480,AXP,Is American Express Stock a Buy ,news,"While the prophets of doom continue to worry about how long our thriving economy can last  top performing companies continue to belt out exciting new products and reap gains  Financial services are an important element of a healthy economy  and American Express  NYSE AXP  is a company that s still bringing out innovative products to engage with its customers 
Despite strong competition from the likes of juggernauts Visa and Mastercard  American Express is holding on to its niche customer base and expanding its unique business model 

A great fourth quarter
American Express released its fourth quarter earnings on Friday  and they showed continued high revenue and growth  Fourth quarter revenue came in at  11 4 billion  an increase of 9  year over year  Full year revenue was up 8   and earnings per share were  7 99  up from  7 91 in 2018  This marked the tenth straight quarter of close to or at double digit growth 
2019 saw 11 5 million new cards issued  with 70  of new card members opting for fee based products  The company has released or refreshed more than 50 cards in the consumer and commercial spaces over the past two years 
Fees  spend  and lend
The company makes its revenue from a mix of products it calls  fees  spend  and lend   which encompasses its fee based products  consumer spending  and loans  In the fourth quarter conference call  CEO Stephen Squeri spelled out how the company is delivering on a four pronged strategic approach that he outlined when he took the helm two years ago 
These were his four strategic imperatives  and how the company accomplished each one this past year 


Strengthening leadership in the premium consumer space  American Express continually refreshes its  premium charge products   and it keeps upgrading global co brand portfolios  which include partnerships with companies that offer special packages for American Express customers  It has agreements with premium retailers  such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Apple  that are in line with its premium subscription base  


Extending leadership in the commercial payments space  American Express has a strong focus on small and medium sized businesses and offers various products to fit their needs  which it also continually refreshes  It also services this client base with AP automation solutions and loan and repayment programs  which it offers as a non bank financial services organization and allow small businesses to have all of these needs taken care of under one roof  It also offers premium services for business travelers such as airport club lounge access and real time foreign currency exchange  


Expanding digital partnerships and targeted acquisitions  American Express has invested in its mobile platform with several acquisitions so cardmembers can have easy access to the company s special rewards platforms  including travel and dining options and other lifestyle services  as well as easily manage their money and business needs  Some of the company s recent acquisitions were Resy  which makes it easy to book a table at a restaurant digitally  and Cake  which simplifies paying a restaurant bill and adds value to the customer with payment options   

Leveraging its integrated model toward becoming the most innovative network  Part of this goal was to be accepted by a full network of merchants by the end of 2019  and the company has nearly achieved that with 99  of U S  merchants who take credit cards now accepting the American Express card  It s rare to hear  We don t take Amex  these days  It also recently worked out a deal with the People s Bank of China to expand its network there 

Long term growth
One of the company s advantages is its extensive range of revenue building devices  composed of cards fees  loans  billings  interest  and more  which gives it great insulation against mishaps in any one of its divisions  When everything works together  such as the current state  it s even stronger 
Not only has American Express been able to please its core premium customers  it s also attracting millennials  a younger and more digitally occupied clientele  About 81  of American Express  customers engage with digital payments  and the company saw a 26  increase year over year in the number of customers who engage daily with the mobile app 
The company expects continued growth in the range of 8  to 10   Squeri said  Our consistent performance  along with our continued investments in product innovation and growth opportunities  gives us confidence that we have a long runway for steady growth over the long term  
So should you buy 
The main challenge for American Express would be if the portended recession actually comes and consumer spending    especially premium  the company s mainstay    slows down  So far  challenges from new financial technology companies have been unfounded  but the company has to keep up with its digital innovations to stay level  which has increased its expenses 
That said  American Express has reason to believe it can sustain its growth in the near future  and its share price trades at a fairly modest 16 9 times earnings  which makes it a good buy  It also pays a consistent dividend that currently stands at 1 27   I won t be selling my shares anytime soon ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/poi84,2070801

160990,382506,AXP,Why Shares of American Express Are Up Today,news,"What happened
Shares of American Express Co   NYSE AXP  traded up more than 5  on Friday morning  before giving some of that gain back in the afternoon  after the company reported better than expected fourth quarter earnings and provided an optimistic outlook for 2020  The company has now grown revenue by at least 8  for 10 straight quarters and management believes AmEx is well positioned to continue to generate growth 
So what
American Express before markets opened Friday reported fourth quarter earnings of  2 03 per share on revenue of  11 37 billion  ahead of expectations for  2 01 per share in earnings on sales of  11 36 billion  The earnings per share number was 17  above the fourth quarter 2018  and net revenue was up 9  year over year 

Company CEO Stephen J  Squeri in a statement said that during 2019 American Express added 11 5 million new proprietary cards  with 70  of the new cards choosing fee based products  That helped drive card fee revenue up 17  
 These results demonstrate the success of our strategy to generate sustainable  profitable growth across the enterprise over the long term   Squeri said 
Now what
American Express said it expects to grow revenue by 8  to 10  in 2020  and for earnings to come in at between  8 85 and  9 25 per share  Wall Street had been expecting the company to make  8 98 per share in 2020  The company expects the credit environment to remain steady in 2020  with  modest  increases in loss rates offset by growing loan volume and fee revenue 
The company on its post earnings call with analysts said that they believe the business is still in the early stages of growth  with expansion opportunities available from both existing and new customers 
Shares of American Express are up 35  over the past year  but if the company s outlook proves to be correct the stock still has room to run  American Express  like most bank stocks  is vulnerable to a potential recession  but as long as the U S  consumer remains strong  this company can thrive ",2020-01-24,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmiu6,2067438

our website at ir americanexpress com We ll begin today with Steve Squeri  Chairman and CEO  who will start with some remarks about the company s progress and results  and then Jeff Campbell  Chief Financial Officer  will provide a more detailed review of our performance  After that  we ll move to a Q A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff With that  let me turn it over to Steve Stephen J  Squeri    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Rosie  Good morning  I m pleased to report that our 2019 fourth quarter and full year results continued the steady consistent performance that we ve delivered over the past two years  Our strong top line growth continued with revenues growing 9  in the quarter  This marked our 10th straight quarter of FX adjusted revenue growth at or above 8   Once again  our revenue growth was broad based  driven by well balanced mix of fees  spend and lend  We added 11 5 million new proprietary cards in 2019  delivered solid billings growth  and continued to grow loans while maintaining industry leading credit metrics These results show that our strategy of investing in share  scale and relevance is working  This strategy is the heart of our financial model and it gives us confidence that in today s economic environment  we can sustain high levels of revenue growth  which is a foundation for steady double digit earnings growth  My confidence in our ability to generate consistent  solid results over the longer term is based on several factors  The fundamental strengths we derived from our differentiated business model  the significant growth opportunities we see across our business and our demonstrated success in executing our investment strategy against the four strategic imperatives I laid out two years ago Let me take a few minutes to share some of the highlights of the progress we made on each of these strategic imperatives in 2019  We expanded our leadership in the premium consumer space by continuing our disciplined strategic approach of refreshing our premium charge products and upgrading our co brand portfolios globally  In all these cases  we ve added features that our Card Members value  Acquisitions remain strong and approximately 70  of our new Card Members are choosing fee based products  which help to drive 17  growth in subscription like fee revenues for the year  Our new Card Members are skewing younger and are more digitally engaged  Our refreshed products are also enabling us to reengage with our existing customer base  where we re seeing increased organic spend  all time high Net Promoter Scores and steady retention In our commercial business  we ve taken our successful approach to strategic product refreshes  and applied to our business card portfolio in the US and select markets around the world  In addition to the refreshes  we ve expanded our commercial card offerings with the introduction of several new products for business customers of all sizes  And to deepen our relationships with our business customers  we continued our focus on growing our non card product offerings by expanding our AP automation solutions  as well as offering a variety of lending and flexible payment programs to help our business customers manage cash flow and grow their businesses In total  over the past two years  we ve refreshed and launched over 50 proprietary products across both our commercial and consumer businesses around the world  resulting in greater customer engagement and strong new card acquisitions  which are driving our revenue growth Turning to the network business  In 2016  we set an ambitious goal of achieving virtual parity coverage in the United States by the end of 2019  Setting this goal was a recognition of the fundamental importance that our merchant network plays in driving growth across our businesses  and it galvanized our organization s focus on achieving it  I m very pleased to report that as of year end 2019  based on our internal tracking and our understanding of the latest industry data  we have achieved virtual parity coverage with approximately 99  of credit card accepting merchants in the US now able to accept the American Express card Of course  we recognize that virtual parity coverage will always be a moving target  The merchant landscape is dynamic with hundreds of thousands of US businesses opening and closing every year  Therefore  we will continue to focus on maintaining virtual parity coverage in the US in 2020 and beyond  We re also making good progress to increase coverage across our international markets where our Card Members live  work and travel to the most  and this will continue to be a focus for us Going forward  as we continue to grow our network  we ll work with our merchant partners in the US and around the world to ensure that our Card Members are warmly welcomed and encouraged to spend in a millions of places where their Amex cards are accepted Finally  I m also pleased to report that the People s Bank of China officially accepted our network application  an important next step in our plan to build a network business in China  On the digital front  we ve been hard at work integrating the acquisitions we ve made over the last few years into our mobile app to provide our Card Members with premium access and experiences across a wide range of travel  dining and lifestyle services that differentiate us from our competitors  We re also working with our partners and our internal development teams to deliver a wide range of new online and mobile features  capabilities and services to help our customers manage their life and their business efficiently and securely Our goal in these initiatives is to deepen the digital ties we have with our customers so that American Express become an indispensable part of their lives  and we re seeing good results as customer engagement with our digital channels are strong and growing  Today  81  of our active Card Members are digitally engaged with us  be it on our app and our website  and we ve seen a 26  increase year over year in the customers who use our mobile app daily Those are just some of the highlights of our accomplishments in 2019  As I ve reported each quarter for the past two years  the progress we ve made in each of these areas is driving our performance and shows that our financial model and investment strategy has generated sustainable growth  That s why we ll continue the strategic approach and why we re confident that we have a long runway for steady growth over the long term  With that in mind  we expect to deliver revenue growth in 2020 of 8  to 10  on an FX adjusted basis and earnings of  8 85 to  9 25 Looking ahead  our business is strong and our focus is clear  We have incredibly talented team at all levels and strong relationships with a wide array of outstanding business partners from our co brand and digital partners to our millions of merchant partners around the globe  all working together to deliver the best products and services for our customers  I m excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in 2020 and beyond  and I m confident in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable growth for our shareholders Now  let me turn it over to Jeff Jeffrey C  Campbell    Chief Financial OfficerWell  thank you  Steve  and good morning  everyone  It s good to be here today to talk about the fourth quarter and what was a solid year for American Express and to lay out our expectations for 2020  I ll discuss both our quarterly and full year results this morning since it is our year end call  and since looking at our performance on an annual basis is both more in line with how we actually manage the business and also gives us a better sense of the underlying trends Turning to our summary financials on Slide 3  fourth quarter revenues of  11 4 billion grew 9  on an FX adjusted basis and full year revenues of  43 6 billion also grew 9  on an FX adjusted basis  This growth has been all year  continues to be driven by a well balanced mix of growth in fee  spend and then revenues and was consistent with the high levels of revenue growth we ve delivered for over two years  This strong top line performance drove net income of  6 8 billion for the full year and  1 7 billion for the quarter In understanding our year over year results  I think we need to spend a minute on some discrete impacts in our reported results this year and last year  As a reminder  the fourth quarter of 2018 contained  0 58 of positive adjustments for discrete tax items related to the Tax Act of 2017 and certain tax audits  In addition  as you remember  in the first quarter of this year  we had a  0 21 charge from the resolution of certain merchant litigations If you adjust for these two impacts  as we have done on Slide 3  full year 2019 adjusted EPS was  8 20  up  0 12 versus the prior year adjusted EPS of  7 33  including the  2 03 of EPS in the fourth quarter  which was up 17  versus the prior year Turning now to the details of our performance  I ll start with billed business which you see several views of on Slides 4 through 6  Starting on Slide 4  total FX adjusted billed business growth was up 6  in the fourth quarter and for the full year  We do think it is important to continue to break out the billings growth between our proprietary and network businesses due to the differing trends as we continue to see the impact of exiting our network business in Europe and Australia due to regulatory changes The 13  of our overall billings that comes from our network business  GNS  was down 1  in the fourth quarter and down 2  for the full year on an FX adjusted basis as a result of the market exits  We do expect to fully lap the billings impact from these exits in the latter part of 2020 and return to positive levels of growth  Our proprietary business  which makes up 87  of total billings and drives most of our financial results  was up 7  in the fourth quarter and 8  for the full year on an FX adjusted basis Turning to Slide 5  as we have said throughout 2019  the proprietary billed business growth trends are consistent with the economic environment  solid growth but slower than the very robust growth we saw in 2018  You see this as you turn to Slide 6 to look at the billings by customer type for the fourth quarter Starting with US consumer  which made up 33  of the company s billings in the fourth quarter and remains our largest customer segment  billings were up 7   in line from the 7  to 8  growth we ve seen all year  This growth reflects continued strong acquisition performance and solid underlying spend growth from existing customers  These trends also highlight the relative strength of the consumer in the US Moving to the right  international consumer growth remained in the double digits at 11  on an FX adjusted basis despite the mixed macroeconomic and geopolitical environment  In the fourth quarter  we saw growth moderate in Mexico and the UK sequentially  driven by external factors so growth in the UK could remain in the mid teens  and we continued to see strong growth in the mid teens in our top markets across the European Union as well as in Japan Spending from our US small and mid sized enterprise Card Members  or SMEs  grew a solid 6  in the fourth quarter  in line with the third quarter  We continue to feel good about the steady acquisition results we were seeing in our US SME customers  and importantly  as we think about 2020  we saw stabilization in this key customer segment in Q4 International SME remains our highest growing customer type with 15  FX adjusted billings growth in the fourth quarter  We feel great about the strong growth we saw throughout 2019 coming off of even higher levels of growth in 2018  Given our focus on this segment and the low penetration we have in the top countries where we offer international small business products  we continued to believe we have a long runway to sustain strong growth going forward And then  for the relatively small part of our volumes  9  this quarter that come from large and global corporate card billings  we saw a decline of 1  on the fourth quarter on an FX adjusted basis  similar to what we saw last quarter  As we ve said for years  now this is not a growth segment for us  but it is an important part of our merchant value development  Technical Issues  Finally  on the far right  Global Network Services was down 1  on an FX adjusted basis  driven by the market exits that I mentioned earlier  And if you were to adjust for those impacts  the remaining portion of GNS was up 3  on an FX adjusted  in line with Q3  Overall  we continue to feel good about the breadth of our billings growth and the opportunities we see across the range of geographies and customer segments in which we operate Turning now to loan performance on Slide 7  total loan growth was 8  in the fourth quarter with about 60  of our growth for the year coming from our existing customers  We continue to focus on taking advantage of the unique opportunity we have to deepen our share of our existing customers  borrowing At the same time  as we ve been saying all year  we have increased our investments in premium products  and that shift in portfolio mix coupled with some steady tightening we have done on the risk management side over the past several years  has led to lower loan growth The shift toward more premium products has also led to lower loan balances on promotional offers  which along with continued positive impacts from pricing for risk  contributed to the 50 basis point year over year increase in net interest yield in the fourth quarter  if you see on the right hand side of Slide 7  So the combination of loan growth and yield increase has drove the 12  growth in net interest income that we delivered this quarter  Ultimately  we are focused on driving profitable revenue growth as the financial outcome of our lending strategy  and so we are pleased with the stability in net interest income growth that we saw in 2019 Turning next to the credit metrics on Slide 8  If you were to take an average for the year to smooth out the quarterly volatility  lending rates were up 22 basis points and charge rates were up 14 basis points on average for the full year  This level of modest write off rate increases in a BAU environment is consistent with the expectations we have talked about for several years now  And as you can see on the bottom of the slide  delinquency rates have been relatively stable all year and the GCP loss ratio continued to actually be down year over year These trends reflect both the credit implications of our strategy as well as the relatively stable economy and low unemployment rate  We continue to expect modest increases in our loss rates in 2020  consistent with the trends we ve now seen for several years  Importantly  we still do not see anything in our portfolios that would suggest a significant change in the credit environment both on the consumer and commercial side  In fact  all of these portfolios performed much better in 2019 than we expected at the beginning of the year This brings us to provision expense  which grew 7  in the fourth quarter and for the full year  The business decisions we ve made to shift more toward premium products along with tightening things a bit on the risk management side both contributed to the loan growth  credit metrics and provision trends we saw in 2019 Moving forward  while there may be some variability in the monthly turns  we expect relatively steady loan growth in 2020  And as I mentioned a few moments ago  from a credit perspective  we expect the kind of modest increases in loss rates year over year that we ve been seeing to continue  As a result of these dynamics  we do expect higher provision expense growth in 2020 than we saw in 2019 While we re on the subject of provision  yes  let me such on CECL  As you know  the CECL accounting changes went into effect on January 1st  2020 for us as well as the rest of the industry  In our first quarter results  we ll report the implementation or day one impact  which we will    which we estimate will increase credit reserves by about  1 2 billion  The increase will run net of tax through equity with no impact to earnings  But I would remind you that a unique aspect of American Express is our charge card portfolio  So although our card and other lending reserves will go up by approximately  1 7 billion  we will have an offset from the approximately  0 5 billion decrease in charge reserves  given the short life of those receivables Now  as a reminder  this increase will not have a material impact on our capital ratios or our ability to return capital to shareholders  given our 30  plus return on equity and the multi year phase in period for regulatory capital purposes Then we get to the ongoing or  as some would say  the day two impact of accounting for CECL and our ongoing provision expense starting in the first quarter of 2020  Under our current outlook  we expect a relatively modest increase to our annual 2020 provision expense from the implementation of CECL  More significantly  I do expect that there will be more quarter to quarter volatility under CECL compared to the previous methodology  though some of this volatility should net out over the course of the year  making our long standing focus on annual results  rather than quarterly results  even more pronounced in 2020 Now let s get back to our results and turn to revenues on Slide 10  FX adjusted revenue growth was 9  in the fourth quarter and for the full year  The focused execution of our strategy has delivered strong top line revenue growth of 8  or more for the last 10 quarters on an FX adjusted basis  This consistent revenue performance has occurred in both the robust economic environment of 2018 and the somewhat slower growth environment of 2019 and continues to be supported by a well balanced mix of growth in fee spend and lend revenues as you see on Slide 11 Net card fees remained the fastest growing revenue line of 17  for the full year and accelerating to 20  in the fourth quarter  We are really pleased by the confidence that our customers place in our value propositions when they choose to pay these subscription like fees  And we continue to see that the majority of our new Card Members  around 70   are choosing our fee based products as well Supported by the continued execution of our product refreshment strategy and our focus on premium value propositions  we expect card fee revenues will remain the fastest growing revenue line in 2020  We are confident in our ability to maintain strong card fee growth  given the breadth of products that are driving this momentum across geographies and customer segments  as well as the high levels of engagement we see with new and existing Card Members These high levels of engagement  supported by the progress we ve made around coverage  continue to drive steady growth in our largest and most important revenue line  discount revenue  which was up 6  for the full year and in the fourth quarter  broadly in line with billings  And net interest income grew at 12  for the full year and in the fourth quarter  driven by the growth in loans and net yield that I mentioned a few moments ago Looking ahead  I expect net interest income growth to continue to be a bit higher than loan growth driven by continued benefits from pricing  mix as well as a modest tailwind from 2019 rate cuts  Importantly  the portion of our revenue coming from fee and spend revenues remained at 80  for the full year and the fourth quarter  in line with history  and we expect that revenue composition to continue  given our differentiated spend and fee centric model Moving on to expenses on Slide 13  overall expenses grew 9  in the fourth quarter and for the full year  There are three important items impacting the quarter here that more or less offset what are important to understand First  there were a few positive income tax and other tax related developments in the quarter that show up in the low effective tax rate as well as in the operating expense line  We then  as we often do  took the opportunity to reinvest the upside we saw relative to our original plans to do two important things for the long term health of the business  First  we accelerated the funding of some incremental business growth initiatives similar to what we did in last year s fourth quarter  and second  we accelerated some of the things we are doing to evolve our organization for the future and improve operating efficiencies and  as a result  we took a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter  which is included in the salary and benefits line in the tables that accompany our earnings release  As I mentioned before  the impact of these three items roughly offset one another  and you see the impacts across OpEx  marketing and business development  and the lower effective tax rate at the bottom of the page Looking at the full year  our OpEx growth of 8  was also impacted by the litigation related charge we took in the first quarter of 2019 that I mentioned earlier in my remarks  And as I ve said previously  some of the investments we are making to deliver continued strong revenue growth  growth in sales force  growth in premium servicing and enhancements in digital capabilities caused us in 2019 to see more growth in operating expenses than we ve seen in recent years  or importantly  than we expect to see going forward  We have a long track record of generating operating expense leverage by growing OpEx more slowly than revenues  and going forward  we are confident that we have a long runway to continue to do so Turning now to Slide 14  to look at the trend in customer engagement expenses  overall customer engagement expenses for the full year grew 10  as a result of our investment strategy  Starting at the bottom marketing and Business Development costs were up 10  for the full year due to our continued focus on funding growth initiatives and in part the incremental impact of the 11 year extension of our long standing partnership with Delta that we signed earlier this year Moving on to rewards expense  you can see that it grew 8  and was broadly in line with proprietary billed business growth for the full year  And as we continue to evolve our value propositions and see high engagement with our premium benefits  Card Member services grew 25  for the full year  While there were some adjustments that caused slower growth in Card Member services in the fourth quarter  we continue to expect this line to be our fastest growing expense category as it includes the cost of many components of our differentiated value propositions such as airport lounge access and other travel benefits  which we believe are difficult for others to replicate and help support the strong acquisition and engagement we are seeing on our fee based products  Going forward  we continue to expect total customer engagement expenses to grow a bit faster than revenues as we continue to invest in share  scale and relevance Turning to capital on Slide 15  We ended the year with a CET1 ratio of 10 7   which is near the top of our 10  to 11  target range  During the year  we increased our dividend by 10  and returned  6 billion of capital to our shareholders  This outcome is a testament to the 30  plus return on equity that our financial model generates  as well as our focus on maintaining capital strength while consistently returning excess capital to our shareholders  As we ve said  our primary focus is on maintaining our CET1 ratio within our 10  to 11  target range as the governor of our capital distribution plans  and we do not believe that CECL will have a material impact on those plans To sum up  we feel really good about our steady and consistent performance throughout 2019  Looking ahead  we see a long runway to sustain high levels of revenue growth and double digit EPS growth in today s economic environment  That brings me to our outlook for 2020  and then we ll open the call for your questions Our guidance for 2020 is consistent with our financial growth algorithm  As Steve mentioned at the start of our call  we are introducing our 2020 earnings per share guidance at a range of  8 85 to  9 25  Our guidance does assume an economy that looks somewhat similar to 2019 and reflects what we know today about the regulatory and competitive environment  Consistent with the performance we ve been delivering for over two years  this guidance includes revenue growth of 8  to 10  on an FX adjusted basis  And at current exchange rates  we d expect a more modest headwind from FX in our reported growth than we saw in 2019 And as I mentioned earlier  we will continue to invest to drive those high levels of revenue growth and so we expect customer engagement expenses to grow a bit faster than revenues again in 2020  And we are committed to generating operating expense leverage by growing our 2020 OpEx at a slower pace than revenues and slower than the pace we saw in 2019 Looking at the drivers of our financial results  there were a few other key planning assumptions I d highlight  As I mentioned earlier  we expect the provision growth to be higher in 2020 than it was in 2019  including a relatively modest increase from CECL  We do expect CECL to drive more volatility quarter to quarter  and so focusing on the full year results will be even more critical in 2020 In addition  we expect that our effective tax rate will be around 21  next year  In summary  we remain focused on sustaining high levels of revenue growth and in today s environment  double digit EPS growth  As I look at our performance over the past two years and our expectations for 2020  they clearly demonstrate consistent execution against our strategy as well as our financial growth algorithm With that  I ll turn the call back over to Rosie Rosie Perez    Senior Vice President  Head of Investor RelationsThank you  Jeff  Before we open up the lines for Q A  I ll ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question  Thanks for your cooperation And with that  operator  we ll now open up the line for questions  Operator Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo  Please go ahead Don Fandetti    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystGood to see the solid guide for  20  Jeff  wanted to confirm  does the EPS guidance include the negative impact of CECL Jeffrey C  Campbell    Chief Financial OfficerYes  absolutely  So when you think about the range we ve provided this year  Don  I would say  the normal thing of    you have to think about a little stronger economy pushes us toward the higher end of the weaker economy    which is why a lower end range is there  and CECL is the other uncertainty  But absolutely we are contemplating  what I call  the relatively modest impact of CECL in there  so you should go with that as full GAAP guidance Don Fandetti    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystAnd are you in your guidance  I mean  I assume we re sort of at the trough of billed business here as you re lapping some tougher comps  Do you have an acceleration built in and could you talk about the discount rate  LDR  knowing that you re sort of willing to scale that up and down Jeffrey C  Campbell    Chief Financial OfficerWell  I think what I would actually point you to is  the remarks we ve started with is we ve had 10 straight quarters now  Don  of revenue growth  which is ultimately what we re focused on in the 8  to 10  range  and the fourth quarter was another strong quarter of revenue growth  So actually when we look at that metric  which ultimately is the end goal of the mixture of everything we re doing with card fees  with pricing  loan growth  billings  with the discount rate  we actually see a lot of stability in the momentum that we re entering in terms of revenue growth Stephen J  Squeri    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think the other point is that if you look over these 10 quarters  we ve shown that there is an elasticity to our billed business that still continues to drive the high revenue growth  And so  given the high card fees  the higher growth in card fees  the consistent performance we ve had from a net interest income perspective  billings can fluctuate up and down  The other thing I would point out is not all billings are created equally  So  we feel really comfortable with where we wound up and how we enter the year from a billings perspective OperatorNext question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays  Please go ahead Mark DeVries    Barclays    AnalystYeah  thanks  Steve  I have a question for you just on what inning you guys are in  in this kind of product launch and refresh cycle  And I m assuming given you ve done 50 already that it s pretty late innings  and the reason I m asking is  as you pointed out  it s been a big contributor to adding new customers reengaging with existing ones and presumably been really helpful in generating that strong revenue growth  And if we are in kind of later innings  what are you looking to as kind of the levers to continue to sustain that revenue growth Stephen J  Squeri    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  The interesting thing is  I wouldn t equate this to innings  I would equate this to baseball seasons  because the way you ve got to think about this is that product refreshes can happen on a three to four year basis  And so  we get to play seasonal over again  And so  if you look at 50 refreshes over the last two years  there are still more to do within the existing portfolio  And by the time you get done  guess what  Some of your products are three and four years old now  So  I wouldn t think about this as a one time thing  And I think you have to think about this as continuous refreshment because  look  the reality is our customer base constantly changes  we re looking to appeal to new customers at all aspects  If you look at Platinum before we did the refresh  Platinum was not as attractive to millennials as it is today  And if you look at the value and the benefits that we put on it  it s become a much more attractive product  and most of our growth has come from millennial uptake Look  we have    since the refresh  we have 60  more Platinum Cards than we did prior to that refresh  and over 50  of the new cards acquired to millennials  so I wouldn t think about this as an innings game  I think about this as we constantly play the baseball season  and there s going to be another season and another season and another season  It s just going to be different    it s going to be different card products  And when you look at our portfolio of card products  it s in hundreds  so we have a ways to go OperatorNext we go to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley  Please go ahead Betsy Graseck    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHi  I was hoping that you could talk a little bit about the network opportunities outside the US  I know you mentioned  Steve  that you ve essentially achieved parity in the US now  And maybe if you could give us a sense because I know that was a three year outlook that you gave  I think  last year  and where are we there and should we expect acceleration  Thanks Stephen J  Squeri    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So  look  from an outside of the US perspective  obviously we re nowhere near where we are in the US  We identified a strategy that we wanted to increase overall coverage internationally by 20  over a three year period  We talked about that at Investor Day  I say  without giving specific metrics on this we ve made progress  We expect to hit that 20  growth target over that three year period  It s a very focused strategy in that we re looking at key cities  We re looking at the key cities that our Card Members travel to and that we have large card bases in  and we re also working with our network partners in markets that we do not have proprietary businesses to continue to grow that  and let s not forget our efforts in China Our license has been accepted  We re waiting for the final approval  and hopefully sometime this year  we will launch the network  and that will increase not only coverage in China  but what it ll do is  it ll put more cards on the network as we engage with the Chinese banks to have more Chinese travelers as they go into  And the reality is  they are going to go into a lot of our European and Asian cities  which is going to put more demand and will actually then help drive more coverage So we re still committed to it and we continue to invest in it  And the other point I would make out is the US is not done  From a US perspective  as I said in my remarks  it is a moving piece  And so  what we need to do is to continue to sign those merchants that come into busines s and what we also need to do is to continue our efforts to have warm acceptance  And from a warm acceptance perspective  what we mean is decals on the doors  we put up over 1 million decals this year just in the United States alone  and it s an education process as well  It s an education process for the merchants and it s an education process for our Card Members that in fact the card is accepted So  what we ve laid  what we would call technical acceptance  there s some more work to be done from a warm acceptance perspective and our Card Members realizing now that the coverage is there so you ll see a lot of work in those areas as well OperatorNext we go to Bob Napoli with William Blair  Please go ahead Bob Napoli    William Blair    AnalystGood morning  Thank you  Steve  Jeff and Rosie  Appreciate it  Just    the    your competitors have been making some significant acquisitions Visa acquiring PLAD  I mean  Mastercard several acquisitions  I mean PayPal buying Honey  American Express has done some interesting tuck in acquisitions  but first of all  is there any concern about some of the acquisitions  From a competitive perspective  I d like a Visa Platt and is Amex  It seems like there are so many opportunities to leverage your brand in your network  With all of this innovation in the FinTech and software space  is there areas that you would like to leverage or invest more into whether it s security or other areas Stephen J  Squeri    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerLook  we re not going to get into obviously specific acquisitions  but you know what you ve seen our focus over the last sort of 24 months has really been from some of our digital capabilities whether that be Mezi or Resy or Cake and obviously LoungeBuddy and we did ACOM pay so what we re trying to do is build out the organic footprint we have with our existing Card Members  we re trying to engage with them more digitally Look  our competitors  Visa  MasterCard  PayPal  PayPal is really a partner more than a competitor  when you look at what they re doing they re doing things that are smart for them  they re run by really smart people  and they ve got their strategies  And their main focus is connectivity and bringing more and more and different types of transactions across those rails  and I think that the acquisitions that they ve done to build out from a network perspective are smart acquisitions for them When we look at what we re trying to do from a Card Member to merchant perspective  we feel really comfortable with what we ve done  And I think just looking at the Plaid acquisition  which I think is a good acquisition by Visa  it allows them to provide connectivity from their bank partners into fintech  In fact  we used Plaid today  We have an investment in Plaid and we ll make a little bit on that as well  And so  that s a more sensible acquisition for them than it would be for us  not only from an economic perspective  but certainly from a strategic perspective  and I think just a customer perspective  So  we look at everything  we have our own target list of things that we want to do and things that quite honestly just don t make sense for us  where we re positioned with our model OperatorNext  we go to Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse  Please go ahead Moshe Orenbuch    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  Thanks  You guys highlighted the    being between that 8  and 10  revenue growth  kind of a long string of quarters and pretty much right in the middle of that over the course of 2019  As you look into 2020  you talked a little bit  maybe a little bit of slowdown on the net interest income  Are there any other things that you d be looking at to accelerate from where they were here Jeffrey C  Campbell    Chief Financial OfficerWell  Moshe  I guess  we look at the stability we ve seen overall in revenue growth  10 quarters of 8  to 10   and see tremendous momentum to continue to meet that same target in 2020  When you look at acceleration  I would actually point you to card fee growth  So card fee growth has been our fastest growing revenue line and actually accelerated in Q4  And for all the reasons Steve described  we re pretty bullish on our ability to keep that as our fastest growing revenue line  I d also point out to everyone that of course you have a large    because of the way we give the accounting for this  as you would know  Moshe  we have a large portion of next year s card fees just sitting on the balance sheet waiting to be amortized  So we feel really good about that line And net interest income  I would point out actually has been very steady sequentially because while our booked loan growth rate has moderated a little bit  that part of that is just us being a little bit tighter about things like promotional offers  And that s why your yield is going up and net interest income growth has actually been pretty flat  So  gosh  we would look at the 2020 revenue guidance and say  it s a continuation of what we ve been putting up for about 2 5 years and we feel pretty good about the stability we see in the economy  the stability we see in our credit performance and the tremendous strength frankly of the US consumer OperatorNext  we go to a question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW  Please go ahead Sanjay Sakhrani    KBW    AnalystThanks  good morning  It sounds like the guidance ranges are more related to execution than anything else  But last year  Jeff  you guys have talked about a scenario where there was macroeconomic weakening  To the extent that there was any weakness  how should we think about this guidance especially on the EPS side  Thanks Jeffrey C  Campbell    Chief Financial OfficerWell  look  I think the results we posted  Sanjay  in 2019  demonstrate that we ve got a model that produce steady results in the really robust economic environment of 2018 and continue to produce those same results in the more modest growth environment of 2019  So  there is clearly a range of economic outcomes around where we are  where our model is flexible enough or resistant enough to change  I ll go back to the card fee point I just made to Moshe  where our card fee growth is actually pretty resilient in different economic environments  So  we feel good about our guidance across any reasonable range of economic outcomes that anyone is forecasting right now  Now if there is a sudden dramatic shift  upwards or downwards  that s the kind of thing that it would take to probably cause us to move off that range OperatorNext we go to Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America  Please go ahead Jason Kupferberg    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThanks  guys  Good morning  So  I just wanted to start on the enterprise commercial side  I know it s still only 9  of billings  but I think last quarter we were expecting maybe a little bit of an uptick we got instead a little bit of a downtick there  on a constant currency basis  So  I was just wondering  I know last quarter you had a couple of specific customers that were call outs as driving some of the softness  Were those continuing to be headwinds in Q4  Was there more of a malaise in corporate T E  Do you still think we get back to  call it  low single digit in 2020  And then  just on a quick side note  can you size that restructuring charge for us in the quarter  Thank you Stephen J  Squeri    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo let me quickly do the facts on the two  and then Steve will probably add a little bit of color  On the large and global  I guess  we look at it and we say  sequentially it s about the same as it was last quarter  Yes  you do have the same two large customers where there is some things unique to those customers going on  But look  we ve said for a long time  this isn t a growth segment for us  these are big companies doing T E  it s an important part of the franchise  So we re not  frankly  particularly overly focused on that rate  We re focused on other parts of commercial On the restructuring charge  the point I would make to everyone is  this is just an example of what we ve done for many  many years  which is we had some very good developments on the tax side  We use that to accelerate some spending  Around a range of growth initiatives  you see some of that in the marketing line  some of that in some of the other customer engagement lines  And yes  we did take a restructuring charge  it s a little bit more than  100 million  Look  we ve been growing    expenses we ve added over 5 000 colleagues in the last year  we will continue to grow expenses in 2020  Frankly we re going to continue that to add colleagues  But we got to make sure we have the right people in the right place  so that we can continue as we have for many  many years to scale our company as we grow our volumesJeffrey C  Campbell    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  As far as restructuring  I think  Jeff hit all that  Look  I think with the large and global  it s from a company perspective  not a lot of companies are looking to grow their T E  So you don t have sort of the organic growth that you would have  And then  you have a couple of companies that pull back or you have a loss here or there  and you feel that in the numbers  But it is 9  of the overall billings  but from a profit perspective  it s a lot less than that  This is an important part of our business from a network perspective  and it allows us to utilize our scale and infrastructure to really support our middle market business and our small business And so it plays an important role  and I think where that    where we are from a perspective of overall billings  we re comfortable with  It would be great if it would grow  But if it grows  it s not going to make that much of a different from a profitability perspective  which gets back to my point about not all billings are created equally  Some billings have a lot more profitability than others  And so  I think you ll probably see this sort of flatness continue as we move into next year  It s something that we re doing in our own company as well I mean  we re not looking to grow our T E expenses  It s not    I don t sit around my staff and say  let s see how we can grow more T E  I wouldn t mind sitting around with a lot of my customer staffs and saying that  but we don t do that  And so    and I think companies are doing that  and you re looking at T E and looking at some more video conferencing and things like that  and reducing some of the travel  and you see that in the numbers OperatorNext we go to Rick Shane with JPMorgan  Please go ahead Rick Shane    JPMorgan    AnalystHey  guys  Thanks for taking my questions this morning  Look  given the maturity of the business  and it s really impressive to see your US consumer business  which is a third of your business growing at the rate that it is  I m curious to sort of understand what you think is driving that  Is there an increase in discretionary spending among your legacy customers or when you cite particularly the growth of millennials in the portfolio  it s the ramp in their spending Stephen J  Squeri    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  Rick  the interesting thing about our business is  it s probably not mature yet  And I think one of the reasons after the financial crisis everybody jumped into this business  especially the banks in a big way  is because this is a business that just continues to grow  When you look at the consumer business in the United States  it s sort of 8   8   8   8   and you see that    you ll see that continuing And I think when we look at our business and  for maturity perspective  look  it s a mix of new customers  it s a mix of what we would call same store sales  if you re thinking about this from a retail perspective  it s a mix of organic spending as well  But we re bringing in new customers to the franchise  and our brand is playing a lot more with millennials  which is over half of our customers that we are acquiring at this particular point in time  and the reach that we re getting with some of our co brand partners is getting us new customers as well So  I don t really look at this business as really mature  I look at this business as having a lot    and I m going to just talk about our business  I m talking about the card business in general  I think about this is a business that still has a lot of legs and a lot of growth  and you see a lot of the technological changes  whether it s sort of tap and go and making it easy to buy online and so forth  I mean  just with contactless  you re going to see more and more smaller dollar transactions coming on to card products  whether that be vending machine transactions  which is the next thing that s going to happen  You re seeing this with transit  obviously now in New York City  you can use tap and go through the New York City transit system So  we don t really look at this as a mature business at all  And we think there is expansion opportunities for us not only with new customers  but also with our existing customers  As we have less than half their share of wallet and we have    as we ve said for a long time  we only have about 23  of their share of lending  So  we think there is still a lot of upside in this business OperatorNext we go to David Togut with Evercore ISI  Please go ahead David Togut    Evercore ISI    AnalystThank you  Good morning  International consumer and international SME continue to be your fastest growth businesses  In particular  you ve called out strength in the UK and the European continent  Given the regulatory changes with Payment Services Directive 2 in Europe and UK  Visa and Mastercard have both acquired Fast ACH rails both to address PSD2 consumer ACH payments and also to complement their B2B payment capability  So my question really is  does fast ACH need to play a role in American Express s future  And if so  where would you have an interest geographically  potentially to acquire Fast ACH rails Stephen J  Squeri    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So what s    a couple of things  Number one  I think from a consumer perspective  we see this sort of fast payments  we see as really looking to cannibalize some debit  looking to cannibalize some ACH  some check and things like that  So  from a consumer perspective  we have an open banking test right now from a consumer perspective ourselves where we re offering some of our non customers the ability to pay out of their bank accounts  So that could be an opportunity for us  but I don t see that really impacting credit and charge growth Look  I think there    what s interesting for fast payments ACH from a B2B perspective  and I ve said this multiple times on calls like this and in meetings  they will play a role in B2B payments that it will play a role in procurement spending as well  The reality is that we believe we can achieve the same things with the network that we have today and the connectivity that we have as we have the flexibility in pricing  Look  I m not constrained by interchange  I could price from a transaction perspective  And one of the advantages we do have in Europe in particular is  we re a three party system  we re not a four party system And so  the relationships that we have with card members and merchants which with that direct connectivity  we believe we can accomplish the same things without acquiring either a VocaLink or Northport  Phonetic  or something like that  But make no mistake  it will play a role in procurement The other thing that I ve said on these calls before is  from a procurement perspective  Fast ACH is really not sort of the be all  end all  given that most of these payments are current 60 to 90 days  The bigger opportunity is really integrating the payment process within the procurement process and marrying the procure to pay  And so    and that takes a long  long time  and that s why you do partnerships with people like SAP and people like Ariba to try and integrate the payment in  Companies are much    look  from my perspective  having run procurement here as well  companies are much more focused on how you merge the two  then sort of paying their vendor in 20 minutes  The last thing I want to do is really pay a vendor in 20 minutes  but what I really want to do is integrate the two together So  I think there is a place for these acquisitions for    again  for Visa Mastercard  it goes back  I think  a little bit to the planned acquisition  but I think we can accomplish the same thing with the capabilities that we have at the current moment OperatorNext we go to James Friedman with Susquehanna  Please go ahead James Friedman    Susquehanna    AnalystHi  Thanks for taking my question  So  Steve  I did    in follow up to the previous question  in the previous    before that  I did want to ask about that large and global corporate again  And I know it s a little like playing Twister  but I m looking at the appendix in terms of the volumes from T E  and the T E actually grew 6   So  that seems pretty good and consistent with the way that it s been  but I realize not all T E lands in large and corporate  I assume some of that s in    so anyway  any context about how the T E grow  but the larger and corporate was down  Phonetic  Stephen J  Squeri    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  well T E  I think about our consumer travel business and think about    just think about the expansion that we ve had in small business international and the expansion that we ve had in Consumer International  And when you think about small business international  it s not as mature as small businesses in the United States  And so  if you go back in history  what happen from a small business perspective in the United States  that started as a T E card and now has more    much more into a B2B card  and so the mix of volume that we have  And the reality is  when you think about sort of the T E aspects as it relates outside the US  small business international that we have  there is a higher percentage of T E that occurs on that card because that s the first thing that small businesses will put on internationally  And then  obviously our consumer business is growing in leaps and bounds internationally  And again  that has a much more T E focus than it does retail focus Jeffrey C  Campbell    Chief Financial OfficerThe only math point I would add is  in our tables  that stat is a US stat  But it just goes to the point  the large and global segment is a small part of our total buildings    billings  So  the T E trends get dwarfed in terms of the global company by what consumers and small businesses are doing OperatorNext we go to a question from Chris Donat with Piper Sandler  Please go ahead Chris Donat    Piper Sandler    AnalystGood morning  Thanks for taking my question  Steve  I want to ask kind of a longer term history question about your card fee strategy  because when you go back a few years  there really wasn t that much growth or low single digit growth in card fees  And I m wondering if your view is    what s changed more Amex s approach or more the consumer appetite for a fee based card Stephen J  Squeri    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo  it s been  our approach that has changed  and    which is why if you go back for the last couple of years  we have started to refresh products  We were not in the business of refreshing products  If you do not refresh the product  it is really hard to increase the fee  Adding value enables you to increase the fee  If you re not adding value  you can t do that  We had a fundamental shift in sort of how we approach the business over the last few years  You ve seen a lot more focus on coverage  you ve seen a lot more focus on    you ve seen a lot more focus on our focused international strategy  And you ve also seen a major focus on card refreshment  And card refreshment  remember  is it s not just about fees  it s to get people to spend  which then gets people to revolve that spend  So it really is more about engagement  And the fees come along as you add value OperatorOur final question will come from Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research  Please go ahead Craig Maurer    Autonomous Research    AnalystYeah  Thanks for squeezing me in  I wanted to get a little clarity on your thoughts for billed business growth trends in 2020  With comps getting easier and we re starting to lap some of the issues in corporate and certainly in GNS  could we see an inflection point in 2020 where billed business growth starts to reaccelerate  And just a housekeeping item  are there going to be any unique quarterly trends in marketing spend this year due to the 2020 Olympics  Thanks Jeffrey C  Campbell    Chief Financial OfficerWell  I think the short answer on the second one  Craig  is no  Obviously the Olympics is an important event from a lot of perspectives  And we have a fabulous franchise in Japan  and it s benefiting from the Prime Minister s incentives that he is providing in the country to encourage more card use  all good stuff for us  but not big enough for you to see in our global results On the inflection point on billed business  I d really go back  Craig  to the theme Steve and I both talked a lot about over the last hour  which is  our revenue momentum has been very stable for 10 quarters  And that s because of the breadth of sources because of the way we re focused on being thoughtful about things like card fees  which Steve just touched on or how we re pricing for risk in our lending portfolio  And so  we feel good about the trends on billed business  but we feel    but more importantly  we re focused on the trends and stability on revenue that make us very comfortable with the guidance we ve provided for another year of 8  to 10  revenue growth  And it is not counting on a big inflection upwards on billed business  if that happens  great  but that is not a planning assumption  if you will  that underlies the guidance we ve provided Rosie Perez    Senior Vice President  Head of Investor RelationsWith that  we ll bring the call to an end  Thank you  Steve  Thank you  Jeff  Thank you again for joining the call and for your continued interest in American Express  As usual  the IR team will be available for any follow up questions  and we look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day  which will be held on March 17th here at 9 00 AM Operator  back to you Operator Operator Closing

161012,382528,AXP,Tiger chasing history  but not favored at Torrey Pines,news,"Tiger Woods will be chasing history at one of his favorite venues this week  but he won t be the betting favorite when he tees it up at the Farmers Insurance Open on Thursday 
That honor goes to Rory McIlroy  the top ranked player in the field this week at No  2  And he has been reeling in No  1 Brooks Koepka with four wins and 10 other top 10s in his past 20 worldwide starts 
McIlroy is being offered at  600 by PointsBet and  660 by DraftKings  with Spain s Jon Rahm the next lowest odds at  750  775  Woods  who has won the event seven times    but not since 2013    is the third choice by both books at   1000  1100 
Woods is seeking to set the PGA Tour career record for victories  which he currently shares with Sam Snead at 82  In addition to his seven wins in 18 regular Tour starts at Torrey Pines and another in the 2008 U S  Open  Woods has five other top 10s  He ll be paired for the first two rounds with Rahm and Collin Morikawa   3000  3500   who has yet to miss a cut in 14 starts on Tour since turning professional last summer 
PointsBet is offering a  3 Ball  prop bet for the grouping  Rahm   130   Woods   156   Morikawa   271  
McIlroy hasn t competed since November  but he did post a T5 in his first career start at the Farmers last year 
Another marquee pairing features the American trio of Rickie Fowler  Phil Mickelson and Xander Schauffele 
Fowler   2200  2000  has opened 2020 with a pair of top 10s  but is coming off another disappointing final round at last week s The  American Express   NYSE AXP   where he failed to convert being in the final group with lesser known counterparts Andrew Landry and Scottie Scheffler 
Mickelson   9000  12500  is making his 30th start in the event  but is coming off a missed cut and hasn t posted a top 25 result since the Masters last April 
The soft spoken Schauffele continues to fly under the radar  but the San Diego native is ranked No  9 and has three runner ups and two T10s in his past six starts  He s the fourth betting favorite at  1500 by PointsBet and  1650 by DraftKings 
Defending champion Justin Rose is  1600 at PointsBet and  1800 at DraftKings  who have him as the co fifth favorite with Japan s Hideki Matsuyama  Rose will be paired with Jordan Spieth   5000  5500  and two time event champion Jason Day   4000  4500   who is returning from a back injury

161045,382561,AXP,Trade deal touts financial sector wins  China to scrap securities business cap faster,news,"By Michelle Price and Sumeet Chatterjee
WASHINGTON HONG KONG  Reuters    The long awaited U S  China trade deal touted wins for U S  companies looking to access China s  40 trillion financial sector  but many of the changes were already in the works  with Beijing having stepped up the pace of liberalization last year 
Under the deal  China has agreed to move forward by nine months a December 2020 deadline for removing foreign ownership caps on securities firms  which includes investment banking  underwriting and brokerage operations 
The Phase 1 trade deal  signed by U S  President Donald Trump on Wednesday  promises improved access to Chinese markets in banking  insurance  asset management  payments and fund management 
It aims to address a number of longstanding U S  complaints about barriers to investment in China s financial sector  including foreign equity ownership restrictions  discriminatory regulatory requirements  and opaque licensing processes 
 China is very eager to get more private funds to invest in the economy   to help fuel economic growth  said Andrew Collier  managing director of Hong Kong based Orient Capital Research  But foreign companies will struggle to corner a bigger share of the market from state owned and private Chinese rivals  he said 
The deal text said that by no later than April 1  China will remove foreign equity limits and allow U S  investment banks to participate in local securities businesses 
Foreign banks  ownership cap in China securities joint ventures was lifted to 51  in 2018 from 49   Lack of control and limited contribution to revenue have long been a source of frustration for global investment banks 
While Goldman Sachs  N GS  and  Morgan Stanley   N MS  are awaiting regulatory nods to raise their holdings to 51  in their China securities ventures   Citigroup   N C  plans to set up a wholly owned securities business after agreeing last year to sell its stake in its previous joint venture 
JPMorgan  N JPM  got final approval from regulators on Dec  18 to set up a majority owned securities venture 
As well as the headline initiatives  the agreement also goes into granular detail on a number of areas  and as a result  feels more concrete than previous announcements   said Jane Jiang  a Shanghai based partner at Allen   Overy 
 There are parts that seem to be written with specific companies in mind  and so we are almost certain that there will be takers for those openings as they must have lobbied for them   Jiang said  She cited as an example an adjustment to rules about foreign banks buying Chinese non performing loans 
China has said the Phase 1 deal will boost imports of U S  financial services  But a pledge to scrap foreign equity limits on firms operating in China s fund management  futures and insurance sectors will feel familiar to many 
 China has already been opening up its markets   said a Beijing based lawyer  who works with Chinese regulators 
 The real test will be how quickly the applications and regulatory processes are handled  
Last July  Premier Li Keqiang announced China would expedite by a full year its plans to allow 100  foreign ownership in a raft of financial sectors 
    Foreign ownership limits in futures companies were scrapped this month  while China said last year that it would do the same for mutual funds by April 2020  A 51  cap on ownership in life insurance ventures was also removed this month 
Likewise  China s pledge on Wednesday to open up its payments system to U S  firms comes after its central bank said it had accepted an application from an  American Express  Co  N AXP  unit regarding starting onshore operations 
Ken Bentsen  CEO of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association  which has criticized China for failing to make good on past promises to level the playing field  struck a cautious note on Wednesday s deal 
 We will examine this agreement closely including what it specifically means for our members in terms of its implementation and enforcement   he said in a statement ",2020-01-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trade-deal-touts-financial-sector-wins-china-to-scrap-securities-business-cap-faster-2060774,2060774
161046,382562,AXP,In the U S  China Deal  Trump Finds a Way Around WTO Process,news," Bloomberg     Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars   Sign up here  
The first phase of President Donald Trump s accord with China aims to resolve a series of longstanding trade disputes between Washington and Beijing and in doing so  may bolster his theory that unilateral tariffs are a better enforcement tool than the World Trade Organization 
As part of Wednesday s deal  China pledged to address various policies that the U S  has pursued in past WTO disputes  such as Beijing s technology transfer requirements  subsidies and quotas for agricultural goods  and restrictions on foreign financial services providers 
The agreement reinforces U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer s view that the best way to get China to quickly and comprehensively comply with WTO disputes is to negotiate them under threat of punitive tariffs 
 Relying solely on the WTO litigation has its flaws   Lighthizer told members of the Senate Finance Committee last year   You can be winning cases for years and years and years and not getting real outcomes  
Lighthizer has long been a critic of the WTO s cumbersome dispute settlement process  which helps resolve trade conflicts among its 164 members  He previously said that nations are exploiting the WTO to try to  gain concessions through lawsuits that they could never get at the negotiating table  
Technology Transfers
The U S  China pact requires both governments to eschew any policies that require or pressure companies or people to transfer their technologies as a condition of doing business 
 Any transfer or licensing of technology between persons of a party and those of the other party must be based on market terms that are voluntary and reflect mutual agreement   the accord said 
The U S  and China also said they would protect the confidentiality of any  sensitive technical information  disclosed during regulatory or administrative reviews and the parties would not require or pressure foreign entities to disclose sensitive technical information that s not necessary to conduct such reviews 
The commitments could help resolve a 2018 WTO complaint against a half dozen Chinese laws that the U S  said violated WTO rules governing the use of trade related intellectual property rights 
The case cuts to the heart of the conflict because Trump argued that his retaliatory tariffs were necessary to counter an alleged Chinese campaign to steal American IP 
Electronic Payments
Another important commitment in phase one requires Chinese regulators to rapidly process applications from U S  electronic payment providers    such as  American Express  Co  NYSE AXP    Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA    and  Visa Inc   NYSE V      to operate as wholly foreign owned entities in China 
In return  the U S  said it would offer non discriminatory treatment to Chinese electronic payment service suppliers  including China UnionPay 
The new commitments could help address U S  allegations that China failed to comply with a 2012 WTO ruling that rejected Beijing s discriminatory treatment of U S  credit card companies 
The U S  has long argued that the Chinese policies regarding uniform business specifications  technical standards and operability rules effectively prevented foreign access to China s  1 trillion annual e payment services marketplace 
Chinese Agricultural Rules
Phase one of the agreement also requires China to fully comply with WTO s findings in a pair of U S  dispute victories against China s agricultural subsidies and quotas 
The agreement said China must adhere to its WTO agriculture commitments and ensure that  from Dec  31  2019  its tariff rate quota measures for wheat  rice  and corn are in conformity with the terms of a 2019 WTO ruling 
Last year  the WTO found that Beijing provided farm subsidies in excess of its international trade commitments and didn t follow proper procedures when it imposed trade restrictions on agricultural imports 
China has already agreed to comply with the rulings  rather than seek to appeal the WTO s findings in the hopes of obtaining a more favorable ruling 
 China has not been transparent about its protectionist policies   said Vince Peterson  president of U S  Wheat Associates   Now it remains to be seen if China will comply fully with its WTO commitments and this new agreement so that trade between our two countries can flourish  
Dispute Settlement
Phase one will further sideline the WTO s dispute settlement system because it establishes a bilateral dispute resolution arrangement whereby the U S  and China will regularly meet to resolve any issues with the agreement 
QuickTake  What s Next for Trade Referee After Sabotage by U S 
This comes a month after the Trump administration essentially paralyzed the WTO s dispute settlement system by choking off staff and funding for the appellate body 
As of Dec  11  the WTO s seven member appellate body  which acts as a quasi supreme court for disputes that involve billions of dollars in international commerce  is now unable to issue any judgments on future trade dispute cases 
While WTO members can still bring disputes to the trade body and receive an initial ruling  any party to the dispute could appeal that ruling into legal limbo    thereby providing the losing party with a veto 
That means the WTO has lost its ability to fully adjudicate trade disputes and governments are now free to impose unilateral measures on their trade partners without fear of WTO oversight ",2020-01-16,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/in-the-uschina-deal-trump-finds-a-way-around-wto-process-2061381,2061381
161047,382563,AXP,Murray grabs share of lead in California  Fowler one back,news," Reuters    Grayson Murray tied his career best with nine birdies in one round to tame the challenging PGA West Stadium Course and was rewarded with a share of the first round lead at The  American Express   NYSE AXP  in La Quinta on Thursday 
The 26 year old carded an eight under under 64 on the Stadium Course  which is considered the toughest of the three venues hosting the tournament in the California desert  for a share of the lead with Zac Blair  who played his round at La Quinta Country Club 
Murray started on the back nine and was two under after four holes and then made a move with four consecutive birdies starting at the par four 15th 
 I don t know what it is but I like those few holes   Murray said in an interview on PGA Tour Radio   To my eye they can be a little intimidating but I kind of embrace it  
Murray added another three birdies on the back nine and could have been the outright leader if not for a closing bogey when he three putted from 64 feet 
Blair  fresh off a share of 63rd place at the Sony Open in Hawaii  enjoyed a bogey free trip around La Quinta and his 64 marked lowest round in 10 events on the 2019 20 PGA Tour season 
Rickie Fowler reached the turn at La Quinta at five under after five consecutive birdies en route to a seven under par 65 that left him one shot off the pace along with Hank Lebioda  who played on the Nicklaus Tournament Course  and Scottie Scheffler 
Tournament host Phil Mickelson  in his first event since last November s WGC HSBC Champions in Shanghai  had trouble finding fairways on the La Quinta layout where he mixed five birdies with a double bogey and bogey for a two under par 70 
Defending champion Adam Long  69  was five shots off the pace and in a share of 49th place

Hurtubise  who was born with one arm and started playing golf at age 11  aced the 151 yard par three fourth hole at the PGA West Stadium Course during first round action of The  American Express   NYSE AXP  on Thursday 
The left handed golfer s tee shot landed near the front of the green and made a beeline for the hole before slamming into the flagstick and dropping into the cup 
Hurtubise  who is among the amateurs competing alongside the professionals in a pro am competition this week  raised his arm skyward and threw his hat in celebration  exchanging high fives with his group 
 As a kid  sports was a way for me to prove that even though I had a difference that I could perform as well as normal people     as they call them   Hurtubise told the Desert Sun 
 People have differences and handicaps and whatever  but it was my way to prove that I could be as good as everybody else  
The PGA Tour s Twitter account posted a clip of the ace and called it  inspirational  while Hurtubise s playing partner Troy Merritt  a two times winner on the PGA Tour  called the moment  the coolest experience I ve had on the golf course  ",2020-01-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/onearmed-golfer-makes-holeinone-at-pga-tour-event-2062198,2062198
161051,382567,AXP,Golf  Scheffler  Fowler shoot matching 64s for La Quinta lead,news," Reuters    Scottie Scheffler shot an eight under par 64  despite chalking up a double bogey at his ninth hole  to tie Rickie Fowler for the second round lead of The  American Express   NYSE AXP  in La Quinta  California  on Friday 
Scheffler narrowly missed an eagle at his last hole  the ninth  to match Fowler s score as they completed the Nicklaus Tournament Course at 15 under 129 
The round of the day  however  belonged to Tony Finau  who birdied seven of his final nine holes  and 10 in total  for a sizzling 10 under 62 on the Nicklaus course 
That moved him into fourth place at 13 under 131  a stroke behind Andrew Landry  64  and two behind Fowler and Scheffler 
Landry s round  which featured nine birdies and a bogey  came on the tougher La Quinta course 
Scheffler  who started his round at the 10th  needed a solid second shot at his last hole to help him catch Fowler and he got it  the ball almost rolling in for an eagle 
 I got off to a pretty hot start today  then kept playing pretty solid even after that double at the 18th   the 23 year old told PGA Tour Radio 
He got back on track with another birdie at the fourth hole  his 13th  and made up more ground with an eagle at the seventh 
Tournament favorite Fowler also started on the 10th and after picking up two birdies on his front nine collected four more and an eagle after the turn to post an early lead 
 I just did a really good job of picking my way around to the green and making some putts on top of that   said the five time PGA Tour winner  who is competing at La Quinta for the first time in six years 
First round co leaders Zac Blair  70  and Grayson Murray  71  were unable to match their opening 64s

161052,382568,AXP,Scheffler tied for lead after rocky finish to third round,news," Reuters    Scottie Scheffler survived a rocky finish to tie fellow American Andrew Landry for the third round lead at the  American Express   NYSE AXP  tournament in California on Saturday 
Scheffler and Landry opened a four stroke buffer over their nearest rival  Rickie Fowler  on a day of low scoring in perfect conditions in the southern California desert 
Scheffler rode his luck at the par four 18th at the PGA West Stadium course in La Quinta 
His tee shot appeared headed for a watery grave left of the fairway  and he was mightily relieved when his ball struck rocks lining the lake and somehow ricocheted back onto the fairway 
He salvaged par for a six under par 66  while Landry wielded a hot putter for a 65 on the Nicklaus Tournament course to tie it up at 21 under 195 
 I was just trying to hit a little draw three wood and I drew it a lot   said a relieved Scheffler of his final tee shot 
 It was a great break bouncing off the rocks like that  I guess you take them where you can get them  
After playing three different courses  everyone will be on equal footing for the final round at PGA West on Sunday  when Landry will be vying for his second PGA Tour win and Scheffler his first 
Landry  who lost in a playoff to Jon Rahm two years ago  is feeling at home in a happy hunting ground 
 I ve been putting absolutely beautifully and everything s been there   32 year old Landry said 
 My wedge play s been there  the putting s there I just need to go out and do it again tomorrow 
 I ve had some success here in the past and I know what to do  Scottie and I are friends  It s going to be very comfortable out there  
Fowler  who hails from nearby Murrieta  began his day poorly with two front nine bogeys before fighting back to give himself an outside chance of a Sunday challenge 
 A couple of mental errors cost me   he said 
 I really struggled to get going early   The greens  were a bit slower than the last two days and I didn t have anything go in until the ninth hole but did a good job of hanging around  not getting too far behind 
 I had to grind it out and put ourselves at least in a position where we can play well tomorrow and still have a chance  ",2020-01-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/scheffler-tied-for-lead-after-rocky-finish-to-third-round-2062674,2062674

The policy  effective in April after a three month education period  will see  habitually slow players  identified using objective data and penalized for taking too long to hit a shot 
Though the majority of golfers play at an acceptable speed  slow play is a perennial issue  with fast golfers routinely frustrated with their slower playing competitors 
The tour decided to revamp its policy in August after Bryson DeChambeau was ridiculed on social media when a video circulated of him taking more than two minutes to hit a putt 
 We re looking for guys to take responsibility  because hitting a standard golf shot and taking two  two and a half minutes to play it is not acceptable   Casey told reporters ahead of this week s  American Express   NYSE AXP  tournament in La Quinta  California 
Under the new policy  slow golfers will be put on an  observation list  and expected to play their shots in under 60 seconds on average  Those failing to meet the one minute requirement will receive a warning for their first bad time 
A one stroke penalty will be handed out for a second bad time  with a further one shot penalty for each subsequent bad time 
 So taking ownership of that responsibility  however you want to phrase it  that s all about education   said Casey 
Anyone else on the field who takes more than two minutes to play a single shot  in the absence of a good reason for doing so  will be given an  excessive shot time  and if they transgress again will be placed on the observation list 
Englishman Casey  a member of the PGA Tour Player Advisory Council  does not think slow play should be a difficult problem to solve 
 That was our feeling  it should be a fairly simple thing to fix so hopefully this fixes it   Casey said   Fairly painless gains to be honest  
While the PGA Tour s new policy is still three months away  the European Tour will implement a similar policy this week at the Abu Dhabi Championship ",2020-01-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/time-for-slow-players-to-take-responsibility-under-new-policy-casey-2059589,2059589

The biggest U S  card companies just moved a step closer to gaining access to China s  27 trillion payments market 
China said it won t take longer than 90 days to consider applications from providers of electronic payments services such as Mastercard  NYSE MA   Visa  NYSE V  and  American Express  Co  NYSE AXP    according the text of a landmark trade agreement with the U S  It should be an especially welcome reprieve for Mastercard and its partner NetsUnion Clearing Corp   which set up a venture in March that is still awaiting approval from the People s Bank of China to begin operations 
 China is a vital market for us   Seth Eisen  a spokesman for Mastercard  said Wednesday in an emailed statement   We continue to make every effort to secure the requisite license to be able to operate in China domestically  This deal is a step forward in that process  
The move shows progress in the U S  payment networks  battle for access to mainland China  which has been a point of contention in the trade dispute  Officials from the world s two largest economies finalized a bevy of deals before signing off on the first phase of a sweeping trade agreement  which they have sought to cast as a major breakthrough in relations 
Mastercard Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga and Visa CEO Al Kelly were in attendance at Wednesday s festivities at the White House for the trade deal announcement  In a statement  Visa said it sees potential to help further develop digital payments in China through the 2022 Olympics in Beijing and that it s approaching entry into the country  with a long term focus  
 Visa is working closely with the Chinese government  including the People s Bank of China  throughout the application process for a bank card clearing institution license   the company said in the statement  welcoming the signing of the trade agreement 
China in June 2015 allowed foreign bank card clearing providers to obtain licenses by setting up units or acquiring a local company  ending a monopoly by state run China UnionPay Co  But progress has since been slow for Visa and Mastercard  the world s largest payment networks  American Express cleared a key hurdle in early January when regulators accepted its application to start a bank card clearing business with a Chinese partner 
 We re pleased with the progress we re making to become the first foreign network to receive a clearing and settlement license to operate in mainland China   Leah Gerstner  a spokeswoman for AmEx  said in a statement   We will continue to work through the regulatory approval process through our joint venture in China  
As part of Wednesday s agreement  the U S  also pledged not to discriminate against China UnionPay  or CUP  or other Chinese electronic payment services 
Mastercard and Visa have long complained that their delayed entrance into China means they ll be pitting themselves against large domestic players in a market that s seen mobile payments explode in recent years  Mobile transactions topped 190 trillion yuan   27 trillion  in China in 2018  making it the world s largest such market  according to iResearch  Ant Financial s Alipay and Tencent Holdings Ltd  s WeChat Pay are the dominant mobile payments firms 
They won t be starting from nothing  Mastercard and Visa have long worked with Chinese banks to slap their brands on cards to facilitate transactions that consumers make outside China  But Wednesday s announcement means the networks will now have a chance to compete for those cardholders  domestic spending as well

161080,382596,AXP,Mickelson has Ryder Cup  not senior circuit  in his sights,news,"By Frank Pingue
 Reuters    Phil Mickelson will be eligible for the PGA Tour s senior circuit this year but the five times major champion said on Wednesday he has not given it much thought and is focused instead on making the U S  Ryder Cup team 
Mickelson  who turns 50 in June  feels that a decision he made years ago to have a greater work ethic and commitment to physical health has left him in no rush to tee it up on the PGA Tour Champions with players he idolized as a child 
 It s nice to have the option to move over to another tour  but it s also nice to have the challenge of competing out here   Mickelson told a news conference in La Quinta  California  where he is tournament host for this week s The  American Express   NYSE AXP  
 And I don t often voice too many goals  but one of them is to make the Ryder Cup  it should be a pretty obvious goal so I need to play enough tournaments out here and play well to be able to achieve that particular goal  
In 20 PGA Tour events last season  Mickelson made the cut 12 times and had two top 10 finishes  including a three shot victory at the Pebble Beach Pro Am in February 
The left hander will be in action over the next four weeks with starts at La Quinta followed by the Farmers Insurance Open in San Diego  the Saudi International and then back to Pebble Beach to defend his title 
 There s a chance that if I do what I expect then I may end up competing for years out here  And there s a chance that maybe I am misguided in my thinking and that I should move over   said Mickelson  who added that he feels better now than 15 years ago 
 But a lot will be decided or seen in the first six months  because I feel like I m ready to play  
Apart from aiming for his first major title since the 2013 British Open  Mickelson is eager to earn a spot on Steve Stricker s U S  squad for the Sept  25 27 Ryder Cup against Europe at Whistling Straits in Wisconsin 
Mickelson was one of four of Jim Furyk s captain s picks for the 2018 edition of the biennial event and he had an 0 2 record as Europe regained the Ryder Cup 
His overall Ryder Cup record is far from spectacular  having won only 18 of his 47 matches in 12 appearances  but he said he had let Stricker know how badly he wants to be on this year s team 
He does not  however  want to get on by virtue of being a captain s pick 
 If I play to the level that I believe I m capable of I ll make the team  But if not  you ve got to give those spots to some younger guys that haven t had the chance to play and compete the way I have   said Mickelson 
 So I have six  eight months to get it done and I ve got plenty of time  every bit of fair opportunity to go out and prove myself and play some great golf 
 So there s not much he s going to be able to do as a captain because I need to     earn my way on the team  ",2020-01-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/mickelson-has-ryder-cup-not-senior-circuit-in-his-sights-2060484,2060484

American Express is one of 844 companies in the Finance group  The Finance group currently sits at  6 within the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank gauges the strength of our 16 individual sector groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups 
The Zacks Rank is a successful stock picking model that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions  The system highlights a number of different stocks that could be poised to outperform the broader market over the next one to three months  AXP is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy

161085,382601,AXP,All You Need To Know About American Express  AXP  Rating Upgrade To Buy,opinion,"American Express  AXP  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for American Express basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For American Express  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for American Express
This credit card issuer and global payments company is expected to earn  9 07 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2020  which represents a year over year change of 10 6  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for American Express  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 8  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

161087,382603,AXP,U S  China Trade Deal Reality Check  What s New  What s Unclear,news," Bloomberg     Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars   Sign up here  
The deal signed between the U S  and China brings a pause in the trade war between the world s two largest economies 
However  it promises some actions China has already taken and skepticism remains as to whether the nation can buy an additional  200 billion in goods and services  including  95 billion in commodities 
To achieve the promised increase in purchases  U S  exports of goods and services have to jump almost 56  this year from 2019 to reach the total laid out in the deal signed by President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He  according to Bloomberg calculations 
Energy
China promised to buy  52 billion more in U S  energy products over the next two years 
Prior to the trade war  monthly U S  oil and gas exports to China peaked at about  1 5 billion  about 25  below what it would have to average over two years to reach its new commitment 
If China were to buy all the the liquefied natural gas the U S  is expected to export in 2020 and 2021 at last year s average North Asia spot price  it would equal roughly  12 billion in 2020 and  17 billion in 2021  according to Bloomberg calculations  However  such a monumental shift in flows to China would be challenging  as most volumes are tied up in long term contracts 
In addition  a slowdown in Chinese demand growth and brimming stockpiles mean that China may not have much appetite for any additional gas right now beyond its base load  long term contracted volumes  Many Chinese importers also don t use the types of oil the U S  produces as most refineries are optimized to run heavier grades of oil  as opposed to the light sweet varieties that the U S  makes 
Agriculture
China s promise to buy an additional  32 billion in farm goods means it would account for about a quarter of all American farm goods sales in 2020 and 30  next year  based on average annual U S  exports  That s not even counting the extra  10 billion China said it would strive to buy over two years 
This would be well above the  24 billion in agriculture and related products it imported from the U S  in 2017  If soybeans continue to make up two thirds of those purchases as they did before the trade war  that would be every soybean that the U S  exports 
China also now has much less demand for soybeans  which are mainly used to produce livestock feed in China  because an outbreak of African swine fever cut China s pork herds by half 
Still  China s most clued in agricultural consultant and researcher said before that deal that the country won t have a problem buying  40 billion in American farm goods  It could buy about  7 billion worth of other grains and related products  more than  2 billion in poultry and chicken feet  and  2 5 billion worth of nuts  JCI said  Cotton  fish and ethanol are also on the table  it said 
Some of the other reforms promised in the deal could help make that happen  China agreed to conduct an assessment on whether its ban on a specific animal growth enhancer is justified  Lifting the ban on ractopamine  which is used to make hogs gain muscle faster while eating less grain  would pave the way for bigger imports of American pork 
China also promised to better implement its tariff rate quotas for wheat  rice and corn  which may lead to higher imports from the U S 
Finance
The biggest win for Wall Street was China s agreement to bring forward the planned opening of its securities industry by eight months  By April  global investment banks will be able to apply to form fully owned units that can do a broad array of investment banking and securities dealing in the nation s  21 trillion capital market 
China also promised to take no longer than 90 days to consider license applications from providers of electronic payments services such as Mastercard  NYSE MA   Visa  NYSE V  and  American Express  Co  NYSE AXP    answering complaints that the licensing process is unnecessarily long 
But a pledge to remove the foreign equity cap for the life  pension and health coverage sectors no later than April 1 caused confusion among lawyers in the Asian nation  who say they thought the limit was lifted on Jan  1 
China also pledged to issue licenses to asset management companies to purchase non performing loans from Chinese banks  although no timetable was provided  adding some detail to previous promises from as far back as 2018 
Currencies
Market participants were mostly unimpressed with China s pledges on its currency  Little was new in the the two page chapter on the topic  which reaffirmed previous commitments not to devalue for competitive advantage and to continue disclosing data on reserves and balance of payments 
The agreement also set up a dispute mechanism  although it s unknown how effective that new process will be  Trump has accused China of  manipulating  its currency since before he became president  and the U S  labeled China as a  currency manipulator  in August at the height of trade war  It removed that label earlier this month before the signing 
However  market consensus is that the People s Bank of China has long relinquished direct intervention  Instead  the central bank now leans more on the daily fixing to guide market expectations  and mostly refrains from intervening in the exchange rate 
The PBOC s most recent wording on the yuan rate reiterated that it will adhere to  the decisive role of the market in the formation of the RMB rate  and  will keep the yuan rate basically stable at a reasonable and equilibrium level   indicating it won t change its current approach 
Intellectual Property
Many of the intellectual property commitments in the deal appear to be ones that China had either made already or was moving to address 
China made a rapid fire series of legal changes amid the negotiations to beef up intellectual property protection  A new foreign investment law  effective from Jan  1  bans administrative agencies from forcing technology transfers  It also exposes officials who disclose or leak trade secrets gleaned from regulatory approvals to potential criminal penalties  The law was approved in March 2019 after just a matter of months  a process that usually takes years 
Along with the law  the country also instituted new rules that stipulate foreign firms will enjoy the same favorable policies as domestic companies  and will be treated equally in setting industry standards and bidding for government contracts 
A revision to the Administrative Licensing Law approved shortly after prohibits officials from revealing trade secrets and confidential information  And the government has also said it would raise penalties for violations of intellectual property rights and look into lowering the threshold for criminal punishment 
China s Trademark Law and Law Against Unfair Competition were both revised in 2019  addressing some of the changes highlighted in the trade deal  A new patent law is also set to be approved this year 
Pharmaceuticals
China agreed to set up a system to resolve conflicts over drug patents  a move that may help U S  pharmaceutical companies seeking greater protections for their branded medicine in developing nations  The changes  which take key provisions from an American law on the books for more than three decades  were included in the text 
Under terms of the deal  patent disputes over potential generic drugs could be resolved before a copycat medicine enters the market in China  and brand companies would be able to seek an order to block any sales until the conflicts are resolved  Drugmakers would be able to seek extensions of their patents to compensate for  unreasonable  delays in the patent office or while waiting for Chinese health regulators to approve a drug for sale 
However  hopes that China would extend the  exclusivity period  for drugs to match that in the U S  were dashed  with no mention in the deal text ",2020-01-16,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/uschina-trade-deal-reality-check-whats-new-whats-unclear-2060748,2060748
161097,382613,AXP,American Express  AXP  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when American Express  AXP  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 24  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This credit card issuer and global payments company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 01 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  15 5  
Revenues are expected to be  11 38 billion  up 8 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 09  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for American Express 
For American Express  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 41  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that American Express will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that American Express would post earnings of  2 07 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 08  delivering a surprise of  0 48  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
American Express appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/american-express-axp-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200499701,200499701

To be sure  the ability to work with credit cards is still pending  In its announcement  Ant Financial s Alipay laid out a system that will work around current restrictions and can start immediately

Will the Upside Continue in 2020 Before we discuss the companies individually  let s check how the economic scenario will be like as the finance sector s performance largely depends on the health of the economy The U S  economy continues to show strength with historically low unemployment rate and positive consumer sentiments  Per the Fed officials  the U S  economy s expected growth rate is 2 2  for 2019 and 2  for this year Further  with the central bank indicating a pause in rate cuts this year  this will likely act as catalyst for the finance sector JPMorganJPMorgan is likely to continue

healthcare payments market Also  positive developments in several macroeconomic issues are likely to result in improvement in client activities  which will support JPMorgan s trading revenues  constituting nearly 20  of the bank s total revenues  Further  global M As  and debt and equity issuance volumes are expected to continue rising this year  driven by low interest rates and strong equity market performance  As JPMorgan is one of the leading players in investment banking space  this will provide additional leverage JPMorgan s Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of  10 48 for

likely to benefit from exposure to the fast growing exchange traded funds market With the company generating approximately one fourth of its net revenues from trading activities  any positive

the factors mentioned above Also  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company is restructuring of its business segments  The changes  better reflect how the firm is now managed  and will  drive greater

161127,382643,AXP,Why American Express  AXP  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider American Express  AXP   This company  which is in the Zacks Financial   Miscellaneous Services industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This credit card issuer and global payments company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 0 73  
For the last reported quarter  American Express came out with earnings of  2 08 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 07 per share  representing a surprise of 0 48   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  2 05 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 07 per share  delivering a surprise of 0 98  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for American Express  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
American Express has an Earnings ESP of  0 25  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 24  2020 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-american-express-axp-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200497700,200497700

161131,382647,AXP,Exclusive  U S  helps Mastercard  Visa score victory in Indonesia in global lobbying effort,news,"By Gayatri Suroyo  Aditya Kalra and Fanny Potkin JAKARTA NEW DELHI  Reuters    U S  trade officials  at the request of card networks Mastercard  N MA  and Visa  N V   convinced Indonesia late last year to loosen rules governing its new domestic payment network  according to Indonesian government and industry sources  and emails reviewed by Reuters  The change will allow the U S  companies to process credit card transactions without having to partner with a local company in Indonesia  the sources said  Indonesia s decision represented a major lobbying victory for U S  payment companies in efforts to beat back a host of new regulations in Asia and elsewhere around data storage or the promotion of local payment networks over foreign ones  The lobbying effort in Indonesia was detailed in more than 200 pages of email communications between U S  trade officials and executives of card companies that Reuters obtained under the U S  Freedom of Information Act  The emails  dated between April 2018 and August 2019  also showed that Mastercard lobbied the office of the United States Trade Representative  USTR  to oppose new data rules and local payment systems in India  Vietnam  Laos  Ukraine and Ghana  Visa was looped into several of the discussions  the emails showed  While American firms often lobby the U S  administration on business issues  those discussions usually happen behind closed doors and are not made public  The Indonesian rules would have required foreign firms to process credit and debit card transactions onshore in partnership with a domestic partner under Indonesia s payment network  known as the National Payment Gateway  NPG   The decision would have hit the companies by reducing their earnings in Indonesia  especially on the more lucrative credit card fee  U S  trade officials made changing that rule a top demand if Indonesia were to retain a privileged trade status known as the Generalized System of Preferences  GSP   three Indonesian officials and two industry sources involved in the negotiations told Reuters  GSP gives Indonesia lower tariffs on exports to the United States worth  2 billion annually   As a result  Indonesia s central bank agreed to exclude all credit card transactions from the NPG  the sources said   The U S  side made clear the National Payment Gateway was a main demand if Indonesia wanted GSP  The U S  side was dead set on this   said one of the industry sources  The decision to exclude credit cards from the NPG has not previously been made public   Indonesia now expects to retain its GSP status  officials said  though negotiations are ongoing  A spokesman for Indonesia s central bank said its role in the GSP talks was over and credit cards would not be regulated under the new system in the near term  The spokesman did not comment on the U S  pressure  But Rizal Affandi Lukman  an Indonesian deputy minister involved in the negotiations  said the decision was taken independently  adding that the central bank can t  be steered by the U S   The office of the USTR in Washington did not respond to requests for comment  Mastercard and Visa did not answer questions from Reuters on their lobbying efforts  In a statement  Mastercard said any change in the regulatory environment in Indonesia  to support global partners participating is a result of conversations between the U S  and Indonesian governments as part of their ongoing negotiations   Visa said it  routinely engages with governments around the world to promote the value of digital payments and to advocate for open markets  free trade  and global competition   USTR has long advocated for Mastercard  Visa and  American Express   NYSE AXP  to have unrestricted access to developing countries  particularly in China  where they cannot operate independently in the yuan currency card market  China s unwillingness to grant the U S  card firms licenses to operate is one of many market access issues now under discussion in the U S  China trade talks led by USTR  LOBBYING SUCCESS  FAILURES Governments around the world say regulations aimed at boosting local data storage help protect privacy of their citizens and support legal investigations  Financial firms  however  say such measures are protectionist and lead to higher costs  and also weaken global fraud detection tools  Countries such as Indonesia  the world s fourth most populous  offer massive growth opportunities for companies as the use of digital payments booms  JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  estimates card usage for online spending in Indonesia will grow 39  a year to 2021  Mastercard s recommendation that the extension of Indonesia s GSP status should be contingent on changing the NPG rules came in an email sent to a USTR official by the company s public policy executive in Indonesia  Wilson Siahaan  on Nov  2   If the GSP were to be signed  it should include notes on some key open items   according to a Mastercard briefing document sent by Siahaan that listed  exclusion of credit card  among pending issues  On Nov  28  Siahaan learned Indonesia had decided to exclude credit cards from the NPG and sent a thank you note  The decision is  great news and we appreciate your help   he wrote in his e mail to the USTR official  sending a copy to Visa  Siahaan did not respond to a request for comment  In contrast to the success in Indonesia  companies including Mastercard and Visa failed to convince India s central bank to relax rules that force them to store data locally  Reuters reported last year  The United States in June stripped India s special trade privilege citing  a wide array of trade barriers   though it did not specifically cite its concerns over data storage rules  Mastercard also opposed a sweeping cybersecurity law in Vietnam  which was approved in 2018 and requires companies to set up local offices and store user data locally  Mastercard s vice president for public policy  Sahra English  told the USTR in one of the emails seen by Reuters that Vietnam s localization requirements could cost the

 Reuters    Credit card issuer  American Express  Co  N AXP  reported a higher than expected quarterly profit that highlighted the health of the U S  consumer even as fears mount that a manufacturing led weakness could spread to the broader economy 
U S  retail sales fell for the first time in seven months in September  adding to concerns after data showed a moderation in job growth and services sector activity in the last month 
New York based AmEx  for long the preferred choice of affluent Americans for credit cards  however  quelled investor concerns with its ninth straight quarter of foreign exchange adjusted revenue growth of at least 8  
 The trends we saw in the business this quarter continue to be consistent with an economy that continues to grow  albeit at a more modest pace than last year   Chief Executive Officer Steve Squeri said 
U S  big banks  quarterly results also showed that American consumers are helping to prop up the economy  even as recession fears have led businesses to pull back on spending and borrowing 
 We see a long runway to sustain this performance  In the  fourth quarter   we expect revenue growth to continue with the strong levels we have seen   Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Campbell told analysts on a post earnings conference call 
AmEx reaffirmed its 2019 adjusted earnings per share forecast range of  7 85 to  8 35 and said it expects revenue growth of between 8  and 10  in the fourth quarter 
The company  whose largest shareholder is Warren Buffett s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc   N BRKa   has ramped up reward programs on its cards and struck partnership deals with a number of firms to counter competition from JPMorgan Chase   Co s  N JPM  Sapphire Reserve and  Citigroup  Inc s  N C  Prestige Card 
AmEx said foreign exchange adjusted proprietary card member spending rose 7  in the third quarter  led by strong consumer growth in both the United States and international markets

The service named TD Bank  US  to TD  Canada  Transfer will enable TD s Canadian customers transfer their funds to Canada from their U S  accounts at TD Bank with speed  convenience and transparency  The service will be provided via Visa s real time push payments solution named Visa Direct 
This solution enables transfer of funds directly to a bank account or card  often in near real time  Visa Direct has processed 2 billion transactions in the past year  and drove more than 100  growth 
For Visa  providing this service in Canada is a good business opportunity given the fact that the region generates huge demand for money transfer services  At present  nearly  80 trillion is transferred globally via traditional methods of wire transfers or bank account  which is time consuming and costly 
There is a dire need to replace these age old methods with new age money transfer technology  which provides convenience  security and cost effectiveness  Visa  with its cutting age technology and a payment modernization strategy  fits the bill here 
The new service will start immediately with 1 5 million Canadians heading to warmer climates during the winter and creating demand for money transfer services  A Visa poll shows that 36  of Canadian snowbirds are frustrated with money matters like moving funds between Canadian and U S  accounts 
The northbound money movement feature is now easily available for TD Cross Border Banking customers in Canada  Also  there is no transfer fee for customers sending money from an American personal bank account at TD Bank  to their Canadian based personal accounts at TD Canada Trust

161161,382677,AXP,Venezuela s Armed Forces Bank slams Mastercard for halting card service,news,"CARACAS  Reuters    A Venezuelan bank run by the troubled country s military on Wednesday slammed Mastercard  NYSE MA  for cutting off service to the bank s credit cards following U S  sanctions against the government of President Nicolas Maduro 
The measure is another sign of how U S  sanctions are affecting the functioning of Venezuelan state institutions 
But the practical impact is limited because the bank is small and hyperinflation has reduced use of credit cards  whose credit limits rarely keep up with price increases 
 The Bank of the Armed Forces denounces to its civilian and military clients     the suspension of interbank services for its credit cards on the part of the American company Mastercard   the bank said in a statement posted on Twitter 
The U S  Treasury Department in March told Visa  NYSE V   Mastercard and  American Express   NYSE AXP  that they could not continue doing business with Venezuelan state institutions after March 2020 
That was part of a broad set of sanctions against Venezuela s government that is meant to push Maduro from office and support opposition leader Juan Guaido  who in January invoked the constitution to assume a rival interim presidency 
Commerce in Venezuela s collapsing economy depends heavily on debit card transactions  which operate principally on a local platform  and increasingly on dollars and euros in cash 
Venezuelan bank regulator Sudeban earlier this year asked local banks to design a new payment system  according to a financial sector source  who added the project has not been completed 
  Mastercard should know that its arbitrary action will not intimidate us   Bank of the Armed Forces President Dario Baute wrote via Twitter   The  BanFANB technology team is stronger than you think and our legal team will respond with the same force with which you attacked us

161162,382678,AXP,Mnuchin Asks Goldman  AmEx to Help Small Banks Win Contracts,news," Bloomberg     Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has told large U S  banks including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS   and  American Express  Co  NYSE AXP   they should do more to help black  and women owned community banks win federal contracts 
Mnuchin in a letter this week asked some of the country s biggest banks to participate in the Financial Agent Mentor Protege Program  in which large lenders counsel their smaller rivals    those with assets of less than  2 billion    on how to become financial agents for the Treasury Department 
 Our goal is to expand networks within the financial services industry and to facilitate the inclusion of a broader range of financial institutions in Treasury business opportunities   Mnuchin said in a letter to banks seen by Bloomberg   The collective network of America s banks  large and small  is a national strength that is critical to our functioning economy  
Treasury s office of minority women and inclusion is leading the effort  a team that Mnuchin  who previously led a community bank  has said he meets with once a month  An administration official verified the letter 
 Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C   was the first financial agent bank to participate and worked closely with the Treasury Department to develop the program  according to a case study published by the lender  For the past decade  the New York based company has managed the Treasury s OTCnet application  which helps federal agencies accept payments  When it re bid for the work  the firm included Industrial Bank  a black owned firm in Washington 
 We hope this program serves as a template and look forward to its continued expansion   Harold Butler  Citigroup s head of Treasury and Federal Reserve banking services  said in an emailed statement 
In April  JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM    Co  announced that it was working with Harbor Bank of Maryland and Liberty Bank and Trust Co   two regional black owned companies  as part of the Treasury program

161180,382696,AXP,Visa  V  Prepares To Charge The Markets In Its Earnings After The Bell,opinion,"Fintech is getting its digital financials in order in preparation for Q3  and Visa   NYSE V   is on deck  PayPal   NASDAQ PYPL   released its earnings after the bell yesterday  October 23rd   hitting it out of the park  beating both top and bottom line estimates as well as illustrating its strongest sales to date  PayPal s peer to peer  P2P  transactions grew substantially with Venmo alone  processing over  27 billion  over half of total P2P  in Q3 demonstrating 64  year over year growth 
PayPal is up over 9  in morning trading while Visa is up 1 5   and MasterCard   NYSE MA   is up over 2   PayPal s positive results and strong transaction growth could be a signal of healthy 3rd quarter figures to come from the rest of the fintech sector 
Visa is releasing its September quarter  fiscal Q4  results after the bell this today  October 24th   and analysts are projecting the best financials to date  Zacks Consensus estimates are showing an EPS of  1 43 on sales of  6 08 billion  demonstrating growth of 18  and 12   respectively 
Visa typically isn t a big mover on earnings with the last 5 quarterly reports having a less than 2  impact  Visa s investor relations team does a reliable job telegraphing expectations to analysts  Only 2 of the 10 earnings resulted in a negative price impact 
The Business
We are all familiar with Visa as the credit card behemoth that is on most of our credit and debit cards  The company works as a middle man between the consumer  the consumer s banking account  and a business  collecting off of each transaction 
Visa s primary revenue drivers are service revenue  data processing revenue  and international transaction revenue  Service revenue is made as a percentage of each transaction  which makes it inflation protected  considering that prices and inflation move together  Data processing revenue is made through authorization  clearing  settlement  and other support that Visa provides on each transaction  International transaction revenue is self explanatory  the company makes money off of cross border transactions and currency conversions 
Visa is a very international company with US transactions making up less than half of its total revenues  This makes the firm a good indicator of global economic activity  and its downside is marginally hedged by growth in digital payment processing  As more developing countries turn to digital payments  the more Visa will grow and expand its reach 
Financials 
Visa has illustrated very consistent topline growth combined with a healthy expanding margin profile that outpaces its biggest competitors MasterCard and American Express   NYSE AXP   
Visa is the largest credit card company in the world and continues to grow  Below is a graphic provided by WalletHub and illustrates the credit card market share by purchase volume 

All of the major credit card companies are outperforming the broader market this year  and the upcoming earnings will dictate if this can continue 

Take Away
I wouldn t recommend any action before earnings  V typically doesn t move much due to the diligent IR team  Visa s shares have grown very consistently  but one concern I would have about these payment processing firms are their rich valuation multiples  which have inflate with their stock prices  This could mean that a more substantial downside if the markets were to turn south

Share Repurchase and Dividend Payout
During the reported quarter  Mastercard repurchased shares worth  1 8 billion and paid out  335 million in dividends 
Our Take
Mastercard is poised to grow  given its solid market position  ongoing expansion and digital initiatives  plus significant opportunities from the secular shift toward electronic payments  Its numerous acquisitions have aided revenue growth 
However  escalating costs will put pressure on the company s bottom line  In order to gain customers and new business  Mastercard has been incurring high levels of costs under rebates and incentives  which remains a concern  Nevertheless  its strong balance sheet enables business investment  thereby driving growth

161204,382720,AXP,The Optimist s Guide To Airlines And Gold,opinion," Travel   Mahatma Gandhi once said   is the language of peace  

If that s the case and I happen to believe that it is then I m extremely bullish about the future  especially with respect to U S  China relations   The trade war s days may be numbered as both sides of the skirmish reached a partial agreement last Friday  laying the groundwork for Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping to sign a trade deal later this year 




Tourism has traditionally helped peace and understanding spread across borders  and I m hopeful that it will do the same today  It s also good for commerce  especially for airlines and the travel industry in general 
It s Airline Earnings Season  Are You Participating 
Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   in particular  had a phenomenal third quarter as we head into the fourth  and historically most profitable  quarter  The carrier reported the best sales in company history as well as impressive earnings per share of  2 32  a 29 percent increase over the same period last year  CNBC reports that Delta is hiring as many as 12 000 new employees including pilots  flight attendants and ground staff through 2020 to meet surging demand 

Supporting this growth are rising ancillary fees  Those are the non ticket fees and upgrades you may end up having to pay when you fly  for everything from meals to preferred seating to credit cards  Delta recently inked a new deal with  American Express   NYSE AXP   which is forecast to generate a mind boggling  7 billion in revenue for the carrier by 2023  up from  3 billion today 

But Delta s not the only one that s joined the party  In the chart below  you can see a comparison of the amount of ancillary fees select U S  airlines collected in 2018  on a per passenger basis  with what they collected a decade earlier  Low cost carrier Frontier saw an unbelievable 1 187 percent jump in such fees  while Spirit topped the list with an average  50 94 per passenger 




If you re not participating  now might be a good entry point  The busy Thanksgiving and Christmas travel seasons are fast approaching  and according to  the fourth quarter has typically seen the highest returns  with shares rising 8 percent on average every period going back to 1990 
Time to Buy the Gold Dip 
I m excited to see what s in store for gold  which is headed back to its mean after its price was up nearly three standard deviations in August  As CLSA analysts said recently  these price dips look like attractive buying opportunities  in anticipating of a resumption of the initial base breakout  




Last week our office was visited by the legendary economist Nancy Lazar  co founder of Cornerstone Macro  who commented that the growing mountain of global debt  not to mention the proliferation of low to negative yielding debt  makes the yellow metal very attractive right now 
I agree and stick by my call for  10 000 an ounce gold  Some critics believe only a major event  such as a war or famine  would be enough to push the metal up that high  but really all it takes is monetary and fiscal mismanagement  That s exactly what we re seeing right now in Europe  where growth is slowing because of business killing regulations  But instead of getting rid of these rules  interest rates have been allowed to dip below zero  In Denmark  banks are actually paying borrowers to take out a mortgage  which is contributing to what Nancy sees as a European housing bubble 
Conditions aren t much better in the U S  or at least they weren t  until President Trump began rolling back unnecessary regulations 
According to Steve Forbes  there are 773 000 words in the Bible  which sounds like a lot until you learn that there are around 10 million words in the federal income tax code  Similarly  there are more than 185 000 pages in the Federal Register of rules and regulations  That s up 17 percent from 158 000 pages in 2008  But in 2018  the number of pages actually fell almost 1 000 pages  or 0 5 percent  meaning Trump is keeping his word

American Express shares have added about 25  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 6  
What s Next for American Express 
While American Express has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

161207,382723,AXP,Credit Cards Breakdown Imminent ,opinion,"The relentless march higher for credit card heavyweights  Visa Inc  Class A  NYSE V  and Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA  may be over  and take  American Express  Company  NYSE AXP  with it   should  PayPal Holdings Inc   NASDAQ PYPL  prove to be the canary in the credit coal mine 
Why  Their charts look eerily similar  with Paypal potentially being the leader 





First  the favorite payment method for millenials  PayPal s  PYPL  stock chart completed and broke down from a  ten gallon hat variety  head and shoulders topping pattern already 
Now let s look at PayPal s physical credit card competitors 





First MasterCard  MA   Yes that right shoulder did not dip beneath the left like PayPal s did  Still  you can agree there s the potential for a head and shoulders pattern to form 





Visa s chart  V  looks just slightly different than MasterCard s  with that potential left shoulder s top above the potential right shoulder s top 





Finally we have  American Express   NYSE AXP   Its chart is still in the process of forming a potential right shoulder  Should that pattern form  Amex s right shoulder low slumped beneath the potential left shoulder s low  which is a would be an edge in the bears  favor 
So what s driving this  In a word  Treasuries 





The most recent bull impulse leg in treasury bonds topped out in late August  Since then  we ve seen  something  cause a retracement  whether it was rebalancing by large funds or other reasons  
Note how the timing of the bonds top   then correction  coincided nearly exactly with price action in Mastercard  NYSE MA   Visa  NYSE V   and  American Express   NYSE AXP

161228,382744,AXP,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  PayPal  Alibaba  American Express  Mastercard And Visa,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  October 3  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  PayPal Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ PYPL    Alibaba Group Holding Limited   NYSE BABA    American Express Company   NYSE AXP    Mastercard Inc    NYSE MA   and Visa Inc    NYSE V   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  PayPal to Tap China s Digital Money Market  Will It Succeed The financial and payment platform market in China has been targeted by US giants for a long time but the stringent norms made it difficult for the latter to venture in that space  Last year  China s central bank announced that  it would open up further to foreign payment companies   thereby paving the road for US firms to make a foray in the communist country s market Last November  American Express became the first US card platform to provide card clearing services in China  This business initiative spread positive vibes in the process  Now  PayPal is all set to enter the market after acquiring a majority stake in GoPay  Will PayPal be able to establish a strong foothold and succeed as a trader in the region PayPal to Enter China in Q419                          On Sep 30  China s central bank finally approved PayPal Holdings  Inc  s appeal to acquire 70  stake in China s GoPay  Guofubao Information Technology Co   GoPay   Ltd   for an undisclosed deal value  This will make PayPal the first foreign company to make inroads into the digital payment service market in China The digital payment market in China had only three players  namely Alibaba Group Holding Limited s Alipay  GoPay and others  While both Alipay and WeChat generally engage in intra country money transfer and e wallet service  GoPay provides payment for industrial products  e commerce  cross border trade  aviation tourism et al This is a big step amid the ongoing Sino US trade rift as PayPal can now penetrate a totally unadulterated market with a huge scope for expansion  US credit card companies have been continuously attempting to enter the market in China but recently the latter opened doors to the players though at a slower pace The restriction on the US entities to enter the payment arena in China has been strong  making the former cough up a lot for fulfilling the licensing requirements and this has for long benefited the Chinese firms The biggest example of the above is American Express Company  which commonly carries out transactions through its own platform  In China  AmEx has to make payment via the state controlled China Union Pay to process transactions  Fortunately  per the latest preliminary approval in November 2018  the player has been allowed to process payments on AmEx branded cards Other players like Mastercard Inc  and Visa Inc  are trying hard to collaborate with domestic Chinese companies to tap the well guarded uncharted market Chance for SuccessPer a Frost   Sullivan research report  the mobile payment market is expected to grow 21 8  in 2023 compared with 2017  influenced and driven by the rise in e commerce  In fact  the aforementioned report also states that active mobile payment customers  number will shoot up to 956 million in 2023 from 562 million in 2017 As China s central bank turns generous in allowing US payment platforms to enter the market  PayPal has hit the bull s eye and will surely succeed  A push in the online shopping will further boost the company s expansion PayPal will be the lone player in cross border transaction in China and with consumers having access to several online stores worldwide  This will help it winning more clients as consumers will be able to purchase from online across

161260,382776,AXP,Visa  MasterCard or American Express  Which Is The Better Value Option Right Now ,opinion,"Value Investors tend to follow the market in search for stocks which may seem somewhat undervalued when compared to their peers  industry and market in general  Fundamental Analysis  Valuation Metrics and overall looking into a company s books are all used when trying to identify the best investment option  On this occasion  we will analyze three credit card giants  Visa  MasterCard and American Express  
Let s begin with  Visa Inc  Class A  NYSE V   by far the largest network by cardholders in the world  with a market cap of  389 9 billion  As of Friday s closing price  the stock holds a PE 33 4x  PEG 2 7x  PS 17 5 and PB 12 8x  It also holds an Intrinsic Value based on Future Cash Flows of  160 28  Now  this value is important because it forecasts future cash flows of a company s business discounting them to today s value  So  having in mind the stock s current price  it is 8  overvalued based on this metric  





Above we have Visa s monthly Chart where  besides it s sustained growth over the years  we can see a double top at the  180 60 level  This might be sending a message to investors that a top might of been reached  The stock continues having buy signals by MACD and Ichimoku which is good  but the RSI does show us the stock is currently overbought  
Now let s take a look at Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA   which has a market cap of  275 1 billion  After yesterday s close  the stock holds a PE 41 6x PEG 2 9x PS 17 5x and PB 55x  It s Intrinsic Value based on Future Cash Flows is  233 17  currently trading 16  overvalued  





 
Taking a look at MasterCard s monthly chart  it is very similar to Visa s  Stock is forming a double top at  281 10 and also continues having buy signals by MACD and Ichimoku  It s RSI also shows the stock is currently overbought  
Last but not least  we have  American Express  Company  NYSE AXP   one of America s favorite credit card with a market cap of  96 9 billion  After Friday s close  the stock has a PE 14 4x  PEG 2 1x  PS 2 5x and PB 4 2x  It s Intrinsic Value based on Future Cash Flows is  141 85 which means the stock is currently trading at a 21  discount from it s fair price based on this metric  





AmEx s monthly chart differs from the other two primarily because it s RSI is currently not in overbought zone  
Comparison and Conclusion 
When comparing the valuation metrics used for these stocks  we clearly see AmEx is undervalued compared to Visa and MasterCard 
Another great item to have in mind is the 1 year EPS Forecast for these stocks  where Visa s is  6 26  MasterCard s is  9 02 and AmEx s is  8 99  This is important because we can also note that AmEx s earnings forecast is almost the same as MasterCard s having in mind it s market cap is practically 1 3 of MasterCard s  
If we add Dividend Yield into the mix  American Express also looks more attractive than the other two  Visa currently holds a dividend yield of 0 6   MasterCard 0 5  and American Express 1 3   The difference isn t so big but it still adds more credit to American Express ",2019-09-21,Felipe Potes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/visa-mastercard-or-american-express-which-is-the-better-value-option-right-now-200466787,200466787

161264,382780,AXP,In Brexit on Sea  the left behind still want Out,news,"By Clodagh Kilcoyne and Sara Ledwith SKEGNESS  England  Reuters    On a Sunday evening in March  Evelyn Ovington and her granddaughter Dana Marie went to play bingo as usual in their local town hall near Skegness  a resort on the east coast of England  Like many of the country s seaside towns  it is battling decline and voted heavily to quit the European Union in the 2016 Brexit referendum  Top prizes at the club that night included the ingredients for a chicken dinner  Dana Marie  who had just turned 18  marked her coming of age by drinking a can of beer  She and her 59 year old gran joked with the rest of the crowd  spanning all ages  as they waited for the numbers to be called in the traditional way  When the caller said   The street where she lives  Theresa May   the players recognized the reference to the prime minister s residence in Downing Street  Number 10  But bingo calls are about as close as Evelyn Ovington expects to get to Theresa May  As the target deadline for Britain to quit the EU approached  Ovington and dozens of others whom Reuters met on a 14 day tour along England s coastline said they felt increasingly let down by politicians  In line with recent opinion polls nationwide  few had changed their minds about backing Brexit  In these coastal areas  the majority still wanted to leave Europe   Get us out of there and get us our own nation back  That s what I say   said Ovington    I m  just fed up with all the money that they give to the EU when we can spend it here  I want out   Britain as a whole voted by a narrow margin to leave the European Union  But around England s coastline  dislike of EU was and is much more marked  A tally of the results as estimated by Chris Hanretty  a professor of politics at Royal Holloway  University of London  shows more than 100 of the 120 or so English parliamentary constituencies that have a coastline voted to leave  Reuters visited 10 of them  eight where most people voted to leave  and two where a majority chose to stay  From Skegness on the east coast to Morecambe Bay in the west  dozens of people said they were still convinced their fortunes could only improve outside the EU  The main exception was Brighton  a southern town nicknamed  London on Sea   partly for its appeal to those with jobs in the capital who have an hour long commute to work  In this cosmopolitan  affluent university town  a clear majority voted to remain in the European community  which the UK joined in 1973  The overall results reflect a wider trend  Across Europe  economic and industrial decline are driving anti EU sentiment  according to a European Commission study from December 2018  The paper   The Geography of EU Discontent   found that areas with lower employment or a less educated workforce are more likely to vote anti EU  In England s case  Brexit also highlights a new layer in the political divide  which Prime Minister May alluded to in 2016 when she pledged to help those  left behind  by globalisation  Big cities are becoming younger  more ethnically diverse  more educated and more socially liberal  while smaller towns are ageing  are less diverse  more nostalgic and more socially conservative  studies by political geographers show  All around the coastline  whether people voted Leave or Remain  they expressed nostalgic regret for a time when there was more opportunity   and kindness   I think we used to take care of our communities a bit more   said Brighton based web designer and massage therapist Chris Baker  adding it was easy to be too romantic about the past   I think  you know  we had more manners  we were nicer to people on the street   For Ovington  the problem is very real  She worries that her granddaughter s 18th birthday brings nearer the moment when Dana Marie  like other young people in the region  will move away to university and work  Ovington hopes Brexit means the local council can claim funds that in her view are currently being mis directed into Europe  and invest them in a future for local young people   At the moment there is no future for them  there s nothing   she said   So out of Brexit  they ll get more funding  help the kids more   SKEGNESS  LINCOLNSHIRE Coastal regions were targeted in the run up to the referendum by the anti EU United Kingdom Independence Party  UKIP   While UKIP has since lost ground  the frustrations it tapped remain  Populations on the coast are typically older  whiter  less well educated and poorer than the average  In 2013  Skegness was designated the  most deprived seaside area in Britain  in a study by the Office for National Statistics  ONS   And in 2016 the constituency returned the biggest  Leave  vote in the country  at more than 75 percent  according to Hanretty  Skegness was the site of the first Butlin s holiday camp for workers in the 1930s  and is still a popular seaside destination in the summer  But it sits in a poor farming region and has yet to attract year round visitors  The mean age of just over 44 in Skegness is older than the English average of just over 39  census data from 2011 shows  More than 93 percent of people in the area said they were white and of English or British nationalities  compared with just under 80 percent in England on average  Around 40 percent of people in the Skegness area said they had no qualifications   It s been going downhill for a long time   said Dana Marie of the town  adding she would have voted to leave the EU if she had been old enough  She is studying biology  sociology and health and social care at school  and works part time in a Burger King    Obviously it s seasonal  so during the summer it s really really good  but during the winter it s terrible   In 2010  average hourly pay for people living in the Skegness area was about three quarters of the British average  By 2018  it had fallen further behind  The national average was 14 36 pounds an hour  according to the ONS  But people living in and around Skegness were making just over 10 pounds an hour  On a Sunday night in a pub in Wainfleet near Skegness  father and son John and Andrew Eldin were almost the only customers  John  77  said that to stay in Europe would be to be  ruled by a load of boneheads  I voted out  Because I remembered how good it was before we went in   Eldin and his son  a heavy goods driver and mechanic  spoke heatedly about how there has been diminishing care for old farm hands in the region who have been afflicted by arthritis after years harvesting cabbages  Now  they said  locals are undermined in the jobs market by immigrants from eastern Europe who have freedom of access  and also compete for schools and healthcare  REDCAR  NORTH YORKSHIRE A militant mood is mounting in Redcar  a small town devastated in 2015 by the closure of its steelworks with the loss of around 3 000 jobs  In January  local media reported  demonstrators marched in yellow vests with the slogan  leave means leave  to urge their member of parliament  who backed the Remain campaign  to quit  The politician did not step down and tensions still run high   Life s gonna change after this because of the politicians  who run the country  said Kevin Calvey  an unemployed 64 year old   Everything s gonna be contested from now on   He thinks London is absorbing investment that the rest of the country needs  A new rail link across the capital is costing some  22 billion  The government s refusal to grant a loan to the Redcar steelworks forced the plant to close  Redcar is a relatively young town  but more than a quarter of residents have no qualifications  Relative pay has declined since 2010   London just needs feeding all the time  to the detriment of the rest of the country   said Calvey  He said he voted to leave the EU  because I didn t want the unelected bureaucrats in Brussels telling us what to do    Fish and chip shop owner and Leave voter Mark Scorer works in Redcar because businesses in his home town of Sunderland were too expensive to take on  he said   I just think Britain s been on the decline since the 80s   he said   There s not much out there for people  sometimes people have got to move away to get jobs  They go to university to get these degrees and then they move to London     which is a shame   Further up the coast  a postcard on sale in the former fishing town of Whitby depicted the shuttered hulk of Redcar s steelworks above a banner   dystopia on sea   WHITBY  NORTH YORKSHIRE In Whitby harbor  kipper smoker Derek Brown said his family has been in the business for 146 years  For the past 30 or so  he says  the fish he has been smoking has had to be imported from Norway and Iceland because herring can no longer be found off the coast  The reasons for this include overfishing and climate change  but he felt London and Brussels have not helped  When Britain joined the then European Economic Community  the country opened its fishing waters to other states  which today catch more in UK waters than do UK boats   I want change   Brown said   Hopefully we ll get our fishing grounds back   Pay in the Whitby area has picked up since 2010  but still lags the British average  A higher than average share of people say they have no qualifications  and in the 2011 census  97 percent gave their nationalities as white English or British variants  Guest house and tea shop owner Alice Raven  27  said she didn t vote in the referendum but she sees more opportunities for England outside the EU  Her gothic themed cafe plays on Whitby s appeal as the site where the 19th century novelist Bram Stoker brought his villain  Count Dracula  into England   I think leaving would be the best option   she said  sitting next to a skeleton outside her tea rooms   I don t think you can trust any of the government at the moment   MORECAMBE  LANCASHIRE On the northwest coast  fisherwoman Margaret Owen  just back from delivering a batch of sprats to feed the seals in Blackpool Zoo  was boiling over at the politicians  ignorance  She said it was preventing her from earning a living  In the summer months Owen  66  uses a haaf net  an ancient technique dating back to the Vikings to catch salmon and sea trout as they head upriver  The job is dangerous  Users manipulate a device like a cutdown soccer goal post while standing in deep  fast running water  Owen has until recently been licensed to fish in this traditional way  But now salmon are an endangered species  and from this year she has been told that EU regulations mean she must discard any salmon she catches  This  she says  is unrealistic  not least because she sometimes fishes at night   I stand in the water up to my chest   she said   It can be pitch black  turbulent  raining  sand s going from under your feet  You get it  the fish  in the net  it goes right to the back of the net  You ve got to catch it  kill it  and put it on your belt and let me tell you  I haven t got time to say   Are you a sea trout or a salmon    Owen said she originally wanted out of the EU   We were hoping for a change for everybody   But now  she says she has changed her mind  because talks so far don t look like delivering what the fishing industry hoped  Other fishermen in Morecambe Bay gather shellfish  such as cockles and mussels  for export  mainly to southern Europe  Leaving could restrict their access to European markets  but two of them said they still wanted out  even though they worried about the potential impact on their business  UK cockle fisheries made over four million pounds in 2017  The EU was originally set up for fair trading  said one of these fishermen  Michael Wilson  but it hasn t worked out like that   We ve countries joining with no money and we were providing money  so it was time to get out or go independent  I think   BRIGHTON  EAST SUSSEX The Leave vote cuts little ice in Brighton on the south coast  one of the few coastal towns with a clear majority in favor of remaining in Europe  In the wealthier part of town  almost three quarters of voters wanted to stay in Europe   I believe that the Leave campaign was based entirely on lies and there was no way I was going to vote in support of that   said Ruby McMahon  a 22 year old literature graduate who works in a clothing store  She came to Brighton in 2015 to go to university  and said she stayed because she had been raised  in a very conservative backwards town   Brighton s demographic profile is almost the mirror image of Skegness  People who live in the town  which houses the UK headquarters of  American Express   NYSE AXP   earn more than the British average   almost 10 percent more in Brighton Pavilion  the richer part of town  The mean age  at 37  is younger than average  according to the 2011 census  Almost 40 percent are educated to the highest level  and around 20 percent of residents say their ethnicity is not white English or British  McMahon   like the Ovingtons in Skegness   said her vote was partly driven by her aspirations for the future  But where the Ovingtons want more opportunities at home  McMahon worries that Brexit will damage her chances of living and working outside England  Once outside the European Union  Britons may no longer enjoy freedom of movement

Financial services stock American Express  AXP  briefly revisited its April lows in the  90 area during the market s bruising late December slide  but the Dow component has joined in the broad based rebound  AXP is now up about 10  from its Christmas Eve close at  89 50  and the shares are on track to close a second consecutive week back above their 80 week moving average    a long term trendline that has historically signaled buying opportunities  see chart  




In fact  Schaeffer s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White found previous occasions where AXP was trading less than one standard deviation from its 80 week moving average  after having spent 80  of the time above it over the past 20 weeks  There have been 13 such signals over the past 15 years  and the stock s returns going forward are compellingly bullish  especially for a  boring  blue chip like AXP 
Looking out four weeks after one of these 80 week pullback signals  AXP was 3 62  higher  on average  with 77  of the returns positive  And expanding the time frame to three months after a signal  the stock s average return climbs to 6 34   with 85  of the returns positive 
However  Wall Street seems unprepared for an extended AXP rally  Among the 18 analysts tracking the shares  only seven call them a  strong buy   with 11 doling out a lukewarm  hold  rating  Any upgrades from this group could bring some fresh buyers to the table in the weeks ahead 
Meanwhile  short sellers have been piling on  Short interest on American Express stock rose by 15 4  in the most recent two week reporting period  and was up by 27 1  over the past two reporting periods  The current supply of 7 86 million AXP shares sold short represents an eight month high  and points to a healthy supply of sideline cash that could unwind to fuel short term upside in the stock 
Options players are also bearishly skewed  During the past 50 days  speculative players on the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Chicago Board Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX  have bought to open 1 45 puts for every call on AXP  This ratio arrives in the 86th percentile of its annual range  as options traders have shown a greater preference for bearish bets over bullish only 14  of the time in the past year 
With AXP set to report earnings on Jan  17  prospective call buyers may wish to see how the post event price action shakes out   and how low implied volatility falls before placing a trade based on this bullish buy signal  That said  given the strength of the three month returns following prior 80 week pullbacks  it s worth pointing out that AXP s  at the money April options are currently pricing in just 24 8  implied volatility  which is about 14 percentage points  cheaper  than the stock s current 30 dayvolatility ",2019-01-10,Money Show,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/american-express-rebounds-but-short-sellers-circle-1744084,1744084

Overview
The financial services giant has been able to deliver for investors thus far  and is looking to turn in a strong quarterly report to continue the successful year  American Express is both a card issuer and a card processer  which allows the company to keep a bigger chunk of interchange fees than companies like Visa   NYSE V   and MasterCard   NYSE MA    The company has been updating some of its signature card lines  but has been hiking up its annual fees in the process  Rumbles coming from the Amex owning community have suggested that cardholders feel that the company might be crossing boundaries  In recent years  American Express has faced some stiff competition from the likes of JPMorgan Chase   NYSE JPM   that has tried to entice credit card clients with lucrative rewards 
Starting next month  the company s association with Priority pass will be ceasing meal credits at participating airport restaurants  This may not bode well for the credit card giant  as the benefit will still be offered to clients through rival credit card providers  In addition  AXP is cracking down on a loophole where its incidental fee credit could be redeemed through purchasing select airline gift cards  This initiative comes as an attempt for American Express to eliminate the pesky churners who may be hindering the company s bottom line 
Q2 Estimates
American Express was able to bring in revenues of  11 26 billion  which was a year over year jump of 8 9  in Q1 2019  In addition  the company s bottom line was able to slightly surpass our Consensus Estimates by an EPS surprise of 0 50   The company has been able to exceed our Consensus Estimates three out of the past four reported quarters for an average EPS surprise of 0 84   AXP attributed  2 73 billion of its revenue from interest on loans out of the total interest income of  2 95 billion it brought in  The company fell slightly short of our NFM estimates for total cards in force in Q1 by reporting  113 9 million  which was short  0 96  of the estimated  115 million  American Express s Return on Average Equity also fell short of estimates by 3  by reporting  31 9 million 
Our Estimates are currently projecting for revenues from net of interest expenses to total  2 94 billion in the second quarter of 2019  In addition  total cards in force are being estimated to total  113 million in the second quarter as well  Year over year Consensus Estimates are forecasting for the credit card giant s earnings to increase 11 41  with a top line spike of 8 21  to  10 82 billion  Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings to be  2 05 this quarter  which would be a 2  increase from last quarter s reported EPS of  2 01 
Bottom Line 
American Express is expected to show signs of growth this current quarter with their year over year estimates  Double digit bottom line growth is forecasted to continue for American Express through 2020  The company is making moves toward improving their bottom line by potentially losing some churners but could end up hindering the company s growth as a result  The credit card issuer is listed as a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  with a Style Score of B in Value  Shareholders of the financial services company should keep their eyes set on the Fed s meeting scheduled to take place later in the month  as the decision to cut rates will have an impact on American Express

161343,382859,AXP,American Express  AXP  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"American Express  AXP  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 19  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This credit card issuer and global payments company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 05 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 4  
Revenues are expected to be  10 82 billion  up 8 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 57  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for American Express 
For American Express  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that American Express will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that American Express would post earnings of  2 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 01  delivering a surprise of  0 50  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
American Express doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/american-express-axp-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200439331,200439331
161348,382864,AXP,Mastercard says storing India payments data locally in face of new rules,news,"By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI  Reuters    Global card payments giant Mastercard  NYSE MA  is storing its new Indian transaction data locally  the company said on Tuesday  as it starts to comply with a regulatory directive which U S  companies unsuccessfully lobbied hard to dilute 
The Indian central bank in April said companies such as Mastercard  Visa  NYSE V  and  American Express   NYSE AXP  will from October need to store their payments data  only in India  so that the regulator could have  unfettered supervisory access  
The directive sparked an aggressive lobbying effort from U S  companies who said the rules would increase their infrastructure costs  hit their global fraud detection platforms and affect planned investments in India where more and more people are using digital modes of payments 
The companies had sought dilution of the central bank directive  requesting they be allowed to store data both locally and at their offshore offices  a practice widely known as  data mirroring   But their requests were declined 
Mastercard has started storing all its new payments transaction data in India at its technology center in the western city of Pune  the company said in a statement to Reuters on Tuesday  It did not specify whether a copy of that data was still being stored abroad 
The company said it has submitted a proposal with the Reserve Bank of India  RBI  for  storage of data only in India within a specified timeframe   It did not give a timeline 
Visa too has started storing a copy of its new transaction data locally and had sought time from the RBI to comply with the requirement to store Indian data only within the country  two industry sources said 
Visa and American Express did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
The RBI directive was part of a wider push by India to ask companies to store more of their data locally at a time when governments globally are enforcing more stringent rules to protect user data 
Government sources have previously told Reuters that stringent data localization measures were essential for gaining easier access to data during criminal and other investigations 
Two U S  senators this month called on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to soften India s stance on data localization  warning that measures requiring it represent  key trade barriers  between the two nations 

Other than the RBI proposal  India is working on an overarching data protection law that calls for the storing of all critical personal data in India  E commerce and cloud computing policies are also being developed ",2018-10-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/mastercard-says-storing-india-payments-data-locally-in-face-of-new-rules-1665861,1665861

161373,382889,AXP,Is American Express  AXP  A Great Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put American Express Company   NYSE AXP   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  American Express has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 11  If we focus on the long term PE trend American Express  current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  However  the stock s PE compares unfavorably with the Zacks   Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 75  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers  Nonetheless  American Express has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 18  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  American Express has a P S ratio of about 2 28  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 07x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  American Express currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes the stock a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though AXP might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of C  This gives AXP a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen three upward revisions with three downward movement in the past sixty days  For the full year  the estimate has seen six downward revision in the same time period with one movement in the opposite direction This has had an impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased 1 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate plunged 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below American Express Company Price and Consensus   Despite the bearish analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAmerican Express is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 17  of more

161395,382911,AXP,Visa Or Mastercard  Which Stock Looks Better Post Results ,opinion,"Visa Inc    NYSE V   and Mastercard Inc    NYSE MA    leaders in the payment processing industry  recently reported results for the January  March quarter  While Mastercard reported first quarter results  Visa came up with second quarter fiscal 2019 numbers 
Both Visa and Mastercard  with a market capitalization of  314 billion and  247 billion  respectively  are leaders in the payment processing industry with their worldwide payment network  partnerships with several retailers  banks and merchants  and a developed technological platform  Other leading companies in the same space are Discover Financial Services   NYSE DFS    American Express Inc    NYSE AXP   
Both Visa and Mastercard have identical business offerings and operate in almost same markets providing customers with almost similar benefits  Macroeconomic factors like GDP growth  unemployment  and the global economic environment affect the stocks in similar fashion 
Mastercard and Visa have made massive investments in technology and are aggressively seeking to make deep inroads into small and medium business segments  Given the ever growing payments space  both the companies are slated for long term growth 
In a year s time  Visa with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and Mastercard with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  have gained 22 4  and 28   respectively  outperforming the  s growth of 13 3   You can see   

 
We  here  try to analyze which one of the two stocks hold an edge over the other based on the recent reported results 
Earnings Surprise and Estimate  In the recently reported results  both Visa and Mastercard surpassed their respective earnings estimate by 5 65  and 7 23   respectively  They also have an impressive beat track  having surpassed estimates    5 75  for Mastercard and 5 40  for Visa   in each of the last four quarters 
Visa has seen an upward revision by 0 9  for fiscal 2019 to  5 38 per share over the past 60 days  while the same for Mastercard is up 0 6  to  7 6 per share  Visa seems better off here 
Return on Equity  ROE is one of the most widely used profitability measures  reflecting the efficiency by which a company uses its shareholder funds to generate returns  While Mastercard has an ROE of 30   the same for Visa is 41   reflecting its better profitability 
Valuation  The 12 month forward price to earnings ratio shows that Mastercard is trading at a P E of 30 compared with the industry s PE of 24  but is near its higher than median level of 25 4  which shows its expensive valuation 
Visa  on the other hand  has a PE ratio of 27  which is higher than the industry s PE of 24 and its own median of 25  However  a comparison shows that Visa is relatively cheaper than Mastercard 
Leverage Levels  Another metric that can affect a company s profitability is its leverage ratio  Though some amount of debt is good for companies as it helps to generate higher returns  since debt is relatively a cheaper source of capital than equity  high debt can be hazardous 
Visa has a debt to equity ratio of 43  and the same for Mastercard is 121   compared with the industry s 63   This implies that Visa has a better debt profile than Mastercard and thus low financial risk 
Growth Estimates  For fiscal 2019  Visa s earnings are expected to grow at 16 7  while the same for Mastercard are expected to grow at 17 75   compared with the industry average growth of 12 4  
Though both companies will surpass the industry growth rate  Mastercard holds an advantage here  over Visa 
Our comparative analysis shows that on most fronts  Visa comes out as a better bet than Mastercard  Though both companies score closely  for now  Visa seems to be a better pick

161430,382946,AXP,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Delta  American Airlines  JetBlue Airways And United Airlines,opinion,"For Immediate Release
Chicago  IL   April 11  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Delta   NYSE DAL    American Airlines   NASDAQ AAL    JetBlue Airways   NASDAQ JBLU   and United Airlines   NASDAQ UAL   
Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  
After Delta s  DAL  Beat  What to Expect from Other Airlines 
Q1 earnings season is on its way and Delta is kicking it off for the airlines  This morning DAL posted earnings of  0 96 per share  11 6  higher than expected and a 28  increase year over year  DAL opened up 3  from yesterday but has traded down since and is now sitting at a 1  gain  Delta Air s CEO Ed Bastian expresses positive forward looking sentiment  saying that  with the momentum in our business and our American Express  NYSE AXP  contract renewal  we have increased confidence in achieving our full year plan of top line growth  margin expansion and double digit earnings growth  
Delta saw margin expansion in Q1 with a 0 2  decrease in cost per available seat mile excluding fuel  CASM Ex  as well as adjusted top line growth of 7 5  demonstrating both customer loyalty growth and continuous improvement in operational excellence 
Delta is the largest airline in the world by market cap  competing with American Airlines for most market share  This airline operates in more than 50 countries taking passengers to over 300 destinations and serving nearly 200 million people annually 
DAL s earnings sets the tone for the rest of the Airlines earnings releases later this month  Competing airline stocks have tracked DAL this morning  opening high  breaking down  and now regaining momentum  American Airlines is up over 1  this morning and JetBlue Airways  a smaller player in the space  saw gains of over 3  in this morning s trading 
Delta Trade
The cyclicality of airline stock makes them a useful asset to trade if you can read the markets  You can see the DAL 1 year chart illustrating relatively strong support in the upper  40s and a resistance around  60  These levels will likely increase as the company continues to grow and expand its market share  Keep an eye on oil prices as they have a direct inverse correlation with airline stocks considering it s a substantial variable cost  I would consider buying DAL as it comes closer to  50 and average down until a trough is hit then ride the wave right back up to  60  if fundamentals don t change 
Upcoming Airline Earnings
United Airlines  4 16
UAL has been effectively flat for the year  underperforming the airline space in 2019  but over the past 52 weeks this stock has seen 30  growth  outperforming the category  United is expect to report  0 94 EPS  which would be 88  growth from Q1 last year  UAL has beat all of the last 6 earnings estimates with positive price reaction from the last 4 reports  UAL is up about 9  over the past 2 weeks demonstrating some possible positive earnings sentiment   
American Airlines Group  4 25
AAL has lagged in its category so far in 2019  Their expected earnings has dropped 17  over the past 3 months causing this stock to be a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  going into earnings  Earnings are expected to be  0 58 per share  22  lower than last year s Q1 EPS but revenue numbers are expected to grow over 2  year over year  AAL saw positive price action after the past 3 earnings reports even with missing revenue estimates on 2 of those  Like UAL this stock has jumped 12  over the last 2 weeks illustrating some positive market sentiment going into earnings

161442,382958,AXP,Bank sped up Manafort loan approval as CEO sought Trump cabinet job  witness,news,"By Nathan Layne  Karen Freifeld and Amanda Becker ALEXANDRIA  Virginia  Reuters    The head of a small Chicago bank was directly involved in approving  16 million in loans to former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort while seeking Manafort s help securing a post in the new administration  a witness testified on Friday in Manafort s fraud trial   Dennis Raico  a former Federal Savings Bank executive testifying under immunity  said the bank s chief executive  Steve Calk  expressed interest in such posts as Treasury secretary or Housing and Urban Development secretary  Calk took a  personal interest  in Manafort s loan applications and expedited them  Raico said  One loan was approved a day after a July 27  2016  call in which Calk let it be known to Manafort he wanted a role in the administration    I knew Steve was interested politics   Raico said   Manafort later asked the incoming administration to consider tapping Calk for secretary of the Army  according to testimony earlier in the week  Calk  a retired Army officer and helicopter pilot  did not get any post in the administration  although he was named to a Trump campaign advisory panel in August 2016   A spokeswoman for Federal Savings did not respond to requests for comment  Calk declined to comment  Raico was one of just three witnesses called to the stand on Friday as the trial resumed after an unexpected recess that lasted into the midafternoon  The delay derailed the prosecution s plans to wrap up its case by the end of the week   Greg Andres  a prosecutor on U S  Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team  said he would call James Brennan  a vice president at Federal Savings Bank who was also granted immunity  and two other witnesses on Monday before resting their case  It was not clear if Manafort  who has pleaded not guilty to 18 felony counts of bank fraud  tax fraud and failing to disclose about 30 foreign bank accounts  will call any witnesses  So far Manafort s lawyers have focused their defense on attacking Rick Gates  Manafort s former right hand man who cut a plea deal and is cooperating with Mueller s probe  Raico testified that Gates had nothing to do with the two Federal Savings loans in question   a  9 5 million mortgage on Manafort s estate in the Hamptons and a  6 5 million loan on a brownstone in Brooklyn  Prosecutors say Manafort lied about his income and provided other false information to get the loans  Raico said Calk asked him to call Manafort shortly after the Nov  8  2016  election  to see if he could be a candidate for the Treasury or HUD posts  Raico said the involvement of Calk in the Manafort loans was unusual and made him uncomfortable  He said had never seen loans approved so quickly at the bank  On cross examination  defense attorney Richard Westling sought to show that the loans to Manafort were justified  Westling pointed out that the Hamptons property had been appraised at  13 million  well above the  9 5 million borrowed  and that Federal s credit committee had approved the loans  LEGENDS SUITE Raico said that a letter from Gates indicating that he  not Manafort  would be paying for Yankees season tickets in 2016 lowered his debts  helping him qualify for the Federal loans  In the letter Gates said he had borrowed Manafort s  American Express   NYSE AXP  card to pay for the tickets  which cost more than  200 000 a year  Gates testified this week the letter was false and a  favor  to Manafort to help him get the loans  Irfan Kirimca  senior director of ticket operations at the Yankees  testified on Friday that Manafort had purchased four season tickets since at least 2010 and that Gates never had an account with the Yankees  Kirimca said Manafort paid for the Legends Suite package  which includes food service and cushioned seats  Kirimca testified about one email exchange in which Manafort instructed a Yankees employee to send the tickets to his Trump Tower address  Andres also on Friday briefly questioned Andrew Chojnowski  chief operating officer of home lending at Federal  asking him whether Manafort had signed various documents warning that he could be prosecuted for giving false information to the bank  Chojnowski read one disclaimer which noted that mortgage fraud was punishable by up to 30 years in prison  Andres said he plans to call James Brennan  a Federal Savings executive who like Raico was granted immunity  on Monday  He then wants to recall Paula Liss  a special agent for the Treasury Department s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network  who testified earlier this week  Manafort s lawyers have opposed Liss taking the stand again  a matter on which T S  Ellis  the judge overseeing the case  has yet to rule  Ellis said the recess on Friday could not be avoided as he had matters to attend to  Without further details  courtroom observers were left to speculate about the reason for the break and a long bench discussion with attorneys from both sides  Ellis  who reminded jurors in the morning in unusual detail about the need to  keep an open mind  about the trial and not to talk to anyone about the case  gave them the same instructions before dismissing them for the weekend  
 Put it completely out of your mind until Monday  I certainly plan to do that   Ellis said ",2018-08-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/us-to-rest-its-case-against-manafort-with-chicago-bank-1569158,1569158

161460,382976,AXP,Delta Beats Earnings  What Airlines Should Expect In Upcoming Earnings,opinion,"Delta Earnings
Q1 earnings season is on its way and Delta   NYSE DAL   is kicking it off for the airlines  This morning DAL posted earnings of  0 96 per share  11 6  higher than expected and a 28  increase year over year  DAL opened up 3  from yesterday but has traded down since and is now sitting at a 1  gain  Delta Air s CEO Ed Bastian expresses positive forward looking sentiment  saying that  with the momentum in our business and our American Express  NYSE AXP  contract renewal  we have increased confidence in achieving our full year plan of top line growth  margin expansion and double digit earnings growth  
Delta saw margin expansion in Q1 with a 0 2  decrease in cost per available seat mile excluding fuel  CASM Ex  as well as adjusted top line growth of 7 5  demonstrating both customer loyalty growth and continuous improvement in operational excellence 
Delta is the largest airline in the world by market cap  competing with American Airlines   NASDAQ AAL   for most market share  This airline operates in more than 50 countries taking passengers to over 300 destinations and serving nearly 200 million people annually 
DAL s earnings sets the tone for the rest of the Airlines earnings releases later this month  Competing airline stocks have tracked DAL this morning  opening high  breaking down  and now regaining momentum  American Airlines is up over 1  this morning and JetBlue Airways   NASDAQ JBLU    a smaller player in the space  saw gains of over 3  in this morning s trading 
Delta Trade
The cyclicality of airline stock makes them a useful asset to trade if you can read the markets  You can see the DAL 1 year chart illustrating relatively strong support in the upper  40s and a resistance around  60  These levels will likely increase as the company continues to grow and expand its market share  Keep an eye on oil prices as they have a direct inverse correlation with airline stocks considering it s a substantial variable cost  I would consider buying DAL as it comes closer to  50 and average down until a trough is hit then ride the wave right back up to  60  if fundamentals don t change

161462,382978,AXP,Panel proposes  India only  policy for critical data,news,"By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI  Reuters    All critical personal data on people in India should be processed within the country  a government panel said on Friday 
The recommendation comes at a time when data breaches are becoming common globally and there is heightened scrutiny by governments on how companies handle user data 
The panel  headed by former Supreme Court judge B N  Srikrishna  also presented a draft bill that will go before parliament designed to enhance data protection  The legislation could affect how global companies store data in India 
The panel said  personal data determined to be critical  will be subject to the requirement of being processed  only in India   according to its 213 page report released on Friday 
 The central government should determine categories of sensitive personal data which are critical to the nation   the panel said  adding that there will be a prohibition against cross border transfer of such data 
The panel recommendations were keenly awaited by U S  trade groups and global technology companies  who fear any stringent data localization directive by the government could alter their business models and raise costs 
Nehaa Chaudhari  a technology policy expert at Indian law firm TRA  said the recommendation was strong as it showed the government wanted to see some kind of data localized 
 They seem to be conscious of the threat of data breaches   Chaudhari said   The devil here is the detail  we will need to know what is critical personal data  
U S  trade groups  representing companies such as Visa  Mastercard and  American Express   NYSE AXP   have been protesting against an Indian central bank directive which said in April that all payments data should be stored locally within six months 
Asked about how financial data should be stored  Srikrishna said at a press briefing that the Reserve Bank had  jumped the gun   adding that a new data protection law will  override  all other notifications and regulations on data storage 
The government panel also recommended setting up a  data protection authority   an agency which would look at enforcement and implementation of the new data protection law 
India has in recent months become increasingly conscious of the risk of data breaches 
The government on Thursday said it had asked its federal police to probe misuse of Facebook  NASDAQ FB  user data by Cambridge Analytica  a political consultancy which was earlier this year accused of improperly using data of 87 million Facebook users 
 It is suspected that Cambridge Analytica may have been involved in illegally obtaining data of Indians which could be misused   the IT minister said ",2018-07-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/personal-critical-data-should-be-processed-only-in-india--government-panel-1548650,1548650
161463,382979,AXP, USPTO Reveals Blockchain Related Patent Applications from Accenture  MasterCard ,news,"The United State Patent and Trademark Office  USPTO  presented on Thursday several blockchain related patent applications  including potential inventions coming from Mastercard and Accenture 
Accenture
Professional services firm Accenture  to implement distributed ledger technology  DLT   another name for blockchain  to automate and secure shipping processes  When a product has to be shipped to a destination  blockchain can be used to store data regarding its aspects  such as origin  chemical identity  and other attributes  Thus  one or more devices can analyze blockchain data at the destination or at any point during the shipping process to identify and determine the item 
The sensor device which is used to collect data from blockchain  may be related to a spectrometer  whether it s an infrared  ultraviolet  or a mass spectrometer   a camera  a RFID reader  a barcode reader  a QR reader  a DNA analyzer or any similar type of device that is capable of analyzing certain attributes of the shipped products  In some cases  the device can be attached to a robot or an unmanned aerial vehicle  UAV   The devices used in the network would check the integrity and state of the products 
The patent application  titled  secure product identification and verification   was initially filed on January 24  2017 

Mastercard
Payments giant MasterCard intends to leverage the technology for the use of digital signatures for signing blockchain transactions  As the  description explains  many blockchains rely on extensive computation power when adding new blocks  As the network grows and more participants are attracted in  blockchains may lead to more energy waste  To avoid this  a blockchain network can rely on signatures by trusted participants who can validate new blocks  Mastercard proposes a trusted pool of participants and digital signatures to ensure that the new blocks are reliable and secure 
In reality  a similar approach already exists in many blockchains  though probably not using digital signatures  For example  the Delegated Proof of Stake  DPOS  algorithm  such as the one used by EOS and other blockchains  doesn t waste so much energy and computational power  and it operates with a pool of block validators 
MasterCard filed the patent application on March 26  2018  The patent is titled  method and system blockchain variant using digital signatures  

Tech giant  IBM   NYSE IBM  is on the list again  At this time  the US based company wants to use blockchain for  decentralized computing with auditability and taxability  
Besides the patent applications described above  the USPTO published two more relevant patents  from IBM and  American Express   NYSE AXP   Amex   which don t use DLT as the core technology but which propose blockchain as one of the methods to store data 
IBM filed a patent application on January 24  2017  for its  decentralized computing with auditability and taxability  
IBM is one of the most active blockchain adopters and promoters  This month  the USPTO  six blockchain related patent applications from IBM in one week 
Amex filed its application on January 23  2017  for a  system and method for dynamic scaling of concurrent processing threads  
Last week  we  that Amex was awarded a patent for a payment system that uses a blockchain based proof of payment ",2018-07-27,Cryptovest,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/uspto-reveals-blockchainrelated-patent-applications-from-accenture-mastercard-1549486,1549486

161490,383006,AXP,Chainlink Price Prediction,opinion,"Thinking of investing in Chainlink in March 2019  Here is our honest price prediction and forecast 
Among cryptocurrencies this year  Chainlink  LINK BTC  has displayed relative stability and even growth  While the token has not continued its early climb  it continues to show relative support in the  0 40 range  This is indicative of the strong support structure and fundamental value proposition that have made Chainlink a stable token through 2018  In spite of these bullish indicators  the overall crypto market remains bearish  For this reason  our short term prediction for LINK is stability based  However  in the long term  we see LINK as a bullish token   with a five year prediction of  5 or more 
Chainlink  LINK  is one of the relatively stable survivors of both the 2017 initial coin offering  ICO  boom and the 2018 cryptocurrency bear market  It is a blockchain platform providing payment and transactional middleware between on chain and off chain finance operations 
The platform has been performing well in the past months  Q1 2019 has brought stable market performance for the LINK token  LINK currently stands at 34th on Coinmarketcap  The LINK token is trading at  0 42  down from 2019 highs in January of over  0 55 
The Chainlink node network was created in 2015  LINK tokens first went public in a 2017 initial coin offering  ICO   The network is a decentralized oracle platform built to collect and verify data from both blockchain and legacy systems  In this way  Chainlink bridges the gap between digital currency and traditional fiat currency needs 
There is considerable competition from multiple similar blockchain oracle platforms seeking to connect traditional  real world financial data with blockchain technology  However  in spite of this competition  Chainlink has thrived and continued to build on its robust Oracle  NYSE ORCL  concept 
A mainnet launch is pending  CEO Sergey Nazarov and the Chainlink team have built a reputation of transparency and reliability through hard work and solid product offerings  While the mainnet launch is eagerly anticipated  it is believed that it will not happen until the team is confident that all bugs and issues have been satisfactorily solved 
The LINK token is traded on major cryptocurrency exchanges  including Binance  Bitthumb  Bittrue  CoinBene  Huobi  Mercatox  and OKEx  Its major trading pairs are Bitcoin  BTC   Ethereum  ETH   Tether  USDT   and Ripple  XRP   Approximately  10 million USD in LINK tokens is currently traded each day  They currently trade around  0 42 USD 
While the platform is solid  the general market is not  For that reason  we expect the LINK token to remain relatively stable through the course of 2019   with little change above the current  0 45 price range 
Fundamental Analysis
The fundamentals of LINK revolve around Chainlink s blockchain agnostic interoperability solution  In stark contrast to its major competitors  which rely on parent and child chains or sidechains  Chainlink utilizes oracles as agents to verify and aggregate data  This data is then recorded via smart contracts onto the blockchain 
The oracle concept is built on reputation  order matching  and aggregation  Reputation develops as transitions are processed  This can include gathering data  presenting data  and recording and verifying data amongst oracles  Types of data include account balances  purchases  market information  and poll results 
The concept has been given veracity through extensive enterprise buy in  The biggest partner to date is the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication  SWIFT   SWIFT verifies account balances for retail card purchases  In other words  it approves or denies card transactions at the time of card swipe 
SWIFT offers Chainlink affiliation by association with major credit cards such as Visa  NYSE V   Mastercard  NYSE MA   and American Express  NYSE AXP   However  Chainlink is also affiliated with other enterprise partners  These include several blockchain projects  including Request Network and Zepelin os 
Partnerships such as these are the key to Chainlink s continued market growth 
Technical Analysis
The past 12 18 months have been a time of great turmoil for the cryptocurrency market  After a short but steep growth trajectory  cryptocurrency hit unprecedented all time highs in January 2018  Unfortunately  the market has been mostly moving downhill from there 
After launching an ICO in September 2017  LINK followed this pattern   with one notable exception  While other tokens have either stabilized or continued to decline in value over the past three to four months  the performance of LINK has been very positive  The token even briefly landed in the top 30 on CoinMarketCap in January 2019  It currently sits at 34th  which is still a respectable rank 
LINK  an ERC20 token  has a total supply of one billion tokens  Currently  about 350 million are in circulation  The market cap is close to  150 million  with a  2 9 million 24 hour volume 
While it did lose value through the 2018 bear market  LINK currently sits at around  0 42  This is close to 40 percent of its ATH price of  1 38 and is indicative of positive future performance 

Specialists  Perspective
Most experts agree that interoperability with traditional fiat money systems and real world networks is the key to all future blockchain success  Projects such as Chainlink speak directly to this theory 
Analysts such as those at CryptoCoinSpy noted the plethora of official partnership announcements coming from Chainlink in Q4 2018  These partnerships include bZx  Hydrogen  Kaiko  Kaleido  Morpheus Network  TownCrier  and Wanchain 
While this abundance of partnerships has clearly bolstered the market position of Chainlink in the short term  what it has done for the company s long term goals is even more important  Chainlink already has a reputation for an authentic  practical  tech focused approach to its blockchain project  Continued enterprise adoption serves to strengthen that market opinion and bring Chainlink closer to fulfilling the goal of blockchain and fiat interoperability 
Another major Chainlink strong point that experts appreciate is its agnostic approach to blockchain networks  While LINK is its proprietary token  Chainlink is designed to integrate seamlessly with any sort of data   financial or otherwise  InvestInBlockchain notes that the LINK token is highly functional  offering the ability to pay node operator fees  format data  engage in computation and guarantee uptime 
While it currently resides live on the Ethereum test site Ropsten  the mainnet launch is imminent  Project progress can be monitored on Github and Glitter 
Chainlink s biggest strength could be its team  Led by respected blockchain thought leader Sergey Nazarov  Chainlink is known for a team that encompasses knowledge and careful execution  This is in stark contrast to some of its competitors  with projects built on hype and fantastical promises 
With these fundamentals in place  specialists see positive growth for LINK   both in the long and short term 
Chainlink Price Prediction 2019
Chainlink  LINK  prices are forecast by some experts to reach as high as  0 75 in 2019  with lows potentially going down to  0 30 USD according to TradingBeasts and WalletInvestor  Given the fact that the LINK token is already surpassing 2019 Q1 expectations  however  a lot could change   and the coin could increase in value even higher than expected  CoinFan predicts a 2019 price of  3 18 
Analysts at CaptainAltcoin suggest that  with 2019 potentially being heavily focused on oracles  anything is possible  Specialists appreciate the fact that LINK maintains relevance and is continuing to show both short term and long term growth patterns 
While the state of the cryptocurrency market over the next year is incredibly uncertain with the volatility investors have come to expect from cryptocurrencies  it is clear that Chainlink offers a solid concept and product  This product comes from a team of programmers and developers who are committed to realizing their expectations and producing the strongest possible iteration of their platform 
While a number of experts predict substantial growth  we are not as bullish  The coin represents real world solutions  At the same time  the overall market remains bearish  This is proven by the declines from early highs already in Q1  For that reason  we see LINK remaining stable at  0 45 throughout the year 
Chainlink Price Prediction 2020
Chainlink  LINK  is expected to do well in 2020  Prices could hit as high as  1 50 in 2020  The pending mainnet launch will strengthen its market position tremendously  As this launch is anticipated to take place in 2019  positive ramifications will certainly take effect by 2020  This could move its rank higher on CoinMarketCap  potentially hitting the top 20  or even the top 10  cryptocurrencies 
Continued rapid adoption and affiliations with major enterprise partners will also drive market performance in 2020  The Chainlink concept is expected to continue to grow in relevance as blockchain technology permeates traditional business models   offering value and flexibility to fiat based business entities 
An extended bear market could mean lower performance in 2020  with worst case prices around  0 50  LINK does not appear to follow typical market trends  however  The LINK token may escape the volatility of the overall market and begin its own price corrections over the next few years 
Chainlink Price Prediction 5 years
Five year price predictions for Chainlink  LINK  are also positive  It may be considered a strong long term investment and may see prices increase by as much as 10 times or more in the years to come  This would put prices at  5 by 2023 
With a strong team of developers and programmers who are clearly committed to delivering a top quality product to stakeholders  the future is bright for Chainlink  Blockchain technology value is increasing and adoption is exploding  Any blockchain company that can continue to produce and deliver in alignment with customer expectations will see continued success   regardless of overall market status 
For these reasons  we at BeInCrypto are bullish long term on the LINK token  In spite of the many challenges facing blockchain and cryptocurrency adoption and growth  LINK s value proposition should continue to deliver results 
Our Prediction
At BeInCrypto  our price predictions are based on realistic  evidence based cryptocurrency analysis practices  We value transparency and honesty in our forecasts  As such  our prediction for ChainLink  LINK  is that it will remain stable at or around the  0 45 range in the year 2019 
LINK has demonstrated solid performance in the first two months of 2019  The token has exceeded most expectations and forecasts  We believe this is due to the commitment of the Chainlink team to building a high quality and lasting product that is both consistent and flexible  We appreciate the team s ability to restructure its roadmap and timelines according to market needs in the rapidly changing blockchain technology space 
While the entire company had a relatively quiet 2018  Q4 brought the news that   unlike other blockchain platforms that have focused on media exposure and a strong marketing platform at the expense of a solid product   Chainlink is truly committed to its business model and to meeting the needs for interoperability in the blockchain space 

Nevertheless  investors should always do their own research and tread lightly before investing in cryptocurrency  All cryptocurrencies  including Bitcoin  BTC   are extremely volatile  Never invest more than you can afford to lose and be prepared to lose everything

161559,383075,AXP,American Express  AXP  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when American Express  AXP  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 17  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This credit card issuer and global payments company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 79 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  13 3  
Revenues are expected to be  10 60 billion  up 19 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 14  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for American Express 
For American Express  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 78  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that American Express will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that American Express would post earnings of  1 78 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 88  delivering a surprise of  5 62  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
American Express appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/american-express-axp-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200374522,200374522

161563,383079,AXP,Exclusive  India resists lobbying by U S  payment firms to ease local data storage rules,news,"By Aditi Shah  Aditya Kalra and Sumeet Chatterjee NEW DELHI HONG KONG  Reuters    India s central bank is standing firm on a directive to compel global payment firms to store customer data in India  resisting calls from U S  companies to dilute an order they say would cost them millions of dollars  people familiar with the matter said  The payment companies are worried India s data on shoring move could set a precedent and nudge other major governments to implement similar rules at a time when there is heightened scrutiny on how companies globally handle their customers  data  The industry s tussle with the Reserve Bank of India  RBI  also comes as Prime Minster Narendra Modi aggressively pushes digital and cashless modes of payment that leave an electronic trail as part of a campaign to crack down on the black economy  While Modi s administration is working on a separate data protection law  foreign companies were caught off guard in April by the RBI s one page directive that said all payments data should within six months be stored only in the country for  unfettered supervisory access   The RBI said storing data locally would help  ensure better monitoring   A joint lobbying effort by  American Express  Co  N AXP   Mastercard Inc  N MA  and  Visa Inc   N V  to dilute or reverse the directive has failed to shift the central bank s position  with the RBI telling the firms in a meeting this month to comply  not complain  sources with direct knowledge told Reuters  The RBI declined to comment  but a government source with direct knowledge confirmed the central bank was  unlikely to back down on its plans   INVESTMENT PLANS The card companies are nervous that the move will disrupt their investment plans  as millions of dollars are diverted from other projects in a scramble to open local data centers within six months        There is a feeling of helplessness and we will have to comply   said a source with direct knowledge of the meetings  The RBI s insistence that payments data be stored  only in India  would hamper global fraud detection and the companies should be allowed to keep a back up  the sources said  The government source disagreed   The suggestion that you need a disaster management back up center overseas just does not cut it   said the source  who declined to be identified   This is not a small island nation that would get entirely crippled by a single natural disaster   Mastercard said it was working with the industry to engage the RBI  to understand their need for access to domestic data and work towards a solution that meets the regulatory requirements  in line with global norms  Visa declined to comment  while American Express did not respond to a request for comment  The move would not impact local players such as Softbank Group backed  T 9984  Indian digital payments firm Paytm  as well as homegrown card payment network RuPay  which competes with the likes of Visa and Mastercard  as they already store their data in India   ONLY IN INDIA  The industry says India s proposed data storage rules would be among the world s most restrictive  China also tightened cyber regulation in the past year  formalizing new rules that require firms to store data locally  None of the global payment card companies  however  operate in the Chinese domestic market yet  Countries such as Russia and Indonesia also have an onshore data storage requirement  but they do not restrict companies from transfer of transactions data offshore as well  according to lobby group U S  India Business Council  USIBC   which counts the three U S  card companies among its members  Global payment firms currently store and process Indian transactions outside the country and a major concern to the industry is a clause in the RBI s order that asks for data to be stored  only in India   two sources said  That  according to the industry  would restrict the transfer of data needed to effectively detect and analyze global fraud patterns  and make India more vulnerable to financial crime  In a letter dated May 3  seen by Reuters  the USIBC pressed the RBI for a  reversal or an indefinite stay  of its directive  which it said would make India s payments ecosystem more prone to cyber attacks   It also urged the RBI to remove any restriction on transferring the data outside India and specify the time period for which the data needed to be stored locally  An industry executive at a U S  payments firm said while the RBI was likely to soon issue clarifications to address some of their concerns  but it would not change the notification s implementation date   In an earnings call last month  Visa CEO Alfred Kelly Jr  referred to the RBI s six month deadline as a  tough timeframe   The directive comes as more people in India are switching to plastic money  partly driven by the Modi s decision to replace high value currency notes in November 2016  since when the government has aggressively discouraged cash transactions   In March  Indians clocked transactions worth  52 billion using their 900 million credit and debit cards  nearly double the amount recorded in November 2016  data from the RBI showed  But fraud is a concern too  The RBI recorded 57 411 cases of card fraud totaling  43 million in the three years to December 2017  according to a Right to Information response seen by Reuters

This credit card issuer and global payments company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 3 08  
For the most recent quarter  American Express was expected to post earnings of  1 78 per share  but it reported  1 88 per share instead  representing a surprise of 5 62   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 83 per share  while it actually produced  1 84 per share  a surprise of 0 55

For American Express  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven

Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value

161670,383186,AXP,Summer Sleeper Hit  Trade Deal Stock Records In Strong Market,opinion," Tuesday Market Open  The U S  equity market may be this year s summer sleeper hit  If you re like many summertime investors  having spent some time away from the hustle and bustle  you might be surprised to see that  amid the geopolitical tensions  trade worries  and interest rate uncertainty  the market has been steadily knocking out solid gains  And now we find ourselves once again in record territory 
Enthusiasm about a trade deal between the United States and Mexico seemed to spill over into a second day Tuesday  a day after news of an agreement appeared to lessen worries over the administration s trade policies 
Recently  trade disputes between the U S  and key trading partners have apparently caused some investors to worry about the pace of global economic growth  While it still remains to be seen how the issues could work out between the U S  and China  the European Union and Canada  enthusiasm about the Mexico deal appeared to help stocks on Monday 
Index Roundup
All three major U S indices ended in the green Monday  with the S P 500  SPX  and NASDAQ Composite  COMP  closing at records  The tech heavy COMP traded above 8 000 for the first time  According to the Wall Street Journal  it took the COMP a little less than eight months to rally from the 7 000 mark  making the 1 000 point sprint the fastest since the index went from 4 000 to 5 000 near the height of the dot com era 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  outperformed the other two indices  perhaps because of its concentration of large multinational blue chips that are more sensitive to international trade issues than domestic small cap stocks  DJI has been lagging the other two indices  with market experts blaming trade as a factor 
Risk Appetite Rises
With the trade news seeming to blunt some worries Monday  the dollar fell against a basket of currencies and the yield on U S  Treasuries rose  Both are often considered haven investments and demand can fall in times when investors are more optimistic   Treasury yields move opposite to their prices   While the Cboe Volatility Index  VIX   often considered the market s fear index  rose  it still finished at a relatively subdued level just over 12  see figure 1 below  
The bullish sentiment on the U S  Mexico trade front comes on the heels of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell s comments in Jackson Hole on Friday  The market seemed to interpret them as dovish  especially a bit about him not seeing much risk of the economy  overheating  as far as inflation goes 

FIGURE 1  RISK OFF AGAIN  As equity markets march higher amid the cooling of trade tensions and dovish talk on the economy  the Cboe Volatility Index  VIX  has pulled back to 12 from a high near 17 two weeks ago  But it s worth noting that the index got down to 10 just prior to the last market scare  when tensions in Turkey dominated the headlines  Data source  Cboe Global Markets  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results  
Consumers Swiping  Over the last year  the financial sector of the S P 500 has only trailed the broader index just a bit  with the sector up 14 1  and the index up 17 62   While financial stocks aren t the best performing sector  they re not the worst either  But there s one segment of the sector that has markedly outperformed the wider index credit card companies  Over the same time period  American Express Company  NYSE AXP  is up more than 25   Visa  NYSE V  is up more than 40   and Mastercard  NYSE MA  is up nearly 60   One reason for the divergence could be that banks appear to have been weighed down by a flattening yield curve  At the same time  recent data and company earnings reports appear to be showing that the U S  consumer is healthy  indicating shoppers may be swiping those cards 
Utilities Cool Off  With the stock market reaching new highs  it s perhaps not surprising that some defensive sectors are doing poorly  Investors often buy into these sectors when they re worried about an economic downturn because people will still need to buy things like toothpaste and electricity regardless of what the economy is doing  So  when investors are more confident about economic growth and the rise in share prices that can come with it for some sectors  they tend to eschew defensive sectors  On Monday  utilities was the worst performing sector in the S P 500  losing 0 64   The sector is down 2 27  over the past year  while the wider index is up more than 17   Another apparent headwind for utilities on Monday was the rise in Treasury yields  Dividend paying utilities often compete with fixed income as investors seek yield 
GDP Data on Tap  The government gets another crack at gross domestic product on Wednesday with its second estimate for Q2 GDP  Investors tend to keep a close eye on GDP reports  as they can give insight into the pace of economic growth  or contraction  and shed light on the state of inflation  if there is any   That s the idea behind the government s GDP estimates in general  More specifically  the report this week is expected to show annualized GDP growth of 4   according to a consensus of economists polled by Briefing com  That would be a slight revision down from the last estimate of 4 1   A surprise revision any lower has the potential to weigh on the markets because it would take the estimate below the 4  threshold  which could be a psychologically important level

161713,383229,AXP,3 Payment Stocks To Gain On A Rise In Retail Spending,opinion,Retail sales increased in April  driven by wage growth  increased financial flexibility owing to the recent tax reform and a record low unemployment rate Details from Commerce Department revealed that retail sales improved 4 7  in April  This was driven by an increase in receipts at gasoline stations as well as sales at clothing   clothing accessories  furniture and home furnishing  food and beverage stores  and building material  This was the second straight month of increase in sales after muted  performance in January and February  which was basically driven by the halt in spending by consumers due to a delay in tax refunds Nevertheless  the recent positive sales trend is expected to continue as consumer confidence stays strong  amid a thriving U S  economy      These developments bode well for the payment and network processors  with digital transformation in shopping and increase in usage of cards for making payments for purchases  Revenue growth for companies in this industry is directly proportional to the level of consumer spending  Therefore it makes good sense to invest in stocks from this space Let us look at some of the factors which would act as catalysts to for the industry s growth Strong Consumer ConfidenceThe Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index  which measures consumers  attitude to current and short term economic conditions  next six months   rose in April  following a decline in March  The index now stands at 128 7  up from 127 0 in March What underlies the surge in the index is consumers  belief that the cadence of growth witnessed recently will continue  This has led consumers to use their savings to make purchases  This surely is a welcome sign for payment and network  which are the end beneficiaries of rising consumer spending and confidence Higher Gasoline Prices to Increase Spending on CardsProduction cuts by OPEC  elevated demand and geo political tensions fueled an increase in the price of oil  Gasoline prices are expected to remain at elevated levels now that President Trump has withdrawn the United States from the Iran nuclear deal and imposed tougher sanctions on Theran Payment processors and card companies like Visa  Mastercard  American Express  NYSE AXP  gain on an increase in gasoline prices because of the higher transaction amount spent each time the card is swiped  Moreover Visa Inc    NYSE V    Mastercard  American Express branded cards provides rewards in the form of rebates to the card holders on gas purchases  thus defraying a part of their oil bill  Owing to the lucrative rebates these cards are greatly used at pumping stations  which in turn increases the business volume for card companies  processers and payment networks Since oil price is set to move northward  we expect the trend to continue to favor the stocks in this space Upside From Tax ReformThe Tax Cut and Jobs Act should be a positive for the financial services industry  A reduction in the tax rate has provided businesses with an increased capacity to invest  and consumers will have more disposable income to splurge on purchases Corporations are making several focused investments that build on their long standing commitment to strengthen their business  support its people  while continuing to provide strong capital returns to its shareholders One of the industry leaders Mastercard Inc  has on its agenda additional investments in its center for inclusive growth  which it launched back in 2014 as a way to focus its data  expertise  technology and philosophic investments to support inclusive growth  Visa has plans to make strategic investments in the areas of digital products  technology operations and merchant solutions Network and Payment Processors Set to GainA thriving economy is favoring the payment and the network processors Visa in its fiscal second quarter disclosed that its payments volume on a constant dollar basis grew 11   driven by a strong global economy  U S  payments volume grew led by strength across retail and every day spend segments as well as continued strong growth in travel categories Another major company  Mastercard  said that it is witnessing overall growth from low employment  healthy consumer confidence and strong retail spending  Its U S  Gross Dollar Volume  GDV    which measures the aggregate amount of purchases made with Mastercard s branded cards  grew 10   up 1  from last quarter  and was made up of Credit and Debit growth of 9  and 12   respectively The  has indeed put up a good show rising 38  in a year s time more than double the S P 500 index growth of 17  Some Attractive Stocks in This SpaceGiven the strong macro backdrop  investing in this space should yield attractive returns   Based on certain parameters  we have zeroed in on three stocks with a Zacks Rank 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   These stocks have seen an upward revision in earnings

US futures are pointing to a third session in the green for equity markets on Wednesday  extending the good run which has come on the back of a slightly less volatile geopolitical environment

Dow  US30  Daily Chart

Attention will once again be on first quarter earnings season today with another 10 S P 500 companies reporting  including Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  and American Express  NYSE AXP   We ll also hear from the Bank of Canada which is expected to leave interest rates on hold  having only raised them to 1 25  in January  With inflation picking up though and unemployment at pre financial crisis lows  it s unlikely that they ll remain unchanged for too long  even if growth has slowed over the last few quarters 
UK Inflation Drop Poses a Challenge For BoE
The UK inflation data this morning may have thrown a spanner in the works for the Bank of England  which has for months been preparing markets for an interest rate hike  most likely in May  The central bank has long highlighted the above target inflation as a concern that requires a rate hike in order to bring it back towards target  despite the fact that it was primarily driven by a one time currency depreciation  more than half of which has since been reversed 
UK Inflation

Just as it looked as though everything was falling into line for a rate hike   43 year low in unemployment  record high employment  wages rising and inflation well above target   the data today has cast a shadow of doubt over it  If inflation is naturally trending back towards target  wage growth is only moderate and Brexit is causing uncertainty for the economic outlook of the UK  can the central bank afford to wait until later in the year before hiking 
While I think that would make sense  I wonder whether policy makers will feel somewhat compelled to raise in May having spent so long hinting at doing so and will compensate for this by stressing that another this year is unlikely  The inflation numbers today were well below expectations and represented another decline after peaking in November but that are still above target which may afford the MPC the ability to hike while still expressing concern about price pressures and the lack of slack in the labour market 
Eurozone Inflation Data Unlikely to Prevent QE End This Year
Inflation in the eurozone also fell short of expectations this morning  causing another headache for the European Central Bank as it approaches the end of quantitative easing  The program currently expires in September and could end altogether then or be extended for another short period at a reduced rate as policy makers respond to an improved economic environment by removing the exceptional policy tools that have been used in recent years

161759,383275,AXP,Should Investors Avoid American Express  AXP  Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,"Shares of American Express   NYSE AXP   climbed on Monday in a sign that investors might be anticipating strong first quarter earnings  So let s take a quick look to see what investors should expect from American Express when the company reports its Q1 financial results on Wednesday 
American Express has seen its stock price sink roughly 7  over the last 12 weeks  But first quarter earnings season could very well help AXP recover from its recent downturn  especially if the company performs well   
Earnings season often provides investors the chance to look for stocks that are set to top earnings estimates and sometimes  more importantly  stay away from stocks that look poised to fall short of expectations  American Express follows JPMorgan   NYSE JPM    Citigroup   NYSE C    Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    and other financial services firms that recently released their Q1 earnings results  which means that many investors have already gotten in a bit of an earnings season groove 
Q1 Outlook
American Express  Q1 revenues are projected to surge by 15 3  to reach  9 1 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates 
Meanwhile  American Express  quarterly earnings are expected to soar over 29 1  to  1 73 per share  Investors should also note that American Express has earned one downward earnings estimate revision within the last seven days 
However  this still doesn t give investors any idea if American Express is actually projected to top our current earnings estimate  Luckily  Zacks Premium customers can utilize the  in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise 
This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
In contrast  a stock with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or worse  coupled with a negative Earnings ESP  is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season 
American Express is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and sports an Earnings ESP of  4 67   The credit card company s Most Accurate Estimate for Q1 is  1 65 per share  which comes in 8 cents below our current consensus estimate  This means that the most recent estimates have come in lower directly ahead of earnings 
With that said  investors should consider American Express a stock that could fall short of Q1 earnings estimates 
AXP is expected to report its first quarter financial results after market close on Wednesday  April 18

There was  however  the largest increase in loss provisions since 2010  notes  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  s Betsy Graseck  and what that might say about future credit trends  Helping the quarter was a surprisingly large boost to net interest margin  but Graseck wonders how sustainable that might be 
Piper s Jason Deleeuw also takes note of the big jump in loss provisions 
Both Deleeuw and Graseck rate the stock at Neutral 
Bearish Jason Arnold from RBC calls the Q3 beat  low quality   noting a drop in the tax rate helped offset the loss provisions  The possible exit of Chenault had been viewed by some at a positive catalyst  but his successor  a 32 year AmEx veteran  suggests status quo  Arnold stays at Underperform 
Bullish Kevin St  Pierre from Bernstein says Squeri was widely expected to be the next CEO  though the move may have come earlier than expected  He s at Outperform with  107 price target

161781,383297,AXP,Bitcoin Or Ripple Both Are Demanding Digital Currency In Future,opinion,"The buzz surrounding bitcoin has been off the charts  and for good reason  The cryptocurrency has become a staple of virtually every news report  Analysts are jumping for opportunities to give their 2 bits on the future   positive or negative   of the world s most popular block chain cryptocurrency 
But  I think there s something even more fascinating hiding in the shadow of bitcoin  Ripple  In the past month  Ripple s XRP market cap doubled from  9 billion to more than  18 billion  Why is it so hot 
Ripple Changes the Way All Currency Transfers Are Processed
Ripple does something even more earth shattering than bitcoin  it revolutionizes the way currency is exchanged around the world  Instead of waiting 3 5 business days for traditional banks to process a transfer  or 4 hours for a bitcoin transfer to process  Ripple s XRP is transferred virtually instantaneously 
And it doesn t just revolutionize cryptocurrency  Ripple is a secure  block chain based platform that is supported by a team of experienced financial professionals  including Chris Larsen  the co found of E Loan  The team have inked deals with Moneygram Int  NASDAQ MGI   United Bankshares Inc  NASDAQ UBSI   American Express  NYSE AXP   RBC and Santander  MC SAN   just to name a few   helps to explain the concept in a way that doesn t require a fintech degree  To be honest  the changes it makes are very long overdue  And the most powerful aspect for traditional financial institutions  beyond the speed of the transfer  is the fact that personal customer information is never disclosed to the Ripple platform 
This is important  because financial security breaches have wreaked billions of dollars in havoc on our financial system  Consumers don t want to expand their risk  But everyone wants to get access to their money faster Ripple s Leadership Team Works Closely with Federal Regulators
Another reason Ripple is fascinating is their cooperation with the U S  Federal Reserve  While bitcoin s biggest supporters try to outfox federal and international monetary regulations  Ripple s team are active members of multiple U S  Fed taskforces designed to improve international money transfer speed  security and transparency 
How the U S  government plans to regulate cryptocurrencies is still up in that air  But there are more than a few funny headlines while we wait in limbo  For example  the U S  Attorney s office in Utah wants to cash out seized assets in a recent drug case   property seizure is a staple of combating the war on drugs   that an accused drug trafficker used the dark web to sell fentanyl pills  The accused had millions of dollars stuffed in trash bags  which were seized  But  to protect the anonymity of all those involved in the criminal conspiracy  payments to the drug kingpin were made using bitcoin 
The U S  government understands the value of bitcoin  and while they still aren t sure how to regulate it  they are more than willing to engage in commerce  The U S  Attorneys in Utah want to immediately liquidate their new stash of bitcoin while the exchange rates are favorable   worth as much as  8 5 million  There s a long history of US law enforcement seizing bitcoin from criminals and then selling it to fund further law enforcement efforts Bitcoin Is a Risky Investment  Ripple s XRP Could Be a Safer Bet 

According to unblock net  Only the future will tell whether cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ripple are treated as an asset or a currency by the IRS  But one thing s for sure  everyone is looking to cash in on the explosion in cryptocurrency  

I personally believe that bitcoin will implode within the coming years  leaving Ripple s XRP as the strongest contender for status as a federally approved digital currency  Why  First  just 1 000 people control over 40  of the bitcoin currently in existence  To me  this screams pump and dump   think Wolf of Wall Street  No  seriously    the basis for the hit movie  views bitcoin as a financial scam that will make money for those that get out at the right time  but will leave everyone else holding a virtual wallet full of low value currency 
There s also a concern around the team behind bitcoin  It s completely anonymous  with rumors swirling about who the founder of the currency may be 
Ripple s strong corporate governance  with experienced industry innovators  should help ensure that XRP stands the test of time  And their money transfer platform will continue to revolutionize the way financial institutions process currency transfers on behalf of customers 
Disclaimer  I do not personally own XRP  I have zero vested interest in any of the topics discussed in this article  As a passionate self made entrepreneur  I enjoy giving back by offering insight to those building their own ladder to financial independence  I hope that the issues discussed in this article help others make wise financial choices that empower them to achieve their goals in life ",2018-03-27,Faizan Raza,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-or-ripple-both-are-demanding-digital-currency-in-future-200300957,200300957

This graph from  shows the USD amount being sent daily for BTC and BCH  As we can clearly see the original bitcoin is being used to transfer much more value 

And though Bitcoin s average transaction fee has come down a long way off the peak of  55  those of BCH barely even register in comparison 

As far as price is concerned Bitcoin s superior market share does translate into a greater valuation  In US Dollar terms  BCH is now just about where it was when it first started trading  just under  700 per coin 

However in BTC terms  BCH does seem to be dropping in value  especially since the market peak on December 20th  since then the original bitcoin has been acting as a safe haven store of value for the entire crypto market 

When Two Fight the Third Gains
The clear winner here is Litecoin 
LTC rose 5  in the last 24 hours making it the biggest gainer in the top 10 cryptos  The announcement that a digital wallet backed by American Express  NYSE AXP  will be using Litecoin rather than Bitcoin based smart contracts is already several days old 
What does seem to have given the price a boost was the  about why the company went with LTC instead of the original blockchain 
On the chart  Litecoin is using the price of  110 per coin as a solid support  We can see a welcome push off this level both on March 30th and again on April 1st  Let s hope this momentum builds across the market 

Many thanks for all the awesome feedback  I m right here if you need anything further

161810,383326,AXP,Sharapova back in business on and off court,news,"By Steve Keating NEW YORK  Reuters    Maria Sharapova s outfit sparkled even if her play sometimes didn t during her grand slam return at the U S  Open but the former world number one s run to the fourth round showed she is back in business on and off the court  Playing her first grand slam since returning from a 15 month doping ban  Sharapova proved a polarizing presence at Flushing Meadows  feted by adoring fans but vilified in the small corners of the players  locker room  For television rights holders and the United States Tennis Association  USTA   seeing Sharapova s name on the entry list was akin to winning the lottery  guaranteeing a bump in ratings and capacity crowds at the 23 000 seat Arthur Ashe Stadium  With the tournament ravaged by injuries and withdrawals  the Russian s return provided a splash of glitz and glamour  She strolled onto floodlit Arthur Ashe as if on a catwalk  wearing a jet black dress that sparkled with Swarovski crystals for her opening match against Simona Halep and duly dumped the second seed out of the tournament   Sharapova s U S  Open ended with a 5 7 6 4 6 2 loss to Latvian Anastasija Sevastova on Sunday  but her week long run will help polish the Russian s tarnished brand   Sharapova s doping transgression was not terribly egregious  neither performance enhancing nor intentional  and her ban seemed unduly harsh   Bob Dorfman of Baker Street Advertising told Reuters   I suspect that s why  Nike   NYSE NKE  suspended their relationship  but did not drop her    And with their number one endorser Serena Williams off the court indefinitely  expecting her first child  Sharapova s first grand slam event since her return is a grand opportunity for Nike to capitalize on America s love for comeback performances   Not everyone at Flushing Meadows was enamored with the comeback  While the fans welcomed her with open arms and standing ovations  there was a chill among a group of players who believe the five time grand slam champion was accorded special treatment due to her profile and marketability  Former world number one Caroline Wozniacki  Halep and Canadian Eugenie Bouchard have been among the loudest dissenters  Fifth seed Wozniacki blasted the USTA and Sharapova when she was relegated to a small outside court for her second round match while the 146th ranked Russian soaked up the applause on center court   Who comes back from a drugs sentence  performance enhancing drugs and then all of a sudden gets to play every single match on center court  I think that s a questionable thing to do   fumed Wozniacki   It doesn t set a good example   Sharapova was unapologetic and delivered a stinging return worthy of anything she has produced on court   I m in the fourth round  I m not sure where  Wozniacki  is   said the wildcard  Hard feelings aside  even Wozniacki conceded she understood the business side of the sport and Sharapova s place in it  Her drug ban notwithstanding  Sharapova remains one of the world s most recognizable athletes and could be set to regain her former corporate standing   Like most controversial athletes  Sharapova has staunch defenders  as well as those that revile her actions and what they have meant to the game   David Carter  principal of the Sports Business Group  told Reuters   Between Nike s culture and its history in accepting  if not defending athletes with indiscretions  it s no surprise they are sticking with her for now   In order for her to regain widespread marketability  her performance will have to steadily improve over time  while any further unforced errors off the court would need to be eliminated   Sharapova was unable to deliver extended stretches of brilliant tennis at the U S  Open but there was every sign that the 30 year old is set to climb back up the rankings and reclaim her spot as one of the best paid women athletes  For 11 straight years  she topped the Forbes list before slipping to second last year and dropping from the list completely for 2017   American Express   NYSE AXP   Avon and Tag Heuer did not renew their sponsorship deals with Sharapova  while retained arrangements with Nike  Head  Evian and Porsche included huge reductions while she was off the tour for over a year  Forbes reported  Before her fourth round elimination  Baker Street s Dorfman said a deep run at Flushing Meadows could return her marketability to  pre ban levels

161816,383332,AXP,Citigroup  American Express  IBM And AIG Are Part Of Zacks Earnings Preview,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 22  2018   Zacks com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises  This week s list includes Citigroup   NYSE C    American Express   NYSE AXP    IBM   NYSE IBM   and AIG   NYSE AIG   To see more earnings analysis  visit  Q4 Earnings Season  Strong Growth  but Weak QualityIt s hard to consider the worthiness of a stock without sizing up the company s profitability potential  Calling earnings as the mother s milk of stocks is probably not an exaggeration  The bottom line is that earnings are very important to keep an eye on for anyone interested in stocks Everyone has an intuition for  earnings  and see it as the leftover of sales after all the business expenses have been accounted for  This otherwise simple and intuitive principle gets complicated as a result of accounting rules that vary from country to country  In the U S   the accounting rules mandating what can be called earnings  officially it s called  net income   in the company s audited financial statements available to shareholders are called GAAP rules  GAAP stands for generally accepted accounting principles  I am oversimplifying here  but GAAP rules don t differentiate between business expenses that are incurred regularly and those that take place every now and then  The investing community likes to make that distinction  they see regular and recurring expenses as the only ones that should matter to those interested in evaluating the stock  the non recurring ones need not be taken into account  As such  the investing community makes adjustments to reported GAAP earnings  by taking out non recurring expenses and gains  All the earnings discussion you see in the marketplace is primarily about such  adjusted  earnings And as you can imagine  such  adjusted  earnings are  almost  always higher than the official GAAP earnings  but the  gap   no pun intended  between the two is typically not that big  That s not the case in the ongoing Q4 earnings season  which ramps up in a big way this week with more than 250 companies reporting results  including 81 S P 500 members For the 53 S P 500 members that have reported Q4 results already  as of Friday  January 19th  the magnitude of gap between adjusted earnings and GAAP earnings is unlike anything we have seen over the last few years  On average  adjusted earnings were  6  higher than GAAP earnings over the preceding 16 quarters for these 53 S P 500 But as you can see in the chart below  the gap is extremely wide for 2017Q4 and likely to remain in record territory even as the reporting cycle moves beyond the Finance sector where the issue was very pronounced A lot goes into  earnings quality   But as a general rule  it is reasonable to be wary of a big variance between adjusted and GAAP earnings  Going by this simple rule  you have to question the  quality  of Q4 earnings reports  irrespective of the growth pace and proportion of positive surprises on the  adjusted  earnings front A few specific examples should help make this point  Citigroup earned  3 38 billion on an adjusted basis  but lost  18 8 billion on GAAP basis  American Express earned  1 39 billion on an adjusted basis  but lost roughly  1 2 billion on GAAP basis  IBM earned  4 8 billion on an adjusted basis  but lost  1 1 billion on GAAP basis  The list goes on and on As pointed out at the top  it makes analytical sense to exclude these one time charges from the data so that investors have a clear sense of underlying business trends and not get distracted by one off gains or losses  Such charges were commonplace during the global financial crisis of 2008 I will mention detail from that period   AIG lost  52 1 billion for full year 2008 on an adjusted basis and lost  103 billion that year on GAAP basis  It s hard to envision any company improving upon that type of  performance  in this earnings season The rest of the earnings discussion in this note will be using  adjusted  earnings  But before I give you the Q4 earnings season scorecard on an adjusted earnings basis  let me give you the GAAP scorecard first On A GAAP basis  total earnings for the 53 S P 500 members that have reported results already are down  57 8  from the same period

 They have ceased this practice and are making consumers whole  In particular  because they self reported the problem and fully cooperated with our investigation  no civil penalties are being assessed in this matter   CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in the statement ",2017-08-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/american-express-to-pay-96-million-over-discriminatory-card-terms-521609,521609

161833,383349,AXP,Ripple Price Predictions  Will The Cryptocurrency Break Out In 2018 ,opinion,"Ripple  XRP  price predictions are extremely difficult to make  due to the unpredictable nature of the   But this embryonic altcoin has already established itself as one of the top cryptocurrency solutions  with many believing that its value will escalate rapidly in the near future 
Ripple effect
Those who have made positive Ripple  XRP  price predictions have already been rewarded  as the cryptocurrency has increased massively in value over the last few weeks  Reaching a peak in excess of  3  the potential of Ripple seems to be absolutely massive  yet its slide since then has also underlined its volatility  and that of cryptocurrencies in general 
Ripple markets itself as using blockchain technology to build the payment system of the future  and has targeted the financial system in the developed world in particular  The market capitalization of Ripple has already increased by an incredible 70 percent in a short period of time  ensuring that Chris Larsen  Ripple s cofounder  has become staggeringly wealthy 
Difficult prospect
Yet Ripple  XRP  price predictions remain fraught with difficulty  It is easy to think that Ripple will just massively increase in value  as this was previously the case with Bitcoin  but this is not necessarily the case  Ripple works fundamentally different to Bitcoin  not being reliant on a network of miners running code in order to validate transactions 
All 100 billion units of Ripple have already been released back in 2012  with it founders keeping 20 billion and distributing the rest to the company  Ripple has since methodically distributed tokens to clients of the company  but still holds around 50 billion in an escrow account 
Additionally  Ripple takes a completely different approach to Bitcoin by utilizing a novel consensus algorithm in order to validate transactions  requiring computers to identify themselves and obtain permission to participate in the network of the currency  Bitcoin simply allows any computer to join its mining process  and this can be considered more democratic and libertarian in nature 
What the difference ultimately boils down to is a larger measure of control over the inner workings of Ripple  leading many observers of the cryptocurrency niche to suggest that it is not truly decentralized  But the payment solution is not actually intended to be a direct rival to Bitcoin  and is instead intended to be something of a bridge currency that will be attractive to financial institutions 
Upward direction
If the founders of the altcoin can achieve this then Ripple  XRP  price predictions will definitely head in an upward direction  It is hoped that Ripple can be utilized in order to settle cross border payments faster and more cheaply than is the case at present  Although Bitcoin can be used for this purpose  Ripple is able to deliver 1 000 transactions every second  which blows Bitcoin and Ethereum out of the water 
Furthermore  transaction fees associated with Ripple are much lower than Bitcoin  and it is these factors which some believe will lead to the value of Ripple increasing exponentially in the next few years  The company already claims that one hundred financial institutions are utilizing its technology  with sixty one banks in Japan and two in South Korea having formed a coalition to launch a new Ripple pilot 
This is interesting news considering the antipathy towards Bitcoin in East Asia  Both  and  have passed legislation in recent months targeting the market leading cryptocurrency  whereas it seems that the attitude towards Ripple is far more convivial 
Key tweet
Last week  Brad Garlinghouse  the company s CEO  tweeted that banks and payment providers are  indeed planning to use  XRP  in a serious way   although there are still doubts whether or not this will really be achieved  Widespread adoption of the currency may not ever occur  and this has been reflected in  100 billion of market capitalization being wiped from Ripple in the last few days 
It is this sort of activity  and the general volatility of the cryptocurrency niche  which makes Ripple  XRP  price predictions so difficult  There is no doubt that Ripple has declined significantly in recent trading  yet many remain optimistic about the potential of the currency to play a significant role in cross border payments 
Moneygram is set to test the water with Ripple by utilizing the crypto platform to see to see if it can be used to move funds in a faster and more efficient way than is the case traditionally  If this test is successful  it seems certain that Ripple will begin to at least play a role in the mainstream currency market  This would be extremely bullish for the value of the cryptocurrency  and could lead to a bitcoin like valuation in the coming years 
Financial backing
With major players in the financial world having already signed up to Ripple  there is no doubt that this cryptocurrency has huge potential  UBS and Santander  MC SAN  are already utilizing Ripple s products in order to enable payments  and big names such as these in the banking industry endorsing Ripple will undoubtedly make people sit up and pay attention 
Elsewhere  American Express  NYSE AXP  has also launched an instant blockchain based payment system using Ripple  indicating that the cryptocurrency is making some significant allies in the financial world 
Whether that is enough for Ripple  XRP  price predictions to be bullish is debatable  The fact is that the cryptocurrency doesn t possess the characteristics which has led to Bitcoin becoming such an overwhelming success story  However  it does seem that the ethos of Ripple is particularly well founded  and that this has been recognized by some big names in the financial world 
This does suggest that Ripple is here to stay  and that its  2 value may look extremely miniscule at some point in the future ",2018-01-14,ValueWalk,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ripple-xrp-price-predictions-will-the-cryptocurrency-break-out-in-2018-200280096,200280096

looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put American Express Company   NYSE AXP   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  American Express has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 1  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 21 4  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts American Express  current PE ratio somewhat above its midpoint  which is 14 4  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that American Express has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 16 8  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for American Express  stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  American Express has a P S ratio of about 2 5  This is noticeably lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  American Express currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes AXP a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for American Express is just 1 6  a level that is noticeably slightly lower than the industry average of 1 9  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  AXP is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though American Express might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of C  This gives AXP a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen eight estimates go higher in the past sixty days  and one lower  while the full year estimate has seen ten upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched up 0 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has nudged up 0 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below American Express Company Price and Consensus    This somewhat favorable trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAmerican Express is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Its strong Zacks Rank also indicates robust growth potential in the near future  However  the company s prospects might be constrained due to adverse broader factors  as it has a sluggish industry rank  bottom 38  out of more than 250 industries   In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite positive estimate revision activity  investors should wait for industry trends and broader factors to turn around first   When they do  this stock could be a compelling value pick Zacks Editor in Chief Goes  All In  on This Stock Full disclosure  Kevin Matras

161864,383380,AXP,Ripple Soars To Surpass Ethereum,opinion,"The Ripple price soared over the weekend to Ethereum as the second largest cryptocurrency in the world  thanks to three of the credit card majors from Japan and other big players in the financial markets  As the world moves in to greet the New Year  2018  the last trading day of 2017 saw the market cap of Ripple  XRPUSD  rising to  76 billion overtaking the  73 billion market cap of Ethereum  though well behind the  246 billion of Bitcoin 
The last quarter of 2017 has witnessed some seismic activity or fireworks in the global cryptocurrency space with Bitcoin leading the pack and taking its price to graze the  20 000 mark before settling around the 15 000 levels  Many of our readers would remember that Bitcoin was sitting below the  1 000 mark in December last and hoping that it would cross the coveted  1000 mark in the New Year 2017  Well  while Bitcoin did meet those expectations  it has perhaps surprised everyone through the quantum leap as we move into yet another New Year  It is  therefore  necessary to examine the frenzied activity in global cryptocurrency markets to understand the surging Ripple  at this point 
Cross border currency movement aiding the Surging XRP price
Ripple is a cryptocurrency designed mainly for banks and businesses engaged in money transfers across the globe  The Ripple token is known as XRP and for the first time in its history the price of the token rose above the  1 mark on 21st December  quintupling its market cap to over  50 billion between just three trading days in that particular week with the bursting XRP price scaling yet another peak at  1 90 before settling down to  1 85 as at 2 15 pm EST on Friday the 29th December 2017 
During 2017  the surging Ripple rocketed by as much as 28 000  to become the most valuable  under the sun  going by the data provided by CoinMarketCap  a price tracker for cryptocurrencies 
More banks and global financial institutions partnering with Ripple
Until a year ago  XRP price was somewhat stagnant  but in 2017 the surging Ripple notched up a collective market cap of about  75 billion  While there is inadequate clarity on this one way run  we do know that Ripple successfully steered clear of some downward moves affecting other participants in the cryptocurrency space  such as Bitcoin during mid December  2017 
However  it is believed that the most recent events like a partnership with banks such as American Express  NYSE AXP  and the credit card companies of Japan have significantly aided the surging Ripple  The present market value of Ripple also puts it on the list of 30 of the most significant banks in the world and ahead of the UK s Lloyds Banking Group  NYSE LYG  and Mizuho Financial Group  NYSE MFG  of Japan 
The cross border payment system of Ripple employs the blockchain technology which is the moving force behind most cryptocurrencies  A huge advantage that Ripple brings to the cross border payments space is an astounding speed at a fraction of the cost charged by other payment systems  With Ripple s technology  cross border payments can be completed in a whisker   just about 15 seconds compared to about three days for banks using the Swift network for their interbank transactions created some four decades ago 
Technology aiding XRP price surge
The XRP reserves available with Ripple is significantly more than what is traded publicly  and its war chest is valued at about  115bn  and it has plans to use this for encouraging banks and other majors in the financial industry to use the technology  Ripple has already signed up over 100 such institutions for moving large volumes of money across the borders 
Ripple is also offering different types of transactions for cross border payments  One such system allows customers to sell or buy XRP to move money with the speed of lightning  Another type employs the blockchain ledger for coordinating and recording interbank transfers between accounts owned by the respective banks 
According to Brad Garlinghouse  the CEO of Ripple  2017 has been the digital assets year  and XRP has emerged as the winner  He also stated that the surging ripple had been aided by the market realizing XRP as an ultra efficient payment mechanism to solve problems in the real world for customers with real money  He added further that there is an increasing realization among people that Bitcoin cannot be the solution for payment problems  though they had imagined it to be so  until some time ago 
In a lighter vein perhaps  he also added that if someone bought a coffee using bitcoin  the coffee would go cold by the time payment was settled  whereas payments are decided in just a few seconds with XRP 
Ripple is different from other cryptocurrencies
Another reason for the surging Ripple could be the fact that it is a different kind of digital currency and it can neither be mined nor used to shop around  Further  it is a private company that operates Ripple  Regarding size  Ripple is significantly small compared to the leader  Bitcoin  While Bitcoin rose by about 1400  in 2017 to reach a  245 billion market cap  the surging Ripple notched up a mind boggling growth of nearly 28 000  in just the 12 months of 2017 
Ripple explained
To understand the low dollar number XRP associated with the surging Ripple  you should also understand XRP itself  XRP is a token and not an actual digital currency  It is similar to what blockchain is to bitcoin  or ether to Ethereum  Another critical aspect of XRP is that it does not constitute a digital currency like bitcoin and merely represents a utility that financial institutions and banks can use to carry out their transactions  Ripple itself calls it a  settlement token  
Multiple parties achieve consensus to validate Ripple transactions  Of all the 100 billion Ripple Coins existing now  60 billion is owned by Ripple Labs  market cap of Ripple in other parts of this article does not include this 60 billion   and Ripple price numbers are not directly linked to the success of Ripple itself 
But  large financial companies and banks find Ripple an attractive option to handle movement of large volumes of cash across borders  particularly given the incredible speed with which such transactions are accomplished 
What is next for XRP price   up or down 
If you are now looking to buy the surging Ripple  Coinbase  the most famous brokerage does not offer it yet  Your options could  therefore  lie between Bitstamp  Bitso  GateHub or Kraken  But  we should also add a caveat that cryptocurrencies are experiencing extreme volatility in recent times and the swings are sometimes shuddering ",2018-01-01,ValueWalk,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ripple-soars-to-surpass-ethereum-200276811,200276811
161865,383381,AXP, Ripple s Next Move  Supply Decisions,opinion,"Finally  Ripple experiences disappointing news  or not the usual bit of good news  Coinbase  one of the largest exchanges for cryptocurrencies said last week  that it had not made a decision to add new currencies to its platform  This dampened recent speculation that it would include Ripple  On December 19  the price of Bitcoin Cash jumped nearly 50  after Coinbase announced the addition of Bitcoin s  cousin  currency to its platform 
You must all know by now about Ripple  the cryptocurrency whose technology enables monetary transfers at a fraction of the cost of the SWIFT system  It takes 4 5 minutes to transfer money internationally  instead of the usual 2 4 days under SWIFT 
You Know the Main Forces
Ripple s 375  price jump over the past 4 weeks was largely driven by these 3 factors 

American Express  NYSE AXP  began routing foreign exchange International Payments platform through Ripple s blockchain network 
Three Japanese credit card companies have begun implementing the technology and the decision 
The Bank of England as well as the Federal Reserve have reportedly been experimenting with Ripple s cross border payment technology 
Rumours that Coinbase would soon add Ripple to its platform were behind the latest price advances  until these claims were denied  indirectly last week 

Coinbase never mentioned Ripple by name  Its statement could well have been a way to alleviate the disruption on its services resulting from the soaring number of new accounts to its platform 

Focus on Supply
Aside from the above dynamics  one key driving force to Ripple s surge emerged in mid December when it jumped from  0 29 to  0 79 in a matter of 2 days as the company announced that it had completed the placement of 55 billion tokens of XRP in a secured escrow account aimed at creating certainty with regards to outstanding supply  The escrow account would be designed to release a total of one billion Ripple each month over the next 55 months  capping the amount of new supply that can be brought into circulation 
Ripple said that   by securing the lion s share of XRP in escrow  people can now mathematically verify the maximum supply that can enter the market  while alleviating concerns that the company could flood the market  The amount of Ripple currently circulating is at 38 7 billion out of a maximum supply of 100 billion 
As we know  one of Bitcoin s striking features is that the number of coins currently in circulation stands at 16 8 million  fast approaching the possible maximum supply of 21 million  Such  deflationary  advantage appeals to those concerned with central banks  arbitrary debasement of their currencies  thereby helps provide a fundamental element to the Bitcoin narrative 
Until last month  the question of Ripple s circulating supply was unclear as the price lingered within the  0 18 0 30 range between May and December while Bitcoin  Litecoin and Ethereum raced ahead by spectacular multiples  The decision to shelve half of Ripple s maximum supply simultaneously addresses supply concerns and pushes it to the forefront of the cryptocurrencies revolution  via eye catching price moves and a unique technological narrative 
While everyone is focusing on Ripple s price action  keep a close eye on management s supply decisions for a better grasp of its long term course ",2018-01-07,Ashraf Laidi,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ripples-next-move-200278109,200278109
161866,383382,AXP,In House race in Georgia  Democrats look for new path to power,news,By John Whitesides DUNWOODY  Ga   Reuters    Democrat Jon Ossoff no longer talks about making President Donald Trump furious  But he may be on the verge of doing just that  Ossoff  a political newcomer who launched his congressional campaign in the Republican leaning northern suburbs of Atlanta by urging supporters to  make Trump furious   now speaks in the measured tones of a moderate consensus builder and rarely mentions the president by name  Local economic development and cutting wasteful government spending are Ossoff s talking points in a race against Republican Karen Handel that has shattered records as the most expensive congressional contest in U S  history  Polls show it is headed for a tight finish in Tuesday s special election  An Ossoff victory would rattle Republicans already nervous about next year s congressional midterm elections  and offer Democrats a template on how to campaign in suburban swing districts as they try to erase the 24 seat Republican majority in the House of Representatives   It would send a very strong message across the country that we can win these kinds of seats   said Representative Dan Kildee  a Michigan Democrat who campaigned with Ossoff in Georgia this week  Democrats have much riding on the outcome  On the surface  conditions seem ripe for a nationwide Democratic renaissance  with a historically unpopular Republican president entangled in an investigation for possible obstruction of justice and the Republican agenda largely stalled in Congress  But Democrats lost two special House elections earlier this year in conservative Kansas and Montana districts that Trump won by double digits last November  A failure in a more competitive district in Georgia  which Trump carried by just 1 percentage point  would be a morale killer for a party that has struggled to develop a coherent message beyond  We re not the party of Trump   Democrats have steadily lost ground in recent years in state and local races  Republicans not only control the White House and both chambers of Congress  but also hold 33 governor s offices  the most in nearly a century  Infighting between grass roots progressives and the party s more mainstream wing has plagued Democrats  who have appeared increasingly vulnerable to Republican attacks portraying them as coastal elites out of touch with working class Americans  Ossoff s  Make Trump Furious  slogan quickly endeared him to national anti Trump activists and pushed him well ahead of 17 rivals in polls in April s non partisan primary in a district represented by Republicans for decades  It wasn t enough  The 30 year old former congressional staffer and documentary filmmaker fell just short of a majority  and outright victory  forcing a closely watched run off against Handel for the House seat vacated by Tom Price  the new secretary of health and human services who was first elected to the House in 2004   FUNDRAISING MACHINE But the grassroots enthusiasm has made Ossoff a fundraising machine  He raised a stunning  24 million by the end of May  five times the amount raised by Handel  a former Georgia secretary of state  Republican outside groups have helped her make up some of the difference  spending nearly  9 million on her behalf  according to fundraising reports  Total spending has approached  40 million  obliterating the previous record of  30 million for a Florida congressional race in 2012  While he benefits from the grassroots anti Trump fervor  Ossoff has deliberately avoided making the race a referendum on Trump  On the campaign trail and in ads  he promises to work with Republicans and focuses on his plans to bolster local economic development  protect access to healthcare  particularly for women  and cut wasteful spending to pay for new priorities  Ossoff said voters in the district are not demanding that he lead an anti Trump resistance   I think voters are more concerned with accountability and results than they are with political drama   he said in an interview after a meeting with millennial supporters  While voters  concerns about the administration have grown  he said   Fundamentally what folks are looking for is representation that will work across the aisle to deliver a higher quality of life   Handel  who also rarely mentions Trump and has argued that the race should be about who has the values and experience to best serve the district  says Ossoff is misrepresenting himself   He s trying to portray himself as something that he is not  He is Nancy Pelosi s hand picked candidate   Handel told reporters this week after greeting diners at a local hamburger restaurant  repeating a line about House Democratic leader Pelosi that has featured prominently in attack ads against Ossoff by outside groups   He is an ultra liberal  His values do not align with this district   she said  Some of her supporters agree  Terry Anderson  67  a retired IT worker from Cobb County  said he did not believe Ossoff was sincere   He sounds more like a moderate Republican all the time   he said  But Brenda Carswell  61  a retired  American Express   NYSE AXP  employee from the city of Tucker who said she typically has switched back and forth between Republicans and Democrats    I ve voted for some Bushes and I ve voted for some Clintons    said she is backing Ossoff   He s been mostly discussing issues that people care about  The problems in our area are more important than most of what they talk about in Washington   she said  Trump  who visited Georgia to raise money for Handel in late April  is watching closely  On Twitter  he criticized Ossoff  and after Ossoff was forced into a runoff he crowed that Democrats  failed in Kansas and are now failing in Georgia   Trump called the race  Hollywood vs  Georgia   Several recent polls have given Ossoff a slight edge heading into Tuesday  while showing that there are few voters who are still undecided  Democrats say the increasingly diverse area exemplifies the sort of educated and affluent suburban district that Democrats will need to win to recapture the House  Georgia based Democratic strategist Tharon Johnson said Ossoff s non ideological messaging should be a model for a party that needs moderates  independents and disaffected Republicans next year   He s done a good job of positioning himself as a sensible Democrat   he said   He doesn t need to tell voters what is wrong with Trump   people see the drama and the problems

161890,383406,AXP,Daily Market Analysis   17 11 2017,opinion,"Market Summary
Asian markets pulled out of their week long slump on Thursday  with most indices across the region posting gains despite the overnight weakness on Wall Street and continued uncertainties regarding U S  tax reform plans  Japan s Nikkei snapped back from recent losses  ending a six session losing streak and making solid gains on excellent corporate earnings reports  Mainland China was the laggard of the day however  as investors there remain concerned about deleveraging and a potential slowdown in the Chinese economy  Australia s S P ASX 200 ended its longest losing streak in six months with a modest gain despite continued softness in commodity prices 
European markets took their lead from the gains in Asia  and also had good news from the corporate earnings front leading to them snapping their own losing streak  It had been the worst run of losing sessions in a year for European markets  so the rebound didn t come as a surprise to many  who said bargain hunting was also present in trading action  The automotive sector did particularly well after data was released showing a large increase in October new car sales across the European Union  Shares of banks were also up significantly as investors were anticipating the passage of the U S  tax reform bill later in the day  In the U K  the FTSE snapped its own five session losing streak  rising modestly on the same bargain hunting and good corporate earnings that helped lift European markets 
U S  markets began the day on an upbeat note in response to overnight gains from Asian and European markets  That positive sentiment was enhanced by better than expected earnings from Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  and Cisco  which led the consumer staples and technology sectors to lead gains across the broader market  The afternoon saw the House of Representative pass the tax reform bill that has caused so much angst to investors  driving equity markets to new heights  By the close the tech heavy Nasdaq was at a new record closing high  while the Dow Industrials and S P 500 both flirted with new records as well  While investors will still need to see the Senate pass the bill  and indications are they may have some sweeping changes in mind  it is a positive for markets to see the tax reform bill moving forward

The pair continued higher for a third session Thursday  and has extended gains above the 1 3200 level as the Asian session began Friday  It looks as if we will see a test of the double top that was put in place in October at the 1 3300 level  but it will remain to be seen of the pair can break through the obvious resistance at that level  Economic data from the U K  remains mixed  and it is probable that the interest rate hike from the Bank of England several weeks ago was a one off and won t be repeated anytime soon  Conversely  the Federal Reserve is ready to raise rates next month  and could give markets several more interest rate hikes in 2018  All of this points to a stronger USD and a weaker Pound  making it more likely we ll see a break of support at the 1 3050 level than a break of resistance at the 1 3300 level ",2017-11-19,AvaTrade,https://www.investing.com/analysis/daily-market-analysis--17112017-200266489,200266489

The people in charge of the money flows  released their thoughts on the economy and stock markets yesterday  As we know  the US Federal Reserve Bank has had more influence on the economy than any single institution or person over the past decade  The FOMC minutes from their meeting on November 1st did contain a few surprises 
It seems that the  has completely changed the language she s using about inflation  The word she was using before was  transitory   meaning that the Fed feels this low inflation period will pass shortly  A word that she used more recently is  guess   stating that we  think  that inflation will rise  Now it seems they re just not certain so they re going to ignore it 
Let s back up   
The Federal Reserve  along with the other central banks of the world have been pumping the global economy with cash injections known as Quantitative Easing  QE   Currently  the total amount of QE from the top five countries is about  19 5 Trillion  Not a small amount of change 
But it doesn t stop there   
In our economy  only a small portion of money is created by the central banks  In fact  every dollar that is held at the Fed is then lent out to other banks within the country who in turn lend each and every dollar to many different clients  This is called fractional banking and what it means is that a bank only needs to own a fraction of the money that it lends out 
Like any other asset  prices of currencies are usually determined by supply and demand  However  with the amount of QE that s been poured into the system it s a real mystery that we haven t seen hyperinflation on a massive scale 
Why are we not drowning in cash   
This question is now being pondered by virtually all economists in the world at the moment and nobody seems to have any good answers 
One of the biggest effects that we can see are global stock prices that tend to benefit from all this cash floating around the system 

The question of  or lack thereof is a hot topic in the financial world and no doubt will be discussed by some over turkey and cranberry sauce this evening  For some of the more normal people  the much bigger topic of discussion will be about cryptocurrencies and how we can replace all of the above with a much better system 
Crypto Market Tops  250 Billion
There have already been several articles published about how to speak about Bitcoin at your Thanksgiving dinner  Some of them are pretty good too  But I m sure most of my readers are already somewhat familiar with this world and what we re trying to accomplish with it so I ll just dive right into the price movements for you 
It s now been two weeks since the Segwit2x hard fork was called off  orange circle  and the action has been intense  It seems that every day one crypto or another is seeing monstrous gains  Here I ve put together all the cryptos that are traded at eToro in one chart 

Bitcoin itself is up 10  in two weeks  which is amazing if you think about it but somehow just doesn t seem impressive at all given some of the other advances 
The best performer by far has been Bitcoin Cash  Green   I actually had to cut off the top of the spike on the chart above just so we could see the moves more clearly  Some believe that Bitcash s bigger blocks and new  difficulty adjusting mining formula  make it an excellent alternative to Bitcoin  However  the crypto markets are all about consensus  And lately  especially since B2X coin never happened  this new bitcoin is gaining traction 
As of this writing  Bitcash is up 36  in the last 24 hours and 148  in the last two weeks  Beware the volatility though  
The second best performer has been Dash  which we discussed in yesterday s update and though Ripple saw a big spike  purple circle  on the announcement that they will be partnering with American Express  NYSE AXP   they re two week performance is now mostly inline with the rest of them 
Trying to guess which crypto is going to perform the best is a lot like playing roulette  The odds that you re going to guess the exact right one are pretty slim  However  this is not a zero sum game  So spreading your bets out and diversifying into many different contenders is probably the best strategy 
New Milestone
The total value of all digital assets in the world has now passed  250 Billion  up 25  in the past two weeks and 1471  since the beginning of the year 

My best guess is that many cryptotraders looking at their portfolio right now might see the  lagging  performance of bitcoin and try to reallocate some of their BTC into higher risk tokens to try and chase those bigger returns  However  this doesn t necessarily mean that Bitcoin will go down 
Bitcoin is a gateway cryptocurrency  Most newcomers in the market and there are a lot of newcomers  first get into Bitcoin before trying out some of the others and it still represents the biggest holding of most crypto investors 
Let s have an amazing day ahead

161894,383410,AXP,5 Charts Showing The Health Of The Banking Industry ,opinion,"The average price to earnings ratio of the S P 500 is now 25  and the cyclically adjusted price to earnings ratio is over 31 
But the financial sector s average price to earnings ratio is  
Banks and insurers usually trade at lower valuations than the broad market  due to the amount of leverage and interest rate sensitivity they have compared to other industries  When a recession hits and consumers are unable to pay back their debts  banks are among the first companies to take a hit to their bottom line 
There s a lot of money to be made by buying bank stocks at good valuations that are financially sound  They are typically good   their business is straightforward  and with high switching costs  they have built in economic moats around their revenue streams 
This article takes a look at the health of the overall U S  banking industry to see if they are still good investments this far into the market cycle  Click on the images for a bigger view 
1  Net Interest Margin

Source  
The core business of a bank is to borrow money at a low interest rate via checking and savings accounts and lend it at a higher rate via mortgages  auto loans  credit card accounts  and personal loans  Many of them have other forms of revenue such as payment processing  asset management or custodianship  and taking care of routine issues like  or notarization  but the difference between borrowing and lending is where the majority of banks make most of their money 
The net interest margin is the difference between the lending rate and the borrowing rate  and the above chart shows the banking industry average net interest margin 
In the 1980 s and 1990 s it was generally over 4   but thanks to the decade of low interest rates following the 2008 global financial crisis  it has more recently been around 3   This seems like a small difference  but if this were to go back up to 4  it would represent a 33  increase in net interest income at no additional expense  which would substantially boost the bottom line  Even going from 3  to 3 3  is a solid 10  net interest income boost 
Federal Reserve interest rates have been near zero for a decade now  but from 2010 to 2015 the average bank net margin continued to decrease because more and more consumers were refinancing their existing fixed debts at these low rates  Now that interest rates are inching back up and refinancing is not as big of a deal anymore  the net interest margin is also inching back up 
2  Household Debt to GDP

Source  
Since banks own most consumer debt  it s important to keep an eye on how leveraged the American public is 
The above chart shows that at 80  household debt to GDP  we re a lot less leveraged than we were in the years leading up to the previous recession 
However  up until around 1990  Americans kept their household debt to GDP   The current trend is positive in favor of debt reduction  but the long term change has been towards more leverage 
3  Return on Equity

Source  
Return on equity is a key measure of profitability for banks 
Equity is the difference between assets and liabilities  and the return on equity is the ratio of the company s net income divided by its equity  In other words  it measures how much money the company makes in a year as a percentage of money it currently has 
The 1990 s and 2000 s were a period of high bank returns on equity at about 15  on average  but this was shown to be hollow as the global financial crisis erased much of those gains 
Now with tighter regulation  banks are back down to about 10  average return on equity 
Banks that hold considerable revolving credit  like American Express  NYSE AXP   Discover Financial Services  NYSE DFS   and Synchrony Financial have returns on equity of 15 20  or higher  but in exchange are a bit riskier as well 
4  Equity to Assets

Source  
Banks currently have more equity to assets than they did in the past  partly due to regulation  which means more liquidity and less leverage 
Let s use Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  as an example    they have  1 93 trillion in assets   1 73 trillion in liabilities  and about  200 billion in equity  which gives them an equity to asset ratio of a little over 10   or just below the industry average of 11  as shown on the chart 
5  Credit Card Charge Offs

Source  
Credit cards are among the riskiest types of loans for banks  because they face much higher default rates than mortgages and other conservative lending in times of financial stress  They correlate very well to broader consumer loans in general  but with higher peaks 
The credit card industry has sharply watched the charge off rate of credit cards this past year  which is a measurement of the percentage of credit card debt that ultimately goes bad  because it has been inching back up  Due to this   are beginning to tighten their credit card lending standards 
At around 3 5   it s still very much in healthy territory  and below what it typically was in the 1990 s and 2000 s 
Final Thoughts
We re eight and a half years into the third longest economic expansion in U S  history 
This makes some investors nervous  especially with stock valuations so high  And I certainly agree with them  I think there s a lot more downside risk in the market with these valuations compared to upside potential over the next 5 10 years 
But I do like buying banks that are trading at low earnings multiples and that are positioned to hold up well during the next recession  whenever it may come  Overall  the banking industry appears to be in relatively good shape  Consumers are a bit less leveraged than they were a decade ago  and banks have more liquidity than ever  in exchange for earning lower  but still decent  returns 
And at this stage  it appears that some of the most volatile banks  with high exposure to credit card debt  are actually some of the best positioned banks  This is because although they have riskier assets  they also trade at lower valuations  earn higher returns on assets and equity  have extra capital on hand to protect their loans  and they  
The state of credit card lending is still very much in healthy territory in 2017

161905,383421,AXP,Huntsman  Alaska Air  United Air Lines  American Express And EBay Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   October 19  2017    Huntsman Corp   NYSE   NYSE HUN       as the Bull of the Day  Alaska Air  NYSE   NYSE ALK       as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on United Air Lines  NYSE   NYSE UAL        American Express  NYSE   NYSE AXP       and eBay  Nasdaq   NASDAQ EBAY       Here is a synopsis of all five stocks   One of the world s largest manufacturers of differentiated commodity chemical products  Huntsman Corp   NYSE      serves a broad range of consumer and industrial markets including transportation  construction  home life  energy and fuels  and clothing and footwear The Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock recently agreed to merge with Clariant AG in a deal that will create a formidable industry player  helping both companies grow their footprint in high growth markets  as well as cut operating costs and expand margins Strong Third Quarter OutlookWhile operations in the Texas Gulf Coast were temporarily affected by Hurricane Harvey  Huntsman still expects strong third quarter results and raised its third quarter expectations not too long ago The specialty chemicals company is set to report earnings on October 27th before the bell  and expects total revenues of  2 06 billion on earnings of 50 cents per share  While sales are projected to decline about 12 8  during the quarter  earnings are estimated to grow over 32  for the period Huntsman expects its global Polyurethanes business and the continued recovery of its Performance Products business to be robust in Q3 Impressive Growth FundamentalsWith projected EPS growth of nearly 44   it s no wonder HUN stock sports a Growth Score of  A   And  Huntsman has a ROE of 30   surpassing the  industry average of 14 28  and showing that the company is efficiently utilizing its shareholder funds Another important thing to note is that the company has beaten earnings estimates in the last 10 quarters  and has an average earnings surprise of more than 26   based on the past four consecutive earnings beats  Shares are SurgingSo far this year  HUN stock has gained well over 51  compared to its industry s year to date return of almost 15  and the S P 500 s gain of about 14 4   The travel industry has been battered by a series of unusually powerful tropical storms over the past few months  with Hurricanes Harvey and Irma causing billions of dollars in damage and creating massive headaches for several airlines Alaska Air s  NYSE      largest hubs are located on the West Coast  so this company hasn t been particularly affected by these storms  Nevertheless  management has struggled with several other key challenges recently Alaska Air Group is currently a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   The company operates the Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air brands  as well as the recently acquired Virgin America airline  Shares are down nearly 10  year to date  and on top of its weak Zacks Rank  Alaska Air is carrying an  F  grade in the Momentum category of our Style Scores system ahead of its report Recent ChallengesThere doesn t seem to be much positive momentum in the airline industry  and as mentioned  several hurricanes have devastated a handful of the biggest players  In fact  our  Transportation   Airline  group currently sits in the Bottom 6  of the Zacks Industry Rank  But what s really interesting here is that Alaska Air is dealing with its own problems For one  a contractual dispute has led to a significant pay increase for pilots at the company s Horizon Air subsidiary  Moreover  fuel cost per gallon in the third quarter is expected to come in nearly 12  higher than the year ago period Alaska Air also recently released mixed September traffic results  The company s total revenue passenger miles  RPMs  were up by nearly 8 4   while its consolidated capacity gained 10 1   What s problematic is that load factor  or percentage of seats filled by passengers  fell nearly 1 5 percentage points year over year  underscoring the fact that capacity expansion has outpaced traffic growth Earnings OutlookALK is slated to release its full third quarter financial results before the market opens on October 25  The company has seen significant negative revision activity  and estimates are down on near universal analyst agreement across the board If these estimates hold up  Alaska Air s results would represent earnings growth of 5 60  and revenue growth of 38 33   This indicates that ALK is perhaps a more interesting growth pick than many others in the airline business  but it could present even more risk if the company fails to live up to expectations On that note  we should mention that Alaska Air currently sports an Earnings ESP of  3 40   Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates Alaska Air s negative Earnings ESP further proves that analyst sentiment has gotten worse during recent trading  which is not a great sign as we approach the company s earnings report date Other Key MetricsAs mentioned above  ALK is currently sporting an  F  grade for Momentum  The stock has its negative estimate revision snapshot  as well as its weak share price movement over the past few months  to thank for this grade  In fact  the stock has underperformed the industry s average gains throughout the past year  within 2017  and over the past three months On top of this  a few of Alaska Air s valuation metrics might leave investors concerned  The company s P S ratio of 1 43 is well ahead of the industry average of 0 81  and its PEG ratio is at a significant premium to the industry s 1 53  What s more  ALK s P B and P CF ratios are currently lagging behind their respective industry averages Better OptionsBecause of the aforementioned storms and rising fuel costs  investors will find very few surefire bets in the domestic airline industry right now  Instead  it might be a good idea to turn our attention to several foreign airliners Additional content Q3 Earnings Reports Follow Record Market HighsAfter another stellar regular trading day this Wednesday  which saw new record closing highs for the Dow  Nasdaq and S P 500  Q3 earnings results from several companies across a wide spectrum of industries hit the tape after the bell  United Air Lines  NYSE       American Express  NYSE      and eBay  Nasdaq      have all put out Q3 results this afternoon American Express shares are down upon the credit card major s latest quarterly beat  earnings per share of  1 50 topped the Zacks consensus estimate by 3 cents  representing 20  growth year over year  Revenues also bested expectations  bringing in  8 44 billion in the quarter  above the  8 32 billion anticipated  The company also raised full year earnings guidance to  5 80   5 90  Yet shares dipped roughly 1  in the immediate aftermath of the quarterly release This likely has to do with the surprise announcement that AmEx s Ken Chenault will be retiring  stepping down as Chairman and CEO as of February 1st next year  Current Vice Chair Steven Squeri will assume both roles for AmEx  Also  company shares are up 24  year to date and 53  year over year United also surpassed expectations on both top and bottom lines today  with  2 22 per share on  9 88 billion both improvements over the  2 12 and  9 86 billion estimated  respectively  The airline major saw its shares sell off in late trading  as well  likely based on weaker than expected passenger revenues and higher costs related to fuel and labor  eBay  meanwhile  barely eked out a positive surprise on the top line after today s closing bell     2 4 billion as opposed to  2 37 billion in our estimate    while just meeting bottom line earnings of 48 cents per share  The company missed estimates for active buyer totals in the quarter by about 3 million  to 168 million actualized   even amid efforts to drive site traffic in the quarter  Shares fell 5  upon the Q3 release

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including American Express  AXP   Verizon  VZ  and eBay  EBAY   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Buy rated American Express  shares are up  39 5  over the last year  outperforming the Zacks Financial Miscellaneous Services industry  which has gained  29 9  over the same period  Its third quarter earnings beat expectations and improved year over year  
Better than expected results were mainly backed by an increase in net interest income  higher Card spending at a lower tax rate and the effect of share buyback  The company continues to witness strong loan growth and credit metrics  plus lower operating costs  
The Zacks analyst likes its solid market position  strength in card business and significant opportunities from the secular shift toward electronic payments are growth drivers  Strategic initiatives focusing on the platinum card portfolio and the OptBlue program will drive business volume  
Cost reduction and return of significant capital to shareholders through dividend and share buyback are also positives  However  an increase in provision for losses  high rewards expense and cost of card member services are the other headwinds

Shares of Verizon have lagged recently    the stock is down  2 6  year to date vs  AT T  NYSE T  s  12 2  decline and the  17  gain for the S P 500 index  Verizon posted mixed third quarter 2017 financial results  with net gain of 603 000 postpaid and 139 000 prepaid wireless customers  
The Zacks analyst thinks these user additions came on the back of Verizon s unlimited data plans  Verizon is teaming up with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  to deliver virtual network services at a global scale  The company s 5G wireless network trials and deployment plans complements its 5G wireless expansion strategies  
Verizon plans to merge its Go90 content into its other digital platforms and is on track to boost its fiber suite through different deals  However  Verizon operates in a highly competitive and saturated wireless market  
Loss in wireline access lines  marketing costs of promotional plans  competitive video market are other major risks  Delay in OTT services  launch is a major drawback 
 You can  
eBay s shares have underperformed the Zacks Internet Commerce industry in the year to date period   26 7  vs   50 7    The company s third quarter 2017 earnings matched expectations while revenues beat the same  The Zacks analyst likes several initiatives taken by eBay  including building a solid foundation of structured data and artificial intelligence  AI   customer to customer  C2C  business and enhancing mobile experience  
While the separation from PayPal led to the loss of a good growth engine  eBay is well positioned for growth based on the aforesaid factors  However  weak global economy  slow e commerce growth and stiff competition remain overhangs

highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  Top Analyst Reports for American Express  Verizon and eBayThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including American Express  Verizon and eBay  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Buy rated American Express  shares are up  39 5  over the last year  outperforming the Zacks Financial Miscellaneous Services industry  which has gained  29 9  over the same period  Its third quarter earnings beat expectations and improved year over year Better than expected results were mainly backed by an increase in net interest income  higher Card spending at a lower tax rate and the effect of share buyback  The company continues to witness strong loan growth and credit metrics  plus lower operating costs The Zacks analyst likes its solid market position  strength in card business and significant opportunities from the secular shift toward electronic payments are growth drivers  Strategic initiatives focusing on the platinum card portfolio and the OptBlue program will drive business volume Cost reduction and return of significant capital to shareholders through dividend and share buyback are also positives  However  an increase in provision for losses  high rewards expense and cost of card member services are the other headwinds  You can  Shares of Verizon have lagged recently    the stock is down  2 6  year to date vs  AT T  NYSE T  s  12 2  decline and the  17  gain for the S P 500 index  Verizon posted mixed third quarter 2017 financial results  with net gain of 603 000 postpaid and 139 000 prepaid wireless customers The Zacks analyst thinks these user additions came on the back of Verizon s unlimited data plans  Verizon is teaming up with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  to deliver virtual network services at a global scale  The company s 5G wireless network trials and deployment plans complements its 5G wireless expansion strategies Verizon plans to merge its Go90 content into its other digital platforms and is on track to boost its fiber suite through different deals  However  Verizon operates in a highly competitive and saturated wireless market Loss in wireline access lines  marketing costs of promotional plans  competitive video market are other major risks  Delay in OTT services  launch is a major drawback  You can  eBay s shares have underperformed the Zacks Internet Commerce industry in the year to date period   26 7  vs   50 7    The company s third quarter 2017 earnings matched expectations while revenues beat the same  The Zacks analyst likes several initiatives taken by eBay  including building a solid foundation of structured data and artificial intelligence  AI   customer to customer  C2C  business and enhancing mobile experience While the separation from PayPal led to the loss of a good growth engine  eBay is well positioned for growth based on the aforesaid factors  However  weak global economy  slow e commerce growth and stiff competition remain overhangs  You can  Other noteworthy reports we are featuring

161931,383447,AXP,Berkshire cuts Wells Fargo stake  pulls Fed application,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
 Reuters    Warren Buffett s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc   N BRKa  withdrew its application to the Federal Reserve to boost its ownership stake in  Wells Fargo    Co  N WFC  above 10 percent  and is instead selling 9 million shares to keep it below that threshold 
Berkshire on Wednesday said it concluded after several months of talks with Fed officials that maintaining the higher stake would  materially restrict  its ability to do business with the third largest U S  bank 
The Fed exerts special oversight when investors take large bank stakes  It often allows double digit stakes not designed to exert a  controlling influence   but has said it would review any resulting business relationship  case by case  
Berkshire said  investment or valuation considerations  were not factors in its sale of 7 13 million Wells Fargo shares this week  and planned sale of another 1 87 million shares  in the near future  
The company  which has owned Wells Fargo stock since 1989  also said it will sell more Wells Fargo shares if needed to keep its stake  slightly below 10 percent   including if the bank repurchases its own stock 
According to a regulatory filing  Berkshire owned 504 3 million Wells Fargo shares worth more than  27 billion before the sales  making it the bank s largest shareholder  Buffett  86  owned another 2 01 million of the bank s shares personally 
Wells Fargo has been beset since September by a scandal over its creation of unauthorized customer accounts 
 We appreciate the confidence that Berkshire Hathaway has placed in Wells Fargo over the years  both as our largest shareholder and a very valued customer   spokesman Mark Folk said in a statement   We look forward to continuing our relationship  
On Monday  Wells Fargo said it would claw back an additional  75 million of compensation from the executives it blamed most for the accounts scandal  former Chief Executive John Stumpf and former community banking chief Carrie Tolstedt 
The San Francisco based lender s shares have nonetheless risen 16 6 percent since Donald Trump was elected U S  president  though they now trade at their lowest level in four months 
Many other banks  shares also rose after Trump s election 
Buffett told CNBC television on Feb  27 that Wells Fargo made a  huge mistake  by not immediately addressing the unauthorized accounts  and that letting the problem mushroom made its reputation suffer 
Wells Fargo is expected on Thursday to report a decline in first quarter profit  according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I B E S 
Berkshire has large investments in other financial services companies  including year end stakes of 16 8 percent in  American Express  Co  N AXP   6 percent in U S  Bancorp  N USB  and 2 9 percent in  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  N GS  

The Omaha  Nebraska based conglomerate also operates more than 90 businesses including insurers  utilities  industrial products makers  food and apparel companies  and a railroad ",2017-04-12,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/berkshire-to-pare-wells-fargo-stake,-pull-fed-application-473968",473968

161984,383500,AXP,Kissinger  Rice  Gates advising Trump on national security policy,news,"Investing com   Investing com   Former secretaries of state and defense of the U S   Henry Kissinger  Condoleezza Rice and Robert Gates  have been informally advising President elect Donald J  Trump on foreign policy and national security strategy  with the goal of reframing American policy toward Russia  Investing com has learned 
Trump had articulated the idea of reaching out to Russia during the presidential campaign  and met much criticism for the concept from the establishment in Washington D C  and the opposition media in the U S 
This was followed by hyperbolic reportage regarding Trump s appointment of Rex Tillerson  CEO of ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM   as the next secretary of state  due to his business ties to Russia  and friendly relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin 
But Kissinger has stated that it would be good for the international order if U S  Russian relations were better   The long term interests of both countries call for a world that transforms the contemporary turbulence and flux into a new equilibrium which is increasingly multi polar and globalized   said Kissinger  who was secretary of state for President Nixon and President Ford  in a speech earlier this year 
 Russia should be perceived as an essential element of any new global equilibrium  not primarily as a threat to the United States  
Kissinger s consulting firm has advised Exxon in the past  as well as advised  American Express   NYSE AXP   Anheuser Busch  Coca Cola  JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  and  Pfizer   NYSE PFE  
Trump s transition team did not comment on the president elect s dealings with Kissinger  with whom he has met personally  at least one time  nor did it speak to his relationship with Rice or Gates 
Some reports indicate that the controversy over Trump s recent remarks on U S  nuclear capacity may be unfounded  according to press reports 
President Obama has pushed for the same kind of technology upgrade to the nuclear arsenal  but this was not understood at the time Trump made his remarks by reporters 
 For the next president to say  we re going to have to systematically rebuild our nuclear capability  is exactly right   said Newt Gingrich  former speaker of the U S  House of Representatives in a TV interview on Sunday ",2016-12-25,Investing.com,"https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/kissinger,-rice,-gates-advising-trump-on-national-security-policy-449851",449851

162020,383536,AXP,U S  urges court to overturn AmEx antitrust decision,news,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK  Reuters    The U S  government on Thursday asked a federal appeals court to reconsider a recent antitrust decision allowing  American Express  Co  N AXP  to stop merchants from encouraging customers to use rival cards that charge lower fees  In its Sept  26 decision  the 2nd U S  Circuit Court of Appeals in New York reversed a lower court ruling that had struck down AmEx s  anti steering  rules  At issue are the more than  50 billion of fees that merchants pay annually to process transactions  These fees are largely hidden from customers  but can be passed along to them through higher prices  The appeals court said AmEx can block merchants that accept its cards from steering customers to cheaper cards from  Visa Inc   N V  and MasterCard Inc  N MA   even if the move saved them money  But in Thursday s filing  the U S  Department of Justice said the court erred by focusing on how AmEx s policy affected customers and merchants  rather than merchants alone  The department also said it should not have had to show at the outset that the policy did more harm than good  and that instead AmEx must show how its policy promotes competition   It is not for AmEx to decide on behalf of the entire market to eliminate merchant side price competition  forcing all retail customers to subsidize rewards for AmEx s affluent cardholders   the Justice Department said  AmEx spokesman Andrew Johnson in a statement said the government s claims lack merit  and that  if asked to do so by the court  we will oppose the DOJ s petition vigorously   The New York based company accounted for about 26 4 percent of U S  credit and charge card purchase volume in 2013  Visa and MasterCard settled similar lawsuits in 2011 by agreeing to change their rules  Thursday s filing seeks reconsideration of the Sept  26 decision by the original three judge appeals court panel  or by the court s 11 active judges in an  en banc  review  The 2nd Circuit rarely grants such requests  and holds en banc hearings at a rate of roughly one every other year

162024,383540,AXP,JPMorgan has clutch of CEO understudies  people guessing on winner,news,"By David Henry NEW YORK  Reuters    JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM  is once again facing questions about who will succeed its larger than life chief executive after Jamie Dimon was courted by the incoming U S  president for the role of Treasury secretary  Dimon  60  has been running the largest U S  bank for more than a decade and has faced questions about his longevity in the role before  when potential successors left  when he allowed an embarrassing  6 2 billion derivatives trading loss and  most recently  when he was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2014  Although associates have said Dimon is not interested in the Treasury job  the recent invitation from a member of President elect Donald Trump s transition team to apply for the job was a reminder to interested parties  including some investors  that his time at the helm is finite   He is not going to be CEO forever   said Walter Todd  chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Management  which owns JPMorgan shares  Although a sudden departure would not necessarily lead the investor to sell the stock  it would be  troubling   Todd said   I would have to gain some comfort with who was taking over that role   Dimon will not be easy to replace  He has won a higher valuation for JPMorgan stock than rival banks by shepherding it through the financial crisis without any quarterly losses  while earning relatively high returns on equity and explaining the workings of the bank to analysts as though he were a demanding business school professor   He has been quick to point out that the JPMorgan board has a succession plan in place  whether he departs abruptly due to unforeseen circumstances   known colloquially as a  hit by a truck  scenario   or whether he takes part in a more gradual transition  The board does not publicize those plans  Doing so could prompt executives who are not the favorite to leave  There are six key members of Dimon s management team who are often mentioned in discussions about succession  They range in age from 46 to 58  with the older executives seen as  hit by a truck  contenders  and younger ones thought to be potential CEOs in training  Each has some qualities Dimon has identified as necessary for the next CEO   like moving through senior roles in different parts of the company  having experience with the investment bank  or having the temperament to be the public face of JPMorgan   but none clearly has them all  JPMORGAN S GOT TALENT Gordon Smith  a 58 year old Briton with computer science training  is chief executive of the consumer bank  He runs nearly half of JPMorgan  including Chase branches  credit cards  mortgages and auto loans  Dimon hired him from  American Express  Co  NYSE AXP  in 2007  Although Smith has many of the skills needed to be CEO  he is close enough to Dimon s age that insiders see him as an unlikely long term candidate  Daniel Pinto  53  who oversees corporate and investment banking  is also on the succession shortlist  Dimon has entrusted Pinto with running the most volatile part of JPMorgan and dealing with the biggest corporate clients  A native of Argentina  Pinto spends much of his time working from JPMorgan s London office  Doug Petno  who runs commercial banking  is another possible contender  With  212 billion in assets  his segment of the company is bigger than all but a handful of competitors  The 51 year old came up through the ranks as lender and investment banker to the oil and gas industry  Mary Erdoes  49  who runs asset management  is also said to be in the running  Erdoes keeps a relatively low public profile as she travels the world to cater to the richest clients  Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake  who is 47  is also floated as a possibility  Lake already has a high profile  because she handles public presentations of the bank s financial results each quarter and has shown she can be as dextrous with numbers as Dimon  But while Lake is known internally for grasping the details behind summaries she receives from business heads  she has not run any of JPMorgan s units day to day  Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames is the youngest contender  at 46  In his role  he has the advantage of learning all segments of the bank from the inside out   Dimon turned to Zames in early 2012 to clean up the portfolio of the bad  London Whale  derivatives trader that was costly not only in dollars but in reputation  Zames came from fixed income trading  and has worked through financial crises going back to 1998   I DON T WANT TO RETIRE  Dimon has said JPMorgan has a  deep bench  of talent  with several people who could take over  But he has been careful not to clearly show favorites  When all goes right with succession plans  companies tend to announce a few months ahead of time that their leaders will be relinquishing the CEO title to a successor but remain on the board as chairman for a smooth transition  During the interim  other executives in the horse race tend to peel off  letting up and comers take over their own roles  JPMorgan has resolved nearly all of its major legal investigations  Dimon received a clean bill of health after undergoing cancer treatment  And  apparently  he has no plans to join Trump s cabinet  So unless an unexpected event forces his hand  Dimon may not feel compelled to tell investors who is next  
 My retirement date  every time you ask me that  I m going to say five years   Dimon said in response to a question last year   I don t want to retire  ",2016-11-18,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/jpmorgan-has-clutch-of-ceo-understudies,-people-guessing-on-winner-442097",442097

162042,383558,AXP,Pump   Dump,opinion,"The potential of the cryptocurrency markets for intraday trading has seen yet another huge leap forward last night 
I mean  every trader knows by now that these markets have the ability to move fast but moves we ve seen on Ripple are just ridiculous  Ripple tokens  known as XRP  have gone from less than 1 cent per coin on March 29th to more than 43 cents this morning 

Ripple is seen by alternative investors as being backed by the traditional financial institutions  The service is designed to replace the current Swfit system  which is slow and expensive and will soon be obsolete 
Last night  the founders of Ripple announced that they will lock up 55 Billion XRP in an escrow account in order to create price stability  However  since this represents more than half of the 100 Billion XRP total supply of the market  traders have increased the demand 
There s no doubt in my mind that this is an extremely speculative market  The major banks have yet to embrace ripple and why should they

Of course  we can t really predict where this high speed train will stop  It may continue on to  1 a coin or further  but what I can tell you is that financial institutions are not known to share their wealth  When they do decide on a blockchain they re almost certain to ensure the money stays local and the public gets left holding the bag

Market Overview
As we ve seen many times before  all the headlines this morning are about President Trump but this time somehow seems different 
The controversies surrounding his Russian connection are almost too much for the broad markets to ignore  For now  the stock markets seem fine  Many analysts are calling this a  distraction  and all we ve really seen is a slowdown of an extremely bullish market 
The currencies and commodities  on the other hand  are showing clear signs of safe haven trading 
After bouncing off support at  1216 a week ago  gold  has continued to climb  Peter Fredy Burri has called the price beyond  1300 in  on  

As far as currencies go  when we re thinking about safe havens  we need to talk about the Yen 
Here we can see the  falling about 200 pips over the last week  indicating that Asian investors are indeed looking for a safe place to stick their money 

The situation with oil is a bit more sticky  Here  it s not as clear if it s leading the sentiment or following  I tend to think of it as the former 
After again failing to break the psychological resistance of  50 a barrel  we are seeing a bit of a pullback at the moment  The crude oil inventories out today could give some indication 
What is clear is that all investors are watching oil very closely at the moment  The oil page on eToro is one of the most active market walls right now  aside from Bitcoin   Ethereum of course 
UK Labor   Earnings
With three weeks left to the general elections  the Labour party led by Jeremy Corbyn has finally released their mission statement 
It does seem like a lost cause for Labour at the moment as they are only showing about 30  of the total vote according to recent polls  As we get closer to the voting  this charade is looking a lot more like a walk in the park for Theresa May 
So far  and ever since May s  clean Brexit  speech on January 17th  blue circle   a stronger May and a stronger conservative party have led to a stronger pound sterling  
On the technical side  the  is still trying hard to break above 1 3000

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

   

	It looks like the market is going to have to wait for a bill to  Repeal and replace  Obamacare  Regardless of what side of the political isle you find yourself on  it s tough to discount the impact of such an event on stocks in the medical business  This is a varied business  with pockets that are more well insulated to  Repeal and replace  risks than others  One of the more insulated areas of this market are the medical device companies  When I say more insulated  I mean when compared to drug makers or insurers 

	One such company is today s Bull of the DayInogen  NASDAQ         Inogen  Inc  is a medical technology company  It offers oxygen concentrator  cart  carry bags  backpacks  external battery chargers and universal power supply for obstructive pulmonary disease patients  The Company s products include Inogen One G3 and Inogen One G2  It sells its products in the United States and internationally  Inogen  Inc  is headquartered in Goleta  California 

	The stock is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock right now with a Growth Style Score of A  The major reason for the favorable Zacks Rank is the recent bullish behavior from analysts covering the stock  Four analysts have increased their estimates for the current year while four have also increased their EPS estimates for next year  The bullish behavior has pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimate from 78 cents or 98 cents for the current year and has inflated next year s number from  1 02 to  1 18 

	Shares of INGN have outperformed the Medical Instruments Industry YTD  with most of that outperformance coming in the last month and a half  INGN is up 14 8  so far this year while the industry is up only 4 7   To put that into perspective  the S P 500 is up 5 5  on the year  Currently  the medical device industry ranks in the Bottom 44  of our Zacks Industry Rank

	Avis Budget Group  Inc  is a leading provider of vehicle rental services  with operations in more than seventy countries  Through its Avis and Budget brands  the company is the largest general use vehicle rental company in each of North America  Australia  New Zealand and certain other regions 

	The stock is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  right now with a Momentum Style Score of F  The major reason for the unfavorable Zacks Rank is the recent bearish behavior from analysts covering the stock  Two analysts have decreased their estimates for the current year while two have also decreased their earnings estimates for next year  The bearish behavior has pushed down our Zacks Consensus Estimate from  3 49 to  3 24 for the current year and has deflated next year s number from  3 98 to  3 61 

	Shares of CAR have underperformed the Business Services industry YTD  with most of that underperformance coming in the last month and a half  CAR is off 20  so far this year while the industry is down 7  To put that into perspective  the S P 500 is up 5 5  on the year  The Business Services Industry ranks in the Bottom 15  of our Zacks Industry Rank

Earnings Results
The company s positive first quarter profit was led by the increased spending in AmEx s credit card members  According to American Express chief executive Kenneth Chenault  card member spending has risen by 8  adjusted by changes in foreign exchange rates  Overall  the company was able to record 1 7 million new card members across the U S  from both businesses and personal holders and 2 6 million globally during the quarter slightly beating growth from the previous quarter 
Chenault also added that the positive earnings result was due to the investments the company has been taking to further support the growth of the business and their successful progress in reducing their operating expenses 
The loans sector of the business has also grown by 11  over half of the growth coming from existing customers or members 
Despite beating analysts  expectation of  1 28 earnings per share  the company still reported losses in their net income coming from  1 4 billion last year  AmEx s EPS came in  1 34 with a net income of  1 2 billion 
Revenues also declined by 2  compared to the same quarter last year to  7 9 billion  which still beat forecasts of  7 79 billion in revenue 
Analysts commended the bank for having sustained such performance in the midst of rising competition with more competitors offering higher rewards  especially for premium customers  AmEx  for instance  raised its Platinum card rewards to compete against a much higher end market  particularly JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  and Citigroup  NYSE C   Aside from the additional rewards  AmEx also boosted its efforts and spending in promotions and marketing 
 Our first quarter performance marks a good start to the year with momentum in the consumer and commercial businesses in the US and in key markets internationally   said Chenault
AmEx To Further Cut Costs
The financial services company which attributed most of their spending success to their operating expense cutting intends to further curb costs in other areas  This would allow them to raise their margins and make meeting its full year profit forecasts easier 
AmEx chief financial officer Jeffrey Campbell said on a call with analysts on Wednesday that the company expects its earnings per share and net income to rise due to the continuation of their cost reducing measures  Campbell previously mentioned in the previous earnings call that the company s earnings and revenue for the year would be  uneven  ",2017-04-20,Trade12,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/american-express-beats-estimates,-shares-rise-200184062",200184062

handful of start ups that have encouraged European small businesses to kick their cash only habits  Now  their strategy is to lower fees as they brace for a more formidable challenge  the onslaught of mature North American payment providers onto their home territory  San Francisco based Square  NYSE SQ    headed by Twitter chief Jack Dorsey   is among the new entrants  SumUp Chief Executive Daniel Klein told Reuters that his company  which is funded partly by e commerce giant Groupon  is prepared to cut the fees it charges merchants in order to take advantage of a growing market and stay

profitable for the full year  he said  SumUp  which in Europe operates in 14 countries  currently charges 1 95 percent  1 75 and 1 45 percent in Britain and France and Poland  respectively  That compares to a 2 4 percent average that Juniper Research estimates such global mobile payment providers charge merchants   There is still a lot of pent up demand that needs to be satisfied   Klein said in an interview   The opportunity is massive   SumUp has not given revenue figures but says it now processing an annualized 1 billion euros in transactions  Sweden s iZettle  a six year old company which is Europe s market leader with an annual run rate of 3 billion euros  announced in June that it was cutting its fees for merchants with high sales volumes  The fee cuts are among the strategies European companies are using to counter the emergence in Europe of players including U S  payments giant PayPal and Square   The rush into Europe is partly driven by upcoming European Union regulation making it easier for non banking players to compete in the payments arena  PayPal rolled out its PayPal Here device in Britain in 2013 and Square has started recruiting in Europe and field testing in London as it too prepares a European launch  The price cut strategy has risks  Though lower fees are a way to battle larger U S  competition  they could put pressure on profits on these players for years to come  analysts say    It s almost becoming a race to the bottom in terms of transaction take   said James Moar  an analyst at Juniper Research   While volumes are massive  Moar said the payments firms serving smaller merchants are struggling with profitability    You really need to scale in order to succeed in these markets   he said   MODERN SYSTEM Mobile payment firms  whose devices plug into smartphones or tablets to turn them into instant tills  allow merchants to take payments via card or mobile phone   often at a lower cost than the traditional and bulky point of sale terminals which can come with inflexible contracts and monthly fees  Juniper Research has forecast global mobile point of sale revenues to rise to nearly  50 billion in 2021  from over  6 6 billion this year  with such devices expected to account for 1 in 3 point of sale terminals by then  U S  firms are keen to break into Europe as the U S  mobile payments market for medium enterprises is getting saturated  Canada s Shopify   which already has a sizeable presence among British online merchants   also just launched its card reader in Britain  The European payment landscape is about to become more open  and also more competitive  New European regulations that aim to level the playing field for banks and payments firms will give third parties direct access to bank accounts by 2018  That means customers can pay bills or shop using their payment service of choice  There is clear evidence that Europe   where small and medium companies make up most of the corporate landscape   is a rich market for the taking  The region makes up almost one fifth of total global revenues in the space and is seen increasing over time   Customers would much rather pay with a card   says Vasilie Kim  owner of food vendor Smakhuset in downtown Stockholm  who uses iZettle software to track which items sell best and how many customers return  Only one in five pays with cash  he says   Peter Gutniak  who runs several vaccination clinics and buses in Stockholm and has 9 iZettle devices  said he used to have to deal with connected terminals  cords and paper receipts    Now I just sms or email receipts to customers   he said   It s a modern system  it s cheaper and it is incredibly simple   BATTLE LINES U S  tech firms are generally seen to have the upper hand  They started earlier than their European peers and have better access to the vast U S  venture capital resources   PayPal  which can be spotted on London black cabs but has yet to push into other parts of Europe  says it is banking on its brand awareness around the globe    Consumers know they can trust and use   a device with the PayPal logo  said Rob Harper  head of Mobile Commerce at PayPal UK   And from a retailer s perspective  they know that they are going to get paid   Square has declined to comment about its expansion plans although Chief Financial Officer  Sarah Friar  has highlighted Britain as an interesting market   To counter the competition  European companies say they have a home court advantage  several years of dealing in a region that is highly fragmented with local rules and payment habits  Jacob de Geer  chief executive of iZettle  says the company is  purposefully not profitable  so that it can invest in growth  The firm  backed by MasterCard and  American Express   NYSE AXP   is present in 10 markets in Europe and has  ambitious plans for the next couple of years   iZettle  which has a 2 75 percent fixed rate for the majority of its users  announced in June it was cutting rates for merchants with high sales volumes even further   to one percent  SumUp s Klein said demand from existing users and new ones who are accepting card payments for the first time would drive the business in the years to come  It expects to install 20 to 30 million terminals over the next five to 10 years  compared to 8 million today   There is an entire industry that hasn t really adopted card payments   he said  Darrin Peller  an analyst covering both Square and PayPal for  Barclays   LON BARC   said that iZettle has the geographic reach and brand awareness in Europe that makes it better placed than U S  rivals  But Peller added that the battle lines were drawn

162127,383643,AXP,Square Inc   A Larger Company Circling Square For A Buyout ,opinion,"A Larger Company Circling Square For a Buyout 
Square Inc  NYSE SQ  
As we have seen in the social media and social networking companies of late  rumors of buyouts and consolidation in the area are running rampant  seemingly almost every few days 
From Twitter Inc  NYSE TWTR   Yelp Inc  NYSE YELP   and of course the famous LinkedIn NYSE LNKD  which was successfully acquired in a buyout recently  rumors have abounded  Most have not come to fruition  with the exception being Linked in  Today added a new face in the mix  The name of the company is Square Inc  SQ  
The company trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker ticker symbol SQ  The company allows merchants  from a mobile setting application  to accept payments for products and services 
Recently they have branched out into making small business loans to qualified customers that they deal with 
The original idea for Square arose when a friend of Jack Dorsey  CEO of Square  named  was unable to accept a credit card payment for products and services he was selling to a customer in a mobile setting 
The reason why many traders and analysts feel Square may be being circled by a larger  better financed company arose today  April 12th  2017 when some unusual options trades began to hit the tape in the reporting of options trades at the CBOE  Chicago Board Of Options  
Unusual Options Activity
Below you will see some of these trades circled  Of note were the April 21 line  17 and  18 strikes  The volume was massive  Especially when compared to the open interest already existing 
It is trades and activity like this that usually occurs prior to some sort of major activity in the stock price  It does not always work out well for the traders and investors who follow along  but when it does it is a very lucrative trade or investment 
One of the companies cited as a possible suitor for a possible takeover is Visa Inc  NYSE V   Visa has seen its own recent unusual option activity and when you consider today s action in the options in Square it does seem that something may be brewing under the surface 
Other possible suitors of course are other companies in the credit card and mobile payment arenas namely PayPal Holdings Inc  NASDAQ PYPL   Verifone Systems Inc  NYSE PAY   American Express  Inc  NYSE AXP  


Source For Options Data  
SQ Technicals
A look at the price chart below for Square Inc also shows some promising signs of a stock under accumulation and a possible imminent break out to the upside  Note the nearly solid green candle formed from today s price action with the increased daily trading volume 
A solid green Japanese Candlestick usually indicates strong buying and bullish behavior going forward  It is what many technical analysts and stock traders look for when they are going to long a stock for a trade or an investment 
Also please see the red resistance line which the price has begun to attack and which will serve as some form of resistance as the stock price tries to get through that area 
However  the stock has the green support trend line just below  which some traders may use as an entry point if the price should come back a little bit from today s move

162178,383694,AXP,Discover Financial Continues To Grow On Solid Card Sales,opinion,"On Nov 8  we issued an updated research report on Discover Financial Services   NYSE DFS   
The company s third quarter earnings of  1 56 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 4   The bottom line also improved 13  on the back of 5  higher revenues  both on a year over year basis 
The company s Direct Banking Business is a major revenue growth driver  Continuous growth in card sales and loans are the two pillars of this segment Continuous growth in card sales and loans strengthen this segment  All three cards of Discover Financial  Discover it  Discover it Miles  and Discover it Secured  continue to gain popularity in the marketplace 
The company is one of the major credit card issuers in the U S  and is creating a more active card member base than solely relying on fund transfers at acquisitions  thus protecting the loan portfolio during times of lower balance transfers  In the third quarter  the segment continued to outperform with total loan growth of 5  and a 1  increase in total card sales volume  on a year over year basis 
The company has put in relentless efforts to solidify its position in the international card market  The company has successfully established its presence in countries like India  China  Russia  Nigeria and the Middle Eastern countries  In order to bolster its inorganic growth  the company has undertaken several mergers  acquisitions  and strategic alliances  These deals have not only strengthened its global payment network but also restructured its business lines with innovations and technologically advanced initiatives 
Discover Financial s strong fundamentals continue to support its capital boosting initiatives  both in terms of debt and equity offerings  These initiatives have significantly contributed to the company s efficient capital deployment  Increase in dividend payments at regular intervals and frequent yet well planned share repurchases have also cemented investors  confidence on the stock  During the third quarter  Discover Financial spent nearly  582 million to buy back 10 1 million shares 
However  the company s Payments Service segment continues to underperform  A previously announced loss of volume from a third party debit issuer continues to affect this segment s revenues  The segment s revenues net of interest expenses for the first nine months of 2016 dropped 4  to  205 million  mainly due to a fall in PULSE volume 
Also  the company faces stiff competition from credit card industry giants like Visa Inc    NYSE V    MasterCard Inc    NYSE MA   and American Express Co    NYSE AXP    which might limit its business  As a result  Discover Financial undertakes several marketing and business development initiatives to stay competitive  This in turn escalates expenses for the company  In addition  costs incurred due to several anti money laundering program enhancements  other planned marketing  technology and infrastructure investments and high legal  regulatory and compliance costs raise concerns

162181,383697,AXP,Airports go slow on Delta s plans to expand VIP security lanes,news,By Jeffrey Dastin NEW YORK  Reuters    As travelers face long waits for U S  airport security checks  Delta Air Lines Inc  NYSE DAL  wants to expand limited access lanes to allow its top fliers   and anyone who pays a fee   to jump to the front of the line  But some airport managers are balking at the idea  saying they don t have the room or don t want to do anything that may compound delays for regular fliers  Houston s two main airports plan to drop the program next year  Eleven other airports have the expedited lanes operated by CLEAR  a private company  For  179 a year  CLEAR checks users  identities and links them to iris scans and fingerprints  At the airports  CLEAR employees verify customers  identities and escort them to the U S  Transportation Security Administration  TSA  screening area   bypassing other travelers  Delta  which bought a 5 percent stake in CLEAR in April  wants the service to expand into its U S  hubs  Delta also plans to discount CLEAR for frequent fliers and make it free for customers who spend  15 000 and accrue 125 000 miles in a year  The No  2 U S  airline in passenger traffic said it wants to increase the use of CLEAR because  customers tell us their time is valuable   But representatives of several airports told Reuters they had concerns about adding or expanding the service  An official with Houston s Bush and Hobby airports said CLEAR lanes were little used   frustrating other travelers waiting in line   LIKE PLATINUM  At a time when travelers scour websites for bargain airfares  Delta is trying to stand out as a high end brand with unique services and infrequent flight cancellations  Chief Executive Ed Bastian said he believes the strategy will allow the airline to command higher prices   Our product is not a commodity   Bastian told analysts on an April conference call  CLEAR has succeeded in some places  At California s San Jose International Airport   where 100 to 300 people use CLEAR lanes each day  compared to 17 000 or more in the regular lines   it s a hit with technology executives  said the airport s Deputy Director of Airport Operations Bob Lockhart  In Orlando  where CLEAR first opened  the program has its own entry into security   There was a joke in Orlando that a CLEAR card was flashed like Platinum  American Express   NYSE AXP    said Carolyn Fennell  spokeswoman for the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority  But Charlie Leocha  chairman of consumer advocacy group Travelers United  said it was  a shame that regular travelers get to be treated as second class citizens   Long lines have been a frustration to frequent travelers like Matt Adams  33  who flew through San Francisco International Airport earlier this week  Some lanes  are not really managed effectively  while others are backed up   said the software analyst departing San Francisco for New York  David Cohen  CLEAR s Chief Administrative Officer  bristled at the notion that the service was elitist  Anybody can buy it  and CLEAR offers promotional rates for first time users  he said   The CLEAR lane from our perspective is not unlike that toll road that anyone has an opportunity to use   Cohen said  JAMMED AIRPORTS Acute security delays at airports this spring have been blamed on a good economy and bad planning  It began when the TSA opened applications for its own expedited security program  PreCheck  in 2013  For  85 every five years  pre screened travelers keep their shoes on and laptops stowed  moving through security checks three times as fast  The TSA aimed for 25 million people to sign up for pre vetting and cut agents accordingly  As it turned out  about 10 million travelers have enrolled  On top of that  screening lapses prompted the agency to reduce its practice of pulling fliers from long security lines into under used PreCheck lanes  As a result  the TSA has not realized the staffing efficiency it expected  In addition  travel has surged as the economy recovered  This year  the TSA projects it will screen 15 percent more people than in 2013  with 12 percent fewer agents   Graphic     Amid the outcry over the ensuing bottlenecks  the TSA replaced Kelly Hoggan  head of its Security Operations Office  and it won funding to hire 768 more agents  The TSA is hoping to contract more vendors to enroll people in PreCheck   an opportunity CLEAR is interested in  Cohen said  Airlines also are responding  Delta  American Airlines Group Inc and United Continental Holdings Inc are each adding  4 million to what they typically spend on workers to help TSA agents with non screening tasks  such as restocking bins   Any new CLEAR lanes must be approved by airport managers  airlines that share a terminal and the TSA  Several managers said they weren t interested   at least for now   We just don t have room   said Peter Higgins  director of airport operations at Delta s Salt Lake City hub  But  a spokeswoman added later  the airport is looking at its options  CLEAR plans to expand in coming months  Cohen said   It has approached Los Angeles  a focus city for Delta  according to a source familiar with the matter  But airport managers there have yet to be convinced that demand for the service merits the space  the source said  Los Angeles World Airports declined to comment  Managers of Delta s Seattle hub hope to have a contract with CLEAR soon  according to a spokesman  At its Minneapolis hub  talks are ongoing   We re not quite ready yet to sign on the dotted line   said Patrick Hogan  a spokesman for the airports commission in Minneapolis   We don t want to add a CLEAR line that then squeezes out someone else

162202,383718,AXP,iFOREX Daily Analysis   October 21  2016,opinion,"The dollar bounced back to a fresh seven month high against the other majors currencies on Thursday  after slipping briefly  as markets digested comments by European Central Bank president Mario Draghi  as well as a string of mixed U S  data 
The U S  National Association of Realtors reported on Thursday that existing home sales increased by 3 2  in September  to 5 47 million units  from 5 30 million in August  while the consensus forecast was for a 0 4  advance to 5 35 million units  The data came after the U S  Department of Labor said initial jobless claims increased by 13 000 in the week ending October 15 to 260 000  from the previous week s total of 247 000  while analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 4 000 to 250 000 last week  In addition  the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its business conditions index came in at 9 7 this month  down from 12 8 in September  while economists had expected a reading of 5 3 this month 
Elsewhere  the ECB left interest rates unchanged at record lows of zero and held its quantitative easing program unchanged at  80 billion per month  and  in a subsequent press conference  ECB President Mario Draghi said the central bank would wait for updated economic forecasts in December to make a decision  and that it had not discussed either tapering the size of its asset purchase program  or extending the horizon of the purchases 
Today the U K  is to release data on public sector borrowing  while Canada is to round up the week with reports on retail sales and inflation 
EUR USD
The euro fell to four month lows against the dollar in volatile trade on Thursday  after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi indicated that an adjustment to the banks stimulus program could come in December 
Earlier Thursday  the ECB left interest rates across the euro zone unchanged at record lows of zero and kept the deposit facility rate at  0 4   The single currency initially popped higher after Draghi said the ECB did not discuss a tapering its asset purchase program  or the possible horizon at which stimulus might end at its meeting 
But the euro quickly turned lower after Draghi indicated that an adjustment to the bank s stimulus program could come in December  because he added that the euro zone economy is continuing to post a  moderate recovery  and a gradual rise in inflation  and  furthermore  he said that also the euro area continued to show  resilience  to economic and political uncertainty  in the aftermath of the June 23 vote by Britain to exit the European Union

162232,383748,AXP,U S  indicts Iranians for hacking dozens of banks  New York dam,news,By Dustin Volz and Jim Finkle WASHINGTON BOSTON  Reuters    Seven Iranian hackers conducted a coordinated cyber attack on dozens of U S  banks  causing millions of dollars in lost business  and tried to shut down a New York dam  the U S  government said on Thursday in an indictment that for the first time accused individuals tied to another country of trying to disrupt critical infrastructure  It said the seven accused were believed to have been working on behalf of Iran s government and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard  Those named live in Iran and the Iranian government is not expected to extradite them  There was no immediate comment from Tehran  At least 46 major financial institutions and financial sector companies were targeted  including JPMorgan Chase  N JPM    Wells Fargo   N WFC  and  American Express   N AXP   the indictment said  AT T  N T  also was targeted  The hackers are accused of hitting the banks with distributed denial of service attacks on a near weekly basis  a relatively unsophisticated way of knocking computer networks offline by overwhelming them with a flood of spammed traffic   These attacks were relentless  they were systematic  and they were widespread   U S  Attorney General Loretta Lynch told a Washington news conference  The indictment from a federal grand jury in New York City said the attacks occurred from 2011 to 2013  Washington has previously accused military officers from China and the North Korean government of cyber attacks against U S  businesses   The attack on the Bowman Avenue Dam in Rye Brook  New York  was especially alarming  Lynch said  because it represented a known intrusion on critical infrastructure  A stroke of good fortune prevented the hackers from obtaining operational control of the flood gates because the dam had been manually disconnected for routine maintenance  she said  The Bowman hack was a  game changing event  for the U S  government that prompted investigators to uncover other systems vulnerable to similar attacks  said Andre McGregor  a former FBI agent and a lead case investigator on the dam intrusion   The investigation s discovery of many more exposed computer systems with vulnerable management consoles is a constant reminder that basic cyber hygiene remains at the forefront of the battle against cyber attacks   said McGregor  now director of security at Tanium  a Silicon Valley cyber security firm   We must step up our counter hacking game ASAP to deal with threats from places like Iran and would be terrorists   said New York Senator Chuck Schumer in a statement  Cyber security experts and U S  intelligence officials have grown more alarmed in recent months by the possibility of destructive hacks of critical infrastructure such as dams  power plants and factories  Some have said a December cyber attack on the Ukraine s energy grid that caused a temporary blackout of 225 000 should serve as a wake up call  LONG MEMORIES The defendants were identified as Ahmad Fathi  Hamid Firoozi  Amin Shokohi  Sadegh Ahmadzadegan  Omid Ghaffarinia  Sina Keissar and Nader Seidi  all citizens and residents of Iran  They are accused of conspiracy to commit computer hacking while employed by two Iran based computer companies  ITSecTeam and Mersad Company  Firoozi also is charged with obtaining and abetting unauthorized access to a protected computer  The indictments are the latest attempt by the Obama administration to more publicly confront cyber attacks carried out by other countries against the United States  The campaign began two years ago when the Justice Department accused five members of China s People s Liberation Army with hacking several Pennsylvania based companies in an alleged effort to steal trade secrets  It continued with President Obama s vow to  respond proportionally  against North Korea for the destructive hack against Sony Pictures    An important part of our cyber security practice is to identify the actors and to attribute them publicly when we can   Lynch said Thursday   We do this so that they know they cannot hide   U S  officials largely completed the investigation more than a year ago  according to two sources familiar with the matter  but held off releasing the indictment so as to not jeopardize the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with Iran or a January prisoner swap  Even though Iran is not expected to extradite the suspects  FBI Director James Comey vowed to pursue justice   The world is small and our memory is long   he said at the news conference with Lynch  Dmitri Alperovitch  chief technology officer with cyber security firm CrowdStrike  said   This sends an important message to Iran and other governments that these people cannot operate anonymously   The U S  and Israel launched a cyber attack against Iran in 2010  now famously known as the Stuxnet worm  in order to disable Iran s nuclear centrifuges  Some security researchers and officials have long suspected the attacks against U S  banks and the dam were done in part as retaliation  Separately  the U S  Treasury Department blacklisted two Iranian companies on Thursday for supporting Iran s ballistic missile program and also sanctioned two British businessmen it said were helping an airline used by Iran s Revolutionary Guards   Corrects paragraph 1 to say hackers did not break into computers

Figures 1 and 2 show the five best and worst rated ETFs and mutual funds in the style  Not all All Cap Blend style ETFs and mutual funds are created the same  The number of holdings varies widely  from 4 to 3638   This variation creates drastically different investment implications and  therefore  ratings

American Express  NYSE AXP   64 share  is one of our favorite stocks held by SVFYX and earns an Attractive rating  We ve previously featured AXP and proposed a strategy that could boost its value by  50 billion  which   Since 2009  AXP has grown after tax profit  NOPAT  by 13  compounded annually  The company has improved its return on invested capital  ROIC  from 9  in 2009 to 13  over the last twelve months while generating cumulative  16 6 billion in free cash flow over the last five years  However  AXP remains undervalued and presents significant upside potential  At its current price of  64 share  AXP has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 0 9  This ratio means that the market expects AXP s NOPAT to permanently decline by 10  from current levels  If AXP can grow NOPAT by just 2  compounded annually over the next decade  the stock is worth  85 share today   a 33  upside 
Reliance Steel   Aluminum Company  RS   76 share  is one of our least favorite stocks held by All Cap Value ETFs and mutual funds and earns a Dangerous rating  Over the past decade  Reliance s NOPAT has not meaningfully increased and over the last five years has declined by 4  compounded annually  The company s ROIC has deteriorated from a once impressive 15  in 2005 to a bottom quintile 3  over the last twelve months  Despite the struggles noted above  RS remains overvalued  To justify its current price of  76 share  RS must grow NOPAT by 10  compounded annually for the next 13 years  This expectation seems rather optimistic given that lack of profit growth over the prior decade

162301,383817,AXP,Book Review  Inside The Investments Of Warren Buffett,opinion,"I have no idea how many books have been written about Warren Buffett  but sometimes I have the feeling that he is giving George Washington a run for his money  The latest addition to the literature is Yefei Lu s Inside the Investments of Warren Buffett  Twenty Cases  Columbia Business School Publishing  2016  
Lu examines 20 investments Buffett made over the course of his career that  in Lu s opinion   had the largest material impact on his trajectory   He puts himself in the shoes of imaginary investment analysts  studying the businesses at the same time   Buffett did   Why would an ordinary analyst either recommend or  as would often have been the case  argue against investing in a company to which Buffett eventually opted to commit funds 
The book is divided chronologically  five investments between 1957 and 1968  the years of Buffett Partnership Limited    nine investments between 1968 and 1990  and six after 1990  I found the first section the most interesting  both because it was the period I knew the least about and because it shows Buffett s willingness to pursue a variety of analytical and risk management strategies  perhaps even some long short pairs trades  Here I will limit myself to Buffett s activities when he was running BPL 
The five investments Lu chooses as illustrative of Buffett s investing during this period are Sanborn Map Company  Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company  Texas National Petroleum Company  American Express  NYSE AXP   and  of course  the ill fated Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  
Sanborn Maps produced maps primarily for fire insurance companies  Its maps  included details of not only streets and houses of a city but also such items as diameter of water mains underlying streets  number of windows  elevator shafts  the material of construction for buildings  and production lines for industrial facilities  The commercial product sold to its customers would typically be a large volume of maps that weighed approximately fifty or so pounds    Sanborn was a successful company  with steady revenues  until the 1950s  when a new technology   carding   threatened to undermine its existence  By 1958  when Buffett began investing in Sanborn  the company was struggling  Between 1950 and 1958 net income had declined approximately 10  per annum  Why  then  would Buffett have been interested in it  First  it had a securities portfolio worth more than the value of the entire company and  second  Buffett believed it could be turned around  Buffett was an activist investor in this instance  Over the course of three years he acquired a controlling interest and separated the company into two separate entities  Sanborn Maps exists to this day 
Dempster Mill  a Nebraska based company  sold windmills and assorted agricultural equipment such as seed drills and fertilizer applicators  In the 1950s windmills were anything but a growing business  Buffett wrote that Dempster Mill s  operations for the past decade have been characterized by static sales  low inventory turnover and virtually no profits in relation to invested capital   But Buffett could buy the company s stock at a significant discount  on average 63   to book value  the bulk of its assets could be readily sold and turned into cash  and with better management it could be revitalized  Once again  Buffett played the role of activist investor  a role it turned out he didn t enjoy and came to abandon 
The next two investments were different  Texas National Petroleum was a special situation  It had an offer to be acquired but had not yet accepted the offer  American Express  a growing business then best known for its travelers cheques  was reeling from the  salad oil swindle  and faced  unknown and potentially enormous liabilities   Judging the ramifications of the scandal to be temporary  Buffett was willing to forgo the  cigar butt  strategy and pay a fair price for a really good business  As for Berkshire Hathaway  although it is often viewed as a mistake   the shrinking business actually provided the capital with which Buffett would invest in many other businesses starting in 1967 with the purchase of National Indemnity   And so  Lu concludes   it likely did not actually lose money for Buffett in absolute terms   And it provided Buffett with an iconic name ",2016-07-31,Brenda Jubin,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/lu,-inside-the-investments-of-warren-buffett-200145190",200145190

 Backpage has significantly lowered the barrier to entry for would be traffickers   said Dart  adding he will reveal details of a larger initiative against Backpage at a news conference on Wednesday 
MasterCard spokesman Seth Eisen said in an email that the company has rules that prohibit its cards from being used for illegal or brand damaging activities 
Backpage is a classified advertising website that offers forums to find roommates and sell goods  like other sites  but its primary revenue stream is through its adult page  according to Dart s office

	Have times changed since Buffett was investing in the 1970s which makes his advice less applicable to today s market 

	And does the size of Berkshire Hathaway  which is a large cap  mean that Buffett can no longer invest in the small cap value names he was famous for 

	Brian does like one aspect of Buffett s investing advice and that s the buy and hold strategy but thinks the  hold  part is the most difficult for most investors  Tracey s not a fan of the large cap dividend paying stocks that seem to dominate Berkshire s stock portfolio now 

	Tracey and Brian discuss what stocks they like now  hint  they aren t IBM  

	Brian likes the disruptor technologies like the lending companies such as OnDeck Capital  ONDK  and Lending Club but also is a fan of the old line companies like Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  if you re investing for the long haul and looking for a dividend 

	Tracey  following Buffett s lead  likes companies with well known brands such as Snap On  SNA  and Bank of the Ozarks  OZRK

Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that TrueCar is likely to beat estimates this quarter as it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 16 cents per share  Hence  the difference is 0 00  
Zacks Rank  TrueCar currently has a Zacks Rank  3 which when combined with a 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

162431,383947,AXP,The Best And Worst Of The Financial Sector Q2 2016,opinion,"Sector Analysis 2Q16
The Financials sector ranks sixth out of the ten sectors as detailed in our 2Q16 Sector Ratings for ETFs and Mutual Funds report    the Financials sector ranked seventh  It gets our Neutral rating  which is based on aggregation of ratings of 38 ETFs and 249 mutual funds in the Financials sector as of April 15  2016  See a recap of our  
Figures 1 and 2 show the five best and worst rated ETFs and mutual funds in the sector  Not all Financials sector ETFs and mutual funds are created the same  The number of holdings varies widely  from 21 to 572   This variation creates drastically different investment implications and  therefore  ratings 
Investors seeking exposure to the Financials sector should buy one of the Attractive or better rated ETFs or mutual funds from Figures 1 and 2

Schwab Financial Services Fund  SWFFX  is excluded from Figure 2 because its total net assets  TNA  are below  100 million and do not meet our liquidity minimums 
iShares US Financial Services  NYSE IYG  is the top rated Financials ETF and Fidelity Select Banking Portfolio  FSRBX  is the top rated Financials mutual fund  Both earn a Very Attractive rating 
iShares Residential Real Estate Capped  NYSE REZ  is the worst rated Financials ETF and Rydex Series Real Estate Fund  RYREX  is the worst rated Financials mutual fund  REZ earns a Dangerous rating and RYREX earns a Very Dangerous rating 
595 stocks of the 3000  we cover are classified as Financials stocks 
American Express  NYSE AXP   62 share  is one of our favorite stocks held by IYG and earns a Very Attractive rating  We previously published a case study outlining how AXP could boost its value by  50 billion by making strategic decisions to boost return on invested capital  ROIC   Over the past six years  American Express has grown after tax profit  NOPAT  by 6  compounded annually  At the same time  the company has improved its ROIC from 12  in 2005 to a top quintile 20  in 2015  However  some short term issues  which we identify in our case study have left AXP undervalued  At its current price of  62 share  American Express has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 0 9  This ratio means that the market expects American Express  NOPAT to permanently decline by 10   If AXP can  instead  grow NOPAT by 6  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth  98 share today   a 58  upside 
Essex Property Trust  NYSE ESS   225 share  is one of our least favorite stocks held by REZ and earns a Very Dangerous rating  Essex earns its rating in large part to its misleading earnings  Over the past decade  GAAP net income has grown by 11  compounded annually  However  Essex s economic earnings  its true cash flows  have declined from  7 million to   249 million over the same time period  Further highlighting the deterioration of Essex s operations  the company s ROIC has halved from 8  in 2005 to a bottom quintile 4  in 2015  GAAP earnings have propped up shares for too long  and ESS remains overvalued  In order to justify its current price of  225 share  Essex must grow NOPAT by 12  compounded annually for the next 11 years  After a decade of shareholder value destruction  the expectations baked in ESS remain too high

162453,383969,AXP,Waddell And Reed Stock Set To Soar ,opinion,"In the past few months I wrote about oil being at low levels and how I was buying up stocks like Chevron  NYSE CVX   Oil was at 2003 low levels and now oil company stock prices are steadily increasing  and I m glad I locked in their dividends at great prices 
Now I m going to do the same thing with another sector  financials  Last month I wrote about American Express  NYSE AXP  stock and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   Financials have performed very poorly so far this year  Here are some stats  all from January 1st 
Wells Fargo  Down 9 
American Express  Down 8   I bought when it was down over 20  
JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   Down 4 
Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   Down 16 
But there s one stock that really piqued my interest  I pulled out the 10 Ks  the 10 Qs  and got to work  It s down 20  since January 1st  and nearly 70  since March 2014 
Who would ever think of catching such a falling knife  What company is this 
It s Waddell   Reed Financial Inc  NYSE WDR  
Waddell and Reed stock is trading at prices not seen since 2010  One could make the case that the stock was essentially flat during the  lost decade  of 2000 to 2010  but I m pulling one of my favorite tactics of all time and locking in a solid dividend  Waddell and Reed currently pays over an 8  dividend yield  and it has been increasing the dividend since going public  eighteen years ago  The best part is that the dividend seems sustainable even if profits decrease 
That s not even the best part  The best part is that the stock s actual dividend yield hasn t been this high since 2008  when the world was coming to an end  By 2010  the dividend was back about 2   My point is you have to strike when opportunity presents itself  and I believe that a great opportunity to invest in Waddell and Reed is presenting itself 
On a personal note  I know a few Waddell and Reed financial advisors and I m familiar with the company structure  Yes  commissions are paid  and yes there are incentives  I could paint with a broad brush and recommend a low cost index fund for everyone on the planet  but the financial advisors at Waddell and Reed are there for personalized service  The company has a wonderful force of advisors with great training  Not everyone is concerned about low cost funds or beating the market   a few customers  some I know  just want their hands held and a phone call during corrections telling them not to panic  Robo advisors and ETFs may be increasing their market share  but there are millions of investors who want the traditional fund model  Did somebody say baby boomers 
The Department of Labor recently released a new fiduciary rule that should level the playing field for retirement account advice  This new rule requires advisor to put clients  best interest first and requires that advisors be able to demonstrate that the clients  best interests are being served  This is different from the  suitability  standard that was used for years 
I think that the market as a whole has overreacted to this fiduciary rule  which has been rumored for quite some time  The industry might completely shift towards a fee based model based on assets under management rather than commissions received on transactions  The market must ve thought   No commissions   The stock is worthless   But honestly  most investors are savvy to commission hungry salespeople  so this should ve been accounted for long ago  The rule is  do right by your clients 
As a company  Waddell and Reed has relatively low debt  Its quick ratio is 2 75  which lets me know that it has enough cash to pay off short term debts  In a nutshell  this lets me know that the company isn t going out of business tomorrow  It has been around since 1937  so I wasn t very worried in the first place  but it s nice to know  The P E is currently in the sevens  which is low when compared to other financial services companies  The stock has solid fundamentals  a strong history  a juicy dividend  and it s at what appears to be a bargain price  I m not sure why you wouldn t buy

A solid jobless claims released ahead of trading supported the belief that the U S  economy is doing well  leading many to consider the Federal Reserve s upcoming interest rate hike  Improving labor offers proponents of the interest rate hike more credibility and a stronger case  The latest comments from the Federal Reserve officials point towards a 1  hike in September before committing to more significant raises  Additionally  the nonfarm payroll report is calculated in part with the use of the jobless claims report  leading some analysts to expect a strong NFP report with 252 000 new jobs on August 7 
A surprise decline in Chinese manufacturing worsened the commodity rout  which has seen prices fall significantly  Copper fell to a six year low  while gold is at its lowest since 2010  The positive jobless claims supported the notion of a U S  interest rate hike  thus strengthening the dollar and limiting gold s safe haven appeal  as it suffers its longest run of losses since 2012  Crude oil tumbled past  50 per barrel and is currently trading at  48 71  after reports indicated that stockpiles have risen by nearly 2 5 million barrels last week  Currently  crude oil stockpiles are nearly 100 million barrels higher than the five year average

Greece can begin bailout talks  Greece s parliament approved new reforms that pave the way for Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to begin negotiating his country s third bailout  Parliament overwhelmingly approved the measures  but roughly a quarter of Tsipras  Syriza party voted against the reforms  Now Greece and its creditors will begin working out the details of the latest bailout package  the third for Athens in the past five years 
Nearly everyone agrees that Greek debt is unsustainably high  but that s where the agreement ends  The IMF on July 14th issued a report calling for debt relief  a 180 turn from their earlier demands of austerity  The monetary fund recommended either a  very dramatic extension  of payment deadlines by up to 30 years or  deep upfront haircuts   banker jargon for write offs 
Lots of headlines flew out of Asia overnight  Japan s exports increased the most in five months in June  fueled by strengthening overseas demand  but imports remained subdued due to the effect of lower commodity prices  South Korea s economy logged its weakest expansion in six years in Q2  recording just 0 3  growth from the previous quarter  as the country got battered by a MERS outbreak and a severe drought  Heading south  New Zealand s central bank cut interest rates by a quarter point for the second time in six weeks  stating further easing would likely be necessary to stoke inflation  The cut was less than anticipated  and short sellers were squeezed as the kiwi unexpectedly rallied 
President Obama is urging lawmakers to renew the charter for the Export Import Bank before leaving on a break in August  saying both small and large businesses are hurting from the lapse in new loan guarantees and trade insurance  The 81 year old institution recently saw its charter conclude  after Congress allowed it to expire on June 30  The Ex Im Bank is still allowed to manage and wind down its portfolio of loans  but cannot enter into any new deals 
The U S  leading economic index rose 0 6  in June  The Conference Board said the index indicates  continued strength in the economic outlook for the remainder of the year   A strong reading for housing permits and the interest rate spread led the LEI s growth 
New applications for US unemployment benefits declined by 26 000 to 255 000 in the seven days ended July 18   the lowest level since 1973  New claims have been under key 300 000 since late February  the longest run in 15 years  The data should provide ammunition for those Federal Reserve officials who have been pushing for higher interest rates 
Oil prices have officially moved into bear territory  From the high on June 10th  WTI oil has dropped just over 20   Of course  oil is still down about 57  from the highs reached a year ago before the crash  And crude is also still above the lows of the crash near  43 per barrel 
Data from the American Petroleum Institute showed a weekly build in inventories that topped forecasts  And the Energy Information Administration s weekly data showed a build in stockpiles last week after two periods of declines  Meanwhile  12 member oil cartel OPEC continues to exceed its production targets to maintain its share of the market  OPEC member Iran is gearing up to boost exports following its deal with world powers that would lift economic sanctions 
Here s the twist  As oil prices dropped over the past year  demand increased by 1 6 million barrels a day  despite the slowdown in China  Meanwhile  since October  the number of rigs actively drilling for new oil around the world has declined about 42 percent  More than 70 000 oil workers have lost their jobs globally  and in 2015 alone  listed oil companies have cut about  129 billion in capital expenditures  US oil production did not drop  it just leveled off  even as OPEC has increased production to over fill the void 
Oil s fall is also part of a larger rout in commodities  Copper slumped to a six year low  The number of requests to withdraw copper from London Metal Exchange warehouses relative to the level of global inventories tracked by the bourse dropped this week to the lowest since March 2013  That shows consumption has almost dried up for the stockpiles that have doubled over the past year 
Copper is an industrial metal used in everything from buildings to cars and more  so it serves as an indicator for what s to come in raw materials and as a gauge of global expansion  Copper prices have long held the position in some investor s minds as a viable economic indicator  So strong is this belief that many call it  Dr  Copper   as in PhD in Economics   The reality is somewhat different  Over the past 4 years  copper has been in a nasty downturn  even as the economy and the stock market have been improving  Dr  Copper is not good for predicting economic activity  but it might be good at reflecting speculation in the copper market 
Meanwhile  a chorus of institutional investors are now singing out against the China market  The Chinese government had tried to lure foreign money by creating A shares  making it easier for foreign investors to buy mainland listed stocks directly  and for a while  it worked  The stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzen shot up like a rocket  doubling in less than a year   only to fall like a rock  Overseas investors have pulled cash out of Chinese stocks via a trading link between Hong Kong and Shanghai for 12 of the past 13 trading days  The list of hedge fund managers running from Chinese markets reads like a who s who  Bill Ackman from Pershing Square  Paul Singer from Elliott Management  Richard Perry from Perry Capital  and Ray Dalio from Bridgewater  These are all recent cheerleaders for the Chinese markets 
You could see this coming from miles away  When an index  or even an individual security  experiences a massive spike in price  it becomes disconnected from fundamentals  and it is inevitable that it will stall  rollover  and plummet back to earth  Technical analysts call this a parabolic run or climax run  and it always seem to end the same way  Some agile short term traders are willing to make that gamble on the hope they can dump stocks at the first sign of weakness  The difference in China is that the government stepped in and essentially halted trading in about half the high flying stocks 
Between the end of June and early July  the Chinese government announced at least 40 measures to prop up the market  including an interest rate cut by the central bank and establishing a stabilization fund to outright buy stocks  all at a cost of about 10  of GDP  The rise and fall of the market over the past year may well have convinced many investors that the market is simply not a reliable investment vehicle  at the very least  it created a cap on growth moving forward  Earnings reporting season is in high gear  In the busiest day for profit reports  some 50 companies are releasing results today  Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  missed revenue expectations and cut it its full year revenue outlook to  49 billion from  50 billion 
3M  NYSE MMM  posted better than expected profits at  2 02 a share versus consensus estimates of  2 00  but missed on revenues  as the company lowered its full year outlook 
American Express  NYSE AXP  reported its second quarter earnings fell to  1 47 billion  or  1 42 a share  and revenue dropped 4   Amex beat profit estimates  but missed on revenue projections 
McDonald s  NYSE MCD  said same store sales were down 2  in the second quarter  reflecting negative traffic in all its major segments 
SanDisk  NASDAQ SNDK   which makes flash memory chips  reported lower revenue and profit  but quarterly results were better than Wall Street s much weaker expectations 
Dow Chemical  NYSE DOW  reported better than expected profit of  1 2 billion  but revenue of  12 9 billion missed Street estimates 
General Motors   NYSE GM  second quarter profit doubled  beating expectations at  1 1 billion  as the automotive company sold more trucks  SUVs  and crossover vehicles 
Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  swung to a profit of  1 1 billion in the second quarter  compared with a loss a year earlier  when it was fined  2 6 billion in the U S  for helping Americans evade taxes 
After the close  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  reported a profit  seriously  it was a small profit of  92 million on revenue of  23 2 billion  Shares of Amazon jumped 17  to  565 in after hours trading  which pushed the market capitalization up by  40 billion  meaning Amazon now has a larger market cap than Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   And don t even look at the P E ratio  you could get vertigo 
After delivering its third profit warning this year  Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  has declared it may break itself up and announced plans to slash 15  of its workforce  4 500 jobs   The move comes after hedge fund Jana Partners called for the company to spin off its chip business from its highly profitable IP licensing unit  Qualcomm also aims to reduce costs by about  1 4 billion and boost capital returns to shareholders

As an advocate for sound money  I am forever tormented by the egregious and overt growth of asset confiscation  The indirect tax from monetary inflation  bank bail outs and coming bail ins  moral hazard  two tiers of justice accompanied by the gradual conditioning of the masses toward acceptance and true self denial 
Yet along the way  we see little clearings  Echoes of a deeper truth attempting to spring forth  They haven t confiscated precious metals yet  We are still relatively free to buy them  And in their vain attempt to mask the inevitable fall of money  they ve made the price dirt cheap   not only relative to actual production   but relative to the amount of false debt and unbacked credit created
On other glimmer is the crossover realm where modern payment systems are meeting virtual currencies 
Like most things  if you aren t up on it  you are down on it  as in the case of virtual  electronic  or crypto currencies  But being up on it just makes it easier to see where it falls along the spectrum as we approach  move through  and beyond  the inevitable dollar crisis 
Technology will not go away  It will be needed to usher in the return of sound money   commodity money   or precious metal backed currency 
And we may be able to indirectly gauge the transition by how the government and it s banks respond 
Therefore  it bodes well to maintain an open awareness pertaining to the maturation of payment systems and the infancy of the new digital currency age 
Two stories recently shed some light here 
The first is the launch of BitGold  a new of a payment system that has commodity  gold  backing  The second was the first penalty delivered by the federal government against a crypto  or BitCoin like  currency 
Both raise questions that can t be answered without a crystal ball  but asking may at least triangulate a few rational outcomes or motivations  Reminiscent of its technologically more primitive and fallen predecessor eGold  BitGold promises to finally have the ultimate way to spend and transact in gold 
Though the BitGold press release emphasizes that BitGold is not a crypto currency like BitCoin  there are similarities  In particular  the BitGold platform allows for the quick settlement of gold trades so that a user s gold is easily acquired and accessible across various payment networks such as SWIFT  Visa  Mastercard  NYSE MA   Interac  SEPA  UnionPay  Discover  American Express  NYSE AXP  and others   including BitCoin 
But is this nothing more than a tool 
Perhaps an innovative math  Not a theorem  but a progression  Another financial innovation 
Beyond another  financial skimming opportunity   there is a hint of indirect value here 
The potential for expanding the general awareness that makes the simple distinction between currency and money is alluring  Intelligence is not a guarantee of justice  but it s nice to imagine the wave of technology and computer nerds contemplating this social injustice of unsound money and the abuse of power 
Are these payment systems here to stay  Whether it is a gold backed currency or a true  market backed  crypto currency  it is sobering to envision widespread adoption 
Is it pervasive  Don t see it  What does the tipping point for widespread adoption look like  The circumstances  Is it only disruptive so far in tiny circles including the big banks and government 
Feds slap virtual currency company with first penalty
Federal regulators this week levied a first of its kind penalty against a virtual currency company  The company  Ripple Labs  allows users to move both real and digital money but failed to register as a money service business 
The company   which manages its own crypto currency  called XRP   also failed to institute an adequate anti money laundering program  government officials said 
As punishment  the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network  FinCEN  slapped Ripple with a  700 000 penalty 
 Virtual currency exchangers must bring products to market that comply with our anti money laundering laws   said FinCEN Director Jennifer Shasky Calvery in a statement 
Federal watchdogs have stepped up digital currency oversight in recent years  as cyber crooks gravitate toward largely untraceable crypto currencies like BitCoin 
These virtual currencies can be exchanged for money or used to directly purchase goods and services  BitCoin has become the crypto currency of choice 
Advocates say it s beneficial to have alternatives to a government backed monetary system  But detractors counter that digital currencies have enabled cyber crooks to anonymously conduct business  Digital thieves can also store digital money in encrypted vaults  away from law enforcement officials 
These concerns caught FinCEN s attention  Last fall  the agency  warning BitCoin exchanges and digital payment processors that they could be considered money services  and thus subject to existing regulations 
Tuesday s action was the first enforcement made since the new guidelines dropped  FinCEN used the 1970 Bank Secrecy Act to justify its penalty  The law requires financial institutions to maintain transaction records and report suspicious activity 
 Innovation is laudable but only as long as it does not unreasonably expose our financial system to tech smart criminals eager to abuse the latest and most complex products   Calvery said 
Who is the Federal Crimes Enforcement Division 
FinCEN s director candidly expressed its mission in November 2013 as  to safeguard the financial system from illicit use  combat money laundering and promote national security  
FinCEN was established by order of the Secretary of the Treasury  Treasury Order Numbered 105 08  on April 25  1990  In May 1994  its mission was broadened to include regulatory responsibilities  and in October 1994 the Treasury Department s precursor of FinCEN  the Office of Financial Enforcement was merged with FinCEN 
From the FinCEN website 
 The primary motive of criminals is financial gain  and they leave financial trails as they try to launder the proceeds of crimes or attempt to spend their ill gotten profits  It is a network bringing people and information together  by coordinating information sharing with law enforcement agencies  regulators and other partners in the financial industry  
First of all  it s always good to step back and contemplate the actions of public enforcement  All we really have is what amounts to public relations  Internally  these agencies are obscure to say the least 
The framing of enforcement around criminal behavior is laughable in that the system they so desperately protect is made vulnerable  and fragile  by their policy to begin with  It is a policy that is ultimately much more damaging than what any outside criminal force could manage 
It is indeed ironic that the agency storyline above leans toward the benefits of saving us  when the government enforced free floating fiat world currencies in actuality   only saved them from us ",2015-05-18,Dr. Jeffrey Lewis,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/payments,-currencies,-and-broken-money-252038",252038

162514,384030,AXP,Short Term Panic  Long Term Profit,opinion,"There is always a crisis du jour  What sets successful investors apart from doomed to fail investors is the discipline to hold to a strategy of buying for the long term and a willingness to differentiate between what is merely transitory and what is likely to be a serious continuing trend 
After many years in this business  I have seen both types of investor and learned from the successes and failures of each  Those whose only measure of success is whether they are keeping pace with the S P 500 in one quarter or one year make the worst investors  They see investing success as a race in which their only goal is to beat one benchmark   and over the short term at that  When they fail to do so  they change their investing strategy like some companies change their business strategies  Coke isn t selling  Create  New Coke   Oops  that was a fiasco  Buy a big orange juice company  Not good enough  Let s get into bottled water  These market players change their tactical approach  their broker  their advisor  their newsletters or whatever every year   and still never find success 
Successful investors care less about beating the S P  the FTSE 100  the DAX  the Dow  the NASDAQ or any other benchmark  What they care about is 

 1  protecting what they have while understanding volatility will move their portfolio somewhat in either direction and
 2  over any 2 3 year or longer time frame  seeing improvement in their financial position 

They share our philosophy of  ratcheting  our gains  We understand that there will be periods sometimes long periods where we are frustrated by our inability to move ahead  alternating with periods where we leapfrog our most optimistic expectations  It s just the nature of the beast that is the stock market  When we review our out performance over the S P over the past 16 years through 2014  we are not surprised to see periods of stagnation and periods of significant elevation 
One of the big reasons for this is our willingness to take on what looks like excess risk like  say  buying European banks and insurers with exposure to Greece  But what looked like risk at the time is often opportunity for outsized gains as short term thinking panics some into selling at any price 
Yet  after most  crises   the various market participants come out of their fallout shelters the next day and find that the world hasn t descended into nuclear winter after all  Just take a look at a few of the most recent such instances  Greece  A pipsqueak of a crisis compared to these

November 22  1963  President Kennedy is assassinated

April 4 and June 6  1968  the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr  and  two months later  of Robert F  Kennedy 

Despite rioting in scores of cities  the Dow fell less than 1  on April 5   and actually rose 4 6  in the following week  When Robert Kennedy was shot  the market fell 1   but then recovered in the next few days

Which brings us to the question of the hour  Should you panic because Greek voters have decided they would rather default on their debt than face continued belt tightening 
My answer is  clearly not  Crises of the past  including World Wars and threats of nuclear annihilation  have been crystal clear in their lesson that the market is most likely to give you the opportunity to make a non emotional exit in the coming days and weeks if you choose to do so 
From my perspective  the greater investment risk would be to sell your portfolio in a panic   usually followed by staying out of the market for far longer than you should if you expect to maximize gains   Instead  you might consider doing what we do  find exceptional values in times of adverse market over reactions 
Think about the following facts about Greece and compare it to the crises you ve seen in the markets in your own lifetime 
While Greece s GDP doesn t rank high enough for the clever chart below  if it did it would rank on par with the Detroit Warren Livonia  MI Metropolitan Area 

Source  Statista
The chart below  courtesy of Don Dodge  shows the percent increase or decline in GDP for some key European nations since the financial crisis of 2008  Seven years later  only the UK  Germany  Belgium and France  in that order  have managed to increase their GDP  The worst of the others in this comparison  Italy  Portugal and Spain  are down just 10  or less  Only Greece has fallen precipitously  with its GDP down roughly 25  during these seven years

162545,384061,AXP,American Express quarterly profit rises as U S  card holders spend more,news," Reuters    American Express Co  NYSE AXP  the world s largest credit card issuer  reported an 8 1 percent rise in quarterly profit due to higher spending by U S  customers using its credit cards and a rise in its net interest income 
Spending by U S  holders of AmEx cards rose 9 percent in the third quarter  boosting profit in the business by 14 percent 
The business accounted for nearly three quarters of the company s profit 
U S  consumer spending rose 0 5 percent in August after being unchanged in July  the Commerce Department said last month 
AmEx  which issues its own cards unlike Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc that work through banks  benefits from its largely affluent customer base and low rates of default 
However  single digit growth in spending by its card users for about two years has pushed the company to launch products such as a fee free card that targets a wider range of customers 
The company s net income rose to  1 48 billion  or  1 40 per share  in the quarter ended Sept  30 from  1 37 billion  or  1 25 per share  a year earlier 
Net interest income rose 8 7 percent to  1 4 billion 
However  total revenue  net of interest expense  remained nearly unchanged at  8 33 billion 
Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault said AmEx s revenue was growing at a pace below the company s long term target   While the economy is stronger  it is not growing as fast or as steadily as most people would like   he said in a statement 
Analysts on average had expected a profit of  1 36 per share and revenue of  8 35 billion  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S

162560,384076,AXP,Airline Stock Roundup  Market Correction Not A Cause For Concern,opinion,"We are not too perturbed by the decline in stock prices of almost all the major carriers over the past week  We believe that this is part of the year end market correction  The NYSE ARCA Airline index was down 5 7  over the period 

We believe that fundamentals of the industry remain strong and stocks in the airline space should gain over the long term  We expect oil prices to remain weak as we enter into 2015  thereby benefiting carriers  Notably  fuel costs account for a major chunk of an airline s operating expenses 

Delta Air Lines  Delta Air Lines Inc  NYSE DAL   attracted attention during the past week with the encouraging long term outlook  driven by collapsing oil prices  at its investor day  The carrier was also in the news when it announced a new five tiered seating scheme to further improve its top line 

Apart from that  headlines were dominated by Southwest Airlines Co  s  NYSE LUV   decision to expand internationally  To attain this objective  the low cost carrier has sought approval from the U S  Department of Transportation to fly to six Latin American destinations from Houston s Hobby airport 

Senator Charles Schumer s demand for a federal investigation into expensive ticket prices despite weak oil prices also grabbed headlines  He has also asked for an investigation whether mergers have contributed to the high prices by limiting competition 

Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories

1  In a bid to boost its top line  improve customer satisfaction and convenience and counter competition  Delta Air Lines has announced that it will introduce a new five tiered seating plan from Mar 1  2015  This will replace the existing basic first class and coach seating schemes 

The carrier also announced at its investor day that it expects a net benefit of  1 7 billion in 2015 from falling fuel prices  Delta expects to grow system capacity by about 2  in 2015  The carrier projects a pretax profit in excess of  5 billion in 2015  up from the  4 5 billion forecasted in 2014  Pretax income was only  1 9 billion in 2013  Additionally operating margin in the range of 11 5  to 12 5  is projected for the fourth quarter of 2014 

Furthermore the carrier expects earnings per share to grow in the range of 10  to 15  after 2014  long term growth   Operating margin over the long term is projected in the range of 11  14  

Moreover  Delta extended its credit card deal with American Express Company  AXP   Following the extension  Delta will continue as the card accepting merchant and a participant in the Membership Rewards program with American Express

4  Senator Charles Schumer has questioned the logic behind air tickets being expensive despite plummeting crude prices  The senator has asked the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation to investigate into this apparent abnormality as fuel costs account for a significant chunk of an airline s operating expense 

5  Republic Airways Holdings Inc   NASDAQ RJET  was also in the news during the week when it amended its Capacity Purchase Agreement with Delta Air Lines to operate nine more 69 seat E170 aircraft  The planes under the amended agreement will become operational between the third quarter of 2015 and the second quarter of 2016  Each plane will operate for six years  Moreover  the carriers extended the terms of the deal pertaining to 14 E170 aircraft by four years  through Oct 2021  and the 16 E175 aircraft by five years  through Feb 2024  

Performance 

The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last 6 months 


The share prices of all the carriers baring Alaska Air Group  NYSE ALK  declined during the past week which we believe is due to overall market contraction as a part of the year end correction  Latin American carrier Copa Holdings SA  NYSE CPA  was the biggest loser in the period with its shares declining 14 6  in the period  However  over the last 6 months  most carriers have traded in the green  Hawaiian Holdings  Inc   NASDAQ HA  witnessed the highest upside  62 62   over the last six months compared to its peers

162563,384079,AXP,Frequent flyer schemes revamped to drive profits in tough times for airlines,news,"By Victoria Bryan BERLIN  Reuters    Beset by low air fares and relentless competition  airlines around the world are waking up to the value of their frequent flyer programs and realizing they can boost profits as well as brand profile 
A multitude of global carriers   preserved by complex cross border ownership rules that curb dealmaking   means that simply selling tickets is no longer lucrative  Industry body IATA predicts a 3 5 percent drop in fares this year and for airlines  net profit margins to reach just 2 4 percent 
As airlines dig around for new ways to make money  many of them are finding it buried deep in their marketing departments 
Dating back to American Airlines  launch of AAdvantage in 1981  FFPs were originally used to encourage a customer to spend their money with just one carrier by offering free flights as rewards once enough miles had been collected 
Nowadays  however  the programs  with their rich customer data  have become a currency of their own as airlines realize their value to companies such as credit card providers  hire car companies and hotels  An example  Delta  N DAL  commanded  675 million from American Express  N AXP  for its Skymiles in 2011 2013  according to Euromonitor analyst Nadejda Popova 
Those are not the only kind of deals to which airlines have turned  increasingly inventive as profits nosedive  In 2012 Germany s ailing Air Berlin  DE AB1  sold a 70 percent stake in its Topbonus program to Etihad for 185 million euros   247 72 million   more than the market value of the German company as a whole at the time  In 2013 an IPO of Smiles  SA SMLE3  helped Brazil s Gol  SA GOLL4  bring down net debt 
Now industry watchers expect more such deals  spin offs and stock market listings as airlines try to unlock more value from these businesses   and in turn drive more new revenues 
Brazil s Valor Economico newspaper reported recently that the country s third largest airline Azul Linhas Aereas could follow in the steps of rivals TAM and GOL by floating its TudoAzul frequent flyer program as a way of raising funds in the capital market  citing the program s director 
 The visibility you get from establishing it as a separate unit and the additional focus that it then has in terms of becoming profitable in its own right pushes it to generate revenue from sources other than the core FFP   Jonathan Wober  chief financial analyst at CAPA   Centre for Aviation  an independent aviation market analysis group 
VALUATION
Given that airlines often don t report separate figures  it s hard to say precisely what FFPs are worth  But the figures that are available show how richly valued they are 
When Air Canada  TO ACb  spun off 12 5 percent of its frequent flyer program in 2005 it was valued at C 2 billion   1 82 billion   or around 20 times its then annual profit of C 99 million  More recently  analysts have put a value of up to  2 5 billion on the loyalty division of Quantas  VX QAN    almost 10 times the unit s annual profit   as Qantas prepares to float or sell part of it under a restructuring 
There are benefits for those airlines that do make money too  Deutsche Lufthansa s  DE LHAG  new chief executive Carsten Spohr said last month that giving its frequent flyer program Miles   More an independent profile would lift the entire group s profitability and provide money needed for new planes 
Analysts at KPMG say it s worth an airline putting a program into a separate unit first before attempting a stock market flotation 
 For IPOs there are a lot of requirements when it comes to transparency  I would recommend letting the program report results for one or two years first so the market has access to numbers   Magnus Schenk  a transactions director at KPMG in Frankfurt  told Reuters 
RICH DATA
It s no surprise that investors are interested in FFPs for their data  What makes FFPs particularly sexy is the detail in that data  Not just a rich seam of customers  but a rich seam of rich customers 
 It s extremely powerful data  especially as it tends to be slanted towards the premium segment   said Marc Allsop  Senior Vice President and Head of Global Business Development at Aimia  TO AIM   which has stakes in a number of FFPs and runs other loyalty schemes including the Nectar supermarket plan in the UK and Italy 
Allsop told Reuters that in the UK  41 percent of those who are a member of an airline loyalty scheme have an annual income of above 90 000 pounds   151 164  
Still  he added  airlines face a tougher task than retailers when it comes to leveraging their data  because people fly far less often than they shop 
A way around this would be to keep tracking their customers once they leave the airport 
 Airlines sell tickets  tell people when they can check in  lead them on board and to their destination city  Then the next time passengers hear from them is when it s time to check in again   Stefan Auerbach  head of airline solutions at Lufthansa Systems  told an aviation conference in Frankfurt 
Instead  they could be using smartphone technology to track their customers as they travel onwards  gathering more information on their spending to tailor offers to their preferences  and increase the possibility that customers take them up  thus bringing in more revenue 
COSTING NEW FLYERS
Aimia s research showed that while 73 percent of consumers were part of supermarket loyalty schemes  just 12 percent were members of airline schemes 
Carriers such as Lufthansa and Emirates hope to attract more flyers  and make infrequent customers more regular  by offering the option to buy miles   to reach reward thresholds   or by offering smaller items like songs via iTunes to persuade them to cash in their points 
More customers  more profits  Maybe  Amid the scramble to boost their FFPs  airlines also have to remember to manage the trillions of unused award miles out there to make sure they don t suddenly get swamped with requests that could burden their yields  or how much profit they get per seat 
For despite airlines offering customers the chance to buy anything from language classes to cases of wine with their points  most people still just want to use their points for a free flight or an upgrade 
 I would rather spend 160 000 miles for a Lufthansa business class ticket than to take the same miles for five nights at a middle range hotel somewhere   said Dennis Glosik  an airline blogger and frequent flyer with Lufthansa

162589,384105,AXP,Amex set to face U S  in antitrust trial over credit card fees ,news,"By Andrew Longstreth NEW YORK  Reuters    American Express Co  N AXP  is set to face off against the U S  government and 17 states in a trial that begins on Monday over claims that it stifles competition from credit card providers that charge lower processing fees 
At issue in the trial  expected to last two to three months  are American Express rules that bar its millions of merchants from offering incentives for customers to use less expensive credit cards or cash when making purchases 
Amex  according to the government  charges the highest processing fees on average of any card network  In a pre trial brief  the government said merchants would testify that they would like to use discounts and other tools to promote competition among the card networks that would help them negotiate lower fees 
Amex asserts that the rules protect customers from price discrimination and have helped promote competition  court papers show 
The U S  Justice Department and several states sued Amex  Visa Inc  N V  and MasterCard Inc  N MA  in 2010  The latter two settled the case the same day it was filed  The states include Michigan  Ohio  Texas  Missouri  Maryland  Arizona and Iowa 
U S  District Judge Nicholas Garaufis of Brooklyn will preside over the non jury trial 
Amex claims it commands only 26 percent of the market  as defined by consumer spending  If debit cards are included  as Amex insists  its share would drop to 15 percent 
With such a small market share  Amex argues that it is incapable of harming competition  However  the Justice Department has said it can show that Amex s behavior had an  adverse  impact on competition  regardless of its market share

162596,384112,AXP,Majority Of Companies Disappoint On Revenue  Should You Rebalance ,opinion,On a quarterly basis  61  of companies tend to beat top line revenue numbers  However  corporations are only beating expectations by a paltry 39  for Q1 The revenue shortfall is not hard to explain  Multinational corporations are struggling to generate sales due to a slowdown in global growth  particularly in Europe and China  The modest achievement in earnings is not particularly difficult to explain either  Bottom line profit can be achieved by cutting costs  increasing worker responsibilities and implementing successful tax strategies  On the other hand  executives are less able to sweep revenue data under the proverbial rug Bulls don t seem to be bothered by surging price to sales ratios or the associated questions concerning valuation  If central banks around the world are lowering target interest rates  or printing money to buy bonds to lower actual rates  they see the backstop as unconditionally positive for high yielding assets and equities  What s more  if a slight majority of companies are still beating profit expectations  where s the price to earnings fire Bears are far less convinced  Simply stated  corporations will not ramp up their hiring if they don t have more sales to justify new employee acquisition  It follows that if genuine job growth remains elusive  consumers cut back on their spending  businesses hold on to their capital and even the recovering real estate sector might stall Are the revenue  misses  contained to certain segments  Not really  The market has already seen top line shrinkage from IBM  eBay  AT T  Procter   Gamble  Wells Fargo  American Express  Dover and dozens of other global participants As it relates to exchange traded fund investing  who will be correct in the weeks and months ahead  The bulls Or the safe haven seeking  long bond buying bears Perhaps ironically  neither camp may have an accurate grasp on what will happen going forward  The most likely scenario in the near term  Stocks will pull back for any combination of reasons  though analysts will look backwards to explain the corrective activity  Profit taking  revenue failure  euro zone debt troubles  budget battles  seasonal patterns  deepening global recession  China manufacturing slowdown   pick your venom  At that time  of course  we will hear from the high profile bears who make investors feel that the world itself is imploding Will the world implode  Will we see a repeat of 2008  Not this year  While the bears are mostly correct about the macro economic picture and its adverse effect on the micro economic revenue of corporations  they underestimate the coordinated determination of central banks around the globe  Not only do they have their collective act better together than they had during the systemic collapse of  08  but they re willing to step in when corrections jeopardize their goals In other words  forget all of the talk about the Fed  pulling the punch bowl  or the euro zone breaking into fragments in 2013  Granted  the summertime rhetoric may heat up and risk assets may very well tumble into correction territory  However  the central banks  e g   People s Bank of China  Bank of Japan  Bank of England  Federal Reserve  European Central Bank  etc   will maintain or accelerate their stimulus  The consequence  Demand for risk assets will return Investors and traders are left to ponder the possibilities  A trader may be wise to  gamble  on the high probability of a correction by selling a large percentage of risky assets here  near the all time market peak  The trader could purchase core index holdings at pre set values that are  5  10  or 15  below all time intra day highs  For example  a

162597,384113,AXP,Americans Are Giving Up On Certificates Of Deposit ,opinion,U S  retail savers are abandoning certificates of deposits  CDs   The amount of CDs outstanding that are  100K or smaller has been on a sharp decline since the recession  and is now at the lowest level since the Fed began keeping track of these balances The question is why  There have been a number of explanations  but few have been completely satisfactory  Here are some of them   1  Since the financial crisis banks have been less reliant on  wholesale financing   reducing incentives on term deposits  in some cases under the pressure from the FDIC   Indeed  the rate on CDs collapsed in 2009 The problem with this argument  is that CDs still carry better yields than money market funds  most overnight accounts  or treasury bills 2  After the financial crisis  people want to have access to their money immediately  while banks charge penalties for early withdrawals from CD accounts  This is certainly possible  but at the same time small investors are loading up on short term bond funds and ETFs  see post   And those products can definitely fluctuate in value enough to cause the equivalent  penalty  from early liquidation 3  People just don t have the cash to put into CDs  This explanation would make sense if it wasn t for the fact that savings account balances have been rising steadily since the recession 4  Savers don t trust banks with money they can t immediately withdraw  Again  it s a strange argument given the fact that all of these CDs are FDIC insured 5  Another explanation for this decline in CD balances is that in a number of instances  savings accounts may actually pay more  Some small banks  particularly credit unions  with limited retail presence want to attract customers by offering high savings rates  Non traditional banks like Ally  GMAC   CIT  American Express Bank  USAA Bank  etc  are also in this game  According to GoBankingRates com  see story   short term CDs often carry half or even less the interest you ll find on an online savings account  even though savings are more liquid  The problem with such savings accounts is that these are often  teaser rates  and banks can and often do lower the rate suddenly vs  a CD that locks the rate for a period  Also in many instances  particularly with credit unions  individuals can t open these accounts online and have to show up on location in person  But it does seem that  high yielding  savings accounts have been the preferred choice of at least some savers as they walk away from lower yielding certificates of deposits   6  Probably the most logical explanation is that for many people  getting 25bp in a 3 month CD vs  zero in a Chase overnight account  while massively better on a relative basis  isn t sufficiently different on an absolute basis  total dollars  to give up liquidity or warrant the paperwork of opening a CD account ,2013-05-11,Sober Look,https://www.investing.com/analysis/americans-are-giving-up-on-certificates-of-deposit-166519,166519

162611,384127,AXP,U S  stocks rally as Fed ditches rate hike target  Dow gains 1 11  ,news,"Investing com   U S  stocks rallied on Wednesday after the minutes from the Federal Reserve s March policy meeting revealed monetary authorities unanimously agreed to ditch a target it was preparing to use to raise interest rates 
At the close of U S  trading  the Dow 30 rose 1 11   the S P 500 index rose 1 09   while the Nasdaq index rose 1 72  
The Federal Reserve Board of Governors unanimously voted to scrap a threshold at which interest rates would rise once the unemployment rate hits 6 5   according to the minutes of the Fed s March policy meeting 
In the past  the Fed had indicated rates could rise when the unemployment rate hits or approaches 6 5  provided that figure accompanied a 2 5  inflation rate 
Today  the headline unemployment rate stands at 6 7   not far from the previous threshold  though inflation remains well below 2 5   prompting the Federal Reserve to do away with its rate hike target  which drew applause from Wall Street by allaying fears borrowing costs would rise while the economy still remained soft 
 Participants agreed that the existing forward guidance  with its reference to a 6 5  threshold for the unemployment rate  was becoming outdated as the unemployment rate continued its expected gradual decline   the minutes read 
 Most participants felt that the quantitative thresholds had been very useful in communicating policy intentions when employment was far from mandate consistent levels  but  with the economy having moved appreciably closer to maximum employment  the forward guidance should emphasize that the Committee is focusing more on a broader set of economic indicators  
Stocks shot up on the news  as Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said that policy must remain accommodative for some time to come 
The March policy meeting minutes reflected that stance 
 With respect to forward guidance about the federal funds rate  all members judged that  as the unemployment rate was likely to fall below 6 5  before long  it was appropriate to replace the existing quantitative thresholds at this meeting   the minutes read 
 Almost all members judged that the new language should be qualitative in nature and should indicate that  in determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 0 25  target range for the federal funds rate  the Committee would assess progress  both realized and expected  toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2  inflation

162666,384182,AXP,Banks Punished For Central Bank And Political Errors,opinion,In recent decades politicians have increasingly followed the Keynesian prescription of economic growth through continued government borrowing and the creation of undreamt of amounts of fiat money by central banks  To facilitate this process  the larger commercial banks have acted as the central banks  de facto distribution system  and as a result have grown ever larger while accepting progressively greater risks In 2008  potential catastrophe loomed as the entire international financial system was challenged with collapse  But  as the  darlings  of the central banks  the  too big to fail  banks were saved by taxpayer bailouts so that they could continue to play their role in the stimulus engine  But as a result of these distortions  the environment for those banks outside of the exclusive  too big to fail club  has been increasingly challenging  In the United States  the financial services industry is changing radically and many fear that the days of U S  dominance will be coming to an end Public ire resulting from the 2008 financial crisis largely missed politicians and central bankers and landed squarely on  Wall Street   As a result  bankers have become easy political targets  Increased regulation of the banking sector has become the rallying cry for the political left In addition to direct assaults on the banks  the ill designed 2010 Dodd Frank financial overhaul law has raised considerably the cost of entry to small entrepreneurial financial companies  Already  it is forcing the business of smaller financial companies offshore to the benefit of other countries Daniel Tarullo  an influential executive at the Federal Reserve Board  has suggested curbing bank growth by demanding a limit on the non deposit liabilities of banks  Too often  short term debt comprises the majority of these liabilities and is a source of potential vulnerability in a credit crunch  Meanwhile  some politicians have urged higher capital requirements in order to curb increasing bank size  Even ex bankers such as Sandy Weil who led the lobbying effort to abolish the Glass Steagle Act are now calling for its effective restoration  As a result  many corporations are deciding to leave the banking sector Companies for whom banking services provide an added benefit to their non bank clients are fearful of the threat of increased capital requirements and of new  as yet to be clarified  Federal Reserve banking regulations  As such  it is a classic example of how excessive and uncertain regulations are hurting American business and employment  A specific example is that of tax preparation firm H R Block  Years ago the company launched a service that provides some banking services to its customers  Recently they re evaluated that strategy and have engaged advisors Goldman Sachs to help them  evaluate strategic alternatives   In other words  they are looking to shed the unit  Those large banks that remain  firmly entrenched and supported by government guarantees  see little reason to provide cost effective services for retail clients  Most people with bank accounts in the United States will likely agree that in recent years banking fees have gone up while the level of service has gone down  This has resulted in private enterprise proposing innovative solutions  Recent moves by retail giant Walmart provides one example The Federal Deposit Insurance Commission  FDIC  pointed out some weeks ago  some 51 million Americans are  under banked   Worse  about 17 million are  unbanked   This implies a massive potential need for banking services for individuals at the lower end of the socio economic spectrum  Many such Americans do a great deal of their shopping at Walmart  which purveys a wide variety of merchandise at extremely low prices To provide a service to these potential customers  Walmart has announced an agreement with American Express to issue a prepaid debit card entitled  Bluebird   This will enable less well off consumers to purchase products from Walmart without surrendering their paychecks to a bank  thereby exposing themselves to high banking fees  or to put their purchases on conventional credit cards  which are notorious for high fees  As the service involves no extension of credit  Bluebird should provide cost effective service to the poor while involving no financial risk to either Walmart of American Express While Walmart s efforts may be timely and successful  the move will not reverse the fading glory of the U S financial services sector  In order to perpetuate its system of massive money distribution  the Fed has insured that American banking will become as competitive domestically and globally as American manufacturing  which is to say  not at all  By Euro Pacific Capital,2012-10-17,Euro Pacific,https://www.investing.com/analysis/banks-punished-for-central-bank-and-political-errors-140178,140178
162667,384183,AXP,Bernanke Said To Be Done And How The Tongues Wag,opinion,Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke  who has held that role since taking over for Allan Greenspan in 2006  looks set to step down in January 2014 at the end of his existing term  Bernanke has indicated to close friends that even if he was nominated  he would turn the job down and return to academia  No matter who wins the election  it looks as though the U S  will have a different Treasury Secretary and Federal Reserve Chairman in less than 15 months Political StakesThe news makes the upcoming presidential election that much more crucial for the future of economic policy in the United States  Mitt Romney  most likely due to pressure from the far right  has announced that he would not renominate Bernanke in any scenario and the news paves the way for him to select a more conservative candidate that appeals more to the right  In light of the news that the two top economic policy making positions will become vacant  let us look at potential successors for both Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Bernanke For the position of Treasury Secretary  one name has popped up for both candidates  Erskine Bowles  The namesake of the Simpson Bowles deficit reduction plan  Bowles is the former chief of staff under the Clinton administration  For President Obama  appointing Bowles would be a clear sign that deficit reduction is a top priority  whereas for Governor Romney a Bowles appointment would be a clear sign at attempting to reach across the aisle and have a bipartisan cabinet J P  Morgan Chase  JPM  CEO Jamie Dimon s name has been thrown around as a potential candidate for Obama  however the trading loss earlier in 2012 probably cost him his chance at a cabinet position  Blackrock  BLK  CEO Larry Fink has also had his name thrown around  but given his close relationship with Secretary Geithner and Blackrock s dealings with the government  it would look like a serious conflict of interest appointing Fink  however much he supports President Obama  Dark horse candidates for the position include Kenneth Chenault  CEO of American Express  AXP   Dan Doctoroff  CEO of Bloomberg LP and Jacob Lew  Obama s current chief of staff The Short ListFor the Federal Reserve Chairman  Larry Summers  name has been mentioned multiple times and his resume fits the bill of becoming a central bank Chairman  Also  current Vice Chairman Janet Yellen is on the short list  as is Allan Krueger  Don t rule out Geithner for this position though  as he is a career public servant and would surely love to return to the Fed where he had more control over decisions and less political influence than at the Treasury For Romney  Glenn Hubbard  who led the Council of Economic Advisors under President George W  Bush and advisor to the Romney campaign  looks set to land one of the two positions  most likely the Treasury position  Should he be appointed this position  the list for the Federal Reserve Chairman slot is rather limited to N  Gregory Mankiw  who also once led the Council of Economic Advisors  and John Taylor  an economist at Stanford Should Hubbard be given the Fed position  the list for Treasury Secretary becomes much longer  Robert Zoelick  former head of the World Bank and also former Managing Director of Goldman Sachs  GS  is most likely at the top of the list  followed closely by Rob Portman and Mike Leavitt  Portman is a senator from Ohio who has become close to Romney and has experience with budgetary matters as he was the Director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Bush  Leavitt  the former governor of Utah  is a close confidant of Romney s and is shoe in for some position in Romney s cabinet Few Bankers On ListOne key theme is the lack of bankers on this list  Jamie Dimon and Larry Fink are the only two names on the list as they are viewed as the best of the bunch  Even so  it seems nearly impossible that any banker could be appointed given sentiment surrounding Wall Street and the fear of the interwoven nature of Wall Street and Washington  No matter who gets selected  investors better hope for just one thing  a quick  smooth appointment and approval process  The longer the process gets dragged out in Congress  the more uncertainty it will create  and uncertainty never bodes well for stocks  c  2012 Benzinga com  Benzinga does not provide investment advice  All rights reserved ,2012-10-23,Benzinga,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bernanke-said-to-be-done-and-how-the-tongues-wag-140911,140911
162668,384184,AXP,Biderman s Daily Edge  There s No BLS Without  BS  ,opinion,Last week the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that 171 000 seasonally adjusted jobs were added in October  That initial estimate was based upon a survey of several hundred thousand mostly large businesses and virtually all government employers  and then is seasonally adjusted Mostly  BS How accurate are the BLS initial monthly job reports  They are mostly BS  For example  the BLS initially estimated that in August 96 000 seasonally adjusted jobs were added  Then this past Friday two months later  the BLS revised the initial August 96 000 to 192 000 new jobs  That means that the initial August number was revised by about 100   Is that a joke or what  Why would anybody invest money based upon an initial BLS number This morning Jack Welch  former GE honcho and now independent player  talked about the disconnect between the BLS reporting an October jobs pick up to 171 000 jobs and how flat his businesses are and have been  Welch also pointed out that the BLS jobs number includes seasonal adjustments that change year to year and sometimes vary by hundreds of thousands  year over year  And no explanations are ever made as to what the heck is going on The hopelessly outdated survey methodology and seasonal adjustment nonsense means the BLS data is as reliable as what passes for economic date coming out of China The Joke s On U S But  the joke is even worse and the ultimate joke is really on us  Real time data is available as to how many people are working right and how much they are making based the withheld income and employment taxes sent to the Treasury daily by all employers  That has been the basis for TrimTabs job and wage and salary growth estimates since the late 1990 s  And it works  The only problem is the BLS does not  or at least says they do not look at the real time data embedded in withholdings sent to the US Treasury Nor does the Bureau of Economic Analysis  which puts out National Income and GDP stuff  It appears government economists are happy with the way things are  Their methodology keeps lots of well paid economists gainfully employed  So what if the data they produce is garbage that is ultimately damaging the U S  economy  But hey  at least these government economists still have a job The  Senseless  BureauAnd then there is the truly garbage Census Bureau retail sales report  Do you know that right now anyone can buy aggregate real time sales data from Master Card  Visa  American Express  etc  at a combined annual cost of less than one government economist  Instead of real time data  the Census Bureau guesses at retail sales with a monthly survey of one out of every 166 retailers What follows is from the current Census Bureau Advance Monthly Sales   The estimates are based on a subsample  Approximately 5 000 retail and food services firms  are surveyed  whose sales are then weighted and benchmarked to represent the complete universe of over three million retail and food services firms   So the Census Bureau spensd millions surveying 5 000 retailers monthly and then guess Yes  after several years and all the income tax returns are analyzed the jobs and income numbers are accurate  But they certainly do not start out that way  Not even close Would you rather make investment decisions based upon real time data as to how many people are working  what industry they are working in  how much are they making  what are they are spending upon Or would you rather make investment decisions based upon US government initial data releases  It would be nice if we had a choice ,2012-11-06,Charles Biderman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/biderman’s-daily-edge:-there’s-no-bls-without-‘bs’-142496,142496

162729,384245,AXP,How To Invest In The Next Game Changer In Smartphones,opinion,Intelligence always moves to the edge of the network   That wasn t always true of the communications business  The only thing  smart  at either end of this network might be one of the callers  and that certainly varied  Phones used to be nothing more than a speaker  a microphone and set of buttons that sent audible tones that the system could recognize as numbers    Now  that has changed    The infrastructure of the nation s communications system is still home to some impressive technology  but the real genius is at the edge of the network    that is  the tablet devices and computers we use to process information and in the smartphones we use to communicate    After all  the smartphones we all have in our purses or pockets contain more capability than the computers NASA had at its disposal when Neil Armstrong was walking on the moon    The smart money invests at the edge of the network  The rest is just a commodity play   The single most important change that this network will undergo in the coming years is right at the edge  It is the integration of electronic commerce functionality into our smartphones    I have written extensively about this in my newsletter  Game Changing Stocks  and I will continue to  Simply put  I think it s the Next Big Thing   So far  I ve been telling my readers about the consumer side of the market  But what we really need to look at is the company that merchants rely on for the state of the art equipment that will allow for seamless smartphone transactions to take place     That company is Verifone  NYSE  PAY      It s the leading provider of hardware for electronic payment processing  And here s the thing  Nearly every one of the devices that you see on the merchant s counter will need to be replaced     There are two reasons for this  The first  Customers will be paying with highly secure near field communication chips instead of handing over their credit or debit cards  But the other trend that s going on at the same time is the mass unplugging of retail point of sale terminals    Well   unplugging  might be the wrong word  The enterprise system is still there  but they re increasingly running in the background  The sales clerk is just as likely to process the transaction with a portable device as to ask the customer to walk back to the cash register     Bottom line  Smartphone commerce and device toting sales clerks are going to mean a one two punch for Verifone s business  which I think is going to explode in the coming years    Major retailers such as Wal Mart  NYSE  WMT  and Target  NYSE  TGT  are already getting interested    It is my prediction that smartphone based commerce will become the fastest adopted technology in U S  history     Verifone started a trend of its own  The company  founded in 1981  came up with the first electronic credit card processing system  In the old days  the retailer took an imprint of your card sent the charge slips to the bank to be verified  As banks began to lower their credit standards for a credit card  retailers wanted to protect themselves from getting stiffed by customers who were over their limit  and Verifone s system was the first that allowed retailers to do that   But with every new technology that has come to market  Verifone has been there to take advantage of it  from new and innovative ways for customers to pay  to new and innovative ways for retailers to connect  It is the market leader with an unassailable industry position   The best reason to use a near field communication chip in lieu of a physical credit card is that you don t have to hand your account information to an unknown sales clerk  The transaction is totally secure and invisible to the clerk  With a smartphone based transaction  that won t be possible   Security is clearly a major concern  and complying with the stringent security requirements set forth by Visa  NYSE  V   Mastercard  NYSE  MA   American Express  NYSE  AXP  and other financial institutions is a huge moat for the Verifone business  The whole system runs on a secure proprietary operating system  That is a wall around this business that no other competitor can breach   Sales at this company are a billion a year  That s what the company pulls in keeping the existing retailer base supplied with hardware  When one considers the possibility that so many of those terminals need to be replaced with new technology  the numbers get impressive  and quickly   The thing to do is to beat the rest of the pack to the trade  Smartphone based commerce won t make headlines until it s implemented at Wal Mart  and I think these shares are worth owning well in advance of that date   While the company  with a market cap of  5 6 billion  is a little larger than my recommendation in Game Changing Stocks  its growth profile is just too sweet to ignore     Two other things to like about this stock      One  most of its shares are held by institutions  some 91   That means the shares that are traded each day are more likely than not to be the 9  held by individual investors  That s always nice    a less visible supply of shares means that the effect of good news will be magnified     The other aspect to like about this company is its increase in shareholder equity during the past three years  where the portion of the company owned by the shareholders has risen in value from  72 million to  1 1 billion  This is evidence of strong financial management and bodes well for the company s ability to translate market demand into an increased stock price  I don t know about you  but I like that  Risks to Consider  It is possible that this trend takes longer to develop than I predict  but I just don t see it not happening  That said  you should do additional research on this stock before committing to buying   Smartphone based commerce is an unstoppable trend  I like shares of Verifone at any price under  55  by Andy Obermueller,2012-05-04,StreetAuthority,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-to-invest-in-the-next-game-changer-in-smartphones-122236,122236

  Updates market action 
 By Richard Leong
 NEW YORK  July 21  Reuters    World stocks and the euro
rose on Thursday  after news of a plan to use the European
bailout fund to make cheap loans to Greece and other heavily
indebted governments in the euro zone region 
 The new proposal from the leaders summit in Brussels
reduced fears the debt crisis would spread to other euro zone
countries and led traders to cut their holdings of gold and
U S  and German government bonds 
 The European Financial Stability Facility  the euro zone s
bailout fund  will provide loans to Greece  Ireland and
Portugal at a lower interest rate and for longer maturities 
according to draft summit conclusions seen by Reuters 
 Loans from the EFSF will be extended from 7 5 years to at
least 15 years and the interest rate will be lowered from

 NEW YORK  July 21  Reuters    World stocks and the euro
rose on Thursday after news of a plan to use the European
bailout fund to make cheap loans to Greece and other heavily

Brussels reduced fears the debt crisis would spread to other

bailout fund  will provide loans to Greece  Ireland and
Portugal at a lower interest rate and for longer maturities

 NEW YORK  July 21  Reuters    World stocks and the euro
rallied on Thursday after news that Europe will create a fund
to make cheap loans to Greece and reports that Washington is
near a deal to shrink its budget and raise the debt ceiling 
 European officials at an emergency summit in Brussels

euros  while the European Financial Stability Facility  the

 NEW YORK  June 16  Reuters    U S  stocks rose in
volatile trading on Thursday  thanks only to technical factors
and options expirations  But raging uncertainty about Greece
prevented investors from committing money to the market 
 The impending expiration of stock index futures 
single stock futures  equity options and stock index options
for June    known as quadruple witching    created exceptional
volatility  pushing the S P 500 to swing more than 1 percent
from its session low to its intraday high 
 Greece kept a pall over investor sentiment  even though
experts say U S  banks  exposure to Greek debt may be smaller
than many market participants fear 
 Still  the market needs resolution of the situation soon 
as the lack of a deal to resolve the Greek debt crisis stifles
investor confidence and curbs the market s advance 
  The big headline is Greece  and it s going to continue to
be Greece until there is some clarity or conviction that comes
out of there   said Jonathan Corpina  head of NYSE floor
operations for Meridian Equity Partners in New York 
 Losses were contained  however  as investors looked for
value after the recent sell off  The Dow finished the volatile
day with a modest gain and the Nasdaq retraced some ground
after falling slightly more than 1 percent in late afternoon
trading 
 The S P materials sector  lost 0 9 percent 
reflecting a slide in copper prices amid concerns that the
U S  economy may be slowing  For details  see  ID nN16194354  
Freeport McMoRan Copper   Gold Inc  shed 1 4 percent to
 47 85 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  gained 64 25
points  or 0 54 percent  to 11 961 52  The Standard   Poor s
500 Index  added 2 22 points  or 0 18 percent  to
1 267 64  But the Nasdaq Composite Index  dropped 7 76
points  or 0 29 percent  to 2 623 70 
 The S P 500 has dropped 7 percent from its April 29
closing high 
 The benchmark S P 500 Index appeared to bounce back from a
technical support test at 1 257 88  its 200 day moving
average  recovering from an intraday low of 1 258 07 
 Quadruple witching is a term used by pros to describe the
 quarterly expiration and settlement of four types of June
equity futures and options contracts    an event that can add
volume and volatility as investors adjust their derivatives
positions 
 The two day event begins when June stock index futures and
certain options on the cash indexes such as the S P 500 and
the Nasdaq 100  stop trading at Thursday s close  These
contracts then settle on Friday s morning opening 
  We ve got expiration    end of the month  end of the

  UBS wants to buy out of a  bad bank  deal  but not yet
   European bank shares up 0 85 percent
 
  Adds UniCredit  Intesa throughout 
 By Ben Berkowitz
 AMSTERDAM  Sept 29  Reuters    BNP Paribas announced a 4 3
billion euro   6 3 billion  capital raising on Tuesday  joining
the ranks of top European lenders seeking to escape from state
support  and UniCredit snubbed government help with a 4 billion
euro cash call 
 Many banks that took billions of euros of government funds
to bail them out of the global financial crisis are looking to
raise money to repay the aid and free themselves from the
conditions that were attached  such as limits on bonuses 
 The trickle of deals and rumoured rights issues of the past
two weeks threatens to become a flood  as banks rush to beat
competitors to the market with outsized deals  taking advantage
of higher stock prices and an apparent investor appetite to
support fundraising 
 It also follows calls from the Group of 20 economies  which
met last week  for banks to boost their capital worldwide and to
make it of a higher quality 
 UniCredit SpA  Italy s largest bank  announced its capital
hike after a Tuesday board meeting in a move that would boost
its core Tier I ratio by 80 basis points 
 Competitor Intesa SanPaolo said Tuesday it will not take
state aid either  announcing a Tier I bond of up to 1 5 billion
euros to shore up its capital base by 40 basis points 
 Switzerland s UBS AG also wants to cut government ties by
buying its way out of a  bad bank  deal  its chief executive
Oswald Gruebel said in an interview with the Financial Times 
but may not be able to do so until late 2010 
  We think it is a good decision  to get rid of political
repercussions on bonuses  dividend payments and acquisitions  
Evolution Securities  Jaap Meijer said in a note on BNP Paribas 
 BNP Paribas  France s biggest bank by market value  said its
capital raising was part of a move to reimburse the government
early on its 5 1 billion euros capital advance  The deal will
free the bank from government conditions for financial help 
including limits on bonuses 
Its fundraising came as sources confirmed BNP had been
approached by the Dutch government to buy the commercial banking
unit of nationalised Fortis Bank Nederland 
 
 WILLING INVESTORS
 The DJ STOXX European banks index rose 0 85 percent as
investors reviewed the offerings 
 In Britain  two banks under substantial state control are
also mulling huge share issues  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
 has been gauging investor appetite for a share issue of up to 4
billion pounds   6 4 billion   a source familiar with the matter
said earlier this month 
 And Lloyds Banking Group Plc has said it is considering its
own options  with market talk it may be seeking as much as 20
billion pounds from the market 
 Raising capital may not be enough to free Lloyds from state
intervention  though  European Competition Commissioner Neelie
Kroes told the European Parliament on Tuesday that Lloyds must
not be allowed to remain dominant in areas where it is already
strong  a sharp warning as the EU reviews Lloyds  plans 
 
 SOME SUCCESS ALREADY
 In the last six weeks two Dutch institutions which have
received state aid  insurer Aegon NV and bancassurer SNS Reaal 
announced share issues to repay part of their aid packages 
  Such deals follow those from U S  banks that have started
to extricate themselves from government aid or are paying fees
to get out of restrictive asset guarantee deals  such as Bank of
America last week 
 Morgan Stanley  JPMorgan Chase   Co and American Express Co
 said in June they would sell shares as they position themselves
to repay billions of dollars borrowed under the U S  Treasury s
Troubled Asset Relief Program

pointed to a higher open on Wall Street on Monday  with stocks
looking to extend last week s gains on signs that major world

value  a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account

 LONDON  July 24  Reuters    European services and industry
data on Friday suggested the worst downturn in 80 years was
easing  but a record economic decline in Britain and gloomy
company outlooks cast doubt over any quick recovery 
 Governments have pumped trillions of dollars into corporate
rescues and stimulus packages to jolt the global economy out of
its downturn  but analysts said there may not be enough demand
to support a sustained recovery when extra funds are withdrawn 
 Euro zone services and manufacturing sectors contracted much
less sharply than expected in July  but firms continued to slash
jobs in a bid to reduce costs  key surveys showed 
  Today s figures are welcome but  fundamentally  still
indicate that the euro area is firmly in recession   Daiwa
SMBC s Colin Ellis said 
 Analysts warned that increased activity in manufacturing or
services owes more to businesses restocking empty warehouses and
retailers discounting to boost sales than a recovery in demand 
  There are considerable questions over sustainability 
inventories are an issue here   said Deutsche Bank s Mark Wall 
  We are enjoying a positive impulse now but on a medium term
base we question whether it s got durability  
 Those concerns were supported by British data showing that
the economy shrank more than twice as fast as expected in the
second quarter  registering its biggest annual decline on record
and quashing hopes of an early recovery in Britain 
 The figures are likely to boost expectations that the Bank
of England will pump more money into the economy  which has
shrunk by 5 7 percent since the first quarter of last year 
  Today s figures are fresh evidence of the sheer scale of
the global downturn we re fighting   Britain s junior finance
minister  Liam Byrne  said   But they also show the pace of
slowdown is easing compared to the winter  which is why we
remain cautious but confident that growth will return toward the
end of the year   

 SUSTAINBILITY ISSUES
 Global markets took heart from the European data but
policymakers were quick to caution against premature optimism 
with mixed news emerging from different nations 
 Germany showed an improvement in services and manufacturing 
and a key business sentiment index rose for the fourth month
running in July  to reach its highest level since October 2008 
 The downturn in French private sector activity deepened in
July  however  while Spanish second quarter unemployment rose to
its highest level in more than a decade  
 Austria s central bank said the economy would shrink 4
percent in the second and third quarters compared with the same
periods last year 
 European Central Bank Executive Board member Jose Manual
Gonzalez Paramo said euro zone interest rates would only be
changed once recovery was certain 
  We ve seen some signs that there has been a change in
trend  but we ve seen positive figures and not so positive
figures  so we can t say the trend has changed   he said 
  All the measures we ve taken have been to restart credit 
This hasn t happened yet but it takes time   he added 
 That view was reaffirmed by officials from emerging markets 
 The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said
emerging Europe may not return to the high growth rates and
record investment levels it enjoyed before the crisis  while
China warned that the apparent recovery remained fragile 
  We will unswervingly continue to implement an appropriately
relaxed monetary policy   China s central bank said on Friday 
 
 CHALLENGING YEAR
 European macro data eclipsed weak earnings from Microsoft
and American Express overnight to help European shares reverse
early losses ahead of the U S  open  
 Stock futures pointed to a mixed open on Wall Street  with
some disappointing results curbing sentiment  including
Schlumberger  the world s largest oilfield services provider 
which posted a sharp drop in earnings and said it saw no rebound
in customer spending this year 
 Black   Decker  however  posted better than expected
quarterly profits and raised its 2009 forecast  citing better
sales 
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up
0 06 percent at 1245 GMT  after gains in Asia helped by a strong
quarterly performance from electronics giant Samsung 
 Vodafone  the world s largest mobile phone firm by revenues 
reported a slight decline in quarterly organic sales and
restated its full year outlook  lifting its shares 
 However  Ericsson  the world s biggest supplier of cellphone
network equipment  said the economic downturn was now taking a
bigger toll on its market 
 While a boost from government stimulus measures has helped
some companies beat forecasts for second quarter earnings 
analysts warned the rally may not last  as prices have risen
fast and the economic outlook remains mixed 
  The rally over the past two weeks has been very fast and
the market is now dangerously overbought  We re due for a pause 
which would be healthy if we want to keep the upside trend  
said Alexandre Le Drogoff  technical analyst at Aurel BGC

 NEW YORK  July 23  Reuters    U S  stocks rallied on
Thursday  sending the Dow industrials above the key 9 000 mark
for the first time since January  as strong second quarter
earnings and improving home sales data fueled economic
recovery hopes 
 Early gains were extended after data showed U S  existing
home sales rose in June    the first time since 2004 that this
measure has risen three months in a row  The Dow Jones U S 
home construction index jumped 5 8 percent 
Results from bellwethers like 3M   Co and AT T Inc on

drove the S P 500 index to its highest level in 2009  The
Nasdaq was on track for its 12th straight day of gains  its

  We re getting good earnings from all different industry
groups   said John Schloegel  vice president of investment
strategies at Capital Cities Asset Management in Austin 
Texas   It s a broad based rally  not pinpointed by any one
industry  
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 182 51 points  or
2 06 percent  at 9 063 77  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index

 Among the Nasdaq s major advancers was eBay  whose second 
quarter results beat Wall Street s expectations  The online
marketplace s stock leapt 8 5 percent to  21 11 
The string of good news handily pushed the S P 500 over a
critical technical resistance level of 960  a development that
some analysts said is an indication that the benchmark index
will take aim at the 1 000 mark 
 This is a significant crack of overhead resistance and
it s causing a lot of investors to panic buy right now 
They re forcing themselves in because they re underweighted
and underinvested when the market is making significant
headway   Schloegel said 
Only two of the 30 Dow components were trading lower in the

NEW YORK  July 20  Reuters    The dollar weakened broadly on
Monday  falling to a six week low against the euro  as
investors waded back into riskier assets and higher yielding
currencies amid solid U S  corporate earnings so far for the
second quarter 
 A further pick up in risk appetite pushed the euro as high
as  1 4248  according to Reuters data  its strongest since
early June  which helped push the dollar to a six week trough
against a major currency basket  The yen also was under broad
pressure 
 A last minute rescue of ailing lender CIT Group late on
Sunday also helped boost risk sentiment  ID nLK693118 
  Clearly the theme for the session has been improved risk
appetite and that has weighed on the U S  dollar and yen   said
Omer Esiner  senior market analyst at Travelex Global Business
Payments in Washington   That was largely fueled by more or
less positive U S  corporate earnings and Sunday s bailout of
CIT by its bondholders  
 Assets considered to be higher risk extended gains after
rallying last week when investors took mixed U S  corporate
earnings as an optimistic sign that the economy is improving 
 But volumes were light with Tokyo shut for a local holiday 
 In early New York trading  the euro rose 0 9 percent to
 1 4221   A climb above  1 4337 touched in early June would
take the pair to its highest level of the year 
 The ICE Futures  dollar index was down 0 6 percent at
78 881  after falling as low as 78 799  its lowest since early
June 
 The U S  currency struggled broadly  pushing sterling and
the Australian and New Zealand currencies each up as much as
1 5 percent  with the New Zealand dollar rising near its
highest level of the year 
 Against the yen  the dollar rose 0 3 percent to 94 44 yen  
while the euro gained 1 2 percent to 134 31 yen 
 SEEING IS BELIEVING
 But whether positive corporate earnings and the bullish
price action could be sustained is still open to debate 
 In the past two weeks  analysts have noted that the stock
market s rally has occurred despite what seemed to be broad
expectations for a pullback and correction to the spring rally 
HSBC in a research note pointed out that at  least some of the
recent gains may have come from a  squeeze  in  prices as some
traders were positioned for that pullback 
  We re not sure that a lot more people now  believe  that

under pressure as a result   said John McCarthy  director of
foreign exchange at ING Capital Markets in New York

 In late morning New York trading  the euro rose 0 8 percent

 But analysts said the euro looked overextended and seemed
unable to get past its highs of the day  It failed to extend
gains despite a generally upbeat U S  economic leading economic
indicators report for June 
  At these elevated levels  risk appetite may be a little
overstretched   said Omer Esiner  senior market analyst at
Travelex Global Business Payments in Washington

 By Joanne Frearson
 LONDON  July 22  Reuters    European shares closed higher
for the eighth straight session on Wednesday  their longest
winning streak since December 2006  as gains in pharmaceutical
stocks overshadowed falls in banking stocks 
 The pan European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares ended
0 2 percent higher at 890 05 points  the highest close since
early January  after trading in a wide range of 879 97 890 38
points 
 The index is up around 37 percent from its lifetime low of
March 9 
  Markets have been a little undecided today showing that the
rally may not be guaranteed to continue  Further highlighting
the changing mood were the stocks in focus as investors went to
the defensive stocks for protection   said Jimmy Yates  head of
equities at CMC Markets 
 Drugmakers added the most points to the index  supported by
positive earnings news as U S  peer Pfizer raised its full year
forecast for earnings  excluding items  and revenue 
 Novartis  AstraZeneca and Novo Nordisk were up between 0 5
and 1 2 percent 
 However  GlaxoSmithKline fell 0 6 percent after earlier
gains  The company said that it had beat expectations with its
second quarter earnings and said momentum in the second half
would pick up on the back of flu vaccine sales     Bayer was up
2 2 percent after the company and its development partner Onyx
Pharmaceuticals said their cancer pill Nexavar showed promise in
treating breast tumours in a Phase II study  Onyx
Pharmaceuticals soared 24 percent 
 Across Europe  the FTSE 100 index was up 0 3 percent 
Germany s DAX was up 0 5 percent and France s CAC 40 was up 0 1
percent 
 
 BANKS FALL
 Banking shares took the most points off the index after
Morgan Stanley reported its third consecutive quarterly loss 
while Wells Fargo reported rising credit losses 
  Morgan Stanley s operating loss per share looks on the high
side  compared to others in the sector  I think Morgan Stanley s
paying back public aid has distorted results  it is not known if
this has been incorporated into analysts expectations of the
results   said Heino Ruland  strategist at Ruland Research 
 Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group were down 3 1 percent and
1 6 percent respectively  as National Australia Bank which owns
the Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks reported a jump in UK bad
debts 
 Credit Suisse  UBS and Nordea Bank were 1 1 to 1 8 percent
lower 
 Insurers were also lower  Axa  Zurich Financial and Swiss Re
 slipped 1 2 to 1 6 percent

after the world s largest miner reported a 10 percent fall in
iron ore output to 27 048 million tonnes after its operations
were hit by mining fatalities and flooding in Australia 
 Anglo American  Antofagasta and Eurasian Natural Resources

 LONDON  July 23  Reuters    The dollar slipped on Thursday 
edging close to a seven week low against the euro and a basket
of currencies as early gains for European shares suggested risk
appetite was holding up after a mixed bag of corporate earnings 
 The yen stumbled across the board  undercut by expectations
of investment trust flows out of Japan this week and as gains in
the euro set off automatic sell orders in other yen pairs 
 European shares rose 0 4 percent in early trade  heading for
a ninth straight daily rise  but analysts said significant gains
in currencies including the euro and sterling may be limited by
lingering concerns about the weakness of the global economy 
  Recent earnings data are helping risk appetite  but
nevertheless  the upsides of risky currencies are capped as the
market realises that improvements in the global economy will be
slow   said Ulrich Leuchtmann  currency strategist at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt 
  Speculators don t really have lots of room to move in
either direction   he said  adding that many in the market were
wary of taking on big positions as market liquidity thins during
the summer holiday season  He said that may keep currencies
rangebound in the near term 
 At 0747 GMT  the euro inched up 0 3 percent to  1 4242 
climbing near  1 4278 touched earlier in the week  its highest
since early June 
 Gains in the euro helped to keep the dollar index under
downward pressure  It was little changed at 78 729  but hovered
near a seven week low of 78 563 hit the previous day 
 
 HIGH RISK CURRENCIES GAIN
 Sterling and the Australian and New Zealand dollars   
currencies often seen as being higher risk    each rose around
0 4 percent against the dollar  while gaining more than 1
percent against a broadly weaker yen 
 The dollar rose 0 7 percent to 94 28 yen  as traders dumped
the Japanese currency before launches this week of  toshin 
Japanese investment trusts which will invest in overseas assets
and foreign currencies 
 Market participants are speculating that these products may
attract solid demand  and that pushed the yen lower 
 With few major economic events or data scheduled in Europe
on Thursday  investors will look to second quarter earnings from
U S  and European firms  including American Express  as well as
data on U S  jobless claims and existing home sales 
 Risk appetite has been improving in recent days  fuelled by
strong quarterly results from some large banks including Goldman
Sachs  although results from Morgan Stanley on Wednesday were
disappointing 
 Traders said Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke provided
little market moving news on Wednesday in testimony to the
Senate Banking Committee  Bernanke reiterated that the U S 
economic outlook was improving but supportive policies would be
necessary for a while to prevent rising joblessness from sapping
economic recovery

 LONDON  July 23  Reuters    The dollar slipped on Thursday 
edging close to a seven week low against the euro and a basket

 At 0923 GMT  the euro inched up 0 3 percent to  1 4230 
climbing near  1 4278 touched earlier in the week  its highest
since early June 
 The pair traded in a narrow  1 4200 1 4266 range  around
where options were seen expiring later in the day  IFR reported
that 200 million euros with a  1 4245 strike price would expire
at the New York cut  along with 300 million euros at  1 4250

 The Swedish crown rose to a three week high versus the euro

 Investors awaited more second quarter earnings from U S  and
European firms  including American Express  as well as data on
U S  jobless claims and existing home sales 
 Risk appetite has been improving due to strong quarterly
results from some large banks including Goldman Sachs  although
results from Morgan Stanley on Wednesday were disappointing 
 The intraday correlation between the dollar and equities at
times has been erratic during the current earnings season  but
analysts at JPMorgan said the general move lower in the dollar
this month has been a solid response to  extraordinarily high 
upside earnings surprises  which have stoked risk demand 
  The day to day price action may suggest some breakdown in
the expected negative USD equity correlation  but the dollar s
decline this month has been in line with its usual sensitivity
to earnings surprises   they said in a research note 
 Markets offered little reaction to Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke  who on Wednesday reiterated that the U S  economic
outlook was improving but supportive policies would be necessary
for a while

 NEW YORK  July 6  Reuters    The Nasdaq and the S P 500
fell on Monday as concerns about the strength of an economic
recovery kept pressure on stocks and commodity prices 
 But the Dow industrials edged higher as some investors
snapped up defensive stocks amid continued concern over the
economy following last week s non farm payrolls report 
 Investors were also looking ahead to the start of second
quarter earnings season on Wednesday for an indication of how
corporations are weathering the economic downturn 
 American Express Co was among the Dow s top percentage
gainers  climbing 5 2 percent to  23 43 after Stifel Nicolaus
raised its rating on the company s stock to  hold   saying it
was the least exposed to new rules on the credit card sector 
 The weakness of June s employment report  which was
released last Thursday before the market shut for the long
holiday weekend  is still casting a pall over Wall Street 
said Robert Auer  senior portfolio manager of SBAuer Funds in
Indianapolis 
  The market is now wanting to see what the earnings season
has in store   Auer said   And it s not just what the numbers
are  It s going to be what the companies say that s going to
be more important  
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 12 85 points  or
0 16 percent  to 8 293 59  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
dropped 3 12 points  or 0 35 percent  to 893 30  The Nasdaq

  Updates to close 
 By Edward Krudy
 NEW YORK  July 6  Reuters    The Dow industrials rose and
the S P 500 rebounded in late trading on Monday as investors 
concerns about the strength of an economic recovery triggered
a move into defensive stocks 
 But the technology heavy Nasdaq slipped as investors
rotated out of the tech sector  which is viewed as more
reliant on the economic cycle 
 A series of reports showing the economy is in less dire
straits than it was at the start of the year drove stocks
sharply higher in the spring  but lately investors have been
looking for consistent evidence of a sustained recovery 
 Stocks were weak through most of the session until the
last half hour when the push into sectors likely to outperform
in a down economy helped healthcare stocks like Merck   Co  up
3 3 percent at  27 89  and consumer staples like Kraft Foods
Inc  up 1 9 percent at  26 44 
 While a report on the services sector was better than
expected in June  the Institute for Supply Management s
non manufacturing data failed to relieve broader concerns
raised by last week s unexpectedly weak June non farm payrolls
report  As a result  some investors turned to defensive
stocks 
  Looking beyond this initial recovery phase  the economic
expansion is going to be below average and that is going to be
more favorable toward the defensive sectors of the market  
said Henry Smith  chief investment officer of Haverford Trust
Co in Philadelphia 
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 44 13 points  or
0 53 percent  to 8 324 87  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
added 2 30 points  or 0 26 percent  to 898 72  But the Nasdaq
Composite Index dropped 9 12 points  or 0 51 percent  to
1 787 40 
 The S P 500 has rallied as much as 40 percent from a
12 year closing low reached on March 9  But the benchmark
index is now up only 32 8 percent since then as stocks have
given up some of their gains on concerns about the economy 
 American Express Co topped the Dow s list of biggest
percentage gainers in Monday s session  climbing 5 6 percent
to  23 52 after Stifel Nicolaus raised its rating on the
company s stock to  hold   saying it was the least exposed to
new rules on the credit card sector 
 Investors were also looking ahead to the start of second 
quarter earnings season on Wednesday for an indication of how
corporations are weathering the economic downturn  Data
compiled by Thomson Reuters shows about a 36 percent decline
in S P 500 earnings from a year ago  That would be roughly the
same result as the first quarter 
  The market is now wanting to see what the earnings season
has in store   said Robert Auer  senior portfolio manager of
SBAuer Funds in Indianapolis   And it s not just what the
numbers are  It s going to be what the companies say that s
going to be more important  
 Among the heaviest weights on the Nasdaq was iPhone and
iPod maker Apple Inc  down 1 percent at  138 61 
While ISM data released earlier on Monday showed the U S 
service sector contracted in June at a slower pace than
expected  the market s sentiment was still colored by last
week s much worse than expected jobs report 
 Last Thursday  the U S  Labor Department reported a
decline of 467 000 in nonfarm payrolls  nearly 100 000 more
than expected  The U S  stock market was shut on Friday for
the long Independence Day holiday weekend 
 August crude futures touched a five week low  tumbling
 2 68  or 4 percent  to settle at  64 05 per barrel on Monday 
The slide in oil prices drove shares of Marathon Oil Corp
 down 0 8 percent to  28 76  Holly Corp  shares
slid 2 percent to  18 25 
 Trading volume was moderate on the New York Stock
Exchange  with only about 1 14 billion shares changing hands

162974,384490,AXP,GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD Investor patterns still stuck in mire,news,"By Jeremy Gaunt  European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON  Feb 1  Reuters    The question facing investors as
they enter the first week of February is what will it take to
change the stubborn trends of global financial markets 
 A glib answer appears to be  quite a lot 
 One month into the new year  investors are still struggling
to crawl out of the uber bearish swamp that was 2008 
 Stocks had a negative January  Relatively safe short term
government bonds and the U S  dollar remained in favour  Gold
continued a three month upward climb  All very familiar 
 Above all  the headwinds that have held investors in this
pattern for more than a year are not only still there but
spreading 
 Concerns about a declining global economy  for example  can
now be compounded by fears China will fare worse than previously
believed  Hopes that the financial crisis is over  meanwhile 
have been doused by new losses at various major banks 
 Trade protectionism  deflation and even the collapse of the
euro zone are now openly discussed in financial circles  even if
they are more often dismissed than taken seriously 
  There is this dawning realisation that the worst may not be
behind us   said Koray Yesildag  an economist at hedge fund
specialists GAM 
 Not that there aren t a few glimmers of light out there to
cheer those hoping for a return to economic and financial
stability 
 For one thing  although world stocks as measured by MSCI
fell in January on top of their 43 5 percent slide in 2008  they
are still above their November low  which may yet prove to have
been the bottom 
 They essentially have been trading in a range of roughly 7
percent either side of a mid point that is about 18 percent
above last year s trough 
 Some risk appetite can also be found by looking at flows to
emerging market equities and debt 
 And on the economic front  there have been little flickers
such as better than forecast  albeit still poor  U S growth  an
unexpected improvement in German business sentiment and a
similarly unheralded uptick in U S  home sales 
 But the overall climate is one of gloom  with investors
expecting things to get better eventually but not yet 
  For the coming weeks  we do not expect markets to improve
much   Klaus Wiener  head of research at Generali Investments 
wrote in his February outlook 
 The  key reason is the globally synchronised recession and
the impact it will have on company earnings  
 
 PROFITS AND LOSS
 Earnings expectations have plummeted in a quite remarkable
manner  Last July  analysts were looking at S P 500 company
earnings growth of around 59 percent in the fourth quarter 
according to Thomson Reuters data 
 A combination of actual Q4 2008 earnings and expectations
for companies still to report suggests the final figure will be
a decline of around 28 percent 
 Quite a few investors also believe earnings expectations for
this year and next remain too high  At the same time  there have
been some positive surprises    American Express  Texas
Instruments and Siemens for example 
 A clearer picture should come this week with the release of
results from some major U S  companies running a gamut of
industries  These include Motorola  Dow Chemical  Cisco  Kraft
and Philip Morris 
 In Europe  there is a similar range of big names  including
the likes of Vodafone  but the focus may well be more on the
week afterwards when a number of big banks report 
 For  over the long term  it is the banking industry that
will probably be the trigger for a turnaround in current bearish
investment patterns 
 Yesildag of GAM reflected the views of many investors and
analysts when he said financial market players still needed to
know how many toxic assets there are out there despite huge
write downs 
  You need to see some much clearer recognition of the
problems   he said   The degree of uncertainty in markets has to
be reduced  
 
 DOWN TOGETHER
 A new wrinkle for investors which might get some attention
this week  meanwhile  is that on a couple of trading days
recently equities and bonds have sold off together 
 This is a break from the set patterns of the past few years
when any momentary rise in risk appetite for equities prompted
selling of fixed income and vice versa 
 Such a move can be a signal of deepening risk aversion among
investors  essentially selling whatever they can 
 But the currency trades did not match such a move and
Goldman Sachs pointed out in a note that macroeconomic data was
 not suggesting any acceleration in the pace of slowdown  
 Wayne Bowers  international chief executive officer of
Northern Trusts Global Investments  said the joint sell offs
could just reflect asset allocation shifts by pension funds and
the like as they begin to see their 2008 results 
 It is still likely to be something that investors watch
closely

 Critical details concerning the valuation of distressed assets remain unclear   says the IMF report   The plan also does not address how severely undercapitalized or insolvent banks will be resolved       greater clarity on all these issues will be critical to ensure the plan s effectiveness  
 
The IMF forecasts the global economy will decline by 1  in 2009  its first contraction in 60 years and believes that the global economy is unlikely to turn round until governments achieve a  decisive breakthrough  in resolving the financial crisis 
 
 To break the negative feedback loop  it is extremely critical to resolve the uncertainty concerning the balance sheets of financial institutions   it says   Systematic and proactive approaches have started to supplant ad hoc interventions but financial sector policies still lack coherence and credibility  Greater international policy co ordination is crucial for restoring market trust  
 
The fund previously said that global governments should provide a total 2  of aggregate global GDP stimulus this year  and id recommending further boosts in 2010 
 
 Given the likely protracted nature of the downturn countries with fiscal room should plan to sustain stimulus in 2010
