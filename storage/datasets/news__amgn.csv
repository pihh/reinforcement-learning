148502,370018,AMGN,Amgen s Shares Slip on Soft Guidance  Time to Buy ,news,"Yesterday  Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   a blue chip biotech  reported fourth quarter earnings  Although the biotech heavyweight topped Wall Street s consensus estimates for its bottom and top lines during the three month period  investors apparently weren t impressed  Amgen s shares immediately dropped by 3 16  in after hours trading on the heels of this overall positive earnings report 
What s the deal  The sore spot seems to be Amgen s  soft  revenue guidance for 2020  Specifically  the company said it expects 2020 revenue to come in between  25 0 billion to  25 6 billion  implying year over year top line growth of 9 4  on the high end of the range  Wall Street s prior forecast pegged the biotech s 2020 revenue at approximately  25 5 billion  So  it s not as though Amgen is calling for 2020 to be a complete disaster 

Should bargain hunters take advantage of this rather questionable sell off  Let s consider Amgen s strengths and weaknesses to find out 
Amgen  The bull and bear case
What s the biggest knock against Amgen s bull case  The most pressing concern among investors seems to be the biotech s ongoing battle against generic and biosimilar competition  Amgen has continually had to drop the net selling price for several key legacy products due to this issue  In fact  the biotech warned investors during this latest earnings call that further price erosion is likely to occur again this year 
To offset this pricing headwind  Amgen is banking on a healthy rise in sales volume across its growth portfolio in 2020  Fortunately  this stated goal does seem feasible thanks to the  13 4 billion acquisition of psoriasis medication Otezla last year  along with the strong commercial performance of multiple growth oriented brands such as osteoporosis treatment Prolia and migraine drug Aimovig  among others  
There are two inter related issues that should concern shareholders  though  First of all  the biotech s cash position dropped from  29 3 billion to  8 9 billion year over year  mainly due to the costly Otezla transaction in 2019  Secondly  Amgen decided to plow  7 6 billion into share repurchases last year  It also has a whopping  6 5 billion remaining in authorized buybacks under the current plan  Amgen s aggressive capital allocation strategy is a tad concerning in light of the biotech s enormous debt load of almost  30 billion 
Amgen should have ample free cash flow to service this debt without issue in 2020  However  a global economic downturn    perhaps one triggered by a pandemic    could put the biotech in a bind at some point  Put bluntly  Amgen might want to rethink its capital allocation strategy given the potentially severe economic ramifications of the deadly coronavirus currently ravaging important emerging markets such as China    
Amgen s bull case  though  is arguably far more compelling than the bear thesis right now  Apart from its healthy top line growth prospects in 2020 and beyond  Amgen s stock is presently trading at a mere 12 98 times next year s projected earnings  That s not exactly bargain territory for a large cap biotech stock  but it s also a far cry from where other biopharmas  such as AstraZeneca and Eli Lilly  are trading at right now  Moreover  Amgen recently boosted its dividend by a noteworthy 10   bringing its forward looking annualized yield to a respectable 2 82   That s slightly above average for its immediate peer group  
Time to buy 
It s hard to go wrong owning Amgen s stock for the long haul  This large cap biotech stock has been one of the absolute best investing vehicles over the past 10 years  There s also no overarching reason to believe this trend won t continue for the next 10 years  Bargain hunters may indeed want to capitalize on the market s puzzling reaction to Amgen s fourth quarter results ",2020-01-31,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppi5e,2073128
148503,370019,AMGN,Stock Market News  Amazon s Amazing  Amgen Falls Short,news,"Investors have been worried about the coronavirus outbreak as it spreads in China and across the world  and Friday morning s stock market action clearly reflected rising levels of fear  As the number of cases moved toward the 10 000 mark  market participants increasingly believe that the outbreak won t simply die out the way similar diseases have in the past  As of 11 a m  EST  the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJINDICES  DJI  was down 387 points to 28 473  The S P 500  SNPINDEX  GSPC  fell 37 points to 3 246  and the Nasdaq Composite  NASDAQINDEX  IXIC  was lower by 83 points at 9 215 
Even with health worries overhanging the market  not all of the news was bad  Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  soared after a strong earnings report  Yet in the biotech realm  Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  wasn t able to satisfy investors even after what looked like solid results in its most recent quarter 
A prime day for Amazon shares
Amazon com saw its stock jump 9  after the e commerce and cloud computing giant reported its fourth quarter financial results  Investors were generally impressed with the numbers and with Amazon s outlook for the future 

Amazon saw sales jump 21  year over year  with particularly strong results in the North American side of the e commerce business as well as Amazon Web Services  Earnings gains of 7  were somewhat less impressive  but that partially reflected all the investment in building out one day delivery capabilities  The number of Prime members topped the 150 million mark  Subscription and third party seller services were also notably strong from a growth standpoint 
Investors even seemed satisfied with predictions for falling operating income in the near future  Much of the change is tied to accounting treatment of server related depreciation  which few shareholders really follow all that closely 
Today s move pushed Amazon s market cap back above the  1 trillion mark and was particularly impressive on a sharply lower day on Wall Street  Right now  Amazon seems to have all the momentum it needs to sustain growth for the foreseeable future 
Amgen predicts a tough 2020
Elsewhere  shares of Amgen were down 6  following its release of its fourth quarter financial report  Despite better than expected numbers  investors weren t excited about future prospects for the biotech giant 
Amgen s results were somewhat mixed  Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 fell 1   as biosimilar and generic competition ramped up against some of its key products  That capped a year in which the top line dropped 2   Yet despite higher operating expenses  adjusted earnings per share were up 6  compared to the year earlier period  buoyed by stock buybacks that lowered outstanding share counts 
Yet what shareholders really seemed not to like was Amgen s guidance  The company expects total revenue of  25 billion to  25 6 billion in 2020  with adjusted earnings of  14 85 to  15 60 per share 
The real question facing Amgen is whether recent major acquisitions will pay off with higher sales and profits  If so  then an attractive valuation could make the biotech stock seem like a steal at current levels  But if those strategic moves fail to bear fruit  then it could cause even more problems for Amgen shareholders in the future ",2020-01-31,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppj0m,2073194
148504,370020,AMGN,Amgen Is Making 3 Big Bets    Will They Pay Off for Investors ,news,"Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  beat Wall Street s earnings estimate with its fourth quarter results  But the big biotech s 2020 outlook underwhelmed  Amgen expects to deliver modest earnings growth and return to revenue growth  but it wasn t enough to impress investors 
During Amgen s quarterly conference call on Thursday  the company s management talked about plans to move past what they called the  transition year  of 2019  a reference to the challenges the company faced with several of its older drugs facing biosimilar and generic competition  Their comments focused to a large extent on three big bets that Amgen is making to drive future growth  What are these bets    and will they pay off for investors  

1  Acquisitions
Amgen acquired Otezla a few months ago  thanks to regulators requiring Celgene to sell the blockbuster drug to pave the way for its acquisition by Bristol Myers Squibb  If there was any doubt about how important this purchase was for Amgen  they should be erased by the biotech s 2020 outlook  The company expects revenue for its base business to be flat year over year  Amgen s return to revenue growth will be driven by Otezla 
The addition of the immunology drug will help Amgen in other ways  too  CEO Bob Bradway said that the company s Humira biosimilar  Amgevita   will benefit from our recent acquisition of Otezla   He thinks that Otezla will help Amgen build its business in China and Japan  Murdo Gordon  Amgen s executive vice president of global commercial operations  said the company is also  excited about potential synergies between Otezla and Enbrel  
More acquisitions could be on the way  At the J P  Morgan Healthcare Conference earlier this year  Amgen s executives hinted that the company could be interested in bolstering its nephrology pipeline  Bradway confirmed in Amgen s Q4 call that the company isn t  investing in discovery research in nephrology right now  but we are going to look for business development opportunities there  
2  Asia Pacific ventures
Amgen has great expectations for the Asia Pacific region  Bradway stated   Over the next decade  we expect this region to account for as much as 25  of Amgen s growth   And the key to unlocking that potential growth is the biotech s partnerships 
Bradway said that over two thirds of its Asia Pacific growth in Q4 stemmed from its joint venture with Astellas Pharma  OTC ALPMY  in Japan  However  Amgen will buy 49  of the shares in this joint venture currently held by Astellas on April 1  2020  for what CFO Peter Griffeth called  a nominal fee   This transaction will make the joint venture a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen 
While Japan is the third largest pharmaceutical market in the world  China is second only to the U S  Amgen s collaboration deal in China with BeiGene  NASDAQ BGNE  closed in early January  giving Amgen a 20 5  stake in the Chinese biotech  BeiGene will market three of Amgen s cancer drugs    Xgeva  Kyprolis  and Blincyto    in China and work together on other experimental cancer drugs in Amgen s pipeline  Bradway said that  we re excited by what our two companies can achieve together  
3  Pipeline
Probably the biggest and most important bet that Amgen is making is on its pipeline  Bradway highlighted several key pipeline updates on the way this year  including data readouts for AMG 510 in treating solid tumors  tezepelumab in asthma  omecamtiv in heart failure  and Otezla in mild to moderate psoriasis 
While all but the AMG 510 results will be from late stage clinical studies  it s probably fair to say that none of these pipeline updates will be game changers for Amgen  For example  with respect to omecamtiv  David Reese  Amgen s head of research and development  acknowledged that  the heart failure treatment landscape is expected to change based on recent data from other drug classes   a reference to FDA approval for AstraZeneca s Farxiga in reducing the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in type 2 diabetes patients 
But Amgen does have some potential game changers in its pipeline  namely its bispecific T cell engager  BiTE  drugs in development  Reese said that the company  remain s  enthusiastic about our BiTE platform  and 2020 will be an important year   He also mentioned that Amgen has seen  the sort of pharmacodynamic activity and early suggestions of anti tumor activity that are reminiscent of the early days of Blincyto and that give s  us encouragement that we re on the right track   Amgen expects to provide updates for several of its BiTE clinical studies this year  
Paying off 
Will Amgen s big bets pay off for investors  The answer seems to be a resounding  yes  when it comes to the company s purchase of Otezla  My view is that Amgen s deals to strengthen its position in the Asia Pacific region are also good investments 
The jury is still out on Amgen s pipeline  though  It s possible that the company s BiTE drugs will be big winners  but there s a real chance that they won t be nearly as successful as Amgen hopes they ll be 
My view is that Amgen continues to be a solid dividend stock  In fact  Peter Griffeth stressed that the company is  committed to returning capital to shareholders in the form of growing dividends   I m not as bullish about Amgen s growth prospects in the near term  however  I think some of the biotech s big bets need to begin paying off in a more significant way before Amgen will return to strong growth ",2020-02-02,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pp-ly,2073853

148509,370025,AMGN,Why Amgen Stock Dropped 10 4  in January,news,"What happened
Shares of Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  fell 10 4  in January  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence  after the stock rose 24  last year and reached an all time high in December 
This isn t simply a case of locking in profits  Investors may be concerned about a slowdown at the biotech giant as older drugs lose patent protection  In the third quarter presentation in October  Amgen reported declines in sales of bone marrow stimulants Neulasta and Neupogen  citing biosimilar competition  Both drugs help the body make white blood cells after cancer treatments 
Biosimilars are highly similar to an already approved biological treatment  Sales of Neulasta fell 32  in the quarter to  711 million  while Neupogen declined 36  to  54 million  Just a year earlier  quarterly revenue of Neulasta topped  1 billion 

While brighter news such as a 10  increase in the 2020 first quarter dividend and a Food and Drug Administration approval for Amgen s fourth biosimilar buoyed the shares late last year  as fourth quarter and full year earnings approached  some investors decided to lock in profits in anticipation of a further slowdown in the company s older products 
So what
Biotechs such as Amgen that have been around for years and have stellar revenue and profit thanks to blockbuster drugs are seeing many of those older drugs come off patent  That opens the door to competition  which weighs on profits from the original drug  Investors could count on Amgen  with more than 20 marketed products and annual sales topping  22 billion for the past four years 
Now what
Future growth at Amgen will depend its ability to replace yesterday s blockbuster with newer drugs  and whether it can introduce biosimilars to other successful drugs  And the need to expand through partnerships is also important 
In its fourth quarter earnings report  the company gave an update on AMG 510  its investigational cancer treatment  Data from a potentially pivotal Phase 2 monotherapy study in advanced non small cell lung cancer is expected this year 
Amgen recently submitted a biologics license application to the FDA for a biosimilar version of Rituxan  Biogen s  NASDAQ BIIB  and Genentech s cancer drug  And it just recently began its collaboration with BeiGene  NASDAQ BGNE  to increase its oncology presence in China  Will it be enough to lift shares meaningfully  We might have to wait for Amgen s next earnings report to find out ",2020-02-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/prn2j,2077362
148513,370029,AMGN,Is Amgen a Stock to Buy ,news,"Revenue growth is slowing at biotech giant Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   and yet the shares are trading near a record high  The share price is a reflection of years of revenue  profit  and a portfolio of more than 20 products  In the world of biotech  where many companies are still in the clinical or pre clinical stage and any revenue source is years down the road  there is value in a portfolio the size of Amgen s  The biotech company has also steadily increased its dividend since 2011  And investors are clearly paying for that  But now the question is  Can the stock move higher from here 
Amgen focuses on diseases that affect large portions of the population  such as asthma  rheumatoid arthritis  and cardiovascular disease  to name a few  The company has about 45 drug candidates in clinical trials  and nearly half of them are in phase 3 studies  Amgen is also working in the up and coming area of biosimilars  or drugs that are highly similar to an already approved biological treatment  Amgen has four approved biosimilars and others in the pipeline 

Profitable for years
From a financial perspective  Amgen has been profitable for years  with blockbuster drugs Neulasta  a bone marrow stimulant for cancer patients  and Enbrel  approved for rheumatoid arthritis among other conditions  driving growth  Amgen won a patent case regarding Enbrel last year  although Sandoz  a company of Novartis  vowed to appeal the decision in order to bring its biosimilar to patients  In spite of that victory  competition has started to threaten some of the company s drugs  and that is showing in the latest earnings reports 
Though Amgen s adjusted earnings per share  that is  not using generally accepted accounting principles  increased 6  in the fourth quarter to  3 64  surpassing analysts  estimates  quarterly revenue has gone down on a year over year basis each of the past three quarters  As a result  the company reported a 1  decrease in revenue for the fourth quarter and a 2  decline for the year to  23 4 billion  Product sales fell 1  for the year  Neulasta  which used to generate more than  1 billion in a quarter  saw quarterly revenue fall to  665 million in this most recent earnings report  Sales of Neulasta slid 43   while sales of Neupogen  a second bone marrow stimulant  fell 17   Amgen cited competition as a reason for the declines in both drugs  Since the drugs came off patent in recent years  the U S  Food and Drug Administration has approved competing products such as Pfizer s Nivestym  a Neupogen biosimilar  and Coherus Biosciences  Udenyca  a Neulasta biosimilar  which have cut into revenue 
When a billion dollar drug no longer brings in billions
Now the question is how to boost revenue when a billion dollar drug no longer brings in billions  Though the obvious answer seems to be  through newer drugs   there is the possibility that the new products won t be as successful as older ones  As mentioned earlier  Amgen has a full pipeline  and the company expects data from various studies this year  including results from a phase 3 trial of heart failure drug omecamtiv mecarbil in the fourth quarter of this year  GlobalData expects the heart failure market to represent  16 1 billion by 2026  Though Amgen s executive vice president of research and development  David M  Reese  said during the earnings call that the heart failure treatment landscape is changing based on data from other drug classes  he considers there is still plenty of unmet need to be addressed 
In addition to clinical stage drugs  Amgen is also seeking to expand the use of already marketed drugs  like psoriasis treatment Otezla  The company expects an FDA decision on the expansion of prescribing information to include data from a scalp psoriasis study in April  Though Otezla only represented 3  of total product sales in the quarter  the psoriasis market isn t negligible  The global psoriasis market is expected to reach  46 6 billion by 2022  according to a report by The Business Research Company 
Another important step Amgen has taken is in the area of partnerships  and its recent one in China  a large and growing oncology market  is encouraging  The company announced late last year that it would collaborate with BeiGene to increase its oncology presence in China  and the two companies recently launched their work together  As part of the deal  BeiGene will commercialize three of Amgen s cancer drugs in China and the two companies will equally share profits and losses  The companies will also advance 20 of Amgen s oncology drug candidates globally  The agreement also involved Amgen taking a 20 5  stake in BeiGene  The oncology drug market in China  growing at a compound annual growth rate of 8 7   is expected to reach  12 7 billion by 2026  according to Allied Market Research 
Is Amgen a stock to buy 
Amgen shares are close to their highest ever  and Wall Street sees 6  upside from here  At the same time  the shares trade at about 18 times earnings  while peers such as Sanofi and Novo Nordisk each trade at about 26  Though Amgen shares may not gain in leaps and bounds  for a long term investor who wants a solid dividend paying stock  Amgen makes a good addition to a biotech portfolio  The company s efforts in the pipeline and partnerships indicate that the current earnings slowdown is transient  and as for dividends  the 2019 total dividend was  5 80 a share  for a yield around 3  with a well supported payout ratio around 45   The stock lost 10  in January  offering investors a decent entry point for shares they will want to hold on to for a long while ",2020-02-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/psre4,2079826

148525,370041,AMGN,Bristol Myers   BMY  Q4 Earnings   Revenues Beat Estimates,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   reported better than expected results for the fourth quarter of 2019 on stellar performance of its blood thinner drug  Eliquis  and addition of sales from Celgene s drugs  The numbers included Celgene s results  following its acquisition on Nov 20 
Shares were up 2 9  in pre market trading  following the earnings release  Bristol Myers  shares have increased 31 1  in the past year compared with the  s rise of 12 7  

 
Fourth quarter 2019 earnings of  1 22 per share easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents and increased from the year ago quarter s earnings of 94 cents 
Total revenues of  7 95 billion comprehensively beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 14 billion and increased 33  from  5 97 billion in the year ago period  Strong growth was mainly driven by addition of Celgene s products 
Full Year Results
Bristol Myers  adjusted earnings per share were  4 69 per share for the full year  up 18   Full year revenues rose 16  to approximately  26 1 billion 
Quarterly Details
Revenues were up 34  year over year when adjusted for foreign exchange impact  Revenues increased 42  to  4 8 billion in the United States and 21  outside the country  Ex U S  revenues were up 23  when adjusted for foreign exchange impact 
Eliquis witnessed strong growth and was the top revenue generator for the company yet again  Sales of the drug rose 19  to  2 billion  We note that Bristol Myers has a collaboration agreement with Pfizer   NYSE PFE   for Eliquis  Sales of Opdivo  which is approved for multiple cancer indications  were down 2  year over year to  1 76 billion  While sales of Eliquis rose 18   Opdivo sales were down 10  in the United States 
Leukemia drug  Sprycel  raked in sales of  549 million  up 2  year over year  Sales of rheumatoid arthritis drug  Orencia were up 8  to  792 million  Melanoma drug  Yervoy  contributed  385 million to the top line  flat year over year 
Multiple myeloma drug  Empliciti  recorded sales of  94 million  up 36  year over year 
The performance of key drugs in the Virology unit were disappointing  Sales of Baraclude declined 26  to  122 million  Sales of other brands  including Sustiva  Reyataz  Daklinza and all other products that have lost exclusivity in major markets  fell 39  year over year to  356 million 
Myeloma drug  Revlimid  added with Celgene s acquisition contributed  1 3 billion to the top line  Other key drugs from Celgene   Pomalyst and Abraxane   generated sales of  322 million and  166 million  respectively 
Adjusted research and development  R D  expenses in the quarter were up 44 4  to  1 96 billion  Adjusted marketing  selling and administrative expenses increased 27 3  to  1 7 billion 
Gross margin was 68 6  in the quarter compared with 72  in the year ago quarter 
Celgene Acquisition Update
In November  Bristol Myers completed the previously announced acquisition of biotech bigwig Celgene Corporation  NASDAQ CELG  for a whopping  74 billion  The acquisition added blockbuster oncology drug  Revlimid to Bristol Myers portfolio  Bristol Myers owns approximately 69  of the combined entity  while Celgene shareholders own approximately 31  
In November  Celgene sold its global rights to psoriasis drug  Otezla  to Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN   in connection with the regulatory approval process for Celgene s acquisition by Bristol Myers 
Pipeline Update
Bristol Myers recently withdrew its application in the European Union   EU   for the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy for the treatment of advanced non small cell lung cancer   NSCLC   based on data from CheckMate 227 
Though the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use acknowledged the integrity of the patient data  it determined that a full assessment of the application was not possible following the multiple protocol changes the company made in response to the rapidly evolving science and data  Consequently  Bristol Myers has no plans to resubmit this application in the EU 
In January 2020  the FDA granted a Priority Review status to the Opdivo Yervoy combination for the treatment of first line NSCLC 
The FDA accepted the supplemental Biologics License Application  sBLA  and granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to the combination for the treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma   HCC   previously treated with sorafenib  The FDA granted a Priority Review to the application  with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act   PDUFA   goal date of Mar 10  2020 
2020 Guidance
Bristol Myers provided guidance for revenues and adjusted earnings in 2020  The company projects earnings of  6 00  6 20 per share  The company expects revenues for 2020 in the range of  40 5 billion  42 5 billion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings is pegged at  42 11 billion and  6 04 per share  respectively 
The company expects adjusted earnings per share in 2021 to be between  7 15 and  7 45 
Our Take
Bristol Myers  performance in the fourth quarter was encouraging  Earnings and sales beat estimates primarily on addition of Celgene s drugs to its portfolio  However  weak growth in Opdivo sales is a concern  Withdrawal of regulatory application seeking label expansion of Opdivo as first line treatment for advanced NSCLC in Europe is also discouraging 
Potential approval for Opdivo s label expansion to include HCC patients and first line metastatic or recurrent NSCLC patients with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations will likely boost sales of the drug  The drug faces stiff competition from Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda and Roche s Tecentriq 
The acquisition of Celgene holds promise as it boosted Bristol Myers  oncology franchise and added diverse pipeline in the therapeutic areas of inflammatory  immunologic and cardiovascular diseases  Moreover  the deal is expected to be 40  accretive to the bottom line on a standalone basis in 2020  Bristol Myers expects to realize cost synergies of approximately  2 5 billion by 2022 Bristol Myers Squibb Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

148528,370044,AMGN,Stocks Jump On Feb  6  Setting Up For A Post Job Data Rip Higher,opinion,"S P 500  SPY  NYSE SPY  
Stocks jumped once again but seemed to hit a brick wall at 3 346 and managed to find support 3 341  on the S P 500 cash  It is creating what appears to be a bullish flag pattern that would suggest the index rises from its current levels  tomorrow 
I find it particularly interesting because other markets do not seem nearly as supportive of this increase  and I do not know what to make of it  But we have to follow the trends  and can t fight it  I guess  there is no other explanation 
Based on the pattern and its projection  it amounts to about a 1  increase to around 3 375  So we can all wait overnight and hold our breath as to what the next major move in the market is 






The nice thing about such a late write up is that we get a head start on tomorrow because the S P 500 futures are already breaking out of that pattern  as Japan trades higher by 25 bps  despite South Korea down 40 bps 







Tomorrow  of course  is the big job data and based on all of my extensive research  the number should be pretty healthy and likely better than expected  Jobless claims have fallen significantly on the 4 week moving average  and the ADP employment was much better than expected  Based on my math  which isn t always perfect  I came to a reading of around 320 000 jobs created in January  This number is a moving target  though  and nearly impossible to predict  because the numbers from previous months will be revised  I went through all most of the significant points in a video today  although I didn t go through my secret formula for my guesstimate  
Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  






Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  almost had an average day of trading  rising by just 2   But that doesn t tell the whole tale  because shares fell as low as  687 and traded as high as  795  Just a typical day of trading  with a more than  100 point trading range  Anyway  the stock seemed to find some support at the uptrend around  that s a plus 
Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN 
Another stock that has been trading all over the place is Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   and this one seems almost impossible to figure out  The one thing that seems clear is that resistance appears to be at the upper downtrend  I think there is a good chance it trades down to  225 






Disney  DIS  
Disney seems like it is trending higher  and holding on to key support levels  but the stock doesn t seem to be acting the way we expected  The stock does have a nice double bottom in the chart  but I do not see any clear patterns or directions at this point  We are going to have to give this a few days to see how it settles out  or at least until we get some clear sense of direction 






Alpahbet  GOOGL 
It is nice to see that Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  has started to come around after that post earnings drop  It looks like shares are consolidating and forming a symmetrical triangle  which could result in the stock breaking higher perhaps to  1 600  which is that level we have been looking to achieve for some time now  Free Article

148559,370075,AMGN,Amgen 2020 outlook falls short of Street estimates  shares down 3 ,news,"By Deena Beasley
 Reuters     Amgen Inc   O AMGN  on Thursday forecast 2020 earnings well short of current Wall Street estimates  sending shares of the largest U S  biotechnology company down 3  
For the full year  the company forecast earnings of  14 85 to  15 60 per share on revenue as high as  25 6 billion  Analysts had estimated 2020 adjusted earnings of  16 14 on revenue of  25 5 billion  according to Refinitiv IBES data 
A company official attributed the difference to lower interest income and Amgen s recently acquired 20 5  stake in China s  BeiGene Ltd   HK 6160   which is not yet profitable 
For the fourth quarter of last year  Amgen said its sales fell 2  from a year earlier due to competition from lower cost generic drugs and biosimilars  but share buybacks enabled the company to post a profit that topped Wall Street estimates 
Sales for the quarter totaled  5 88 billion  Total revenue fell 1  to  6 2 billion  which was ahead of the average analyst estimate of  6 06 billion 
Quarterly adjusted earnings per share rose 6  to  3 64  beating the average Wall Street estimate of  3 48 
Net earnings fell 5  to  2 85 per share due to higher operating costs partially offset by a lower share count 
Sales of older drugs such as white blood cell booster Neulasta and kidney drug Sensipar fell sharply due to competition from cheaper versions  Neulasta was down 43  at  665 million and Sensipar sales were off by 76  at  107 million 
Sales of newer drugs like cholesterol fighter Repatha and migraine drug Aimovig rose  Repatha was up by 26  to  200 million  while Aimovig rose 3  to  98 million in the quarter 
Amgen said it bought back around 6  of its outstanding shares last year 
Shares of the company were down  7 15  or 3 2   at  219 in after hours trading ",2020-01-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/amgen-2020-outlook-falls-short-of-street-estimates-shares-down-3-2072383,2072383
148560,370076,AMGN,Amgen Revenue Slipped 1  in the Fourth Quarter,news,"Fourth quarter revenue for Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  slipped 1  year over year to  6 2 billion as the company faced competition from biosimilar and generic competition for its older medications  Adjusted earnings per share increased 6  year over year  boosted by the company s repurchase of 40 2 million shares for  7 6 billion during 2019 
Sales of Parsabiv  which helps patients on hemodialysis  jumped 49  year over year  Cholesterol lowering Repatha saw sales increase 26  year over year as Amgen parlayed data from an outcomes study showing the drug reduces cardiovascular events  Sales of osteoporosis treatment Prolia and immune thrombocytopenia treatment Nplate both increased 15  year over year  Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis treatment Otezla  which Amgen acquired to facilitate Bristol Myers Squibb s  NYSE BMY  closing of its deal with Celgene  added  178 million in revenue during the five weeks or so that Amgen owned the drug during the quarter 

While Amgen fights biosimilars to its branded drugs  it s also launching biosimilars of its own  including Avsola  a biosimilar to Johnson   Johnson s  NYSE JNJ  Remicade that gained Food and Drug Administration approval in December  The drugmaker also has a biosimilar to Biogen s  NASDAQ BIIB  and Roche s  OTC RHHBY  Rituxan that was submitted to the FDA in December 
Management guided for 2020 revenue of  25 0 billion to  25 6 billion  up 8 2  at the midpoint  Adjusted earnings per share are expected to fall in the  14 85 to  15 60 range  higher than the  14 82 Amgen recorded last year  but up just 2 7  at the midpoint  suggesting that the company plans to increase spending faster than revenue this year ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pp6d6,2072503

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorMy name is Ian and I will be you conference facilitator today for Amgen s Fourth Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call   Operator Instructions I would now like introduce Arvind Sood  Vice President of Investor Relations  Mr  Sood  you may now begin Arvind Sood    Vice President of Investor RelationsOkay  Thank you  Ian  Good afternoon  everybody  Thanks for joining us today  So  2019 was the year that we made significant progress on our strategy and took steps that position us well for what will surely be a special year in 2020 as we celebrate our 40th anniversary  What better gift to celebrate this important milestone than to get back to revenue growth So  our Chairman and CEO  Bob Bradway  will lead the discussion today  We are also joined today by our new CFO  Peter Griffith  who will provide a financial update on our results for Q4 and full year 2019 and provide guidance for 2020  Our Head of Global Commercial Operations  Murdo Gordon  will then review our product performance  followed by our Head of R D  Dave Reese  who will provide a pipeline update  We will use slides to guide our discussion today  and you should have received the link separately We ll also use non GAAP financial measures in today s presentation  and some of the statements will be forward looking statements  Our 10 K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our results  actual results to differ materially So with that  I would like to turn the call over to Bob  Bob Robert A  Bradway    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Thank you  Arvind  and good afternoon  everyone  and thank you for joining our call  Heading into 2020  we feel ready for the challenges of a new year and we re feeling encouraged by the progress we made in 2019  Once again  this past year  we met and exceeded our financial targets  We advanced key elements of our long term growth strategy and we served more patients around the world with our growing portfolio of medicines 2019 was the transition year  we had long been preparing for  as many of our off patent legacy products faced new competition  I believe we managed this transition well  as evidenced by the fact that we delivered earnings growth in 2019 and will return to top line growth in 2020 In 2019  drug prices in the US actually fell overall for the first time since 1974  In anticipation of this challenge  we repositioned the Company s expense base and embedded productivity initiatives over the past several years that are serving us well  In addition  we reshaped our product portfolio committing to medicines that can deliver growth for us primarily through volume increases rather than price increases  Products like Repatha  Aimovig  Prolia  EVENITY  and most recently Otezla In 2019  we delivered 3  volume growth globally and 19  volume growth outside the United States  We re seeing especially strong performance in our Asia Pacific region  albeit from a small base  Over the next decade  we expect this region to account for as much as 25  of Amgen s growth  For the full year in 2019  volume in the region grew 62   Over two thirds of that growth came from our joint venture with Astellas in Japan  the world s third largest pharmaceutical market  Just a reminder that this collaboration reverts fully to Amgen on April 1st  enabling us to do business in Japan through a wholly owned subsidiary for the first time Our strategic collaboration in China with BeiGene closed a few weeks ago and we re excited by what our two companies can achieve together in the world s second largest pharmaceutical market 2019 was also a watershed year for us  for our biosimilars business  We ve delivered our first several biosimilars to market on time and on budget and we believe we are in the early innings of what can be an important growth opportunity for us over time  Through the end of Q4  the business was already annualizing at over  1 billion and we will add to our portfolio later this year with the launch of AVSOLA  our biosimilar to Remicade  We also expect that AMGEVITA  our biosimilar to Humira in Europe and other parts of the world will benefit from our recent acquisition of Otezla A key pillar of our growth strategy continues to be bringing to market first in class or best in class medicines that deliver a large effect size for patients suffering from serious illnesses  The world is growing older  wealthier  and more urban  and these mega trends mean that the world will need more biopharmaceutical innovation  not less  We intend to be a leader in delivering that innovation We expect several important data readouts from our pipeline in 2020  We expect data for AMG 510 or KRAS G12C inhibitor  for tezepelumab in allergic and non allergic asthma  for omecamtiv and heart failure  and look for Otezla in mild to moderate psoriasis  In addition  we d expect to generate some important data across our BiTE portfolio in 2020 as well and Dave Reese will provide details on all of this shortly Last year  we also expanded our commitment to discovery research  strengthening our world leading human genetics capabilities through a number of collaborations while adding large scale proteomic data as well  We remain excited about how our approach is enabling us to identify and pursue new targets and the patients who stand to benefit most from them Everything we see in our Company and across the industry continues to make us feel that we re living in an incredible age of biotechnology innovation  Across diseases  we re seeing more and more reason to be optimistic about the next breakthrough for patients  At the same time  we know that governments and individuals are struggling with how to pay for these breakthroughs  We accept responsibility to be part of the solution  both in advancing innovation that really matters and in providing innovative ways for patients to get access to it In an election year  there is bound to be much discussion about healthcare and we look forward to engaging with other stakeholders to promote market based solutions that promotes innovative medicines and affordable access to them Just as we recognize that we need to be a constructive stakeholder to help sustain the robust ecosystem that exists for biotechnology innovation in the US  so too do we recognize and accept the need to be part of the process of addressing other environmental  social  and governance matters that are of concern in our communities today  To that end  several years ago  we set targets for reducing our carbon emissions and water consumption by the year 2020  Having hit those targets in 2019  a year earlier than planned  we are now developing a next set of goals that we will share later this year  These goals will include a further commitment to our next generation manufacturing technologies  which have a much smaller environmental footprint than traditional biologics manufacturing and enable us to operate at a lower cost  too Now  let me turn over the call to our new CFO  Peter Griffith  You ll recall that Peter joined us in October  and he ll take you through the details of our performance in 2019 and our outlook for 2020  Peter  over to you Peter Griffith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Bob  Let me begin by saying how happy I am to join Amgen at such an exciting time in the Company s 40 year history  I also want to take a moment to thank David Meline  the Amgen team  as well as many of you on the call who have helped me transition into the role  Over the last several months  I ve enjoyed meeting many of our investors  as well as members of the analyst community  and I look forward to the continued dialogue and engagement Now  let s turn to the fourth quarter financial results on Page six of the slide deck  Revenues at  6 2 billion decreased 1  year over year in the fourth quarter  In the quarter  we saw worldwide product sales declined 2  to  5 9 billion as our portfolio transitioned with declines in our mature products  substantially offset by our growth and launch products  We are particularly encouraged by the strong 21  volume driven growth from our ex US markets  which gives us confidence as we continue our global expansion including into China  which will also benefit from our collaboration with BeiGene  which closed earlier this month Foreign exchange had a 1  negative impact to fourth quarter worldwide sales on a year over year basis Other revenues at  316 million were up  87 million versus Q4 2018 Our Q4 non GAAP operating income at  2 6 billion decreased 4  from prior year  Non GAAP operating margin was 44 6  for the quarter  compared to 45 3  in Q4 of 2018  As previously indicated  our operating expenses reflected the typical underlining    underlying fourth quarter pattern  increased investment in our rapidly evolving oncology pipeline portfolio and additional operating expenses associated with the Otezla acquisition  which closed in Q4  These increases were partially offset by continued favorable expense impacts from our productivity initiatives across all operating expense categories Other income and expenses were a net  65 million expense in Q4  representing  132 million of year over year favorability  This favorability was driven by gains generated from liquidating bond investments to fund the Otezla and BeiGene transaction and favorable market value fluctuations of publicly traded securities held in our Ventures portfolio  partially offset by lower interest income due to reduced cash balances The non GAAP tax rate was 14 9  for the quarter  a 1 6 point increase versus Q4 2018  primarily due to a one time prior year tax benefit associated with intercompany sales under US Corporate Tax Reform Non GAAP net income was  2 2 billion and non GAAP earnings per share increased 6  year over year for the fourth quarter  supported by a 7  reduction in share count versus Q4 2018 Next  I will review our 2019  full year results on Page seven of the presentation  Our 2019  full year revenues decreased 2  to  23 4 billion  while our non GAAP earnings per share grew 3  to  14 82 per share  For the full year  we saw a 1  decline in worldwide product sales to  22 2 billion  Volume growth in markets outside the US was 19  year over year  Other revenues at  1 2 billion were down  56 million year over year For the full year  non GAAP operating income at  11 2 billion decreased 6  from the prior year  and our non GAAP operating margin was 50 2  for the year  down from 52 6  in 2018  In total  non GAAP operating expenses increased 3  year over year to  12 2 billion  This growth was driven by research and development investments  launch product support  and the addition of Otezla to our business  partially offset by our productivity program Other income and expenses were favorable by  250 million on a year over year basis due primarily to gains in 2019 from liquidating bonds to fund the Otezla and BeiGene transactions  partially offset by lower interest income resulting from reduced cash balances The non GAAP tax rate was 15  for the full year  up 1 5 points versus 2018  Again  primarily due to a one time prior year tax benefit associated with intercompany sales under US Corporate Tax Reform Turning next to cash flow in the balance sheet on Page eight  For the full year 2019  Amgen continued to generate strong cash flow  reflecting a diversified portfolio of products coupled with an industry leading cost structure  Free cash flow was  8 5 billion in 2019 versus  10 6 billion in 2018  The decline driven by lower net income  timing of working capital  and an advance tax deposit In 2019  we returned a total of  11 1 billion to shareholders through dividend payments totaling  3 5 billion and  7 6 billion used to repurchase 40 2 million shares at an average of  190 per share  And this follows the  21 4 billion return of capital to shareholders in 2018 Cash and investments totaled  8 9 billion at the end of 2019  a decrease of  20 4 billion from the end of 2018  This decrease was primarily driven by the Otezla transaction  cash return to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases  as well as debt repayment  All partially offset by free cash flow generated during the period  Debt outstanding at year end totaled  29 9 billion and carries a weighted average interest rate of 3 7  with an average maturity of 12 years Now  turning to the outlook for the business for 2020 on Page nine  2020 will be another important year for Amgen  as we continue to invest in the pipeline to generate innovative and differentiated molecules  build out the global business  and support the growth of our new products  As previously discussed  in anticipation of this opportunity and continued downward pressure on net prices  we developed a productivity capability to enable us to fully invest from a position of strength Our 2020 revenue guidance is  25 0 billion to  25 6 billion and our non GAAP earnings per share guidance is  14 85 per share to  15 60 per share GAAP earnings per share guidance is  10 85 per share to  11 65 per share  which divergence from non GAAP EPS  primarily due to the amortization of intangibles related to our Otezla acquisition Our non GAAP tax rate guidance is 13 5  to 14 5  and once again  we expect capital expenditures of approximately  700 million this year  including our industry leading environmentally friendly next generation manufacturing facility in Rhode Island Let me mention several key assumptions embedded in our guidance  First  our revenue guidance range reflects continued strong worldwide growth from products including Prolia  EVENITY  Repatha  Aimovig  Otezla and our biosimilar portfolio  At the same time  we expect increasing competition against our filgrastim and ESA franchises  as well as Sensipar Next  with regard to net selling prices  we experienced a 5  decline globally in 2019  For 2020  we expect to again experience low  to middle single digit declines globally  We expect our volume growth to more than offset the net price declines  Overall  as previously stated  excluding Otezla  we expect our base business to be stable in 2020 on a year over year basis As you model revenue in 2020  note that historically the first quarter represents the lowest product sales quarter of the year  As a percent of the full year  product sales for the first quarter should look similar to the percentage we saw in Q1 of 2019  Murdo will explain further in his remarks With respect to other revenue  we expect about  1 1 billion for the full year 2020  as we anticipate increased competition against our royalty product portfolio From an operating expense perspective  overall we expect 2020 total non GAAP operating expenses to grow in the low double digit percentage range year over year on an absolute basis As previously communicated  we reiterate the following three assumptions  Non GAAP R D investment to increase as we invest in our advancing innovative pipeline programs and new Otezla indications  partially offset by R D recoveries received from our BeiGene collaboration Second  non GAAP SG A expense to increase due to the acquisition of Otezla  as well as modest incremental investment in support of our base business  as we continue to expand globally  including China and Japan  grow our biosimilars business and begin product launch preparation for our late stage pipeline Non GAAP cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be generally consistent with 2019  We expect all expense categories to continue to benefit from our productivity program We anticipate non GAAP other income and expense to be a net expense in a range between  1 2 billion and  1 4 billion  This is primarily driven by lower interest income as a result of cash used to fund the Otezla and BeiGene transactions  as well as our 20 5  share of BeiGene s results based on current publicly available consensus estimates  I note that our 20 5  share of BeiGene s results will be booked one quarter in arrears in accordance with the equity method of accounting and therefore  begins in Q2 2020 As you know  on April 1  2020  Amgen will purchase the 49  of shares in Amgen Astellas BioPharma that are held by Astellas for a nominal fee  making the company a wholly owned Amgen subsidiary  First  let me say how excited we are about this transition as it marks the achievement of a long term strategic objective  We look forward to further leveraging this platform as we seek to bring Amgen s new medicines to patients in the third largest pharmaceutical market  From a financial perspective  we anticipate limited near term financial impact resulting from this transition Now  with regard to capital deployment  Our actions will continue to reflect the following principles  First  we will invest in our business to expand our pipeline of innovative medicines and to seek to drive long term volume growth globally  We will also invest in prudent external business development opportunities Second  we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders in the form of growing dividends  including the 10  increase in the first quarter of 2020  Technical Issues   1 60  Phonetic  per share  as well as continued share repurchases  We will continue to take an opportunistic view toward the timing of share repurchases within  20  We expect share repurchases within a range of  3 billion to  5 billion and have an authorization outstanding in the amount of  6 5 billion And third  we remain committed to maintaining an optimal capital structure in order to minimize our weighted average cost to capital and retain our investment grade rating  Consistent with our usual practice  our guidance today does not include the impact of potential external business development activities So  in summary  we delivered another year of strong financial results in 2019  and we remain confident in the outlook for Amgen s success in 2020 and beyond This concludes the financial update  I will now turn the call over to Murdo Murdo Gordon    Executive Vice President  Global Commercial OperationsThanks  Peter  and good afternoon  everyone  I ll take a few minutes to reflect on 2019 and then review Q4 in greater detail  In the 40 years since incorporation  Amgen s product portfolio and geographical footprint has changed dramatically  On our 40th anniversary  we reflect on the pioneering innovative spirit of our early Amgen employees that transformed the treatment of disease  Our mission to serve patients remains unchanged and it motivates us every single day  Our accomplishments on behalf of patients in 2019 give us further confidence about our future as we enter 2020 To summarize 2019  for the full year  we grew volume by 3   The growing proportion of our portfolio posted 35  year over year volume increases  This portfolio is diverse and includes products such as Prolia  EVENITY  Repatha  Aimovig  Otezla  AMGEVITA  our six hematology and oncology brands  as well as MVASI and KANJINTI Finally  our international business contributed 19  volume growth in 2019  Notably  year over year revenues for our businesses in China and Japan grew nearly eight fold  These markets are long term growth engines for Amgen and our collaboration with BeiGene  along with our acquisition of Otezla will accelerate our expansions in the second and third largest pharmaceutical markets Now  moving to fourth quarter results  Volumes grew by 3  year over year  In Q4  net selling prices declined 4  year over year  resulting in reported net sales declining by 2   As Peter mentioned  we have a stable outlook for our base business for 2020 and with the addition of Otezla  we expect revenue growth this year despite projecting continued declines in net selling price on a portfolio basis Now  getting into product details  Prolia delivered 15  growth year over year  driven by higher volume from increasing rates of new patient growth and strong repeat injection rates  Recall that given twice a year dosing  Prolia experiences consistent seasonal trends  EVENITY posted  85 million in the fourth quarter  driven by strong uptake in both Japan and the US  Every year  worldwide 8 9 million fractures occur due to osteoporosis  That s one fracture every three seconds  and only 20  of women who experienced a fracture are treated with a bone building medicine  Given the under penetrated nature of this market  we continue to focus on ensuring postmenopausal women receive appropriate screening  diagnosis  and treatment  With Prolia and EVENITY  we have excellent treatment options to offer these patients On to Repatha  Q4 sales grew by 26  year over year  as we continue to be the leader in the PCSK9 class  Worldwide unit growth was 67  year over year  And new to brand US prescriptions are steadily improving growing at 61  year over year  We ve taken significant steps and have made major progress in improving access and affordability for Repatha  We removed the original list price offering  We simplified and improved prescription approval rates and commercial plans and we have increased the percentage of Medicare patients up to 70  that can access Repatha at a more affordable co pay  Although the blended net price of Repatha in the US declined in Q4 versus the previous year  net selling price was relatively stable sequentially  For 2020  we expect a step down in Repatha s net selling price in Q1 based on our contracting to obtain broader access with stabilization thereafter Now  onto Aimovig on Slide 16  On a year over year basis  volume grew 27   while net sales grew 3   As a reminder  Q4 2018 benefited from  20 million of favorable changes in accounting estimates impacting the year over year comparison on a quarter over quarter basis  Unit volume grew 9   To date  almost 300 000 patients have been prescribed Aimovig by more than 33 000 prescribers  Considering that there are 4 million migraine patients in the US who are eligible for CGRP treatment  Aimovig has significant potential remaining to penetrate this market  and we expect to drive volume growth over the course of 2020 Aimovig leads in both new to CGRP prescriptions and total prescriptions  which exited Q4 with a 48  TRx share  Aimovig has exceptional access with over 80  of prescriptions paid and over 92  of lives covered  As a result of this broader access  we expect net price to decline slightly on a full year basis for 2020  when compared to the full year 2019  Additionally  Q1 has lower sales in subsequent quarters due to the impact of benefit plan changes  insurance reverifications  and greater co pay expenses as patients work through their deductibles We ll move to Parsabiv on Slide 17  which grew by 49  year over year in the fourth quarter  Independent and midsize dialysis providers already utilize Parsabiv for a majority of their calcimimetic patients  while FMC and DaVita continue to increase adoption Next  onto Otezla  With the help of the dedicated professionals that have joined our team from Celgene  we will continue to drive strong sales growth and launch potential new indications for Otezla  During the period since acquisition close  prescription momentum continued with 13  year over year growth  Our seamless integration efforts  combined with planned  label and geographic expansion gives us confidence in our ability to grow Otezla at low double digit compound annual growth rate over the next five years  For the approximately five weeks post closing in 2019  Otezla sales were  178 million  We expect first quarter sales to be proportionally lower than in the remaining quarters of the year  The quarterly pattern for Otezla in 2020 should approximate the historical pattern over the last number of years Moving onto Enbrel  Sales increased 2  year over year  driven by a  66 million favorable change in accounting estimates and increases in net selling price  partially offset by unit volume declines  Volume trends in 2020 are expected to be similar to those in 2019  As for net selling price  we project limited benefit in 2020 versus 2019 due to less favorable contract terms With two highly complementary products  targeting psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis  we see an opportunity to strengthen their positions in the market  More broadly  we re increasing our focus in inflammation through our broad portfolio  which includes our biosimilars  AMGEVITA  and AVSOLA  Our late stage asset tezepelumab and a number of other earlier assets in the R D pipeline Now  to our hematology and oncology business  which is highly integrated with our oncology biosimilars that I ll discuss later  Our innovative portfolio of six brands XGEVA  KYPROLIS  Nplate  Vectibix  BLINCYTO  and IMLYGIC collectively totaled  1 2 billion in the quarter  growing 10  year over year As for some of the larger brands within this portfolio  XGEVA grew 7  in Q4 year over year  driven by 4  volume growth  KYPROLIS grew 6  year over year  driven by volume led by a 12  increase in the US    in US sales  Nplate grew 15  year over year  driven by volume  Our investments in R D for Nplate have resulted in two innovations  First  we recently launched a smaller presentation at 125 micrograms in support of in Nplate s pediatric indication  as the product is administered with weight based dosing  This new presentation will also help to minimize general product wastage for ITP patients across all indications  Second  Nplate received approval in October for the treatment of early ITP  which gives us the chance to serve patients earlier in the course of their disease and provides the opportunity for treatment free remission Now  onto our more mature brands  in Q4  Neulasta sales declined 43  year over year  with a 42  decline in the US  Recall that Q4 of 2018 benefited from a  55 million BARDA order  which did not repeat in Q4 of 2019  Coinciding with the emergence of US biosimilar competition  the most recent CMS published ASP for Neulasta reflects a 10  reduction  Bear in mind that ASP is calculated two quarters in arrears On a volume basis in Q4  US Neulasta retained an exit share of 74  of the long acting segment with Onpro holding an exit share of 55   We are encouraged by Onpro s durability demonstrating confidence that our customers have  in the reliability and quality of our supply  along with our broader customer services  We now face a third biosimilar competitor in the US and other potential competitors remain in development  As you model Neulasta sales for the first quarter  recall that Q1 2019 benefited from a  98 million BARDA order that we do not project to recur in 2020 Finally  outside the US  sales declined 48  in Q4 and we expect those trends to continue  Switching to Nephrology  starting on Slide 25  Q4 EPOGEN sales declined 20  primarily due to lower net selling price from our contractual commitments with DaVita  which calls for a further price reduction in 2020  Meanwhile  Aranesp declined 10  year over year driven by lower volume due to increased competition Regarding Sensipar  recall that in the US  there were several at risk generic launches in 2019 that resulted in year over year sales declining 76  to  107 million in the quarter  In 2020  supplemental patent protection certificates for cinacalcet expire in France  Germany  Italy  Spain  and the United Kingdom  which will likely result in a significant decline in ex US sales in 2020 I ll close the product section with our biosimilar portfolio  which is highly integrated with our innovative business throughout the Company  As examples  a majority of these products were made with the same manufacturing network as our innovative brands  We also leverage the same supply chain for distribution  And on the commercial side  we continue to identify synergies in commercializing our biosimilars alongside our innovative products  making it a highly efficient selling model  and allowing us to rapidly apply learnings across our portfolio We also offer the same provider and patient services as with our innovative portfolio  These advantages are increasingly important as we now face additional biosimilar competition to KANJINTI and MVASI and expect other competitors to enter during 2020  Our Q4 biosimilar portfolio comprised of KANJINTI and MVASI in the US and AMGEVITA  KANJINTI and MVASI outside of the US recorded sales of  258 million In the US  KANJINTI and MVASI each recorded  79 million of sales  and we ve seen very encouraging adoption rates in the clinic segment and hospital adoption is accelerating  Given the early stage of launch  there is also some inventory stocking during the quarter  Ex US sales from our biosimilars where  100 million led by AMGEVITA  We continue to see important differences between products and markets in terms of uptake and price erosion with some markets experiencing strong uptake at more discounted pricing levels  while other larger markets  including Germany and France exhibit a more balanced and sustainable opportunity  Here again  we re able to leverage our expertise and footprint in oncology  while AMGEVITA efforts synergized nicely with Otezla In summary  2019 was a solid year given the evolution of our product portfolio  In 2020  we plan to drive volume uptake of our growth portfolio of products  now including Otezla while defending our mature brands Let me now turn it over to Dave Reese David M  Reese    Executive Vice President  Research and DevelopmentThanks  Murdo  and good afternoon  everyone  As we enter 2020  we are looking forward to important clinical data from programs across our three therapeutic areas  inflammation  oncology  and cardiovascular disease  I ll say more about oncology in a moment  but I d like to take the opportunity upfront to express our enthusiasm for the BeiGene collaboration  We re off to a good start and look forward to working together to advance the global development of our pipeline of innovative oncology molecules I ll now begin my quarterly review in inflammation  We expect Otezla data this year from a Phase 3 study in over 500 patients with mild to moderate psoriasis that have failed topical therapy  This patient population has no approved oral therapy available and we are confident that Otezla may provide a much needed treatment option  We re working with the CHMP toward a Behcet s indication in Europe and with the FDA on inclusion of the scalp psoriasis data in the US label this year  There are also ongoing studies for new indications  including pediatric psoriasis and we re evaluating additional studies to expand the opportunity for Otezla I ll also remind you that later this year  we expect Phase 3 data from our TSLP antibody  tezepelumab in development with AstraZeneca in severe uncontrolled asthma In bone health  along with UCB  we were pleased to receive European approval for EVENITY for the treatment of severe osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture  EVENITY is the first new osteoporosis medicine approved in Europe in the last decade  a testament to the need for a new therapy that can rapidly build bone Turning to oncology and hematology  we continue to rapidly advance the development program for AMG 510  our first in class KRAS G12C inhibitor  We enrolled the potentially pivotal Phase 2 monotherapy study in advanced non small cell lung cancer in approximately three months and look forward to sharing data later this year when we have at least six months follow up on all patients  I previously mentioned that we had enrolled a cohort of advanced colorectal cancer patients in our Phase 2 monotherapy study  Based on the data we have generated to date  we have opened the study to further enrollment and we ll assess our potential development path in colorectal cancer as additional data become available We also expect to present additional data later this year from our first in human monotherapy study in solid tumors  where we will have more information on duration of therapy  as well as data in tumor types other than lung and colon cancer  We also expect initial data from our Phase 1 combination study with KEYTRUDA in advanced non small cell lung cancer We are enrolling advanced colorectal and non small cell lung cancer patients in our MEK inhibitor combination study  as well as treatment naive non small cell lung cancer patients in our ongoing Phase 1 monotherapy study  We continue to plan additional studies primarily combination trials and we ll provide updates as the program progresses We remain enthusiastic about our BiTE platform  and 2020 will be an important year  Based on emerging evidence of anti tumor activity in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors  we are growing increasingly confident in the half life extended format  As we advance our BiTE clinical programs in different tumor settings  we are gaining important insights into dose and schedule and management of adverse events  such as cytokine release syndrome  These insights will guide customized development approaches  depending on the target and underlying disease biology  Over the course of the year  we anticipate sharing data from some of these programs and I ll provide further guidance on expected data presentations as these molecules advance We are now pursuing two half life extended BiTE programs for gastric cancer and recently initiated a first in human study for AMG 199  which is directed against MUC17  a target widely expressed in gastric cancer  Gastric cancer  as you know  is highly prevalent in East Asia  where we have a growing presence through our impending Japan subsidiary and collaboration with BeiGene As I previously discussed  we intend to present the data for AMG 701  or half life extended BCMA BiTE when we have a meaningful dataset  most likely in the second half of this year We ve also made several regulatory submissions in oncology  including the KYPROLIS CANDOR study in the US  KYPROLIS plus dexamethasone in China for relapse and refractory multiple myeloma and BLINCYTO in China for relapsed refractory AOL  We look forward to working with BeiGene to advance these important medicines In cardiovascular disease  along with Cytokinetics  we look forward to the data from the omecamtiv mecarbil Phase 3 outcome study in the fourth quarter of this year  While the heart failure treatment landscape is expected to change based on recent data from other drug classes  we believe significant residual unmet medical need remains in this global epidemic  Also  in cardiovascular disease  our Lp a  siRNA  AMG 890 continues to advance and we expect to initiate Phase 2 development in the first half of the year Finally  on biosimilars  we re pleased to receive US approval for AVSOLA  our biosimilar Remicade and to make our US regulatory submission for ABP 798  our biosimilar Rituxan  I m also pleased to announce that we are initiating a Phase 3 study with our 7th biosimilar ABP 938  our biosimilar aflibercept or EYLEA Bob Robert A  Bradway    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Thanks  Dave  Ian  why don t we open the lines up for questions now and please remind our callers of the process Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question is from the line of Jay Olson from Oppenheimer   Company  Jay Jay Olson    Oppenheimer   Co     AnalystOh  hi  Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking the question  You talked a little bit about net pricing dynamics for Aimovig  Could you maybe elaborate a little bit on how you expect the competitive dynamic to shape up in the CGRP space and any long term data you could potentially leverage there  Thank you Murdo Gordon    Executive Vice President  Global Commercial OperationsThanks for the question  Jay  it s Murdo here  We re very pleased with Aimovig s market access position now with over 92  of covered lives  having access to Aimovig at a very affordable co pay  We re also pleased with the addition this year of CVS  Last year  we did not have CVS as a benefit    with Aimovig as a benefit and we do  as of the beginning of this year  and we ve already seen an acceleration in our new patient uptake  We are happy that the percentage of patients that are receiving paid prescriptions now of Aimovig is above 80  and that bodes well for the future growth of this category because we ve got highly effective medicines that have an impact    a significant impact on the reduction of migraine days on migraine sufferers and we have a lot of them  there is 4 million eligible patients out there in the US and they re able to access Aimovig at a very affordable co pay  So that s good for the future outlook of the category Obviously  because we did contract to secure that additional access  there will be a reduction in our net selling price that you ll see in Q1  and then we expect it to be relatively stable over time  Now  because this is a retail benefit product  you do see some fluctuations as you make true ups in the mix of your product that comes through Medicaid commercial or to some extent Medicare Part D  But overall  we would expect post Q1 stability in net selling price Robert A  Bradway    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAll right  Let s go to the next question  Ian OperatorAnd our next question is from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies  Michael Michael Yee    Jefferies   Company    AnalystGreat  Thanks for the question  I had a R D question for David  Of course  there is a lot of attention on AMG 510  You made a lot of great comments about how you quickly enrolled the study and we re going to get data later this year  One of the things I picked up on was your comments about first line lung  can you just maybe make a comment about how that advances or how that progresses or how you go about a first line strategy that s  obviously  a huge opportunity  So  maybe just comment about where that monotherapy study goes and where you can go with first line  Thank you David M  Reese    Executive Vice President  Research and DevelopmentYeah  Thanks  Michael  That is intended to provide a potential treatment option for patients who are not eligible for other first line lung therapies or unwilling to take such therapies  I think it will provide incredibly valuable clinical information on response to the drug in a previously untreated population  We ve just started enrolling that in the    so    over the course of the year as we generate data  we ll provide guidance as to when we may have some things to share OperatorAnd our next question is from the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler  Chris Christopher Raymond    Piper Sandler    AnalystHey  thanks for taking the question  Just on M A priorities  So Bob  I was kind of struck a couple of weeks ago in San Francisco  You guys talked about renal as maybe an area of interest in terms of building out the pipeline  And you re offering  and obviously  augmenting what is a pretty formidable business now  But I think the wording that I heard you say  Bob was that  any asset you bring in  would have to be game changing  So maybe two parts  can you talk about the reasoning for this sort of focus on renal or at least articulating that to us  And then what are you really looking for in terms of the game changing therapy  Thanks Robert A  Bradway    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So  Chris  just to remind you  we have six commercial franchise areas  of which nephrology is one  Obviously  that was our first  We ve been a leader in that area now for several decades  We have a number of important products for nephrologists today and we intend to continue to serve the needs of patients and physicians and providers  etc   in that community  We have not found in our own discovery research efforts that we ve been able to find the kinds of game changing innovation that we want to invest in from a discovery standpoint  So we re not investing in discovery research in nephrology right now  but we are going to look for business development opportunities there  And in general  our strategy when it comes to the business development  is to look for medicines that make a big difference for patients suffering from these diseases  So we ll look for innovation and large effect size  I don t know that I use the word game changer  But if I did  that s what I was intending to reflect the notion of large effect size innovative medicines So  to the extent  there are some in the industry or otherwise medicines  where again we think  because of the historical investment we ve had it  with this community patients that we can add real value  we ll look OperatorAnd our next question is from line of Brian Skorney from Robert W  Baird   Company  Brian Brian Skorney    Robert W  Baird   Co     AnalystHey  good afternoon  guys  Thanks for taking the question  One quick one    actually two quick ones on housekeeping  just it looks like compared to last quarter  you saw a 6  decline in Neulasta market share  Could you just breakout how much of that was Onpro loss  And can you also talk about how Onpro price has been impacted by the biosimilars have been able to maintain price so far or have you taken greater discounts to maintain that share  Thanks Robert A  Bradway    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Those are good questions for Murdo  Why don t you go ahead  Murdo Murdo Gordon    Executive Vice President  Global Commercial OperationsYeah  Thanks  Brian  The majority of the share decline is from the prefilled syringe  Onpro exited at a 55  share of long acting filgrastim and continues to hold up well in terms of share  We have had a contract out there that provides some discount to Onpro  but it s a more modest discount  then you would see on the prefilled syringe OperatorAnd our next question is from the line of Evan Seigerman from Credit Suisse  Evan Evan Seigerman    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  all  Thank you for taking my questions  One on biosimilars  so what are some gating factors to achieve  I think it s multi billion or you had at one point said greater than  3 billion in sales across the franchise  And if there were to be implementation of an international pricing index for most favored nation clause for Medicare Part B  how would this potentially impact your biosimilars business  Thank you  guys Robert A  Bradway    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI can take a stab at the first part of your question and Murdo  I invite you to jump in  But since we made those undertakings before you were part of the team  Murdo  the notion that we articulated was that we were going to advance the portfolio of up to 10 biosimilars that we expected that these could be an attractive growth opportunity for the Company and we re off to a good start  as you heard me say earlier  At the end of the fourth quarter  we were annualizing in excess of  1 billion  So  we re off to a good start  We re on time  We re on budget with these programs and the gating item is simply product approvals and product launches  So  we remain enthusiastic about our chance to earn a return from these products and it adds to the specifics of IPI  just to say in general  We  obviously  would be concerned we think quite a few other stakeholder groups would as well about the disruption that IPI would represent to the innovative biopharmaceutical industry  And we think there are better ways to evolve our system in a way that ensures patients have access to medicines at affordable prices But Murdo  feel free if you want to add anything specific about IPI in biosimilar landscape Murdo Gordon    Executive Vice President  Global Commercial OperationsNothing on IPI  Bob  I think you summarized it well  And on the biosimilars  the only thing I would say is  I m thankful to have inherited this portfolio and for the decisions that were made prior to my arrival  I think this is a strong business opportunity  It s been one  we ve been able to realize very good competitive share in Europe and we re off to a very good start in our early launch in the US  And I look forward to being able to launch more products OperatorAnd our next question is from the line of Kennen MacKay from RBC Capital Markets  Kennen Kennen MacKay    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystHey  Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on the end of the year in 2019  I totally agree it was transformative  Maybe for Murdo  I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the synergies you re seeing or expecting between selling of both Otezla and Enbrel  And whether there were any tailwinds there to year end formulary rebating or contracting negotiations we should think about in pricing or access in the year ahead Murdo Gordon    Executive Vice President  Global Commercial OperationsThanks for the question  Kennen  Yeah  We re excited about potential synergies between Otezla and Enbrel  and quite frankly  by extension our biosimilars business coming into the inflammation category  Too early to comment on specifics  but we continue to work through our contracting strategy  promotional strategy  even things as simple as possibly expanding into primary care promotion because we have a fairly large primary care footprint  And then  clearly  our international geographic expansion is augmented by having Otezla joining our portfolio with potential new markets where perhaps Otezla was slated to be launched by distributors when we have a full blown affiliate in some of those markets And then the last piece is  of course  synergies as we go into some of the new indication areas  So I m excited about building those out  Our teams are working hard to realize those synergies  and I feel optimistic that we ll be able to be more specific in upcoming quarters OperatorAnd our next question is from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI  Umer Umer Raffat    Evercore ISI    AnalystHi  Thanks so much for taking my question  I am just extraordinarily confused today on the guidance  but I ll limit my question two specific things perhaps  First  Peter on the OI E line  if you can bear with me for a second  you mentioned  1 2 billion to  1 4 billion  And I was trying to think it through and I thought to myself  30 billion debt at just above 3  rate  so that s  1 billion as an interest expense  minus about  100 million of the interest income  So that s  900 million  so when you guide to  1 2 billion to  1 4 billion  that s effectively implying  300 million to  500 million for BeiGene  But my understanding was you re only booking 20   and I m just trying to understand  is BeiGene s implied net income  1 5 billion to  2 5 billion  or am I thinking about that wrong  because that sounds so much higher than what BeiGene does  That s number one And secondly on revenues  I noticed    I know the business is being implied flat year over year outside Otezla  so I just want to understand better what the pushes and the pulls are there  And perhaps also  I think it mentions biosimilars doing  1 billion in 2020  annual 4Q  19 alone was north of  1 billion run rate  So just trying to understand all this  Thank you very much Robert A  Bradway    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Umer  Let s try and go through that  I think there were three questions there  So  Murdo  you want to take the first two on the revenue  just clarify what we said  and then Pete  you can help clarify the other interest and expense line item Murdo Gordon    Executive Vice President  Global Commercial OperationsSure  So  yes  we ve guided that our base business will be stable year over year  Obviously  there are a range of outcomes on that portfolio  and we continue to work hard across a number of opportunities to do as we ve done historically and that is to outperform  I would say that Otezla has come in and we have seen very good seamless integration of that team and that performance of that product and the growth trajectory continues without any interruption through the fourth quarter and we re seeing strong weeks early in the New Year On biosimilars  it s very early in the launch of those two products  where we are annualizing  as you pointed out  at over  1 billion based on fourth quarter and we expect to be able to continue to accelerate that business Peter Griffith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerUmer  Peter here  Thanks for your question  I would take you to the fact that our total debt at the interest rate I talked about in my remarks at 3 7  average maturity 12 years  by the way  I mentioned that too  That plus the 20 5  of BeiGene s results for 2020  the publicly available consensus estimates are what we re guiding to  So  when you work through those two  you should get pretty close to our  1 2 billion to  1 4 billion for 2020 OperatorAnd our next question is from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey  Robyn Robyn Karnauskas    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystHi  I don t want to beat a dead horse  but I guess  I m confused  too  just by this lack of growth  given that your slides have outlined  in your last    you ve lost like half Onpro s holding  you re growing like a bunch of different products  So  what is the one thing you think that is going to prevent you from growing more this year and not just having a stable business year over year  Like that s sort of what I m struggling with the most  Just help me understand that  because the way you describe  it looks like more growth of the top line  Thank you Robert A  Bradway    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSorry  Robyn  repeat the last piece of your question   Speech Overlap Robyn Karnauskas    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystSure  Just like    the way you re describing our your businesses in your slide performance basically is that  you re growing many parts of the business and the part that is declining is Neulasta  it seems to be potentially stabilizing with Onpro  So  what is preventing you from growing beyond what you re guiding  Is there one particular thing  I think most of us are sitting there saying  why can t you grow more than what you ve outlined given the picture that you painted of the business being actually quite strong Murdo Gordon    Executive Vice President  Global Commercial OperationsSo  I would agree with your last comment  the picture of the business does look quite strong  We re pleased with what we ve been able to achieve  particularly in the back half of last year  As I mentioned earlier  some of the Neulasta stability with Onpro has been at the expense of contracted terms  which lowered the net price of that total portfolio inclusive of Onpro  and we would expect with additional competitors against Neulasta in the biosimilar space that there will be further net price erosion in the long acting filgrastim category  And  of course  overall in our total portfolio worldwide  we would expect single digit net price declines for the year Now  that goes up against what I talked about throughout the call is  we have a number of really strong growth drivers in a young portfolio  very diverse products  and we have guided a wide range on revenue and it s my hope that the strong execution we saw in the back half of last year continues into this year and we can achieve a good growth profile  not just in Otezla but in the base business OperatorAnd our next question is from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs  Terence Terence Flynn    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHi  Thanks for taking the question  Omecamtiv is a product you guys haven t talked a lot about recently  obviously  some Phase 3 data coming later this year  Dave  you mentioned it in your remarks as well in terms of kind of the change in treatment landscape  But just curious if you could remind us of the puts and takes for the program  as we think about the probability of success here  And what would really get you guys excited that type of data  Thank you David M  Reese    Executive Vice President  Research and DevelopmentYeah  Sure  Terence  This is Dave  I m happy to address that  I mean  as I mentioned in my remarks  heart failure is a global epidemic  what makes us continue to have excitement in omecamtiv  it s a first in class mechanism of action  it s the only drug ever introduced that actually acts directly on the heart cell to improve contractility or the heart s pumping function  And we re conducting what ll will be a definitive 8 200 patient  give or take  trial in patients with advanced heart failure  It s a fairly sick population  where we re going to be looking for mortality benefit and a variety of other clinical outcome measures that improve  So  I think there is a large amount of residual unmet medical need and  obviously  where this fits in a train    changing treatment landscape will depend on the profile that emerges from that Phase 3 trial OperatorAnd our next question is from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein Research  Ronny Ronny Gal    Sanford C  Bernstein    AnalystGood afternoon and congratulations on the nice 2019  And got one housekeeping and one question  The quick one is  I was wondering if you could give us your comment on the Medicaid block grant that just was announced today  Does that has any relevance to you  And then generally  where do you expect it will impact the drug industry And second  David  I was wondering if you could give me your view on the Memorial Sloan Kettering paper suggesting the targeting the active GDP bound form of KRAS is better than trapping the GDP KRAS in the inactive form in terms of preventing tumors    tumor resistance to those agents Robert A  Bradway    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood  Well  let me    I ll knock off the Medicaid piece first  Ronny  For those who are on the call who aren t aware  CMS released some guidance earlier today  so we and others are still chewing through it  I think it ll have very limited impact at first read of it for us  But it s likely to be relevant for those states that didn t opt into the ACA in the first instance and we ll go through it  as well  I m sure others in our industry  more closely to see whether there are any specific issues for our business  But it didn t seem to me  Ronny  that that was going to be a concern for us in 2020 Dave  you want to tackle the Sloan reference  Speech Overlap  David M  Reese    Executive Vice President  Research and DevelopmentYeah  I m sure you don t want to address that one  Bob  So  for those who aren t familiar  Ronny is referring to a paper that came out within the last month or so that suggests that also targeting the GDP bound form of KRAS G12C would be required for signaling inhibition  We read the paper with interest  of course  I ll make a couple of observations  First  I would say our own data with AMG 510 suggests that at the appropriate doses and doses that we can achieve clinically  we can completely suppress signaling throughout a dosing interval  It is also my understanding or belief that the G12C inhibitor used in that paper may have been a little less potent  And one thing that we ve learned over 40 years in oncology is that  if you incompletely inhibit a target you very quickly breed resistance  So  I would say  I feel very confident based on the preclinical data that we ve generated with AMG 510  We re  of course  profiling tumors across our clinical program to try to generate signatures of response and resistance  This is the sort of thing that we ll look at  But I don t see anything in the literature as of yet that dissuades me from the approach we re currently taking OperatorAnd our next question is from the line of Mohit Bansal from Citi  Mohit Mohit Bansal    Citigroup    AnalystGreat  Thanks for taking my question  And a quick question on Otezla in mild to moderate psoriasis  it seems like you ll have data later this year  But given that net of tax rate is kind of a standard of care in that particular market and is a generic  what sort of challenge do you anticipate placing Otezla in that market and how do you think about navigating those challenges there  Thank you David M  Reese    Executive Vice President  Research and DevelopmentYeah  Well  let me start  Mohit  and then I ll ask Murdo to jump in  So  in mild to moderate psoriasis  there are currently no approved oral therapies  The only thing really available to patients right now is topical therapy  many of them will not ultimately experience disease control with those topical therapies  And so  we think there is a real opportunity for Otezla in that area  There are up to nearly 6 million patients with mild to moderate psoriasis in the United States alone  So that gives you a sense of the size of this opportunity and actually the prevalence of the disease  Murdo Murdo Gordon    Executive Vice President  Global Commercial OperationsYeah  And  Mohit  the only thing I would add is  yes  there is some methotrexate used there  but it s largely a topical business as Dave described and it s largely a patient population that gives very little relief  And this is really a patient population that is in the sweet spot for Otezla The other thing I have to say is that  our new colleagues when building out their positioning strategy for Otezla and their payor strategy have done a very  very nice job of positioning the access and reimbursement for Otezla as a post topical pre biologic option  So  I think for the mild to moderate population  if we re successful in securing that indication  that same payor strategy will be continued  So  I feel confident that we re in good shape there for another source of growth for Otezla going forward Robert A  Bradway    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo  Ian  I know we ve got several calls or several questions still queued up  so we ll try to get through those  Apologies that we re beyond the top of the hour here  but let s go onto the next question OperatorCertainly  Our next question is from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley  Matthew Matthew Harrison    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGood afternoon  Thanks for taking the question  I just wanted to follow up on a comment that Dave made earlier in the call  suggesting I think that maybe you re seeing some activity in HLE BiTEs in both solid tumors and liquid tumors  Maybe you could just characterize for us what data you have internally that gave you the confidence to make that statement  Thanks David M  Reese    Executive Vice President  Research and DevelopmentYeah  Thanks  Matt  And I assume that someone would pick up on that statement  So  what I would say is  I m not ready to declare victory in any indication yet  but we re seeing the sort of pharmacodynamic activity and early suggestions of anti tumor activity that are reminiscent of the early days of BLINCYTO and that give us encouragement that we re on the right track I d also point out that we undoubtedly have the largest experience in the world in development of bispecific T cell engagers  As I noted in my remarks  we ve learned an enormous amount about dosing and scheduling appropriate management of adverse events  and I think all of that is starting to come to bear right now  And we re starting to see some of these hints in that in the HLE or half life extended format  So  again  I m not ready to declare a victory  but we re seeing signs of encouragement and we ll be ready to share some of those data as the year goes on OperatorAnd our next question is from the line of Do Kim from BMO Capital Markets  Do Do Kim    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystGreat  Thanks for taking my question  Just one on Aimovig  you ve talked previously about expanding the primary care prescribing base  How would you go about doing that and could you do it with your current sales force Murdo Gordon    Executive Vice President  Global Commercial OperationsYes  Thanks  Do  We are doing it with our current sales force  I think I talked about the 33 000 prescribing base  And I think we re seeing some encouraging results  Right now in the CGRP class  you see about 7 000 new patients coming into the class  and into the category that are receiving a CGRP therapy and it s our goal to broaden that  Given that there are so many patients  who are persisting on oral therapies and older therapies that are just not as effective and in fact  we see very high drop off and very low persistency on these older oral meds like topiramate  And we are trying to change that care continue on that pathway in the way physicians treat chronic migraine sufferers  And I think we re having some success So the 7 000 patient per week number that we re seeing is one that we re looking to grow  And we are applying all the right efforts  both in our digital campaigns  as well as our personal selling teams in the primary care community right now  So yes  the answer is  we have all the resources required to do that OperatorAnd our next question is from the line of Yaron Werber from Cowen   Company  Yaron Yaron Werber    Cowen   Company    AnalystYeah  Great  Thanks so much  If you don t mind  Dave  just have a quick housekeeping and then a question for Murdo  On the housekeeping side  omecamtiv  can you just let us know  is there one more final DSMB look before you look at the event rate  And then for Murdo  just curious about Repatha  it looks like it s beginning to grow now  But now  what s your expectation given that 70  of patients now have access to the new price    the new formulation  Thank you David M  Reese    Executive Vice President  Research and DevelopmentYeah  Yaron  So I ll take the omecamtiv question  There is an    as we ve previously discussed  there is an interim analysis for efficacy that will occur  that has a very  very high bar  a very high bar in terms of the statistical stopping rule  So  our expectation is that  the trial will continue through to the primary analysis toward the end of the year Murdo Gordon    Executive Vice President  Global Commercial OperationsYes  And Yaron  on Repatha  just a reminder  a 100  of patients are accessing the low list price because we pulled the original list price off the market in December  And we ve been able to  throughout the course of 2019  open up the commercial access  where the majority of patients receive Repatha by their physicians prescribing it without the need for paperwork and utilization management criteria  so physician attestation only in commercial is the majority condition for how they can prescribe Repatha And then in the Medicare Part D space  obviously  that s a new event for us  because we were mid cycle when we lowered the price with the introduction of the low list price  So  it s really something we re excited about as an accelerating potential for Repatha  as was mentioned  roughly 70  of Medicare Part D lives now have access to Repatha at an affordable co pay  So  we re looking forward to seeing sustained growth going forward  Our teams are ready  and I was just with our sales forces in Dallas and everybody is pretty excited about being able to treat more patients quite frankly the way they should have been treated all along OperatorAnd our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink  Geoffrey Geoffrey Porges    SVB Leerink    AnalystThank you very much for taking the question  A quick housekeeping and then one for Murdo  First  could you just give us an update  Dave  on where the C5 biosimilar program is  Is that still active  And then for Murdo  I m impressed with the EVENITY number  you re annualizing it sort of  350 million already  which I think is better than most of us anticipated  Could you talk a little bit about the reception you re receiving and whether you really think this can become FORTEO s  obviously  losing its exclusivity  can it become a FORTEO like brand given what you re seeing already  Thanks David M  Reese    Executive Vice President  Research and DevelopmentYeah  Geoff  so I ll take the first part of that question relating to ABP 959 or Soliris biosimilar  the Phase 3 is actively enrolling and we ll provide guidance as we come to the conclusion of that trial when you can expect to see data Murdo Gordon    Executive Vice President  Global Commercial OperationsYeah  And Geoffrey  thanks for the question on of EVENITY  We are pleased with the launch trajectory on EVENITY  it s reflective really of two markets  Japan and US primarily  The Japanese launch has been nothing short of a resounding success out there with our partners  Astellas and UCB  I think physician reception has been excellent  We positioned the product for post fracture high risk patients  And I think that that s gone really well and it s where the risk benefit equation seems to be one that most physicians are accepting off  And we ve done the same thing in the US  our launch is a little younger in the US  but nonetheless the trajectory has exceeded our own expectations as well We just recently got our permanent J code in the US and that s opening up the prescriber base as well  So  I do think that we will have a very successful franchise on our hands and  of course  UCB will be commercializing with some help from us across Europe  thanks to the approval with the EMA there So overall  whether    will it be as big as a FORTEO  that remains to be seen  We are    I will remind you slightly less expensive 30  on the low end  as much as 70  on the high end than our competitors in the category  It s a 12 month duration  so it s not a product that you take for multiple years  it s a 12 month duration  but the new patient acquisition is clearly exciting OperatorAnd our next question is from the line of Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald  Alethia Alethia Young    Cantor Fitzgerald    AnalystHey  guys  Thanks for taking my question  I guess  Parsabiv is another drug that s been doing quite well in spite of Sensipar  So maybe can you talk about  should we expect continued kind of unit demand growth  I know you probably had some contracting  obviously  over the prior 12 months  But just maybe help us frame how to think about the next 12 months for Parsabiv  Thanks Murdo Gordon    Executive Vice President  Global Commercial OperationsYeah  Thanks  Alethia  The Parsabiv performance last year was fantastic  There are a number of patients who are benefiting from it  There is a change in reimbursement for Parsabiv going into    coming into 2020 that may slow the rate of growth a little  but the range of possible outcomes is broad and it s really too early to call Robert A  Bradway    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Ian  I think we ve got two more calls  Why don t we try to get them and then we ll wrap up OperatorVery well  Our next question is from the line of Salim Syed from Mizuho Securities  Salim Salim Syed    Mizuho Securities    AnalystYes  Hi  Thanks  guys  for taking the question  Just one for me on omecamtiv  David  you mentioned that the landscape will be changing  you believe  based on some of the recent data  And  I guess  what I was looking for some clarity on  when I presume you re talking about the SGLT2 space  specifically dapagliflozin  And then from the commentary you provide  are you envisioning this to be    omecamtiv to be on top of SGLT2s or competing at the head  And if there is any SGLT2 patients actually getting enrolled in the trial  Thank you David M  Reese    Executive Vice President  Research and DevelopmentYeah  Thanks  Salim  Yeah  So I was making reference to the SGLT2s  in particular  Our sense is that  the patients treated in those studies were probably a somewhat less sick population  So that may be a point of differentiation  And then as we have intended all along with omecamtiv  given the lack of drug drug interactions that we ve seen now in the mechanism of action  it is intended to be an add on to other therapies  Of course  in the Phase 3 trial  we will look at number of patients who are receiving things such as SGLT2s in the study Robert A  Bradway    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Let s get the last question OperatorAnd our final question is from the line of Cory Kasimov from J P  Morgan  Cory Gavin Scott    J P  Morgan    AnalystHi  this is Gavin on for Cory  Thanks for fitting us in  And I apologize if you answered this  but we are wondering what your assumptions are going into the double digit growth for Otezla  Does this imply label expansion or is this just with the existing label and or any comment on competitive concerns Robert A  Bradway    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd I think we ve addressed that  But why don t we just reiterate for you  Gavin  what we think is behind that Murdo Gordon    Executive Vice President  Global Commercial OperationsYeah  So we are assuming that we would secure additional indications in our assumption for double digit going forward  We re also using historical growth rate and where we re sourcing new patients right now  So I think that s pretty clear Robert A  Bradway    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  everyone  thanks for your patience  Sorry  we went a little bit past the allotted hour  But let me just conclude by saying that we feel good about where we ended in 2019  managing through what was always going to be a transition year for us  and we think we re on the cusp now of a period of new product revenue growth  So we look forward to that  And we look forward as well to the important clinical data that is expected  particularly toward the second half of this year So  I d be remiss if I didn t just take a moment to thank  as well the Amgen staff around the world  who continue to work so hard every day to deliver on our mission to serve patients  So  thank you to them  And we look forward to having a chance to talk to all of you in April after the first quarter  Thanks Arvind Sood    Vice President

several hours  Have a good day Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  77 minutesCall participants Arvind Sood    Vice President of Investor RelationsRobert A  Bradway    Chairman and Chief

drugs  namely Trulicity  Taltz  Jardiance  Basaglar  Emgality  and Verzenio  which compensated for lower sales of older products like Cialis and Forteo and the impact of Lartruvo s product withdrawal  Lilly suspended promotion of its advanced soft tissue sarcoma drug  Lartruvo due to the failure of the ANNOUNCE confirmatory study Lower realized prices had a negative impact of 1  on sales due to

products  Trulicity generated revenues of  1 21 billion  up 31  year over year driven by higher demand in the United States and higher volumes in ex U S  markets  which offset the impact of lower realized prices and changes in segment mix Cyramza revenues were  245 1 million  up 11  year over year driven by higher sales in both U S  and international markets Jardiance sales rose 39  to  268 0 million  driven by increased demand trends within the SGLT2 class of diabetes medicines in the United States and increased volume outside the United States  which offset the negative impact of currency Basaglar recorded revenues of  307 2 million  up 32  year over year  In the United States  sales rose 34   benefiting from higher demand and the impact of higher realized prices  Outside U S  sales growth of 28  was driven by increased volume Taltz brought in sales of  420 1 million  up 37  year over year as U S  sales gained from higher demand  which offset the impact of lower realized prices due to changes in estimates for rebates and discounts  Ex U S  sales were driven by increased volume from launches in new countries New rheumatoid arthritis drug  Olumiant generated sales of

 beating estimates on both counts  The stock was up more than 1  in pre market trading  In the past year  Lilly s stock has risen 19 6  compared with the  increase of 14    Going forward  Lilly s

148569,370085,AMGN,Amgen  AMGN  Q4 Earnings And Revenues Surpass Estimates,opinion,"Amgen  AMGN  came out with quarterly earnings of  3 64 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 44 per share  This compares to earnings of  3 42 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5 81   A quarter ago  it was expected that this world s largest biotech drugmaker would post earnings of  3 51 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 66  delivering a surprise of 4 27  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Amgen  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry  posted revenues of  6 20 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 18   This compares to year ago revenues of  6 23 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Amgen shares have lost about 5 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 3  
What s Next for Amgen 
While Amgen has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions

148600,370116,AMGN,Bristol Myers reports positive data on cancer treatment acquired in Celgene deal,news,"By Michael Erman and Carl O Donnell
 Reuters    Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY  Co on Saturday said that an experimental cancer therapy it acquired as part of its  74 billion deal for  Celgene Corp   NASDAQ CELG  produced positive results in a clinical trial 
The company said it will apply for U S  approval for the treatment for a type of advanced blood cancer by the end of the year 
The treatment  liso cel  is a newer type of immunotherapy known as CAR T cell therapy  that takes immune cells from a patient  engineers them to better recognize and attack cancer and infuses them back into the patient 
The study tested three dose levels of liso cel in the 269 patients with relapsed or refractory large B cell lymphoma 
Nearly three quarters of the patients responded to the one time treatment  with 53  experiencing a complete response  meaning no detectable sign of the cancer  according to data presented at American Society of Hematology Conference in Orlando 
The data marks a win for Bristol Myers after its purchase of Celgene met resistance from some investors who thought that it was overpaying for the cancer focused biotech 
It is also a positive sign for Celgene investors  who are entitled to received a contingent value right  or CVR  payment of  9 a share if three treatments in development  including liso cel  achieve timely approvals 
Celgene had forecast annual sales reaching  3 billion for the immunotherapy  If approved  it would lessen some of Bristol Myers  dependence on its immunotherapy Opdivo  which has faced stiff competition from Merck   Co s market leading rival drug Keytruda 
Liso cel would compete with already approved CAR T therapies Kymriah from Novartis AG s Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  Inc s Yescarta  Several other companies are also developing CAR T cell therapies 
Bristol Myers closed its deal for Celgene in November  after anti trust regulators approved it on the condition it divest Celgene s psoriasis drug Otezla   Amgen Inc   NASDAQ AMGN  agreed to purchase Otezla for  13 4 billion in August 
Bristol Myers managed to win investor approval for the deal despite resistance from investors Starboard Value LP and Wellington Management  who pushed other investors to vote against it ",2019-12-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/bristolmyers-reports-positive-data-on-cancer-treatment-acquired-in-celgene-deal-2036286,2036286

148604,370120,AMGN,Better Buy  Amgen vs  Gilead Sciences,news,"Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  has been struggling recently as the company s hepatitis C drug business is no longer performing as well as it used to  Last year  the pharma stock gained a meager 3 88  in part due to its declining hepatitis C Virus  HCV  drug sales 
By contrast  Amgen s  NASDAQ AMGN  stock gained a healthy 23 84  last year  despite some of the company s products    such as Neulasta  which treats a lack of white blood cells caused by chemotherapy    encountering stiff competition from biosimilars  Will Amgen continue to outperform Gilead Sciences moving forward  
Product lineup
Though Gilead Sciences  HCV revenue is declining  this segment still includes products such as Harvoni and Epclusa  which generate decent sales  However  Gilead Sciences makes the bulk of its revenue from its HIV lineup  In particular  the company s HIV prevention medicine Biktarvy has been performing well  Gilead Sciences HIV products also include Genvoya  Descovy  and Truvada  But the U S  government filed a lawsuit against Gilead Sciences last year alleging that Descovy and Truvada infringe on patents held by the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  DHHS   Not much has come of this lawsuit yet  

Amgen s top selling product is Enbrel  which treats several conditions  including rheumatoid arthritis  RA   The company also boasts several other drugs with growing sales  including Prolia  a medicine used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women  Lastly  Amgen can count on sales of Xgeva  which treats giant cell bone tumors  and its cancer medicine Kyprolis  
Financial results
During the third quarter  Gilead Sciences posted total revenue of  5 6 billion  which was flat compared to the same period the year prior  The company s HCV business posted revenue of  674 million  down from  902 million during the prior year quarter  Meanwhile  the company s HIV sales were  4 2 billion  a 13 5  year over year increase  Further  Gilead posted an operating loss of  1 5 billion as its expenses soared by 138  year over year  The company also posted a loss per share of  0 92  compared to its earnings per share  EPS  of  1 62 in the same quarter the year before  
Amgen s performance during the third quarter wasn t particularly stellar either  The company s revenue of  5 7 billion decreased by 3  year over year  mostly as a result of competition from biosimilars for  key products  such as Neulasta  However  the company recorded a generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP  operating income of  2 5 billion  up 7  year over year  and a GAAP EPS of  3 27  up 14  year over year  
Pipeline
Gilead Sciences boasts several potential medicines in its late stage pipeline  Most notably  the company s product Filgotinib is being evaluated for several conditions  including psoriatic arthritis  rheumatoid arthritis  and Crohn s disease  This product could become highly successful if it passes the appropriate clinical and regulatory hurdles  
Amgen recently completed its acquisition of psoriatic arthritis drug Otezla from Bristol Myers Squibb  This product will bolster the company s pipeline as it is being evaluated for several other conditions including a rare inflammatory disorder called Behcet s disease  Amgen s late stage pipeline includes other products such as Tezepelumab  a potential treatment for severe asthma  
Which is the better buy 
Investors looking for stocks that will provide strong revenue growth will have to look elsewhere  these two pharma giants are unlikely to deliver that  at least for now 
However  I think Amgen wins this matchup for three reasons  First  Amgen is more attractively valued when taking into account future earnings growth  Amgen s price to earnings growth  PEG  is 2 07  while Gilead Sciences  PEG ratio is 5 27  Second  Amgen is a better dividend stock  The company offers a dividend yield of 2 66  and a payout ratio of 43 55   With Amgen raising its quarterly dividends by 83 5  over the past five years  investors can expect more in the future  Gilead Sciences  juicy yield of 4  isn t backed by a conservative payout ratio  currently at 116  
Lastly  Amgen s recent acquisition of Otezla will help boost the company s sales  This is why Amgen is  in my view  the better buy at the moment ",2020-01-24,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmcqh,2066973

148606,370122,AMGN,Which Big Biotech Has the Safer Dividend    Amgen or Gilead Sciences ,news,"You can count the number of big biotechs that pay dividends without even using all of your fingers  Two of the best dividends belong to Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  and Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD   Amgen s dividend currently yields nearly 2 7   while Gilead s yield stands right at 4  
Neither company has had any problems whatsoever in the past funding its dividend program  But that doesn t mean the future won t hold any bumps in the road  Which of these big biotechs has a safer dividend  

What the numbers say
One of the most important metrics to look at when evaluating the health of a given company s dividend is the payout ratio  This number provides a quick assessment of what percentage of a company s earnings are being used to fund dividends 
Amgen s payout ratio of 43 6  indicates that the biotech should be able to easily keep its dividends flowing without breaking a sweat  On the other hand  Gilead s payout ratio of 116  appears to be more concerning  No company can pay out more in dividends than it makes in profits for very long 
But before we immediately give the safer dividend prize to Amgen  let s dive deeper into Gilead s financial position  The company reported a net loss of  1 17 billion in the third quarter and shelled out  2 4 billion in dividend payments during the period  This performance weighed heavily on Gilead s payout ratio 
There s more to the story  though  Gilead s Q3 loss resulted from the company s  3 92 billion upfront payment that was part of its expanded collaboration agreement with Galapagos  Before the paper loss in the third quarter  Gilead s payout ratio was around 52   Although that s a little higher than Amgen s number  it s still quite healthy 
Looking to the future
An even more critical factor to consider is how strong Amgen s and Gilead s cash flows are  A company with solid cash flow can fund a dividend program even if its earnings are low 
Amgen s operating cash flow over the last 12 months was  9 8 billion with a free cash flow of  6 4 billion  Gilead s operating cash flow during the same period was  8 9 billion with a free cash flow of  3 3 billion  While Amgen pays out a little more than Gilead does in dividends each quarter   2 6 billion  compared to  2 4 billion in Q3   its stronger cash flow appears to give it more flexibility in funding future dividends  
But cash flows can decline over time  Amgen faces significant competition for several of its top selling drugs  Sales continue to plunge for Neulasta and Sensipar  especially  Meanwhile  the worst days for Gilead s hepatitis C virus  HCV  franchise appear to be in the past  setting the stage for the company to deliver stronger cash flow going forward with its HIV drugs and a potential winner in immunology with filgotinib 
Still  though  Wall Street analysts project that Amgen will increase its earnings by an average of nearly 8  annually over the next five years  The biotech s newer products such as migraine drug Aimovig and immunology drug Otezla  which Amgen picked up with Bristol Myers Squibb s acquisition of Celgene  should fuel revenue and earnings growth  Analysts think Gilead will return to earnings growth over the next five years but will be able to increase earnings by less than 2  annually  
The safer dividend
My view is that both Amgen and Gilead Sciences are solid dividend stocks  I don t think either company will run into problems paying dividends  But if I had to pick only one of these stocks based solely on how safe its dividend is  I d have to go with Amgen because of its lower payout ratio and stronger cash flow 
I think the jury is still out on earnings growth  though  My hunch is that Gilead will beat analysts  earnings growth projections if it wins regulatory approvals for filgotinib and its HCV franchise sales stabilize more than they ve done so far  I also expect Gilead to continue offering a higher yield than Amgen does  even if Amgen dramatically increases its dividend  which I think is very likely  
But a higher dividend yield doesn t translate to a safer dividend  I believe Amgen still has the edge on that front ",2020-01-26,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmzqg,2067890
148613,370129,AMGN,Know These 3 Facts To Avoid Paying Half Your Retirement Income To The IRS   January 13  2020,opinion,"If you do not make a required minimum distribution  RMD  from your own or an inherited IRA by the specified deadline  the IRS could hit you with a big penalty   50   For example  if you were required to withdraw a minimum of  4 000 and you did not  you would be obliged to pay  2 000  Plus  beginning January 1  2020  the rules concerning RMDs were updated 
In case you re like most investors  you re probably trying to build a financial portfolio that is solid enough to guarantee a comfortable retirement  Among retirement financial planners  this is known as the  accumulation phase   In this stage  your objective is to carefully invest by selecting stocks with long term potential for your retirement nest egg  For example  you might choose Amgen  AMGN   which is a current top ranked dividend stock 
There is also a second phase of retirement planning that gets less focus   despite the fact that it s the more interesting part  It s the  distribution phase   which essentially means spending the wealth you ve worked hard to amass 
Planning for the distribution phase is the time where you may make decisions about where you ll want to live in retirement  whether you ll want to travel  hobbies you may pursue  and other decisions that will affect your retirement spending 
Along with those choices  you need to be mindful of the RMD  because it applies to the majority of retirement accounts  This IRS rule requires you to withdraw a specific minimum amount from any qualified accounts you have when you reach a certain age  previously it was 70 1 2  but beginning in 2020  it is 72 
Why does the IRS require these distributions  It s straightforward   they need to ensure they get their tax  In the event that this standard didn t exist  individuals could live off other pay and never pay tax on their retirement investment returns  So  that cash could be left to family or companions as an inheritance without the IRS getting any taxes from you 
The Most Important Things to Know About RMDs
What types of retirement accounts have RMDs  Qualified retirement accounts such as IRA accounts  401 k s  457 plans and other tax deferred retirement savings plans like a TSP  403 b   TSA  SEP  or SIMPLE IRA plan require withdrawals in retirement 
When do I need to begin withdrawals  For most accounts  you should take your first distribution by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you turn 72  If you retire after 72  you must withdraw your first RMD from your 401 k   profit sharing  403 b   or other defined contribution plan by April 1 of the year following the calendar year that you retire 
Every year after your start date  you are required to take your RMD by December 31  Remember  for Roth IRAs you do not have to take an RMD because you paid taxes before contributing  However  other types of Roth accounts do require RMDs  but you may be able to avoid them  for instance  by rolling your Roth 401 k  into your Roth IRA  
What happens if I don t take my RMD  The penalty for not taking a required minimum distribution  or not taking a large enough distribution  is a 50  tax on the amount not withdrawn in time 
How much money do I have to withdraw  To calculate a specific RMD  you must divide your prior year s December 31st retirement account balance by a  distribution period  factor based on your age 
Example  Ann is 71 and must take her first RMD in the year that she reaches age 72  Her year end IRA balance the prior year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  The result of dividing  100 000 by 27 4 is  3 649 63   the amount of the RMD that Ann must withdraw for the calendar year in which she turns 72

in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Amgen has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 54  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 53  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Amgen s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 14 32 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Medical sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 48  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Amgen has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 03  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Amgen stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Amgen has a P S ratio of about 6 22  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 56x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Amgen currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Amgen a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too  What About the Stock Overall Though Amgen might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of A  This gives AMGN a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been solid at best  The current quarter has seen eight estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen eight up and none down in the same time period  This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 5 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched higher by 1 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Amgen Inc  Price and Consensus   This somewhat bullish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term  Bottom LineAmgen is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 34  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  However  over the past two years  the Zacks Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first

148616,370132,AMGN,Amgen  AMGN  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Amgen  AMGN  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This world s largest biotech drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 48 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 8  
Revenues are expected to be  6 01 billion  down 3 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Amgen 
For Amgen  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 55  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Amgen will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Amgen would post earnings of  3 51 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 66  delivering a surprise of  4 27  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Amgen doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/amgen-amgn-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200501147,200501147

148644,370160,AMGN,U S  charges six investment bankers over insider trading scheme,news,"By Chris Prentice
NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  prosecutors said on Tuesday they had charged six members of an insider trading ring who worked for firms including  Goldman Sachs Group   N GS   Moelis and Centerview Partners and allegedly booked tens of millions of dollars in illicit profits 
The U S  Attorney s Office for the Southern  NYSE SO  District of New York has arrested three members of the international ring and unsealed four separate indictments in recent days 
The bankers and others all booked trading profits off nonpublic information related to deals including acquisitions  the prosecutors said in a statement 
They said Benjamin Taylor  formerly an employee of investment banking firm Moelis  and Darina Windsor  a former employee of boutique investment bank Centerview Partners  obtained and leaked nonpublic information about publicly traded companies to securities dealers 
The bankers shared in the profits from the trades beginning in at least January 2013  authorities said in an indictment unsealed on Monday 
That included profits from buying shares of biotech firm InterMune Inc ahead of a 2014 announcement of an  8 3 billion acquisition by Roche Holding AG  S ROG   profits from shares of Onyx Pharmaceuticals before news reports in June 2013 that it would be purchased by Amgen  O AMGN  for  10 4 billion  and profits off shares of Pharmacyclics ahead of an announcement it would be purchased by  AbbVie Inc   N ABBV  for  21 billion in 2015 
Windsor and Taylor  who were romantically involved   repeatedly accessed internal electronic files  of their employees  including files relating to business deals on which they were not involved  the authorities said 
A Moelis spokeswoman confirmed Taylor had been a  junior employee   A Centerview spokesman said Windsor  also a  junior employee   was terminated nearly four years ago for misconduct 
Securities trader Joseph El Khouri was arrested on Monday in the United Kingdom  He allegedly received leaked information from Windsor and Taylor  which he then passed along to journalists 
El Khouri and an unnamed trader built up long positions in companies targeted for acquisition  court documents said  El Khouri realized over  2 million in illicit gains trading securities of at least six different companies  according to the documents 
Bryan Cohen  a banker who worked for Goldman Sachs  was arrested on Friday 
Cohen shared inside information with a securities trader named Georgios Nikas  who is also an owner of a chain of Greek restaurants in New York  prosecutors said 
From December 2012 through 2017  Nikas and another trader obtained information from Taylor  Windsor and Cohen  prosecutors said 
They said Nikas also received information from Telemaque Lavidas  the son of a member of the board of directors at Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc  Lavidas was arrested on Friday 
The U S  Securities and Exchange Commission said in a separate statement on Tuesday it had obtained an order freezing Nikas s assets  The SEC had filed an emergency action charging Cohen and Nikas on Oct  18

148647,370163,AMGN,Biotech for hire PeptiDream charts new path and becomes short target,news,By Rocky Swift TOKYO  Reuters    The promise of PeptiDream Inc s drug discovery technology and its lucrative research for hire contracts have made it a darling of the Tokyo stock market  Now  those gains have made it a target for short seller Muddy Waters   The company  which has seen its market value jump fivefold to  6 billion over the past four years  is now pivoting its strategy to in house research  using its technology that allows it to create libraries of peptide chemicals that can bind drugs to cells   Muddy Waters Capital LLC says that the biotech company s new  and traditional  businesses are flawed and is betting its shares will fall back to earth as a result   Since its listing in 2013  PeptiDream has grown from a lab start up into a company with the highest profit margins in the Japanese pharmaceutical industry   without ever having brought a drug to market  Its technology has attracted a bevy of partners including Novartis AG  Merck   Co and Shionogi   Co    We re on the cusp of over the next 1 5 years of introducing a multitude of drugs into the clinic through our big pharma and strategic partnerships   PeptiDream President Patrick Reid told Reuters in an interview    We d rather get 5  of 100 drugs than get 100  of five drugs   he said  He estimates that around half of all drugs being worked on by PeptiDream partners are cancer drugs   PeptiDream s rocketing market value has been helped by its traditional fees for collaborating in R D and licensing deals to use its libraries  Its operating profit margin is 50   the highest of all 37 members in the Tokyo market s pharma index  where the average is 14    MUDDY WATERS DEALS DISPUTE However the shares of the Kawasaki based company fell 4 percent on the Nov  7 release of Muddy Water s report  which doubted the viability of many of its existing partnerships and said investors were  deluded as to its potential for commercializing drugs    There s real technology there  but it s the usefulness of the technology that we question   Muddy Waters founder Carson Block said in an interview with Reuters   It s cool  but so far it s been unable to yield anything that s meaningful   PeptiDream was now  massively overvalued   Block said  adding that  many of these partnerships that are the basis of this valuation seem inactive    PeptiDream s Reid declined to comment on the Muddy Waters report  referring to a company statement that  completely rejects  the short seller s assertions  The company says it has 19 discovery and development partners  predominantly big to mid pharma firms  Among its 101 programs in progress  compared with 60 in 2017  two are cancer related compounds being developed with Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY  now in phase 1 clinical studies  Twelve of PeptiDream s partners told Reuters their partnerships were active and ongoing  including pharma giants Bristol Myers  Merck  Novartis   Bayer AG   DE BAYGN  and  Amgen Inc   NASDAQ AMGN   Japan s Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corp declined to comment on the status of its relationship  The other six companies did not respond to multiple requests for comment   Block declined to name a price target for PeptiDream or the size of its short strategy  which pays off when a stock falls  PeptiDream s shares are trading about 5  lower than before the release of Block s report  PeptiDream is the second short play in Japan for Muddy Waters  which became famous for its bearish calls on Chinese companies  Muddy Waters announced a short bet on Nidec Corp in December 2016  Shares in the maker of precision motors have since risen more than 60    It s a bunt single  and that s better than a strikeout   Block said of PeptiDream s share fall  referring by bunt single to a baseball play that sees a batter eke out a small gain   Japan s potentially interesting  We might look to come back and hit some more bunt singles and see if we can build up a brand   PROTEIN HULA HOOPS PeptiDream s research partners do the heavy lifting in bringing drugs through clinical trials to market   allowing the company to avoid much of the large development costs and risks   Even so  as the company increasingly looks to keep some ownership of its research  it will still receive future milestone payments and royalties   On top of its research partnerships  it also has seven license agreements for its library or drug discovery platform  PeptiDream concentrates on  constrained peptides   particularly macrocyclic peptides   hula hoops of natural and non natural amino acids that can carry various cargoes to specific types of cells   such as cancer or inflamed tissue  Founded in 2006  the company sprang out of the research of University of Tokyo professor Hiroaki Suga  Suga looked to Reid  then an associate professor at the university  to help forge the connections to big pharma  As discoveries related to antibody and small molecule treatments dwindle  peptide based compounds are likely to become increasingly important as a class of drugs  said Bernstein analyst Shen He  who has an  outperform  on the stock    PeptiDream is one of the best technology platforms out there to solve this   He said   But it s not an overnight journey    Japan Pharma Stock Performance

Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  has agreed to buy Celgene s Otezla business  the company said in a statement  The Otezla sale was valued at  13 4 billion 
Bristol Myers Squibb announced in January it would buy Celgene Corp in a cash and stock deal for about  74 billion  combining two of the world s largest cancer drug businesses in the biggest pharmaceutical deal ever 
The proposed divestiture is the largest that the FTC or the U S  Department of Justice have ever required in a merger enforcement matter  the FTC said in its statement 
 The Commission has ordered BMS to divest Otezla to preserve BMS s incentive to continue developing its own oral product for treating moderate to severe psoriasis   FTC Chairman Joseph Simons said in a statement 
The five members of the FTC split along party lines on whether to approve the proposed merger  with the three Republicans in favor and two Democrats opposed 
Rebecca Slaughter  who voted to oppose the deal  argued that the FTC s approach of demanding divestitures only if the two companies sell treatments for the same ailment was  too narrow  
 The commission should more broadly consider whether any pharmaceutical merger is likely to exacerbate anticompetitive conduct by the merged firm or to hinder innovation   she said in a dissenting statement ",2019-11-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bristolmyers-squibb-wins-antitrust-approval-to-buy-celgene-but-must-divest-psoriasis-drug-2021921,2021921
148652,370168,AMGN,3 Investing Facts About Required Minimum Distributions You Need To Know   December 20  2019,opinion,"Failing to withdraw a required minimum distribution  RMD  from your own or an inherited IRA by the deadline results in a big tax code penalty  50   That s right  If you were supposed to take out a minimum of  4 000 and  oops   did not do so  you have the privilege of writing the IRS a check for  2 000 
Like many investors  you re likely aiming to build a comfortable nest egg to ensure a comfortable retirement  Among retirement financial planners  this is called the  accumulation phase   In this phase  your goal is to invest wisely by choosing stocks with long term potential for your retirement portfolio  such as Amgen  AMGN   a current top ranked dividend stock 
There is also a second phase of retirement planning that gets less focus   despite the fact that it s the more interesting part  It s the  distribution phase   which essentially means spending the wealth you ve worked hard to amass 
Making plans for the distribution stage involves deciding where you ll live in retirement  whether you ll travel  your proposed leisure activities  and more decisions that will affect your spending during your golden years 
Along with these aspects  it is important to consider the required minimum distribution  RMD  that applies to most retirement accounts  Essentially  the IRS requires you to withdraw a specific sum from your qualified retirement accounts once you hit age 72 
Why does the IRS requires you to start taking your money out  It s simple   they want to make sure they get their tax  If this rule didn t exist  people could live off other income and never pay tax on their retirement investment gains  Then  that money could be left to family or friends as an inheritance without the IRS collecting any taxes from you 
What You Need to Know About RMDs
Which types of retirement accounts have RMDs  Qualified retirement accounts like IRA accounts  401 k s  457 plans and other tax deferred retirement savings plans like a TSP  403 b   TSA  SEP  or SIMPLE IRA plan require withdrawals in retirement 
When do I have to start taking distributions  For most accounts  you must take your first distribution by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you reach age 72 
Every year after your start date  you are required to take your RMD by December 31  Remember  for Roth IRAs you do not have to take an RMD because you paid taxes before contributing  However  other types of Roth accounts do require RMDs  but you may be able to avoid them  for instance  by rolling your Roth 401 k  into your Roth IRA  
What happens if don t take my RMD  The penalty for not taking a required minimum distribution  or if the distribution is not large enough  is a 50  tax on the amount not withdrawn in time 
How much money do I have to withdraw  To calculate a specific RMD  you must divide your prior year s December 31st retirement account balance by a  distribution period  factor based on your age 
Here s an example to give you an idea of the amount  Ann is 70 and will take her first RMD in the year she turns 72  Her IRA balance at the end of the prior year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  Dividing  100 000 by 27 4 equals  3 649 63  This is how much Ann is required to withdraw for the calendar year in which she turns 72

148653,370169,AMGN,Amgen  AMGN  Upgraded To Buy  Here s What You Should Know,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Amgen  AMGN   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Amgen basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Amgen  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Amgen
This world s largest biotech drugmaker is expected to earn  14 60 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 1 4  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Amgen  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 9  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term 
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here    
The upgrade of Amgen to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2020-01-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/amgen-amgn-upgraded-to-buy-heres-what-you-should-know-200495803,200495803

monthsThe chart below shows that the   Bio Med    and the  have risen 11 9   10 3  and 8 5   respectively while the S P Zacks S P 500 composite has gone up 26 1    A strong third quarter earnings season  bullish outlook for the rest of 2019 and 2020 and a flurry of M A deal announcements this year were the primary reasons for the industry s strong performance  Demand driven growth in sales of new products  success of key pipeline candidates in clinical studies  product line extensions of blockbuster drugs in important therapeutic areas  successful innovation resulting in new drug approvals  and continued strong performance of key products are some other factors boosting this industry s growth There has been a flurry of M A deal announcements this year in the biotech drug industry  Apart from the two mega merger announcements of Bristol Myers Celgene and AbbVie Allergan  smaller biotech research firms  investigating new therapies or interesting pipeline candidates  garnered attention of bigger players this year  Oncology and gene therapy have mainly been the focus areas of M A activities Headwinds for the industry include government scrutiny of high drug prices  pricing and competitive pressure  slowdown in sales of some of the most high profile older drugs and most importantly major pipeline setbacks  Nonetheless  we believe that pipeline success  cost cutting measures  regulatory approvals for new drugs and line extension  product launches  ramped up M A and collaboration activities and appropriate utilization of cash should keep the sector afloat in 2020 Though it would be prudent to add a few stocks from this growing sector to your portfolio  you need to watch out for a few stocks  which  despite performing well this year  may lose momentum next year  In this

application   BLA   in January 2019  the CRL did not require any new study to be conducted  In December 2019  the company resubmitted the BLA to the FDA  Meanwhile  sacituzumab govitecan is being evaluated in several label expansion studies including earlier line settings for breast cancer as well as other cancer indications However  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank  4 and its estimates for 2020 have widened from a loss of  1 41 per share to  1 59 in the past 60 days  Rising competitive pressure in the breast cancer market is a concern  In September  sacituzumab govitecan showed a response rate in a bladder cancer study  which was lower than that of a competitor s candidate  The data was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in BarcelonaANI Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ANIP  ANI Pharmaceuticals  shares are up 42 1  this year so far  also outperforming the Bio Med industry  driven by decent sales and profits in a challenging U S  generics drug market   However  competitive pressure hit sales of some of its generic drugs in the third quarter  leading management to lower its 2019 sales and earnings outlook on expectations of

MRTX  Mirati Therapeutics  stock has risen 165 1  this year  outperforming the Bio Med industry  mainly on positive data on its KRAS G12C inhibitor  MRTX849  which showed that treatment with the

148776,370292,AMGN,Exclusive  Facing crackdown in Canada  drugmakers offered billions in price cuts,news,By Allison Martell and Anna Mehler Paperny TORONTO  Reuters    Canadian pharmaceutical industry lobby groups  in an effort to head off a planned crackdown on prescription drug prices  offered to give up C 8 6 billion   6 6 billion  in revenue over 10 years  freeze prices or reduce the cost of treating rare diseases  according to interviews and documents seen by Reuters  Those industry offers did not impress federal officials  coming last year as Canada prepared to expand the powers of a little known federal watchdog called the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board  PMPRB  to reduce the cost of prescription drugs  The government proposals would change the countries Canada compares its prices to  dropping the United States where they are highest  and set a formula to assess cost effectiveness of medicines  Announced in 2017  the new rules were scheduled to come into effect last month but have been delayed as the government reviews feedback  which has some wondering if they will ever be implemented   The delay is a setback for supporters of the changes  But documents detailing counter offers from lobby groups Innovative Medicines Canada and BIOTECanada show an industry struggling to win over federal officials  Unlike other countries with universal healthcare  Canada s government funded healthcare system does not cover prescription drugs  Most Canadians rely on an expensive patchwork of public and private insurance plans for that  Among industrialized nations  only the United States and Switzerland spend more on prescriptions per capita  Declan Hamill  a vice president at Innovative Medicines Canada  said the proposed regulations go too far and could hurt patient access to new drugs in Canada  But his group recognizes that the Canadian government wants to make drugs more affordable  he said    We d like to help the government out with that  and we ve been trying to have discussions with them   Hamill said   Lower prices in Canada could eventually hit drugmakers in the most lucrative U S  market  as Washington evaluates a proposal to base drug prices paid under the government s Medicare program on the cost of medicines in other developed nations  including Canada  Global drugmakers  including Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   Merck   Co   Amgen Inc   NASDAQ AMGN  and others  have argued against the Canadian proposal  They referred questions back to Innovative Medicines Canada   WOULD NOT ACHIEVE THE GOAL  With major drugmakers united in their condemnation of proposed regulations to rein in prices  Health Canada hired former Bank of Canada governor David Dodge and health economist  ke Blomqvist to assess the government proposal  Their review  completed in August 2018  broadly endorsed the government s plan  documents seen by Reuters showed  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s senior ministers will eventually decide how to proceed  PMPRB Executive Director Douglas Clark told Reuters the new regime could be running by early 2020   People have a tendency to presume that the sky is falling   Clark said   I think it s a little early for people to panic and lament the demise of this policy initiative    Health Canada said the industry s offers do not address drug price problems created by outdated rules   The non regulatory counter proposals that Innovative Medicines Canada and BIOTECanada jointly submitted to the government would not achieve the goal of ensuring appropriate consumer protection in these circumstances   the ministry said in an emailed statement  One offer was to  secure a price reduction target of C 8 6 billion  in net present value terms  according to a letter from officials seen by Reuters   Hamill said the C 8 6 billion figure was borrowed from a government estimate of how much the PMPRB reforms would reduce revenue and would have been spread over 10 years  He did not say exactly how it would have worked  Total patented medicine sales were C 16 8 billion   12 8 billion  in 2017  according to the PMPRB  Health Canada also rejected an offer to freeze prescription drug prices  saying it would not meet its objective of lowering prices  Health Canada said the industry had also committed to improving access for patients with rare diseases  but that proposal would not help those who have drug plans  Meanwhile  ahead of a fall election  Trudeau s government is preparing to announce a limited expansion of the nation s universal healthcare system to cover part of the cost of prescription medicines  as drug plans grapple with the extremely high cost of newer specialty drugs   WE DON T WANT TO SHUT THAT DOOR  The PMPRB caps prices of drugs still under patent protection  If new regulations are adopted  it would change the list of countries whose drug pricing it uses to decide whether costs are excessive  dropping the United States and adding countries with lower prices  The regulator would also consider for the first time a type of value based pricing  measuring how cost effective drugs are in terms of quality adjusted life years  and force drug companies to privately disclose some confidential discounts  It is not entirely clear how the PMPRB would use its new powers  In documents posted online  the agency said it could apply new rules to drugs already on the market  But Health Canada said the regime would not apply to those  Andrew Casey  president of BIOTECanada  would like  a more rigorous sit down  with the government   I fear the consequences when you do something without really working with industry   he said   We don t want to shut that door

148778,370294,AMGN,FDA chief tough on e cigs steps down in surprise resignation,news,By Yasmeen Abutaleb WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on Tuesday that he plans to step down next month  a sudden resignation that calls into question how the agency will handle issues such as surging e cigarette use among teens and efforts to increase competition in prescription drugs   Gottlieb was well regarded by public health advocates and won bipartisan support for his efforts to curb use of flavored e cigarettes by youths  speed approval times for cheap generic medicines to increase competition and bring down drug prices  and boost the use of cheaper versions of expensive biotech medicines called biosimilars  Unlike his predecessors  who said drug pricing was not the purview of the FDA  Gottlieb waded into the intensifying debate about the high cost of medicines for U S  consumers and had the agency actively looking into possible solutions    Scott s leadership inspired historic results from the FDA team  which delivered record approvals of both innovative treatments and affordable generic drugs  while advancing important policies to confront opioid addiction  tobacco and youth e cigarette use   Health and Human Services  HHS  Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement   Gottlieb  who said he wanted to spend more time with his wife and three young children in Connecticut  was nominated by President Donald Trump in part to aid in Trump s anti regulation agenda  But Gottlieb took an aggressive stance toward e cigarette makers  such as Juul Labs Inc  On Monday  he confronted 15 retailers including Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA   Kroger  NYSE KR  Co and Walmart  NYSE WMT  Inc  for illegally selling tobacco products to children  In early February  the FDA pursued enforcement actions against some Walgreen and Circle K locations   But Gottlieb ran into fierce opposition from anti regulation groups  such as Americans for Tax Reform  and former FDA officials  who said the agency s regulatory efforts would destroy thousands of jobs   A coalition of these groups wrote Trump last month asking him to  immediately halt the Food and Drug Administration s aggressive regulatory assault  on e cigarette businesses   Following news of Gottlieb s resignation  the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index turned negative  It closed down 0 5 percent as shares of  Amgen Inc   NASDAQ AMGN  erased gains and  Gilead Sciences Inc   NASDAQ GILD  shares fell further  Shares of  British American Tobacco   LON BATS  Plc rose after the news on Gottlieb  who had signaled his intention to also go after menthol and other flavored cigarette products   He made proposals that were unprecedented in their breadth  scope and  if they were adopted  likely impact   said Matthew Myers  president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids   But they were just proposals    E CIG  EPIDEMIC   Gottlieb s campaign against flavored e cigarettes followed preliminary federal data showing teenage use had surged by more than 75 percent since last year  which the FDA described as an  epidemic    Under Gottlieb  the FDA proposed a ban on the sale of fruit  and candy flavored electronic cigarettes in convenience stores and gas stations  The FDA also proposed stricter age verification requirements for online sales of e cigarettes    Scott has helped us to lower drug prices  get a record number of generic drugs approved and onto the market  and so many other things  He and his talents will be greatly missed   Trump said on Twitter on Tuesday  Trump picked Gottlieb to lead the agency in March 2017 and he was confirmed by the Senate in May of that year   The Washington Post first reported on Tuesday that Gottlieb planned to resign    There s perhaps nothing that could pull me away from this role other than the challenge of being apart from my family for these past two years   Gottlieb wrote in a note to FDA staff  In his resignation letter  Gottlieb touted several agency initiatives  including efforts to curb tobacco use  decrease the rate of opioid addiction  speed up approval of generic drugs and streamline the process to bring to market novel medical technologies  such as gene therapy  Gottlieb  46  a conservative and former physician  was deputy FDA commissioner under Republican President George W  Bush  Before taking over at FDA  he was a healthcare investor and consultant who sat on multiple company boards  He surprised critics who worried about his ties to the pharmaceutical industry by speaking out about rising drug prices and drug company tactics to keep competitors off the market   In all my years of public service  I ve never worked with a more talented  forthright  and effective agency leader than Dr  Scott Gottlieb   Republican Congressman Greg Walden said in a statement   He worked effectively with Congress to find solutions and to improve the quality of life for all of us   Gottlieb often touted that the agency had approved more than 1 000 generic drugs as evidence that it was helping to curb prescription drug prices  a priority of Trump s administration  Among those seen as possible successors  according to the Wall Street Journal  are Norman Sharpless  director of the National Cancer Institute  and Brett Giroir  assistant secretary at HHS  Giroir has been the senior adviser to Azar for HHS efforts to fight the opioid crisis  In January  Gottlieb said in a tweet that he did not plan to leave the agency after speculation that he was preparing to step down   We ve got a lot of important policy we ll advance this year   he wrote in the January tweet

Shares of Bristol Myers have rallied 8 5  so far this year  outperforming the  rise of 4 9  

 
We note that Opdivo is currently approved in several countries including the United States  the EU and Japan for several cancer indications 
The company continues to evaluate Opdivo alone or in combination therapies with Yervoy and other anti cancer agents  The drug generated sales of  5 4 billion in the first nine months of 2019  reflecting an increase of 10  year over year 
Label expansion of Opdivo into additional indications would lend the product access to a higher patient population and increase its commercial potential significantly  However  a key study failure like CheckMate 915 can hurt the growth prospects of Opdivo 
In a separate press release  Bristol Myers announced that it has closed the long impending acquisition of Celgene Corp    NASDAQ CELG   for a whopping  74 billion  Last week  the U S  Federal Trade Commission   FTC    to close the merger of Bristol Myers with Celgene after the latter agreed to divest its blockbuster psoriasis drug Otezla to Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN   in August 
As a result  Bristol Myers met all the regulatory requirements under the merger agreement to complete the buyout of Celgene and completed the transaction 
The acquisition is likely to boost Bristol Myers  oncology portfolio  given the stiff competition for Opdivo from the likes of Merck s   NYSE MRK   PD L1 inhibitor Keytruda 
We remind investors that in January 2019  Bristol Myers announced that it will acquire Celgene  Following several roadblocks  the acquisition was finally given a green signal in April  In July  the merger was granted unconditional approval by the European Commission

markets Amjevita  biosimilar of AbbVie s Humira  and Kanjinti since 2018 Amgen expects more biosimilars to gain approval this year and contribute to total revenues  especially as drug pricing issues

revenues declined 5  from the prior year quarter to  452 million on lower volume due to increased competitive pressure Revenues of the other ESA  Epogen  declined 15  to  215 million due to lower selling prices as the category has become extremely competitive Neulasta revenues declined 32  from the year ago period to  711 million due to lower selling prices and biosimilar competition Neupogen recorded 36  decline in sales to  54 million in the quarter due to unfavorable changes in accounting estimates and biosimilar competition in the United States  which hurt demand and prices Enbrel

remind investors that in July  Amgen and partner Novartis discontinued two pivotal late stage studies evaluating CNP520 to prevent or delay the symptoms of Alzheimer s disease in a high risk population Our TakeAmgen s third quarter results were strong as it beat estimates for both earnings and sales While Amgen s newer drugs   Prolia  Xgeva  Parsabiv  Blincyto  Kyprolis   will continue to drive sales  biosimilar and brand competition for its legacy products will continue to create pressure on sales  However  recently launched products including Aimovig and Evenity  biosimilars and

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4 27   A quarter ago  it was expected that this world s largest biotech drugmaker would post earnings of  3 58 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 97  delivering a surprise of 10 89  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Amgen  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry  posted revenues of  5 74 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 82   This compares to year ago revenues of  5 90 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Amgen shares have added about 5 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 21 3  
What s Next for Amgen 
While Amgen has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Amgen was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  3 37 on  5 81 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  14 35 on  22 84 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 43  Earnings rose 10  year over year as higher operating costs were partially offset by slightly higher revenues  a lower tax rate and reduction in shares outstanding due to buybacks Quarter in DetailRevenues of  5 48 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 56 billion  Sales however grew 3  year over year  backed by strong volume trends for its newer drugs  namely Trulicity  Taltz  Jardiance  Basaglar  Emgality  and Verzenio  which compensated for lower sales of older products like Cialis due to the loss of U S  exclusivity and the impact of Lartruvo s product withdrawal  Lilly has suspended promotion of its advanced soft tissue sarcoma drug  Lartruvo due to the failure of the ANNOUNCE confirmatory study Foreign exchange hurt

Outside U S  sales were also hurt by generic competition  lower realized prices and currency headwinds Among the new products  Trulicity generated revenues of  1 01 billion  up 24  year over year driven by higher demand in the United States and higher volumes in ex U S  markets  which offset the impact of lower realized prices and changes in segment mix Cyramza revenues were  240 0 million  up 21  year over year driven by higher sales in both U S  and international markets Jardiance sales surged 44  to  240 7 million  driven by increased demand trends within the SGLT2 class of diabetes

United States  sales rose 29   benefiting from higher demand and the impact of higher realized prices  Outside U S  sales growth of 39  was driven by increased volume Taltz brought in sales of  340 0 million  up 29  year over year as U S  sales gained from higher demand  which offset the impact of lower realized prices due to changes in estimates for rebates and discounts  Ex U S  sales were driven by increased volume from launches in new countries  In August  Taltz gained FDA approval for its third indication   active ankylosing spondylitis  which expanded the drug s eligible patient population New rheumatoid arthritis drug  Olumiant generated sales of  114 6 million in the quarter compared with  102 4 million in the previous quarter backed by increased demand in international markets  In the United States  Olumiant recorded sales of  12 1 million  higher than  10 7 million in the previous quarter New advanced breast cancer treatment medicine  Verzenio generated sales of  157 2 million in the quarter  up from  133 9 million in the previous quarter  This was because of increased demand and higher realized prices in the United States The newly launched CGRP antibody  Emgality generated revenues of  47 7 million in the quarter compared with  34 3 million in the previous quarter  In the United States  Emgality sales were  45 8 million compared with  33 8 million in

billion to  5 7 billion Our TakeJust like the second quarter  Lilly beat estimates for third quarter earnings but missed the same for sales  The stock was down more than 3  in pre market trading probably due to Lilly s lukewarm sales performance in the quarter and absence of an increase in sales guidance  In fact  so far this year  shares of Lilly have declined 5 1  against the  decrease of 0 3    Going forward  Lilly s revenue growth is expected to be driven by higher demand for its newer drugs including Trulicity  Jardiance  Taltz  Verzenio  Basaglar  Emgality as well as newly launched

rebates and legislated increases in Medicare Part D cost sharing  price cuts in some international markets  currency headwinds and the impact of the failed Lartruvo study are expected to put pressure on the top line Nonetheless  Lilly has made significant pipeline progress in the past year with several positive late stage data readouts  multiple approvals and regulatory submissions  Earlier this

148962,370478,AMGN,Biotech s Soon Shiong hiring bankers for Nant cancer drug IPO,news,"By Deena Beasley
LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Billionaire Patrick Soon Shiong plans to take an experimental cancer treatment company public this year and has begun hiring bankers  the biotechnology entrepreneur told Reuters 
The former surgeon said in a recent interview that the new company  to be called Nant  would use most of the money raised from the initial public offering to develop a pipeline of cancer drugs  although the amount of financing has yet to be determined 
Soon Shiong made billions by founding and selling an injectable drugmaker  followed by a company that developed a way to make a chemotherapy drug more effective 
Later  he founded Culver City  California based NantWorks  from which he has spun off two publicly traded companies   cancer testing company NantHealth Inc  O NH  and immunotherapy developer  NantKwest  Inc  N NK  
Shares of both have fallen sharply and losses have mounted amid questions over whether funds from his charitable foundation have been used to drive sales  Soon Shiong called allegations of donations being tied to sales of a cancer diagnostic test  completely untrue  
Earlier this year  he agreed to buy the Los Angeles Times and other California newspapers for  500 million  but the deal has not yet closed 
 Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  has been hired to work on the Nant IPO  and Soon Shiong said he was in talks with two other investment banks  Credit Suisse declined comment 
Nant s portfolio includes six compounds in clinical trials against nine tumor types  The pipeline includes versions of existing chemotherapy drugs designed to make tumors more recognizable to the immune system  methods of delivering cancer fighting cells to tumors  and immunotherapies 
Soon Shiong believes a multi drug regimen could help cancer patients achieve long term remission 
 Everybody is focusing on one little piece of the puzzle   he said   But the tumor is too smart  It has too many fail safes  We need to attack the entire tumor system  
At least two of Nant s drugs are in late stage trials  Ganitumab  an antibody licensed from  Amgen Inc   O AMGN   blocks a receptor linked to cell growth and is being tested in combination with chemotherapy for advanced sarcoma patients 
Another compound  N 803  targets a protein involved in activating immune system cells and is in late stage development for bladder cancer 
NANTHEALTH AND NANTKWEST
Shares of NantHealth have fallen to  3 41 from their IPO price of  14 in 2015  The company reported a first quarter loss of around  22 million 
NantKwest trades at  3 66  down from  25 when it debuted in 2016  and reported a quarterly net loss near  27 million 
Jefferies analyst Biren Amin rates shares of NantKwest as  hold   Citi Research has a  sell  rating on NantKwest and estimates the company has enough cash for two years of operations  Soon Shiong said NantKwest was exploring  strategic partnerships  to fund clinical trials  He owns controlling stakes and holds the chief executive office of both companies  and will be a majority shareholder in Nant 
Health news website STAT reported last year that Soon Shiong and his charitable foundations in 2014 gave the University of Utah  12 million for disease research  and the university later paid NantHealth  10 million for testing services 
Utah s legislature determined that the university should have sought competitive bids for the testing  but said the donation was not tied to the purchase 
Soon Shiong said of the Utah case   That was a donation our foundation made to the University of Utah  They had an opportunity to go to any vendor  and they came to us  ",2018-06-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/biotechs-soonshiong-hiring-bankers-for-nant-cancer-drug-ipo-1487673,1487673

148964,370480,AMGN,Drugmakers try evasion  tougher negotiations to fight new U S  insurer tactic,news,"By Michael Erman and Caroline Humer NEW YORK  Reuters    In the escalating battle over U S  prescription drug prices  major pharmaceutical companies are scrambling to limit the economic damage from a new U S  insurer tactic that coaxes patients away from expensive drugs   The latest move by insurers   which effectively forces drug companies to pay more to assist patients with their copays   is causing a decline in real U S  drug prices this year  and is expected to become more widely adopted in 2019   That reality is forcing drugmakers to devise their own response in the near term  according to interviews with pharmaceutical and insurance industry executives and consultants  Among major drugmakers   AbbVie Inc   NYSE ABBV  and  Amgen Inc   NASDAQ AMGN  have said the most so far about the new tactic  and more drugmakers will likely face questions about it during quarterly earnings calls in July  In recent years  insurers have tried to guide patients toward less expensive treatments by making them pay a higher portion of a drug s costs  Drugmakers responded by dramatically raising the financial aid they offer  in the form of  copay assistance  cards   similar to a debit card   that reduce what consumers need to pay when they place their pharmacy order  Express Scripts Holding Co and CVS Health  NYSE CVS   which manage prescription drug coverage for large U S  employers  say these payments shield consumers from drug costs  making it easier for manufacturers to raise those prices  Insurers have to make up the difference  This year  Express Scripts and others introduced a new  copay accumulator  approach for its corporate customers  The programs prevent copay card funds from counting toward a patient s required out of pocket spending before insurance kicks in on expensive specialty drugs  such as arthritis and HIV treatments   As an example  a patient whose medicine costs  1 000 per month might be required to pay that amount until they reach a deductible of  2 000 set by their insurer  A copay card from the drugmaker would cover most  or all  of those costs for the patient and it would count towards the deductible   When the deductible is reached  the insurance begins to pay  But if the insurance plan is using an accumulator  the patient could still have to pay the  2 000 out of pocket when their copay card expires or runs out of money  Some more aggressive accumulator programs will also draw more money than a drugmaker expected to pay off a copay card when the card is detected    These tactics could force the drugmaker to keep paying the out of pocket costs  Otherwise the patient could move to an equivalent drug if one is available or abandon their prescription because it is too expensive  PHARMA FIGHTS BACK Drugmakers are working on ways to counter copay accumulator programs  fearing that more employer health plans will adopt them in 2019    They include new payment options to evade detection by the pharmacy benefits managers  PBMs  so that a patient still benefits from the financial aid  said Matthew Turner  who is working with drugmakers as director of patient affordability at TrialCard  which operates copay cards for companies  He would not provide details of how those arrangements work  Larger drugmakers may have the financial flexibility to monitor how these accumulator programs affect revenue over time  while those reliant on a small number of drugs may not be able to wait it out  Turner said   Drugmakers are also taking a tougher stance when negotiating prices or new discounts for payers  according to insurance industry executives and pharmaceutical consultants   They have reason for concern  A survey by the National Business Group on Health  NBGH   which represents large corporate employers  showed that 17 percent of respondents said they were currently using a copay accumulator program  Another 18 percent of respondents are considering using one next year or in 2020   Real U S  drug prices  including discounts and rebates  fell 5 6 percent in the first quarter of this year  mostly due to copay accumulator programs  according to Sector and Sovereign Research  Amgen has said that it altered copay assistance cards for arthritis drug Enbrel to work only if the funds are applied to a patient s deductible  The company would not say how it responds when a patient is affected by an accumulator  adding the information was proprietary  AbbVie in April said that about 4 percent of patients taking rival arthritis drug Humira were exposed to accumulators  but that they had no material effect on company profits   Belgium s UCB  which makes a competing drug called Cimzia  said in February that it was reaching out to patients affected by the programs to help them stay on the medication  Savings can be substantial for employers when accumulators coax patients to switch to a drug for which they receive the highest rebate  For instance  rebates to PBMs for Humira and Enbrel can differ by as much as  1 000 per prescription  according to Michael Rea  CEO of Rx Savings Solutions  At CVS Health  accumulator programs help reduce specialty drug spending by about 5 percent for its customers  health plans  spokeswoman Christine Cramer said  Express Scripts and UnitedHealth Group Inc  NYSE UNH   told Reuters they expect the programs to expand   UnitedHealth tracks copay assistance payments at its mail order specialty pharmacy BriovaRx and wants to introduce them to other specialty pharmacies it works with  Chief Medical Officer Dr  Sam Ho said   UnitedHealth calls patients to tell them their copay cards will no longer count towards deductibles  and suggests switching to a less pricey drug  if available  or provides information on charity assistance  he said   When asked how drugmakers have responded to UnitedHealth s program  Dr  Ho said the manufacturers are taking a tough stance in new price negotiations  Kevin Cast  a partner at pharmaceutical consulting firm Archbow Consulting  said drugmakers may be better off providing greater discounts to the PBMs in exchange for ending the copay accumulator  Concocting an alternative payment method is only a temporary fix  he said  
 As soon as a copay card company makes a slight adjustment  they ll figure it out   he said ",2018-07-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/drugmakers-try-evasion-tougher-negotiations-to-fight-new-us-insurer-tactic-1518584,1518584

Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for AMGN  These revisions typically reflect the latest short term business trends  which can change frequently  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability

148994,370510,AMGN,Should Value Investors Buy Amgen  AMGN  Stock ,opinion,"Here at Zacks  our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system  which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks  Nevertheless  we are always paying attention to the latest value  growth  and momentum trends to underscore strong picks 
Looking at the history of these trends  perhaps none is more beloved than value investing  This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market  Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large 
On top of the Zacks Rank  investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will want to focus on the  Value  category  Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and  A  grades for Value will be some of the highest quality value stocks on the market today 
One company value investors might notice is Amgen  AMGN   AMGN is currently holding a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and a Value grade of A 
We also note that AMGN holds a PEG ratio of 2 40  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  AMGN s industry has an average PEG of 3 62 right now  AMGN s PEG has been as high as 2 43 and as low as 1 76  with a median of 2 12  all within the past year 
Value investors also use the P S ratio  The P S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales  Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  This means it could be a truer performance indicator  AMGN has a P S ratio of 4 93  This compares to its industry s average P S of 12 48 
Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics  but the above data helps show that Amgen is likely undervalued currently  And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook  AMGN sticks out at as one of the market s strongest value stocks ",2019-09-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-buy-amgen-amgn-stock-200469626,200469626
148996,370512,AMGN,OSE Immunotherapeutics  R D Progress Triggers Milestone Payment Windfall,opinion,"OSE Immunotherapeutics  PA OSE  now has four clinical trials running  Interim results from its Phase III Atalante 1 trial with cancer vaccine Tedopi are a key catalyst and due in Q120  Another three trials were initiated over the last 12 months  which brought OSE a total of  27m in payments from partners  plus another  5 4m from Bpifrance   These trials include a Phase I study with OSE 127  partnered with Servier   a Phase I study with BI 765063  previously OSE 172  with Boehringer Ingelheim  BI  and a Phase II study with Tedopi in pancreatic cancer  GERCOR   We raise our valuation of OSE to  198m or  13 2 share  previously  190m  




Phase III Atalante 1 interim results in Q120
Although OSE has a broad and diversified R D pipeline  much of the focus until early 2020  Q120  will be on the Phase III Atalante 1 trial with a peptide cancer vaccine Tedopi for second  and third line treatment of non small cell lung cancer patients  NSCLC   OSE hosted a Tedopi focused KOL event in New York in May 2019  where the presenters provided a detailed overview of the cancer vaccine s development and of target indications NSCLC and pancreatic cancer 
Self sufficient R D
In addition to Phase III Atalante 1  funded by OSE   Tedopi is being tested in a Phase II trial in pancreatic cancer patients  which is run by OSE s partner GERCOR  a physician network   Another two trials were initiated earlier this year and both are financed by partners  These include a Phase I study with BI 765063  OSE 172   a SIRP  antagonist for solid tumours  which is run by OSE but funded by BI  which paid  15m in milestones on initiation of the trial  According to the terms of the licensing deal with BI  OSE is still eligible to receive up to  1 1bn in milestones plus royalties if certain conditions are met  Similarly  OSE initiated a Phase I trial with its OSE 127 IL 7R   CD127  antagonist for autoimmune diseases  which triggered a  12m payment  Servier exercised an option  total value of the deal  272m  of which  22m has been received  
Valuation   198m or  13 2 share
We have raised our valuation of OSE to  198m or  13 2 share from  190m or  12 8 share previously  which is due to a better cash position  rolling our model forward and increasing the probability of success to 10  for BI 765063  OSE 172  as the Phase I trial has been initiated  The milestone payments from Servier and BI had virtually no effect as we have already included them in our model  The interim results from the Phase III Atalante 1 trials are the main catalyst in the near term

Tedopi KOL event  interim Atalante 1 trial data in Q120
On 30 May 2019  OSE hosted a KOL day in New York  which focused on Tedopi  NSCLC and pancreatic cancer  The presentations provided more detailed background on the development of Tedopi and an overview of the target cancer indications  Overall  we view the update as in line with our discussions in our initiation report  Although OSE has a well balanced R D pipeline in terms of asset stages and technology types  the focus on Tedopi will prevail due to a combination of factors  It is the most advanced OSE asset in development and interim analysis will be carried out in Q120  which will also include some efficacy data  this makes it a substantial catalyst for OSE 
Atalante 1 is a Phase III trial with Tedopi as second  or third line treatment against standard of care  docetaxel or pemetrexed  in HLA A2 positive patients with locally advanced  IIIB   unsuitable for radiotherapy or metastatic  IV  NSCLC  Post checkpoint failure patients represent an area where no novel treatment has been approved yet  The trial aims to enrol 300 patients  Interim analysis is expected in Q120  which will include survival data from the first 84 patients  This is a significant catalyst for OSE  although the final results should come later in 2021  OSE presented case reports from three patients from the Atalante 1 trial at AACR in Atlanta on 31 March 2019  which we discussed in our last update report 
At the end of 2018  OSE s partner GERCOR  a physician network  initiated a Phase II trial with Tedopi as maintenance therapy alone or in combination with Opdivo or FOLFIRI in pancreatic cancer after induction therapy with FOLFIRINOX  Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY  is supporting the trial by providing Opdivo for free  Results are expected in 2022  Pancreatic cancer represents an unmet need with relatively little advance in treatment compared to most other cancers over the last decade  Pancreatic cancer is a  cold  tumour  so the rationale is to combine immune priming cancer vaccine Tedopi  stimulates specific T cell response  with checkpoint inhibitors  makes tumours  visible  to the immune system   OSE will evaluate options for further development and commercialisation depending on the results of this study 
Exhibit 1  OSE s pipeline




BI 765063  First patient enrolled in Ph I  milestone paid
OSE announced on 17 June 2019 that the first patient had been dosed in the Phase I study with BI 765063  OSE 172   a monoclonal antibody antagonist of SIRP   that OSE licensed to BI  This triggered the second part of the  15m milestone payment from BI as expected  we only adjusted the milestone with 95  probability in our model   OSE is still eligible to receive up to a further  1 1bn in milestones plus royalties if certain milestones are met 
The full clinical trial design is now available  Exhibit 2   It is an open label  dose finding Phase I study of BI 765063  OSE 172  as single agent and in combination with BI 754091  anti PD 1  to characterise safety  PK PD and preliminary efficacy in patients with advanced solid tumours  OSE is responsible for running the trial but BI bears the costs  according to the collaboration and licensing agreement  BI will take over the development after Phase I 
In total 116 patients with advanced metastatic tumours are expected to be enrolled  The study includes two steps and four cohorts  essentially two dose escalation cohorts and two expansion cohorts  BI 765063 standalone and BI 765063 in combination with BI s own anti PD 1   The dose escalation cohorts are enrolling patients with advanced metastatic primary or recurrent malignancies who failed or are not eligible to standard therapy  Then the expansion cohorts will be restricted to selected cancers  see Exhibit 2 notes for the list  




Combining BI 765063 with a PD 1 inhibitor is based on the complementary mechanisms of action of the two agents  That is  CD47 SIRP  inhibition should lead to phagocytosis of tumour cells by myeloid cells  this leads to tumour antigen uptake and presentation  which should activate the adaptive immune system  namely  T cells killing tumour cells  which in turn is facilitated by PD 1 PD L1 inhibition  OSE recently published an article describing the role of SIRP  in the induction and maintenance of immune tolerance and a poster presentation supporting the combination of a SIRP  monoclonal antibody and checkpoint inhibitor  anti PD L1 not anti PD 1 as in the Phase I study   These pre clinical studies add support to OSE s strategy  As with many Phase I cancer trials  the indications are quite broad at the moment but will focus on the most promising cancers in further trials 
BiCKI bispecific platform  PD 1   innovative targets
OSE presented its new BiCKI platform at the World Immunotherapy Congress in San Diego on 5 March 2019  This included some information about the bispecific fusion antibody platform and included a lot of information on the first potential bispecific candidate  BiCKI IL 7  While we do not include any new assets in our valuation  we conducted a more detailed review of the platform and the opportunities 
Bispecifics and other types of antibodies can bind multiple targets  BiCKI is a bispecific fusion antibody platform  Exhibit 3  that consists of 
A humanised high affinity anti PD 1 monoclonal antibody  blue Y in Exhibit 3   OSE has developed its own anti PD 1 antibody that forms the  backbone  of the bispecifics  So far there is limited information about this anti PD 1 but OSE indicated it was chosen due to its good yield in terms of manufacturing and productivity  in particular in bispecific format  This is an IgG antibody in that it has a normal structure with heavy and light chains  where the Fab region binds to the PD 1 receptor on T cells 
Engineered proteins attached to the Fc region  green circles in Exhibit 3   The silent Fc region of the antibody  base of the heavy chains  is the effector part of the molecule  It determines what effect the antibody has once it has bound to the antigen   usually an immune response  OSE plans to engineer different proteins to the Fc region  eg IL 7  through protein fusion to target novel receptors 




Exhibit 3  BiCKI platform  left  and BiCKI IL 7 mechanism of action on T cells  right 
OSE hopes these anti PD 1 bispecifics will help overcome the resistance  primary and secondary  depending on the second target  to anti PD 1 drugs by selecting targets that are involved in different stages of the immunity cycle and so are complementary  In particular  OSE is looking for targets that would have synergistic potential 
OSE s first candidate based on this platform is BiCKI IL 7  Exhibit 3   OSE is already working with the IL 7 receptor  IL 7R  from the OSE 703 and OSE 127 programmes  so has experience in this area with a cytotoxic agonist asset  OSE suggested a few mechanisms of action for BiCKI IL 7 during the BiCKI presentation in March 2019  but perhaps the most important is that IL 7R sustains the life of exhausted T cells  IL 7 is a cytokine that controls the proliferation  apoptosis and activation of CD4  and CD8  T cells in humans  IL 7R  expression is reduced in exhausted T cells  Activating the IL 7R  receptor with IL 7 should reduce T cell exhaustion  The main advantage of the bispecific drug  over a combination of two drugs  anti PD 1 with IL 7  is that BiCKI IL 7 synergistically increases TCR signalling and hence antigen specific T cells responses 
OSE presented the first preclinical data with its BiCKI IL 7 technology at the International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference  CICON  25 28 September  2019  in Paris  The company showed that the bifunctional anti PD1 IL 7 fusion protein potentiates effector function of exhausted T cells and disarms the suppressive activity of regulatory T cells 
Large biotech pharma are getting in early on bispecifics
Many players are trying to tackle the resistance to checkpoint inhibitors issue through developing combination therapies and bispecifics to solve the same problem  Some existing projects in the anti PD 1 bispecifics space are listed in Exhibit 4  The most advanced candidates are in Phase I  There are a few companies trying to use bispecifics to target multiple checkpoints  eg XmAb20717 targets both PD 1 and CTLA 4  with the aim of further reducing any T cell inhibition by tumour cells and promoting T cell activation 




The bispecifics field has recently become a popular area  There are three bispecific antibodies  they do not target checkpoint receptors  that have been approved   Blincyto  blinatumomab  Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN    Hemlibra  emicizumab  Roche  and Removab  catumaxomab  Fresenius now withdrawn   but there are many more in clinical stages  57 individual bispecifics according to EvaluatePharma   They are being developed for both oncology and immunology indications 




Most of the programmes are still very early stage therefore the existing deals are for bispecific platforms and pre clinical programmes  There have been several large deals  Exhibit 5   which is promising for OSE  Most of the pre clinical deals in Exhibit 5 include a collaboration based on the licensor s bispecific platform plus rights for their existing pre clinical bispecific programmes  These deals achieved between  45 150m in upfront payments and  180 1 700m in milestone payments  for platform plus existing programmes   depending on the number of candidates included in the deal  As there is an appetite for bispecifics platforms and bispecific candidates from pharma  OSE s decision to invest in BiCKI seems well founded 
Financials
OSE reported a top line of  16 0m in H119  which was mostly a milestone from BI  the rest is R D cost reimbursement to OSE   The milestone payment of  10m from Servier was booked as prepaid income  cash balanced with deferred income plus  2m in VAT received as OSE and Servier are both French companies   Total H119 operating expenses were  12 1m  of which R D costs and overhead expenses amounted to  9 2m and  2 9m respectively  resulting in an operating profit of  3 9m  R D costs are mainly associated with the Tedopi Phase III NSCLC study  Our full 2019 and 2020 estimated operating expenses were  19 6m and  19 7m  which we now revise to  22 7m and  22 8m 
As of end H119  OSE had cash  cash equivalents and financial assets of  26 5m  includes  current financial assets    The balance sheet also includes debt of  5 1m  which is mainly government loans  In September 2019  OSE announced it had received a  5 4m milestone payment from Bpifrance  the French public investment bank  in connection to the initiation of the Phase I trial with BI 765063   4 8m as a loan and  0 6m as income  as well  As part of a research consortium with the L on B rard cancer research centre  OSE also received a grant of  800k from the French National Research Agency  which will support preclinical research focused on validation of new targets linked to myeloid cells  Our model implies a comfortable cash reach to around end of 2020 
Valuation
We have raised our valuation of OSE to  198m or  13 2 share from  190m or  12 8 share previously  The increase is due to a better cash position and rolling our model forward  but is also a result of increased probability of success to a standard 10  for BI 765063  OSE 172  as the Phase I trial has now been initiated  previously we used a slightly discounted probability of 7 5    The milestone payment from Servier and BI had no effect as we have already included them in our model  now moved from respective projects to cash in Exhibit 6   We make no other changes to our assumptions  described in detail in our initiation report 




We include Tedopi NSCLC  FR104  OSE 127 and OSE 172 in our valuation  Although GERCOR has initiated the Phase II study with Tedopi in pancreatic cancer  we still do not include this indication in the valuation because its commercial strategy has not been confirmed   OSE will evaluate this based on the Phase II results  We do not include the new bispecific platform in the valuation because it is still in a pre clinical stage ",2019-10-01,Edison,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ose-immunotherapeutics-rd-progress-triggers-milestone-payment-windfall-200469407,200469407
148998,370514,AMGN,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Amgen  AMGN ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Amgen  AMGN   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry 
This world s largest biotech drugmaker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 7 04  
For the last reported quarter  Amgen came out with earnings of  3 97 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 58 per share  representing a surprise of 10 89   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  3 45 per share and it actually produced earnings of  3 56 per share  delivering a surprise of 3 19  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Amgen  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Amgen currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 31   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-amgen-amgn-200469969,200469969

149024,370540,AMGN,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Amgen  Tokyo Electron And Kinross Gold,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 17  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN    Tokyo Electron   OTC TOELY   and Kinross Gold   NYSE KGC   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  Why Cut the Fed Funds Rate Again  Global Week Ahead This is a Fed meeting week  On Wednesday  Fed Chair Powell is widely anticipated to cut the Fed Funds rate another 25 basis points With a U S  consensus forecast for a tad above 2 0  U S  real GDP growth rate  a core U S  CPI tracking near  2 0  in y y terms  and a U S  3 7  household unemployment rate  the Fed s statutory mandate of stable consumer prices and full employment is clearly and succinctly met For this economist  it is hard to say what is the real justification It could be to keep policy and risk free benchmark U S  Treasury rates in alignment with the ECB s easing last week  It could be to alleviate trade war uncertainty  It could be to assist in next year s U S  Presidential election Most likely  it is all of the above  I placed them in order of their likely emphasis  too Next  I have Reuters  five world market themes for the Global Week Ahead  leaving them in order of importance for equity market traders  Yes  the Fed Meeting leads  But don t forget about the many central bank meetings that conclude the following day  1  The Fed Meets Tuesday and WednesdayInvestors around the globe are bracing for a second rate cut from the U S  Federal Reserve at its policy setting Federal Open Market Committee on Sept  17 18 Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently said that the central bank remained committed to keeping the U S  economic expansion going  signaling he and his colleagues are likely to cut interest rates into 2020  But even so  President Donald Trump has made life a little harder for Powell Trump again lambasted the Fed following an European Central Bank rate cut Thursday that sent the euro lower  tweeting the ECB was  succeeding  in  depreciating the Euro against the VERY strong Dollar  hurting U S  exports  while the Fed  sits  and sits  and sits  Powell acknowledged  a range of views  among policymakers  his careful wording reflects a split within the U S  central bank about how best to respond to an economy where the job market and consumer spending are holding up but trade tensions between Beijing and Washington  Britain s possibly messy exit from the European Union and a broad global slowdown pose risks The Fed cut rates for the first time in more than a decade in July  Market pricing suggests that investors expect another quarter point reduction next week  2  Lots of Central Banks Will Follow Suit ThursdayAfter the European Central Bank s bazooka  the wait is on to see what the message is from other central banks  The Fed of course will cut rates by a quarter point on Wednesday  But Thursday brings policy meetings in Japan  Britain  Norway and Switzerland The Bank of Japan  sources say  will discuss further easing  it may even decide to act to head off further economic pain  a third of analysts in a Reuters poll predict  Upcoming trade and inflation data should show Japan s export slump deepening and inflation at two year lows  But its dilemma is the same as elsewhere  How to inject stimulus without hurting banks any further  and how to make it effective Switzerland  with a  0 75  interest rate  is quiet so far on the prospect of emulating ECB easing but will be concerned at the franc s surge to two year highs versus the euro  On the other hand  the relentless rise in SNB  sight deposits  is hardly tenable  These are at almost 600 billion francs as the SNB intervenes to tamp down the franc Brexit clouds the Bank of England s strategy but Norway  one of very few central banks still pressing on with rate rises  could hike again on Sept  19  But with easing gathering steam all around  it is very likely to mark the end of its tightening cycle There is excitement also in emerging markets  where Brazil is expected to cut 50 bps on Wednesday  South Africa s central bank also meets on Thursday  though is not expected to move  But these days  you never know  3  Can a Mini Trade Deal Be Struck in October Financial markets were quick to seize on recent conciliatory messages and measures between Beijing and Washington as a hopeful sign of an imminent deal in the protracted trade war  Yet that may be as much a symptom of fatigue   from the unremitting tweets and retorts   as genuine optimism A Reuters poll of 60 economists shows 80  expect relations between Beijing and the Trump administration to deteriorate or at best hold steady until end 2020 The week saw Beijing exempt some agricultural products from additional tariffs on U S  goods and Trump delay a tariff increase on certain Chinese goods by two weeks  Junior U S  and Chinese officials meet in the coming week  followed by talks between senior trade negotiators in early October Meanwhile  the IMF has issued dire warnings of a drop in global economic growth next year  China s neighbors are seeing growth rates slide as their exports to the mainland collapse Some are looking for upsides  Vietnam has been a beneficiary of businesses seeking to move or alter trade routes  Thailand just announced a package of tax incentives  investment zones and new legislation that would draw in companies from China  Japan  Taiwan and South Korea  But if tensions are shrinking the world trade pie  any feasting in Southeast Asia may be short lived China also reports industrial output and retails sales data for August on Monday  4  Brexit and Boris Johnson  The Same IssueBritain s never ending Brexit drama is set to reach fever pitch again   this time in the country s top court Prime Minister Boris Johnson will challenge a ruling of Scotland s highest court of appeal that his decision to suspend  or prorogue  parliament for five weeks was unlawful and should be annulled  Gina Miller will appeal a rejection of her challenge for a judicial review of Johnson s decision to prorogue parliament  Both cases are scheduled to be heard by U K  s Supreme Court on Tuesday Proroguing parliament until Oct  14 was seen by most as a tactical move from Johnson to make sure he maintains a strong negotiating hand with Brussels Johnson wanted to show he can deliver a no deal Brexit on Oct  31  Most investors believed him  sending the pound sharply lower at the start of the month  to levels not seen since 1985 But the tables seem to have turned for now  Parliament managed to pass a law that forces Johnson to extend Brexit if a deal isn t reached by Oct  19  Traders say this has definitely reduced the probability of a no deal Brexit on Oct  31  though the risks of a no deal Brexit down the road was still high  5  Will Emerging Markets Finally Be the Place to Be If the Fed goes big with its rate cut on Wednesday  the place to be will probably be the riskier parts of the world that still have interest rates you can see with the naked eye Low rates in the United States and sub zero ones in core Europe and Japan mean high yield bonds from places like Turkey  Ukraine  Ecuador  Egypt  Brazil or parts of sub Saharan Africa look ever more attractive There is a catch up factor in play too  August was a torrid month for these countries  assets  Argentina s slump into crisis made it worse  of course  but the underperformance between high yield emerging market sovereign debt and that the safer  investment grade   IG  emerging market countries  was one of the most severe ever   roughly  3  returns versus  3  for IG emerging markets debt Turkey s jumbo rate cut this week helped speed that catch up process but a dove bomb from the Fed on Wednesday as well as a big chop from Brazil and more soothing trade war sounds will all help it along nicely Top Zacks  1 Rank StocksAmgen  Health Care stocks have been overlooked in this rally

149026,370542,AMGN,Bull Of The Day  Amgen  AMGN ,opinion,"Amgen  is literally one of the world s biotech pioneers  Founded in California in 1980 and going public three years later  the company   formerly known as American Molecular Genetics   has been on the cutting edge of genetic therapeutics  molecular biology and biochemistry for almost 40 years 
Following the 2009 acquisition of Genentech   an early competitor in recombinant DNA technology   by Roche  Amgen became the world s largest stand alone biotechnology research and development company 
Amgen s first blockbuster product was synthetic human erythropoietin that had been produced in cell culture using non human animal eggs  The technique was lauded as brilliantly creative at the time   as well as covered by extensive patent protection  Epogen was approved by the FDA in 1989 for the treatment of chronic anemia as a result of kidney disease  and approvals for use in cancer  HIV and other critical ill patients soon followed  By 2002 it was the single most paid for pharmaceutical by Medicare with reimbursements of over  2 billion annually 
Neupogen is still marketed by Amgen and also sold under the brand named  Procrit  through a licensing agreement with Johnson and Johnson   
In fact  Erythropoietin is so effective at helping the human body produce red blood cells under stressful conditions that Epogen was added to the World Anti Doping Agency s  banned  list and was the subject of many failed drug tests by healthy endurance athletes who had obtained it illegally and used it as a performance enhancing drug 
Amgen continued to use unique and creative techniques for developing precisely targeted therapeutic biologicals based on naturally occurring human compounds for a wide range of afflictions  including kidney failure  osteoporosis  migraines  auto immune disorders and many more serious illnesses 
Starting in 1994  Amgen also started making strategic acquisitions of smaller biotech companies who owned promising intellectual property that fit well into the Amgen stable of treatments  Among the 17 companies acquired in the past 25 years was Immunex  which was on the verge of approval for its rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel  now another Amgen blockbuster with annual sales of over  5 billion 
Current pharmaceutical offerings like Neulasta  Neupogen and Repatha headline a list of 18 drugs that are currently being sold by Amgen or its partners   producing  23 billion in annual revenues The company also continues to use state of the art science to investigate new treatments for serious illnesses  They currently have 24 compounds in Phase 1 trials  2 in Phase 2 and 5 in Phase 3   as well as countless experiments running on pre trial drug ideas 
It s exactly that combination of huge selling and profitable drugs and a full pipeline of candidates for the next generation of success stories that make Amgen such a compelling investment  The typical narrative for a small startup biotech is that they have a low number of potential drugs in development or even in trials  and with little or no revenues  significant costs and essentially infinate pricing multiples  investors are quick to unload shares at the first sign of any trouble 
Amgen is already so far past that stage that they look attractive on a valuation basis just based on current lines of business  The potential for new best selling drugs is just gravy for shareholders 
With a forward P E Ratio of just 13 7X and an annual dividend yield of 3   Amgen can be viewed simultaneously as a Value stock  a Growth stock and an Income stock  
Twelve upward analyst revisions in the past 60 days have brought the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate for 2019 from  13 90 share to  14 30 and help earn Amgen a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2020 estimates have been rising on a similar trajectory over the same period   from  14 78 to  15 42 share 
Pharmaceutical companies tend to be steady performers  producing sales gains even in difficult economic conditions  but with little chance of huge growth  Early stage Biotechs have explosive potential  but they also have a tendency to implode when things don t go as planned 
Owning Amgen shares allows a savvy investor to experience the best of both worlds 
5 Stocks Set to Double Each was hand picked by a Zacks expert as the  1 favorite stock to gain  100  or more in 2020  Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth  Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar  which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor ",2019-09-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bull-of-the-day-amgen-amgn-200466526,200466526

149125,370641,AMGN,What Investors Need To Know About The Celgene  Amgen   Bristol Myers Deals,opinion,"On Monday  Celgene   NASDAQ CELG   announced a sale of its psoriasis drug Otezla for  13 4 billion to Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN    This deal will be all cash and is expected to clear before the end of the year  Celgene s stock climbed 3 2  the day of the announcement and has risen another 0 5  since then 
The Sale
Bristol Myers Squibb will buy Celgene contingent on Celgene s sale of its Otezla drug to Amgen 
Celgene began looking for a buyer for Otezla after U S  regulators raised antitrust concerns over a proposed acquisition of Celgene by Bristol Myers Squibb   NYSE BMY    Regulators are likely concerned about BMY s psoriasis drug in late stage development that would be similar to Otezla 
The sale is contingent on approval from regulators and the subsequent acquisition of Celgene by BMY  Amgen expects this deal to be worth about  11 2 billion after anticipated future cash tax benefits  This is much higher than the  8  10 billion range that analysts expected  However  Amgen released a statement after the announcement saying  We re doubtful investors will miss the additional cash required to bring Otezla on board from AMGN s balance sheet   Recall  AMGN finished Q2 with  22B in cash  
Impact
Last year  Otezla brought in  1 61 billion in sales for Celgene  Amgen anticipates sales to grow by low single digits over the next five years due to its compatible portfolio of other anti inflammatory drugs  Otezla has already shown impressive growth since its 2014 approval  with sales up over 300  from 2015 to 2018  and Amgen does not expect this to stop  This will boost Amgen s top line significantly and help offset recent pressure from copycats of its Neulasta and Sensipar drugs 
Currently  BMY s acquisition of Celgene is expected to be worth about  74 billion  Bristol Myers Squibb stated that it would use cash from Celgene s sale of Otezla sale to pare down debt incurred as a result of its Celgene purchase  The company will target a better debt to EBITDA ratio of 1 5x by 2023  using this sale to start  BMY also announced it would increase its already accelerated share buyback program from  5 billion to  7 billion 
Let s now look at the individual financial estimates for Bristol Myers Squibb and Celgene to gain insight into the combined company s possible future 
Celgene
Celgene stock is up 51 7  YTD  beating the large cap pharma market s performance of  2 0   Celgene is also a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  at the moment  with earnings estimates having been revised in both directions in the past 60 days 
Earnings estimates show a current quarter growth of 19 21  to  2 73 per share  Next quarter is projected to come in 18 41  above last year  along with a full year estimate of  10 87 per share  a 22 55  jump  Fiscal 2020 is predicted to see earnings continue to rise 10 14  to  11 97 for the full year 
Bristol Myers Squibb 
For Q3 2019  our Zacks Consensus Estimates show earnings shrinking by 3 67  over the year ago period  to  1 05  Investors should note that BMY crushed Q2 fiscal 2018 s  0 91 per share estimate when it posted  1 09  Meanwhile  full year earnings are projected to grow 7 54   Earnings for the following year are projected to jump another 18 67  
BMY currently holds a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   due to positive earnings estimate revisions for full year fiscal 2019  It is also currently trading at a discount with a forward P E ratio of just 9 7x compared to the large cap pharma average of 14 1x 
Bottom Line
Analysts expect this deal to close by the end of the year  and for anti trust regulators to approve it after the Otezla sale  Both companies look promising financially  making it likely that the deal will create a pharma powerhouse  Investors should look for more news on this deal as it approaches completion  as it is possible to make gains if the combined company operates successfully

149142,370658,AMGN,Amgen  AMGN  Moves To Buy  Rationale Behind The Upgrade,opinion,"Amgen  AMGN  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Amgen basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Amgen imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Amgen
This world s largest biotech drugmaker is expected to earn  14 25 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of  1  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Amgen  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2 2  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

149205,370721,AMGN,Pharma industry shuns Trump push for radical shift at FDA,news,"By Deena Beasley  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump s vow to roll back government regulations at least 75 percent is causing anxiety for some pharmaceutical executives that a less robust Food and Drug Administration would make it harder to secure insurance coverage for pricey new medicines  The prospect of big change at the regulatory agency comes as drugmakers are under fire for high prices  including Marathon Pharmaceuticals LLC  which said Monday it was  pausing  the launch of its Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug after U S  lawmakers questioned its  89 000 a year price  Industry trade group Biotechnology Innovation Organization told Reuters that during high level discussions with Trump advisors  lobbyists urged the administration not to name a new commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration who would act rashly to speed up the agency s approval of new medicines  That sentiment was echoed by executives at more than a dozen pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms  who told Reuters that the FDA is already adopting new drug development models and warned that a looser review process would put patients at risk   People often argue that the FDA is too restrictive   said Roger Perlmutter  head of research and development at Merck  NYSE MRK    Co Inc   We have the sense that the balance is pretty right     you have to have a well characterized risk benefit profile   That stance underscores the unique position the drug industry finds itself in when it comes to regulating its products  While most sectors welcome less oversight  drugmakers say a robust review process is critical in convincing physicians and insurers that a pricey new medicine has value   Otherwise  the time and money it takes to get a new drug to market   estimates run as high as  2 6 billion   would be lost if insurers are not willing to pay for the product   It is great that the administration is seeking deregulation     to make sure the private sector can be more competitive   said John Maraganore  chief executive officer at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc and co chair of BIO s regulatory committee   But payers are looking for evidence of value   He said the FDA should speed the approval of lower cost generic versions of drugs that have lost patent protection  but warned that allowing novel products to be launched without extensive testing could be dangerous   Any change at the FDA that allows drugs to be tried out on patients without clinical evidence is a damaging approach   said Jeremy Levin  chief executive officer at Ovid Therapeutics Inc   which is developing drugs for rare diseases  Health insurers are pushing back against high priced drugs  Sales of expensive new cholesterol drugs from  Amgen Inc   NASDAQ AMGN  and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ REGN  have stalled as insurers limit coverage until they see results of trials designed to prove that the drugs significantly lower the risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular crises   It is one thing to get a drug approved  but you have got to get reimbursed   said Paul Perreault  CEO at biotech company CSL Ltd  adding that won t happen unless payers see proof that a new drug is better than what is already available  To be sure  some pharmaceutical executives have been vocal about the need for deregulation  Reducing regulation  will help with drug prices  because it will induce more competition    Pfizer  Inc  NYSE PFE  CEO Ian Read said on a recent conference call  After top executives at Merck  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  and others met at the White House last month with Trump  who pledged to  streamline  the FDA  industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said the meeting found common ground such as tax reform  and removal of outdated regulations  The trade group declined to comment on changes at the FDA  The prospect of a shake up at the FDA is being welcomed by a new class of investor with ambitions to disrupt the current drug development model  in which larger pharmaceutical players often buy or license early stage medicines  and reap the bigger rewards if they succeed   The system we have now has its roots 50  60 even 70 years ago     it has become incredibly expensive   said Tim Shannon  of venture capital firm Canaan Partners  He supports the notion that some prescription medications could reach the market  possibly at discounted prices  once testing shows they are safe  If such controlled usage indicates that they are also effective  prices could then be raised   We want to make healthcare itself more efficient   he said   Let the marketplace decide how valuable a drug is   The fate of deregulating the FDA will be driven by its next commissioner  President Trump said last month he has a  fantastic person  lined up for the role  Candidates  according to sources close to the administration  include former FDA staffer Scott Gottlieb  and Jim O Neill  a colleague of Trump supporter Peter Thiel who has advocated for allowing some medicines to reach the market once they are shown to be safe  even if there is scant evidence that they work  A recent survey of drug company executives conducted by Mizuho Securities found that 72 percent said Gottlieb should be Trump s pick to head the FDA  
 There is no groundswell of movement for change   said attorney Jim Shehan  head of Lowenstein Sandler s FDA regulatory practice   The industry likes certainty  ",2017-02-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pharma-industry-shuns-trump-push-for-radical-shift-at-fda-459982,459982

149220,370736,AMGN,Amgen  AMGN  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Amgen  AMGN  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This world s largest biotech drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 57 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 8  
Revenues are expected to be  5 65 billion  down 6 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 45  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Amgen 
For Amgen  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 05  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Amgen will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Amgen would post earnings of  3 45 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 56  delivering a surprise of  3 19  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Amgen appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/amgen-amgn-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-should-you-buy-200443198,200443198

149237,370753,AMGN,California drug pricing initiative headed for defeat,news,"By Deena Beasley
LOS ANGELES  Reuters    A California ballot initiative aimed at reining in rising prices for prescription drugs was headed for defeat on Tuesday after pharmaceutical companies spent more than  100 million to fight it 
The California Drug Price Relief Act  also known as Proposition 61  sought to limit state health programs from paying more for medications than the U S  Department of Veterans Affairs  VA   which receives the steepest discounts in the country 
As of late Tuesday night  with 47 percent of precincts partially reporting  the vote was 46 percent in support of the measure and 54 percent opposed  according to California s Secretary of State 
 The pharmaceutical companies spent a lot to defeat this   said Stuart Schweitzer  professor of health policy and management at the University of California  Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health   They wanted to draw a line in the sand  
The rising cost of prescription drugs has come under attack during the recent U S  presidential campaign  Both Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump have called for cost trimming measures including allowing Medicare  the federal health plan for seniors  to negotiate prices with drugmakers 
 This strong vote for Prop 61  even despite the barrage of drug company campaigning against it  provides momentum for state legislation to rein in prescription drug prices   Anthony Wright  executive director of advocacy group Health Access California  said in a statement 
Pharmaceutical companies  concerned about their bottom lines  spent heavily on ads urging  no  votes  making this California s most expensive initiative contest among the 17 in this election 
Opponents  led by global drugmakers such as  Pfizer  Inc  NYSE PFE  and  Amgen Inc   NASDAQ AMGN   spent around  106 million to fight Proposition 61  They argued that the measure would benefit only 12 percent of Californians  while putting the other 88 percent  as well as veterans across the country  at risk of higher drug costs 
Supporters  led by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and AARP  which advocates for seniors  said only drug companies themselves can raise prices for veterans or other consumers  Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders also campaigned in support of Proposition 61  calling on voters to  stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry  
Proponents  who raised  17 million to support the measure  estimated it could save California taxpayers up to  5 7 billion over 10 years  although a state legislative analysis said the financial impact is not clear 
UCLA s Schweitzer said the measure would have had only a modest impact on state drug costs 
There were also questions about how Proposition 61 would be implemented  The VA s mandated prices are listed publicly  but its steepest negotiated drug price discounts are required by law to be confidential 
The VA spends some  6 1 billion a year on medicines for 6 million veterans  Proposition 61 would extend those discounts to around 4 5 million Californians  including certain members of the state s low income Medicaid plan  state employees and retirees  university teachers and prisoners 
The  Yes on Prop 61  coalition said it plans to carry its message to other states  A similar proposition has already been approved for Ohio s 2017 November ballot ",2016-11-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/california-drug-pricing-initiative-headed-for-defeat-439032,439032

149248,370764,AMGN,Why Amgen  AMGN  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Amgen  AMGN   This company  which is in the Zacks Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This world s largest biotech drugmaker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 4 05  
For the most recent quarter  Amgen was expected to post earnings of  3 45 per share  but it reported  3 56 per share instead  representing a surprise of 3 19   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  3 26 per share  while it actually produced  3 42 per share  a surprise of 4 91  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Amgen lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Amgen has an Earnings ESP of  0 89  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on July 30  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-amgen-amgn-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200439349,200439349

The fund raise extended the cash runway until the end of 2021 and several milestones are achievable within this period  Phase II MERECA trial top line results in Q319  initial safety data from the Phase Ib of ILIAD trial around end 2019 and then full safety data from the Phase Ib of ILIAD trial in 2020  Although final results  including efficacy endpoints  from the ILIAD trial are not likely until 2022  safety data from the Phase Ib part are key  as this will be the first time ilixadencel is combined with a checkpoint inhibitor  CPI  and will allow the company to engage in negotiations with potential partners before the full ILIAD results are available 
Focus on accumulating attractive data package
CPIs have well established safety issues  which limit combination potential  ie two CPIs can be more effective  but also increase toxicity  Therefore  when it comes to combinations  emphasis on safety is just as important as on efficacy  Immune primers tend to have benign safety profiles  so should combine with CPIs well presuming efficacy is proven  By the time safety data from the Phase Ib part of the ILIAD trial are obtained  expected in 2020   Immunicum will have gathered an attractive data package supporting ilixadencel s mechanism of action  especially immune activation data from the MERECA trial   safety and initial clinical efficacy 
Valuation  SEK2 0bn or SEK21 7 share

Investment summary
Developing immune primer for combination cancer therapies
Immunicum is an immunooncology company listed on NASDAQ Stockholm and based in Stockholm  Sweden  which develops allogeneic DC technologies  It was formed in 2002 based on research originally carried out at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg  Sweden  Immunicum is developing an  off the shelf   clinical stage immune primer  ilixadencel  based on activated allogeneic DCs  The company also has two other preclinical stage  off the shelf vaccine technology platforms  IMM 2  which focuses on adenovirus transfected allogeneic DCs  and IMM 3  an optimized CAR T expansion protocol for improved anti cancer activity  The lead product  ilixadencel  is based on Immunicum s patented pro inflammatory allogeneic DC technology  which is now being explored in the Phase II MERECA trial in RCC and the Phase Ib II ILIAD trial in multiple solid tumours  The underlying rationale is to develop ilixadencel as an immune primer  which will be used in conjunction with other cancer therapies that either directly target the tumour or amplify the immune response against it  The synergy of these mechanisms is expected to boost the anti cancer immune response 
Valuation  SEK2 0bn or SEK21 7 share
Following the share issue completed in Q418  we have revised our model to reflect the fact that Immunicum will be able to create more value before the assumed out licensing  In addition  we rolled our model forward and incorporated the increased net cash position  We have postponed the deal in our model from 2019 to 2020  which is when full safety data from the ILIAD trial are expected  We reflect the improved deal terms by increasing the royalty rate from 5 0  to 7 5  and total milestone payments from  160m to  400m  supported by benchmarking as described in the valuation section below   Overall  we maintain the valuation approach described in our initiation report  where we value five of the six indications in Immunicum s R D pipeline 
Financials  Cash runway to 2021 after successful share issue
Immunicum s Q119 operating loss of SEK29 1m was in line with SEK28 8m in Q118  As expected  R D costs comprised most of Immunicum s expense  accounting for SEK23 2m  SEK22 2m in Q118   while administrative costs were SEK6 1m vs SEK6 0m a year ago  In Q418  Immunicum completed an underwritten fund raising split between a direct share issue  c SEK178m  and a rights issue  c SEK173m   which management guides will extend its cash runway to the end of 2021  To reflect a higher level of R D investment  we have amended our valuation model as described above  postponed the deal by two years and improved the terms   This means our operating loss estimates now are SEK119 9m and SEK121 6m in 2019 and 2020 respectively  This brings our model in line with management guidance on cash reach 
Sensitivities  Biotech risks apply
Ilixadencel has yet to reach a definitive proof of concept clinical stage so has significant R D risk  as is typical for a company at this stage  The clinical programmes are all testing the same therapy  therefore the investment case relies on the success of ilixadencel  CT or ultrasound is required to guide the injection to the viable part of the tumour  It is unlikely that the administration procedure is too difficult for physicians to perform since intratumourally injected products are already marketed  By the time ilixadencel is launched  the treatment landscape and  standard treatments  are likely to have developed  Ilixadencel is already being positioned as an addition to combination therapy  so potential changes in clinical practice are not prohibitive to the development of ilixadencel as a part of a combination treatment 
Efficacy data from Ph II MERECA trial in RCC in Q319
Immunicum s long term strategy is to accumulate proof of concept clinical data in multiple solid cancer indications where ilixadencel is used in combination with other anti cancer treatments  The company expects that this type of data package will be interesting to a number of potential partners and improve the prospects for a potential out licensing deal  The current R D programme focuses on six cancers  Exhibit 1  
The most advanced trial is in renal cell carcinoma  RCC   where ilixadencel is being tested in the Phase II MERECA study  n 88  in combination with Pfizer s tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib versus sunitinib alone  Recruitment in this trial is completed and top line results are expected in Q319 
The other key study is the Phase Ib II ILIAD trial  estimated n 150  in multiple solid tumour indications  non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC   head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  HNSCC  or gastric adenocarcinoma in combination with CPIs  In the Phase Ib part of the trial  ilixadencel will be combined with Keytruda  pembrolizumab  Merck   Co MSD  and in the larger Phase II part with Bavencio  avelumab  Merck KGaA and Pfizer  NYSE PFE    for which Immunicum will acquire Bavencio at no cost  The trial started enrolling patients in January 2019  Interim safety toxicity results are expected around end 2019  full safety and efficacy data from the Phase Ib of ILIAD should be released in 2020 and controlled efficacy data from the Phase II of ILIAD should be obtained in 2022 
Immunicum has completed a Phase I II trial in liver cancer  HCC   with results demonstrating that ilixadencel was safe  well tolerated and showed initial signs of clinical efficacy 
Most recently  Immunicum also completed a smaller Phase I study  n 6  in patients with relatively rare gastrointestinal stromal tumours  GIST   where ilixadencel was combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in second or later lines of therapy  In line with previous findings  Ilixadencel was safe and well tolerated and showed clinical benefit in two out of six patients  who had all previously progressed while on TKI therapy 

Ilixadencel  an  off the shelf  immune primer
How it is different
Ilixadencel is an immune primer made up of pro inflammatory activated allogeneic DCs and intended for intratumoural administration  The DCs are activated ex vivo using a potent cocktail  denoted as COMBIG  of poly I C  TLR3 ligand   R848  TLR7 8 ligand  and IFN    Karlsson Parra et al  2018   This induces DCs to produce large amounts of chemokines and cytokines  The activated DCs can then be frozen and stored on the shelf for at least three years  expected shelf life could increase   and used in any patient  The key differences between ilixadencel and most other cell therapies or cancer vaccines are as follows 
Ilixadencel DCs are allogeneic  ie isolated from healthy donors  This allows an off the shelf product manufacturing  which is one of the most desired characteristics when considering cell therapies and allows for stockpiling  An additional benefit is the fact that around 100 ilixadencel doses can be produced from a single donor  which is expected to be sufficient for c 50 patients 
Ilixadencel DCs are not loaded with antigens  which means there is no need to obtain a patient s tumour tissue  The treatment can be simply used and administered off the shelf  which avoids the more complex logistics typical in the manufacture and administration of autologous immune primers  involving retrieval of a patient s cells and or tumour tissue  ex vivo manipulation and the administration of the product to the same patient  Exhibit 2  
Ilixadencel potentially makes the full set of cancer neoantigens accessible  Cancer vaccines in a traditional sense typically introduce one or several so called tumour associated antigens  which often can be tolerated by the immune system  so the drawback of such an approach is that it is difficult to select the right antigens  Personalized cancer vaccines can expose the whole neoantigen set  but  as discussed above  are autologous  Immunicum s approach is to introduce allogeneic  activated allogeneic DCs directly into the tumour with the aim that the patient s own tumour will become the source of neoantigens  This ensures that there is no need to predict  which neoantigens would be effective  and that the full set of immunogenic antigens will be used for immune system activation 
These features correspond to what could be called a  holy grail  immune primer  allogeneic  exposes the full set of patient specific neoantigens  simple and cost effective  The critical question as to whether it will be effective will obviously need to be addressed in clinical trials  However  the combination of these features alone is what makes ilixadencel a stand out immune primer cell therapy in R D  in our view 

How it works
Classical cancer treatment options include surgery  radiation and chemotherapy  However  improving knowledge about the immune system has led to the development of innovative therapies such as cytokines  interferon alfa  interleukin 2  and antibodies  rituximab  trastuzumab  bevacizumab   The more recent drugs in this area are checkpoint inhibitors  with Yervoy  ipilimumab  Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY   being the first launched in 2011  followed by Keytruda  pembrolizumab  Merck  and Opdivo  nivolumab  Bristol Myers Squibb   and the first virus based cancer vaccine Imlygic  talimogene laherparepvec  Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN    Adoptive T cell therapies represent the latest breakthrough in cancer treatment  with the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy  Kymriah  tisagenlecleucel  Novartis   approved by the FDA in August 2017 for paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 
There are two immune system types  innate and acquired  Innate immunity is inborn  non specific ability to defend against infections  acquired  adaptive  immunity is specific to a pathogen and responsible for a long lasting effect  eg vaccination  The latter is subdivided into an antibody based immune response  humoral  and a cellular response  which involves T cells  T cells sense and can kill infections or a patient s own tissue cells if those become abnormal and cause the risk of a tumour developing  There are several subsets of T cells  but the two major ones are CD4   also called  helper   and CD8    killer    indicating which CD glycoprotein they express  CD4  cells are involved in the coordination of other immune cells that participate in the immune response  CD8  cells can directly attack and kill other cells which  for example  are infected with viruses or become malignant  Another important class of immune cells is dendritic cells  DCs  
In a malignant process  when cancer cells die and release abnormal proteins antigens  the DCs pick them up  process and present to the CD8  cells  which then initiate an attack against the cancer  Ilixadencel is made up of activated allogeneic DCs  When injected into the tumour  the ilixadencel DCs survive for 48 72 hours and release immunostimulating factors  including chemokines and cytokines  during that time period  Production of the immunostimulating factors causes local recruitment and activation of the patient s immature DCs  natural killer  NK  cells and T cells  The recognition of the injected DCs by the immune system as foreign  to the patient or host  also helps this process  which leads to cancer cell death and neoantigen release  This then leads to the initiation of the cancer immunity cycle  Exhibit 3   which is expected to mount a sustained anti cancer response  The patient s activated DCs migrate to the tumour site  pick up neoantigens and express them on the cell surface  They then travel to the lymph node  where the patient s DCs  present  these neoantigens to patient CD8  cells  which become cytotoxic CD8  cells that are able to kill tumour cells which display the same antigens as those previously presented  Importantly  in ilixadencel s case  although it is injected intratumourally  if the cancer immunity cycle is efficiently initiated  then both the primary tumour and metastases should be targeted  abscopal effect  
Combinations exploiting several steps in cancer IO cycle are needed
In a malignant process  the tumour evolves in such a way that it can escape being cleared by the immune system  This can happen because either the cancer antigens are not effectively exposed to the immune system and or the cancer develops a so called immunosuppressant environment  Checkpoint inhibitors are effective in certain cancers  however  a very significant part of the patient population is non responsive to the treatment  One suggestion for this effect is that a non responder s immune system is not efficient at carrying out the full immunity cycle in so called  cold  tumours  Chen and Mellman  2013   This is why more traditional chemotherapeutic drugs are used in combination with CPIs to hit the tumours at different targets  For the same reason  novel immuno oncology approaches are also tested in combination with CPIs with the goal of priming the immune cycle and inducing a sustained anti cancer immune response  which will then be amplified by CPIs  turning  cold  tumours to  hot    This approach is supported by emerging evidence that CPIs are more effective in tumours that are already recognized by the immune system  ie tumour specific CD8  T cells are already present before administering CPIs  Ock et al  2016  

Ilixadencel s mechanism of action is  inspired by nature 
Natural viral infection and vaccination with live attenuated viruses  eg the smallpox vaccination  mounts an immune response  which includes the development of specific cytotoxic CD8  T cells that attack and kill the cells infected with the virus  Current understanding  Karlsson Parra et al  2018  is that those DCs that are first infected with a virus lose their ability to present viral antigens to T cells  but instead start to act as an immune primer by secreting inflammatory compounds  This leads to the recruitment and maturation of non infected DCs or  bystander  DCs  The newly recruited DCs absorb the dying virus infected cells and thereby take up the viral antigens  The immune cycle follows  where the DCs migrate to lymph nodes and present the antigens to CD8  T cells that attack the virus infected cells 
The goal with ilixadencel is to recreate this initial stage of the immunity cycle  leading to local inflammation  maturation of own DCs  cancer neoantigen release and uptake by the patient s own mature DCs  Theoretically  this should also be facilitated by the fact that allogeneic DCs will still be recognized as  foreign   which should facilitate an inflammatory reaction  Since ilixadencel is injected intratumourally  the expectation is that the matured own DCs will have access to full set of cancer neoantigens  intracellular and surface  
Existing data are promising
Preclinical data
Immunicum has preclinical data supporting ilixadencel s proposed mechanism of action  which has been published in several peer reviewed articles and different conference presentations  Fotaki et al  2018  Fotaki et al  2017  and ESMO presentation 2018  
Most recent set of preclinical in vivo data was presented at the ESMO conference in October 2018  In this study the researchers used anti PD 1 resistant colon carcinoma mouse model  CT26   The co administration of ilixadencel and PD 1 inhibitor was found to overcome tumour anti PD 1 resistance  Exhibit 4A   which is exactly the proposition of ilixadencel s combination with CPIs  In survival studies researchers treated colon carcinoma mice with ilixadencel in combinations with anti PD 1 or a known immune enhancer 4 1BB  anti CD137   The results showed that combinations with ilixadencel were synergistic when compared to these drugs standalone  Exhibit 4B  

In preclinical in vitro studies ilixadencel was shown to produce pro inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in a sustained fashion  such as IL 12p70  TNF    IL 1  and MIP 1   Ilixadencel also activated co cultured allogeneic T cells  The secretion of these pro inflammatory factors during the co culture promoted the maturation of bystander DCs  which efficiently presented a model antigen to activate antigen specific CD8  T cells 
In preclinical in vivo studies  mouse models   intratumoural administration of allogeneic mouse DCs activated with an identical stimulation cocktail was shown to induce recruitment of T cells  and NK cells  into the tumour  In another study  mice were vaccinated with allogeneic DCs transfected with a virus vector  which induced the expression of a tumour antigen gp 100  This resulted in the generation of gp 100 specific CD8   T cells  ie the animal s own immune system discovered the tumour antigen 
Phase I II in RCC
The Phase I II study in RCC was completed before the MERECA trial  The study was conducted at Uppsala University Hospital  Sweden  in 12 newly diagnosed metastatic RCC patients  Patients were only enrolled if they were candidates for nephrectomy  had a tumour larger than 4cm and at least one metastasis  Following treatment with ilixadencel  patients underwent nephrectomy and only received subsequent standard of care  TKI  upon disease progression  The primary safety endpoints were adverse events  AEs   Immunicum also measured the tumour specific response as a secondary endpoint using various immunological techniques  The main findings were  Laurell et al  2017  
Ilixadencel was found to be safe and well tolerated  All AEs were mild to moderate and were fever  five patients   chills  two patients   rash  one patient  and hypotension  one patient   No dose limiting toxicity was found  SAEs were reported but were unrelated to ilixadencel and there were no signs of an autoimmune response  We believe the side effect profile is encouraging and suggests that a transformation of the immune response to the tumour was in progress 
Immunological examination showed strong to massive tumour specific immune activation with CD8  T cell infiltration in the primary tumour  in 7 out of 12 removed kidney tumours   Massive CD8  T cell infiltration was also observed in one  and the only evaluable  obtained distant metastasis  abscopal effect  
Long term follow up data  six out of 11 evaluable patients received subsequent treatment with TKIs  Three of these six patients surpassed five year survival  while the median overall survival of all 11 patients was 48 months  This compared to historical median overall survival of 14 16 months in similar patients who were treated with TKIs  Exhibit 5  
An interesting case involved one of those three patients  He had multiple liver and brain metastases that all completely regressed after the treatment with ilixadencel and Sutent  Brain metastases are not expected to respond when treated with Sutent 

Phase I II in liver cancer
Ilixadencel has completed a second clinical Phase I II study in 18 patients  17 had HCC and one had cholangiocarcinoma   The patients had an advanced or unresectable disease and received three intratumoural injections of ilixadencel in first line as monotherapy  first line in combination with sorafenib  or second line after progression on sorafenib  The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability  while secondary endpoints included immunological response and initial signs of clinical activity  Overall  ilixadencel was shown to be safe and well tolerated when given as a single treatment or in combination with Nexavar  and some evidence of tumour specific immune activation was observed in the majority of evaluable patients  Rizell et al  2019  
Safety and tolerability  The most common toxicity was grade 1 and 2 fever and chills  with one single treatment related grade 3 event  Notably  this patient was also treated with sorafenib  The patient was suspected of having sepsis  although this was not confirmed  and later recovered 
Immunological examination showed that in the majority of evaluable patients  11 15   there was an increased frequency of tumour specific CD8  T cells in circulating blood 
Initial clinical efficacy  A subgroup of 6 patients received ilixadencel in combination with sorafenib and had a median overall survival of 8 6 months that was shorter than expected when compared with historical controls receiving first line sorafenib  While this was a surprising finding  it could be explained by observations from in vitro studies  where sorafenib  but not sunitinib or anti PD 1 antibodies  inhibited so called mixed leukocyte reaction that leads to a by stander effect  In contrast  patients who received ilixadencel monotherapy as a second line treatment  n   7  had a longer median survival of 10 9 months 
The safety profile from these clinical studies appears to be very good  It appears that sorafenib may not be the best combination drug with ilixadencel due to impaired DC maturation effect  but ilixadencel monotherapy data and in vitro studies allow exploring other TKIs and anti PD 1 combinations  in our view 
Phase I II study in GIST
In June 2019  Immunicum released top line results from the Phase I II trial  which tested ilixadencel in patients with GIST  The Phase I II open label  single arm trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of ilixadencel in unresectable or metastatic GIST patients with tumour progression during ongoing second or later lines of treatment with TKI therapy  Patients were treated with two intratumoural doses of ilixadencel in combination with the ongoing TKI treatment  Ilixadencel was administered in combination with sunitinib  regorafenib or similar TKI  Initial plans were to conduct a larger study  but due to the rarity of the disease  enrolment was stopped at six patients  The released top line results include 
The primary safety endpoint was met with no life threatening  treatment related adverse events  and
The secondary endpoint exploring initial efficacy was based on tumour growth  In two out of six patients the tumour growth was stopped and partially regressed for three and six months  respectively 
GIST is a relatively rare cancer and accounts for less than 1  of all gastrointestinal  GI  tumours  and is therefore a small indication compared to others in Immunicum s R D pipeline  When diagnosed with GIST  most patients appear to have a localised disease and so surgery is the mainstay of curative treatment  but 40  of the resected tumours recur and spread  Schvartsman et al  2017   TKIs became standard of care chemotherapy  but GIST remains one of the most chemo resistant solid malignancies  Imatinib is the TKI of choice for first line treatment  but 50  of patients develop resistance within two years  Other TKIs  sunitinib or regorafenib  were shown to have a benefit in subsequent lines of therapy  but the medial survival at this stage typically is several months  Feng and Morris  2014  
The findings in this study showed that two out of six patients had partial regression  in patients who received ilixadencel in conjunction with second  or third line of standard TKIs   This could be an indication that ilixadencel helped to overcome the resistance to TKIs in these patients  but since the patient sample was small  efficacy claims would need to be investigated in a larger population  As with other trials Immunicum has done  the benefit of this study is the fact that ilixadencel will gather data in multiple tumours and more proof of mechanism of action can be accumulated  specific tumour immune response  tumour infiltration   Further details from the study will be published in a peer reviewed journal 
Ongoing R D programme
Phase Ib II ILIAD study
The ILIAD study is an open label  multi centre  Phase Ib II study in 21 and up to 150 patients  respectively  to evaluate ilixadencel when injected intratumourally in combination with CPIs  The study started enrolling patients in January 2019 and will be carried out in two parts 
The Phase Ib part will enrol a total of 21 patients in a staggered format  Exhibit 6   It will assess safety and define optimal dosing in combination with Keytruda 

The Phase II part will enrol up to 150 patients who will be grouped by indication  NSCLC  H N cancer and gastric adenocarcinoma  into three arms advancing in parallel  Each of the arms is expected to be sufficiently powered to detect clinical efficacy  Futility analyses are also included in the design 
In November 2018  Immunicum announced a collaboration and supply agreement with Merck KGaA and Pfizer  which will supply their jointly developed checkpoint inhibitor avelumab  Bavencio  anti PD L1  to Immunicum for the Phase II part of the study at no cost  costs can be substantial in the market   Immunicum will sponsor the study and retain all commercial rights to ilixadencel  Avelumab will be used to treat patients with H N cancer and gastric cancer  NSCLC patients will receive Keytruda  Although the involvement of Merck KGaA and Pfizer appears to be limited to supply only at the moment  we believe it provides a degree of external validation of the technology and rationale behind ilixadencel  as we assume that the partners conducted due diligence before committing to supply avelumab for free 
The importance of the ILIAD trial is that it will be the first study to test ilixadencel in combination with CPIs  As well as safety and efficacy data  it is also designed to gather data to demonstrate the proof of mechanism of action by showing that ilixadencel generates a systemic tumour specific immune response 
Phase II MERECA study
Patient enrolment for the Phase II MERECA study  n 88  with newly diagnosed  metastatic RCC patients completed in early 2018  The patients in the active arm were treated with ilixadencel  subsequently underwent nephrectomy  removal of the kidney  and received the tyrosine kinase inhibitor  TKI  Sutent  sunitinib  Pfizer   Patients in the comparator arm received only Sutent after nephrectomy  This is the most advanced trial in the R D pipeline and should deliver pertinent efficacy data  The primary endpoints of the study are the hard clinical endpoints of median overall survival and median survival after 18 months  in addition to other safety and efficacy endpoints  Like the ILIAD trial  intratumoural infiltration of CD8  T cells will also be measured  Top line results are expected in Q319 

Path forward  Combination with CPIs is likely key focus
The current cash position should finance operations until the end of 2021  Several milestones are achievable within this period  Phase II MERECA trial top line results in Q319  initial safety data from the Phase Ib of ILIAD trial around end 2019 and then full safety and efficacy data from the Phase Ib of ILIAD trial in 2020  Although controlled efficacy data from the Phase II of ILIAD trial are not likely until 2022  safety data from the Phase Ib part of the trial are key  as this will be the first time ilixadencel is combined with a CPI  CPIs have well established safety issues  which limit combination potential  ie two CPIs can be more effective  but also increase toxicity  Therefore  when it comes to CPI and other anti cancer therapy combinations  safety is as important as efficacy  From this perspective  immune primers tend to have benign safety profiles  so should combine with CPIs well  Specifically  ilixadencel s safety data have so far been very good 
By the time the safety results from the Phase I part of the ILIAD trial are known  expected in 2020   Immunicum will have data from the MERECA  liver cancer and GIST trials  This will also include the all important tumour infiltration and tumour specific systemic immune response results  If positive  these findings would demonstrate proof of concept of ilixadencel s mechanism of action of and we believe Immunicum would be in a strong position to reach a partnership deal without waiting for efficacy data from the ILIAD trial 
We believe that details of the pivotal trials and specific indications will be clarified in conjunction with potential partners  according to their priorities  Immunicum s current strategy is to gather as much proof of concept data in as many indications as possible with the aim of attracting the attention of potential partners 
We also believe that CPIs will be the most likely combination partner drug  In addition  given good safety profile of ilixadencel  there is potential to use it in combination with more than one other anti cancer drug  novel or established   in our view  as long as the cumulative toxicity is manageable  This is not unlike the classic chemotherapy regimens  which routinely combine anywhere from two to four and more drugs 
Historically  ilixadencel was tested in combination with targeted therapies  which made sense at that time  as it was the best standard of care  The advent of CPIs meant that  despite the side effect profile and non responder issue  the standard of care is changing  For example  in February 2019  Merck reported data from its pivotal KEYNOTE 426 trial  n 862   which showed that Keytruda in combination with Inlyta  VEGF targeted TKI axitinib  Pfizer  was more effective than standalone Sutent in extending both overall and progression free survival in first line metastatic RCC  primarily in patients that did not have metastases at diagnosis of the primary tumour  This combination is now expected to become the standard of care in this broader setting  which have a more favourable prognosis than the patients included in the MERECA study  which only included patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis of the primary tumour  intermediate or poor prognosis   In primary liver cancer  Nexavar  sorafenib  has been the standard of care for a decade  In 2017  the FDA approved Opdivo  nivolumab  for second line treatment of patients with HCC  based only on a Phase I II clinical trial  Bristol Myers Squibb has conducted a large Phase III trial CheckMate 459  which tested Opdivo as first line treatment in advanced HCC  but the results reported on 24 June 2019 showed that the overall survival endpoint did not reach statistical significance in this setting 
These developments demonstrate the importance of the ILIAD trial in Immunicum s R D programme  as ILIAD will be the first study to combine ilixadencel with CPIs  Even though the upcoming pivotal trials will have to accommodate the changing standard of care  accumulated data from the MERECA and liver cancer trials will be valuable in partnering discussions for the reasons discussed above 
Competitive landscape
So far  Dendreon s Provenge  dendritic cell vaccine  approved in 2010  and Amgen s Imlygic  oncolytic virus  approved in 2015  are the only approved cancer vaccines although there is no lack of research being conducted in this area  However  the relative lack of more successful examples could be explained by variability in the design of the vaccine  the selection of antigens and understanding of the inhibitory tumour microenvironment  In addition  an increasing number of third party studies are supporting the idea that the backbone strategy of immuno oncology should be in combination treatments exploiting different steps in the immunity cycle  Schlom and Gulley  2018  

Immunotherapy approaches that have been tried so far can be grouped into several categories based on which antigens are exposed to immune system and how the vaccines are manufactured  Exhibit 8  
 Off the shelf  vaccines based on tumour associated antigens  These vaccines contain tumour associated self antigens  typically in the form of synthetic long peptides  and are not based on the patient s own tumour  Compared to personalised vaccines they can be easier to manufacture  store and ship  However  the identification of suitable neoantigens that are conserved and expressed in the majority of patients is a significant challenge  especially due to patient to patient  and even intratumoural  variation 
Personalised cancer neoantigen vaccines  These are developed from the patient s own tissues and contain patient specific neoantigens  DCs can be isolated from the patient and modified ex vivo to express neoantigens from the patient s own tumour and administered back to the patient  Although apparently solving the problem of neoantigen variation between patients  the procedures can be complicated  expensive  time consuming and can expose the patient to infection 
 Off the shelf  personalised cancer neoantigen vaccines  These are immune primers that become personalised vaccines when injected into the patient s tumour  These vaccines offer a potential compromise between the first two approaches  They are personalised in that they exploit the patient s own tumour neoantigen release by inducing tumour cell death  and are also off the shelf  Ilixadencel falls into this category  as do oncolytic virus vaccines  eg Amgen s Imlygic  
Provenge  Dendreon Sanpower  contains a prostate specific antigen  which is a tumour associated self antigen  rather than a neoantigen  and has not been commercially successful  Because autologous DCs are used as the primer adjuvant  this concept does not easily fit into any of the three groups here  and  furthermore  is unrelated to Immunicum s DC technology 
Looking at the R D landscape  there are ongoing attempts to develop various approaches that would fall into all the above categories  Products that would fall into ilixadencel s category include oncolytic viruses  STING pathway activator and Toll like receptor  TRL  agonists  Imlygic  the oncolytic virus from Amgen  is the only marketed for several solid tumours  melanoma and prostate  respectively   Transgene s oncolytic virus Pexa Vec is in Phase III for HCC in combination with sorafenib  Viralytics  oncolytic virus Cavatak is in Phase I for NSCLC in combination with the CPI pembrolizumab 


Sensitivities
Ilixadencel has yet to reach a definitive proof of concept clinical stage  so is subject to significant R D risk  as is typical for a company at this stage  The clinical programmes are all testing the same therapy  therefore the investment case relies on the success of ilixadencel  CT or ultrasound is required to guide the injection to the viable part of the tumour  The administration procedure is unlikely to be too difficult for physicians to perform since intratumourally injected products are already marketed  However  some tumours will be more difficult to access than others  and some may be inaccessible  This may affect market uptake  but given ilixadencel can be used in many solid tumours  the overall potential is still high  In addition  ilixadencel can be injected in distant metastases  which could be easier to reach than the primary tumour  By the time ilixadencel is launched  the treatment landscape and  standard treatments  are likely to have developed  Ilixadencel is already being positioned as an addition to combination therapies  so potential changes in clinical practice are not necessarily prohibitive for ilixadencel combination development  The new trial  ILIAD  is exploring ilixadencel combinations with CPIs

149269,370785,AMGN,Roche s Tecentriq Gets CHMP Recommendation For Breast Cancer,opinion,"Roche   OTC RHHBY   announced that the European Medicines Agency s  EMA  Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  has recommended the approval of immuno oncology drug  Tecentriq  for yet another indication 
The CHMP recommended approval of Tecentriq in combination with Celgene Corporation s   NASDAQ CELG   Abraxane for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable  locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer  TNBC   whose tumours have PD L1 expression    1   and who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease 
The recommendation is based on data from the phase III IMpassion130 study  wherein Tecentriq plus nab paclitaxel significantly reduced the risk of disease worsening or death by 38  compared with nab paclitaxel alone in patients who tested positive for PD L1 expression on tumour infiltrating immune cells  IC   The study will continue until the next planned analysis 
The European Commission generally takes the CHMP recommendation in consideration but is not bound by it  A decision from the commission is expected soon 
Roche has a strong presence in the oncology market  In particular  the company dominates the breast cancer space with strong demand for its HER2 franchise drugs  The HER2 franchise includes Herceptin  Perjeta and Kadcyla  Growth in Herceptin is being driven by increasing demand in the United States and Europe  A potential approval of Tecentriq for this indication will further boost the company s franchise 
In March 2019  the FDA approved the drug for the same indication 
We remind investors that Tecentriq is approved in the United States  EU and or countries  either alone or in combination with targeted therapies and or chemotherapies in various forms of non small cell and small cell lung cancer  certain types of metastatic urothelial cancer  and PD L1 positive triple negative breast cancer 
Tecentriq sales came in at CHF336 million in the first quarter of 2019  up 135  from the year ago quarter  Label expansion of the drug for other indications should further boost sales 
Currently  Roche has seven ongoing phase III studies evaluating the drug in TNBC  including early and advanced stages of the disease 
Roche s stock has gained 14  in the past six months compared with the s growth of 3 2  

 
Approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing drugs bode well for the company and should offset the adverse impact of biosimilar competition for some of its key drugs such as Avastin  Rituxan and Herceptin from the likes of Novartis   NYSE NVS   and Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN

149292,370808,AMGN,Roche Reports Positive Data On Rituxan For Pemphigus Vulgaris,opinion,"Roche   OTC RHHBY   announced positive top line results from the late stage study  PEMPHIX 
The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of MabThera Rituxan  rituximab  compared to mycophenolate mofetil  MMF  in adults with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris  PV  
The primary endpoint was the percentage of participants who achieved sustained complete remission off corticosteroid therapy  no disease activity  as evaluated by Pemphigus Disease Area Index  without the use of steroids for 16 consecutive weeks or more  at week 52  The study met the primary endpoint and demonstrated MabThera to be superior to MMF in achieving sustained complete remission

dismal run toward the end of 2018 A key announcement was Bristol Myers    NYSE BMY   offer to buy Celgene   NASDAQ CELG   for  74 billion  one of the biggest mergers in the industry  Other important acquisition announcements include Lilly s   NYSE LLY   purchase of small cancer biotech  Loxo Oncology  and Merck s   NYSE MRK   acquisition of Immune Design and pending acquisitions of small private cancer biotechs  Peloton Therapeutics and Tilos Therapeutics  Roche   OTC RHHBY   is also due to acquire Spark Therapeutics for  4 8 billion  per a deal announced in February The Zacks industry  comprising some of the biggest drugmakers in the world  has gained 1 9  in 2019 so far  Moreover  the industry features in the top 15  of the 255 Zacks ranked industries   We believe that new product sales ramp up as a result of rising demand  driven by growth in ageing population  successful innovation and product line extensions in important therapeutic areas  strong clinical study results  and frequent FDA approvals  12 new drugs approved so far in 2019   helped the big drug giants to do well this year despite broader macro issues or the industry s own challenges  The industry is likely to perform well even if the global economy slows down this year  as is widely expected  This is because it is a defensive sector  which is almost insulated from broader macroeconomic factors Meanwhile  most big pharma companies are resorting to restructuring activities  which is increasing their financial capacity  The funds can be used to re stock pipelines with promising new drug candidates bought from smaller innovative drug biotech companies However  the sector faces its share of headwinds like government scrutiny of high drug prices  pricing and competitive pressure  generic competition for blockbuster treatments  slowdown in sales of some of the most high profile older drugs and most importantly major pipeline setbacks Nonetheless  we believe pipeline success  cost cutting  share buybacks  product launches  increased M A and collaboration activity and appropriate utilization of cash should keep the sector afloat through the rest of this year In this scenario  investing in stocks with a large market cap is a prudent move  given the fact that they control a large portion of the industry Here we have highlighted three bigshot drugmakers  which may prove to be good buys  All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and have seen share price rally in the past year and positive estimate revisions in the past 60 days You can see  A chart showing the share price movement

2020 have gone up 1 7  and 0 6   respectively in the past 60 days Like 2018  a significant part of Merck s outperformance this year so far has been driven by strong performance and positive regulatory updates related to its PD 1 inhibitor  Keytruda In addition to Keytruda  Merck s other new products  Lynparza  and Bridion are contributing meaningfully to its top line  Merck has also been on a strong footing in terms of collaborations and M A activity  This year  Merck bought small cancer focused biotech  Immune Design and privately held Europe s animal health technology provider  Antelliq Group  Merck also announced definitive agreements to buy small private cancer biotechs  Peloton Therapeutic and Tilos Therapeutics Meanwhile  Merck s animal health and vaccine products are also performing strongly and remain core growth drivers  Also  Merck can gain approval for two new products this year  a vaccine for Ebola Zaire  V920 and an anti bacterial medicine  MK 7655A  which is a fixed combination of relebactam with imipenem cilastatin Roche Roche s earnings estimates have increased 2 1  for 2019 and 1 3  for 2020 over the past 60 days  The company s shares have increased 28 7

Hemlibra this year  These approvals have expanded the eligible patient population for these drugs  mainly Tecentriq  which can drive sales of Roche higher in the future quarters Moreover  the acquisition of Spark will enable Roche to have a foothold in the promising gene therapy space as it faces stiff competition from biosimilars for key drugs such as Avastin  Rituxan and Herceptin from

strengthening its pipeline as well as oncology portfolio  Pfizer looks well positioned to deliver several potential new breakthrough innovative medicines in the next five years  which can drive long term growth In oncology  Pfizer gained FDA approval for four innovative medicines  Daurismo  Lorbrena  Vizimpro and Talzenna  in the last four months of 2018  which can boost its oncology sales in

combo in both non squamous and squamous NSCLC Several regulatory decisions for new indications in the United States as well as in Europe are pending in 2019  If approved  the drugs can further boost sales  Earlier this week  Keytruda was approved by the FDA for first line treatment of recurrent or metastatic HNSCC while another FDA decision is expected this month for label expansion of Keytruda for previously treated advanced small cell lung cancer  SCLC The Keytruda development program is also progressing well and the drug is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 1000

149337,370853,AMGN,Merck  MRK  Up This Year So Far  Will The Momentum Continue ,opinion,"Merck   Co   Inc    NYSE MRK   shares have performed well this year so far   Merck s shares have risen 6 2  this year so far compared with the  s increase of 0 7  
 

 
Earnings estimates for 2019 and 2020 have risen 1 5  and 0 6   respectively  over the past 60 days 
What s Behind the Rally 
Like 2018  a significant part of Merck s outperformance this year so far has been driven by strong performance and positive regulatory updates related to its PD 1 inhibitor  Keytruda  In a short span of time  Keytruda has become Merck s biggest product  It is already approved for use in 15 indications across 10 different tumor types in the United States 
Keytruda  the largest product in Merck s portfolio  generated sales of  2 27 billion in the first quarter of 2019  up around 5 6  sequentially and 55  year over year  Sales were driven by the launch of indications globally  Keytruda sales are gaining particularly from strong momentum in first line lung cancer indication both as monotherapy and with the rollout of the chemo combo in both non squamous and squamous NSCLC 
Following approval to include data from KEYNOTE 407 study in October 2018  the company witnessed strong uptake in squamous non small cell lung cancer in the United States in the past two quarters  In March  European Commission granted marketing approval to Keytruda for the same indication  In fact  in the first quarter  Keytruda was approved by the FDA as an adjuvant therapy for high risk stage III melanoma and for five new cancer line extensions in Japan 
In April  the FDA gave approval to Keytruda in combination with Pfizer s   NYSE PFE   Inlyta for the first line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma  RCC  as well as for an expanded first line lung cancer patient population  All these label expansion approvals should drive sales of Keytruda higher in future quarters of 2019 
The Keytruda development program is also progressing well and the drug is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 1000 studies  including more than 600 combination studies  Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN    Incyte  NASDAQ INCY   Glaxo  and Pfizer separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens 
Several regulatory decisions for new indications in the United States as well as in Europe are pending in 2019  which  if approved  can further boost sales of Keytruda  In June  FDA decisions are expected on regulatory applications looking for label expansion of Keytruda for previously treated advanced small cell lung cancer  SCLC  and first line treatment of recurrent or metastatic HNSCC 
Other than that  in April  Merck and partner AstraZeneca s   NYSE AZN   Lynparza gained approval in Europe as a monotherapy for the treatment of certain adult patients with advanced breast cancer  Merck also announced positive data from several late stage studies this year  mainly evaluating Keytruda for further line extensions in 2019 so far 
Merck has also been on a strong footing was far as collaborations and M A activity is concerned  In the year  Merck bought small cancer focused biotech  Immune Design and privately held Europe s animal health technology provider  Antelliq Group  This month  Merck also announced a definitive agreement to buy small private cancer biotech  Peloton Therapeutics for an upfront payment of  1 05 billion in cash  The acquisition will add Peloton s novel late stage renal cell carcinoma  RCC  candidate  PT2977 to Merck s oncology pipeline 
Conclusion
Merck  which carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   has its share of challenges in the form of generic competition for several drugs  pricing pressure and rising competitive pressure on the diabetes franchise and on products like Isentress  HIV   Zepatier  HCV  and Zostavax  vaccine 
Nonetheless  going forward  new products like Keytruda  Lynparza  and Bridion should continue to contribute meaningfully to the top line  Animal health and vaccine products are also performing strongly and remain core growth drivers for Merck 
Also  Merck can gain approval for two new products this year  a vaccine for Ebola Zaire  V920 and an anti bacterial medicine  MK 7655A which is a fixed combination of relebactam with imipenem cilastatin  Meanwhile  Merck will also continue to focus on cost cutting initiatives  which should drive its bottom line

149338,370854,AMGN,Amgen  AMGN  Down 4  Since Last Earnings Report  Can It Rebound ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Amgen  AMGN   Shares have lost about 4  in that time frame  outperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Amgen due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Amgen Q1 Earnings Top  Sales Hurt by Pricing PressureAmgen reported first quarter 2019 earnings of  3 56 per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 45  Earnings increased 3  year over year helped by a lower share count as sales were weak in the quarter Total revenues of  5 56 billion in the quarter were almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and flat year over year Quarter in DetailTotal product revenues decreased 1  from the year ago quarter to  5 29 billion  U S    3 99 billion  ex U S    1 30 billion  as increasing demand for newer products like Prolia was offset by the erosion of mature brands from biosimilar competition  Product sales growth was mostly driven by higher volumes as pricing pressure hurt sales of several drugs  mainly Repatha and Aimovig Other revenues of  271 million rose 28 4  in the quarter driven by royalty income growth Prolia revenues came in at  592 million  up 20  from the year ago quarter  attributable to 17  volume growth resulting from higher demand  However  a seasonal sales pattern with first quarter sales being lower than second quarter due to a six month dosing interval hurt Prolia sales to an extent in the quarter Xgeva delivered revenues of  471 million  up 6  from the year ago quarter mainly due to higher demand  which drove volumes Kyprolis recorded sales of  245 million  up 10  year over year driven primarily by growth in key markets including the United States Blincyto sales increased 41  from the year ago period to  69 million  reflecting rise in demand Repatha generated revenues of  141 million  up 15  year over year  as higher unit demand was offset by lower prices  Repatha volumes grew 81  globally and 90  in the United States Sales of Repatha have suffered since launch due to payer restrictions  Despite Amgen s efforts to improve access to Repatha  patients face significant hurdles due to high co pay expenses  In response  Amgen announced a cut in the U S  list price of Repatha by 60  to improve access and affordability of Repatha Vectibix revenues came in at  170 million  up 1  year over year  Nplate sales rose 6  to  189 million Parsabiv  launched in several markets including United States 2018  recorded sales of  126 million in the first quarter  higher than  120 million in the previous quarter driven by higher demand Aimovig recorded sales of  59 million in the quarter  less than  95 million in the previous quarter as discounts and rebates offered to improve coverage led to lower selling price of the drug On the call  the company said that approximately 200 000 new patients in the United States have tried Aimovig since launch  suggesting that there remains growth potential  Aimovig has captured 60  market share in total scripts and 40  of new to brand prescriptions Amgen recorded biosimilar revenues of  55 million in the quarter  entirely from international markets versus  34 million in the previous quarter  On the call  the company said that Kanjinti and Amgevita are off to a strong start in Europe  explaining the higher biosimilars revenues in the quarter  Amgen expects more biosimilars to gain approval this year with biosimilars making important contribution to total revenues  especially as drug pricing issues increase demand for lower cost treatment options However  Amgen s mature drugs like Enbrel  Aranesp  Epogen  Neupogen and Neulasta are facing an array of branded and generic competitors Aranesp revenues declined 9  from the prior year quarter to  414 million on lower demand primarily due to increased competitive pressure Revenues of the other ESA  Epogen  declined 10  to  219 million due to lower selling prices as the category has become extremely competitive  Sales in the quarter benefited from approximately  20 million of large end customer purchases  Pfizer s Retacrit  the first biosimilar version of Epogen  was launched in November 2018  Biosimilar competition coupled with Amgen s contractual pricing commitments with DaVita is expected to hurt Epogen s price significantly in 2019Neulasta revenues declined 12  from the year ago period to  1 02 billion due to lower selling prices and inventory changes Two companies  Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  and Coherus launched biosimilars of Neulasta in the United States in mid  2018 early 2019 while three long acting biosimilar competitors were launched in the EU  which are hurting sales of Neulasta  More biosimilars are expected to be launched in 2019  which will put further pressure on Neulasta sales Also  increased competition from PD 1s and other new cancer therapies are hurting demand for the class of medicines to which Neulasta belongs  However  the Neulasta Onpro kit  on body injector  continues to perform well  commanding a market share of more than 60  in the United States for all Neulasta sales Neupogen recorded 29  decline in sales to  73 million in the first quarter due to biosimilar competition in the United States  which hurt demand and prices Enbrel delivered revenues of  1 15 billion  up 4  from the year ago driven primarily by favorable changes in accounting estimates along with a slight price increase  which offset the unfavorable impact of changes in inventory  On the call  Amgen said that the slight benefit in pricing should persist through the rest of the year Sensipar Mimpara revenues declined 57  to  213 million  Though Sensipar lost patent exclusivity in March 2018  Amgen was keeping generic competition at bay  However  recently some generic drugmakers launched small molecule generic versions  at risk   which hurt Sensipar sales significantly in the first quarter  In the second quarter  U S  sales of Sensipar are expected to be lower than Q1 levels Other product sales rose 24  to  78 million Operating Margins DecreaseAdjusted operating margin declined 450 basis points  bps  to 52 4  due to higher operating costs SG A spend increased 5  to  1 15 billion on higher investments to support new products including Aimovig  Evenity  Amgevita and Kanjinti  R D expenses rose 16  year over year to  859 million due to higher spending on the early stage oncology pipeline Adjusted tax rate was 14 6  for the quarter  a 0 9 points increase from the year ago quarter Amgen repurchased 15 9 million shares worth  3 0 billion in the first quarter and has  2 1 billion remaining under its stock repurchase authorization 2019 GuidanceAmgen raised the lower end of its previously issued sales and earnings guidance for 2019  The company expects revenues in the range of  22 0  22 9 billion versus  21 8  22 9 billion previously  Adjusted earnings per share are anticipated in the range of  13 25    14 30 versus  13 10  14 30 expected previously Amgen believes that higher sales of newer products should make up for uncertainty surrounding timing and intensity of generic competition to Sensipar and biosimilar competition to Neulasta and continued competitive dynamics for Enbrel and other mature products will create pressure on the top line in 2019   However  recently launched products including Aimovig  Repatha and biosimilars and international expansion provide incremental growth opportunities Operating costs in 2019 are expected to be flat to down from 2018 on an absolute basis  R D costs are expected to rise in a single digit percentage terms in 2019  However  SG A expenses are expected to decline as launch expenses normalize Adjusted tax rate is estimated at approximately 14 Amgen

for a variety of cancers The five day long ASCO conference  which is basically the most important annual cancer research event  held in Chicago concluded on Tuesday  The conference featured clinical updates from several companies about the latest developments in treating the disease  Cancer research is definitely an exciting area and one that investors will keep a close watch on in the coming years  This is because the disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality across the world preceded only by heart disease Though this year s event was labelled by many as unusually quiet as far as big drug biotech companies are concerned  still  a lot of impactful data was presented Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN   presented  for AMG 510  its novel investigational KRAS inhibitor for solid tumor  In the phase I study  AMG 510  when given as a monotherapy  showed encouraging anti tumor activity in patients with locally advanced or metastatic KRASG12C mutant solid tumors KRAS gene has been a target of active exploration in cancer research and is particularly common in solid tumors  Amgen believes that AMG 510 has the potential to be developed into a successful targeted therapy to treat patients with the KRASG12C mutation due to its high selectivity for this mutation  Amgen also presented data from an early stage study of AMG 420  a bispecific T cell engager  BiTE  molecule

previously treated lung cancer patients  Historically  the five year survival rate in advanced lung cancer patients in the United States has been around 5   Keytruda s five year survival rates thus represent a huge improvement over these historical rates Meanwhile  follow up lung cancer data from the KEYNOTE 189 study showed that Keytruda in combination with Lilly s Alimta  pemetrexed  and platinum chemotherapy reduced the risk of death by 44  compared with chemotherapy alone as a first line treatment option for metastatic non squamous non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  in patients with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations Bristol Myers presented data from on Opdivo  at ASCO including the longest follow up data for the Opdivo plus Yervoy combination in advanced melanoma patients   A five year analysis of the phase I CA209 004 study showed that overall survival  OS  rates were stable at 57  in the Opdivo plus Yervoy arm  with a median follow up of 43 1 months in all patients  at four years or longer  Moreover  data presented from multiple analyses of CheckMate   067 study demonstrated that quality of life was maintained throughout the course of Opdivo plus Yervoy treatment

149361,370877,AMGN,Insight  Big Pharma faces up to new price pressure from aggressive insurers,news,By Deena Beasley and Caroline Humer SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    The world s biggest drugmakers face a new reality when it comes to U S  pricing for their products as insurers use aggressive tactics to extract steep price discounts  even for the newest medications  Big Pharma executives acknowledged the depth of change this week during public presentations and interviews with Reuters at the J P  Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco  Drugmakers have long relied on their ability to charge whatever they deemed appropriate in the U S   the world s most expensive healthcare system   Industry advocates have defended those U S  prices in the past as a way to recoup the billions of dollars spent on experimental drugs that fail and to offset discounts offered overseas   There has definitely been increased price competition     if a product is viewed as a commodity   Derica Rice  chief financial officer at Eli Lilly   Co  said in an interview   Our goal is clinical differentiation   Pascal Soriot  chief executive of AstraZeneca Plc  warned investors that the pressure exerted by health insurers has expanded from medicines used to treat common maladies to the specialized fields  like cancer  where drugmakers have been able to charge their highest prices   Payers will try to leverage their strengths to try and get pricing concessions because those agents are very expensive   Soriot said  Many say the tide shifted with a campaign by insurers and pharmacy benefits companies against Gilead Sciences Inc s  84 000 hepatitis C treatment Sovaldi  The drug represented the first effective cure for hepatitis C and quickly raked in billions of dollars in sales within its first few months on the market in 2014  Sovaldi s cost is based on a 12 week treatment regime and amounts to  1 000 a pill  By contrast  the treatment costs about  57 000 in the U K  As soon as U S  regulators approved Sovaldi s competitor  a treatment from AbbVie Inc  last month  the country s largest pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Co dropped reimbursement for the Gilead drug   Express Scripts said it had received a substantial discount from AbbVie  a departure from industry practice of pricing new competing drugs close to the incumbent for as long as possible  It didn t say how much the discount was  Express Scripts said this week it sought similar opportunities for discounts in new cancer medications  and was looking closely at a new class of cholesterol fighting drugs aimed at millions of patients who can t tolerate or get enough benefit from widely used statins   Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc are two of the companies racing to bring the new cholesterol treatments  which target a protein called PCSK9  to market   It s not a worry  It s a reality that we will deal with   Regeneron CEO Len Schleifer said of Express Scripts  goals   I think there will be fair pricing and healthy competition in the marketplace     A LESS CROWDED FIELD     When pressed on how they could counter the growing pressure from insurers  large drugmakers say they are relying on strategies long employed in the marketplace  focusing research on diseases that don t have adequate treatments and finding ways to differentiate their products from competitors in terms of effectiveness and convenience  But some industry experts believe they will have to become far more selective even when entering a new treatment area  The hepatitis C example shows how insurers have been able to play just two competitors off one another to wrest a discount    Gilead Chief Operating Officer John Milligan said that in recent weeks  more health plans are asking the company to drop its hepatitis C drug price more in line with AbbVie in order to keep both drugs on their reimbursement lists   Payers are starting to move beyond hand wringing to real action   said Glen Giovannetti  head of global life sciences at Ernst   Young   We are starting to see  pharmaceutical  companies deciding which therapeutic options they want to compete in   Nils Behnke  a partner with Bain   Co s global healthcare and strategy practices  noted that even for the most new promising classes of medications  there are often three or four companies pursuing similar development programs    Companies that were heavily into specialty indications thought they were immune  but it is now clear that they are not   he said Merck   Co CEO Kenneth Frazier acknowledged that U S  prices for diabetes drugs remain under pressure   We need to identify a value proposition     show that over time we can reduce costs   he said in an interview  Smaller biotech Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc said it is already taking into account potential competition when deciding which research programs to pursue  CEO Stanley Crooke said the company abandoned its PCSK9 program when it became clear the drug would reach the market only after several others   We are working on diseases for which there are no real treatments    Parkinson s  Alzheimer s  ALS   said George Scangos  CEO at Biogen Idec   In the future  we will see more correlation between value that drugs deliver and the way they are reimbursed

149367,370883,AMGN,Radius  RDUS  Posts Narrower Q1 Loss  Misses On Revenues ,opinion,"Radius Health  Inc    NASDAQ RDUS   reported mixed results for the first quarter of 2019  wherein loss was narrower than expected but sales missed estimates 
The company incurred a loss of 94 cents per share in the quarter  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 95 cents and the year ago loss of  1 11  The year over year improvement was backed by an increase in revenues 
The company reported Tymlos  sales of  29 8 million  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  34 8 million 
Quarter in Detail
We remind investors that Radius Health obtained the FDA approval for Tymlos  abaloparatide  injection in April 2017 for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture  The company began shipments of the drug to wholesalers at the end of May 2017 
Hence  revenues recorded in the year ago quarter were  14 6 million only  Tymlos U S  net sales were negatively impacted by anabolic market seasonality that showed lower volumes in the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2018  higher gross to net expenses due to the impact of the Medicare Part D coverage gap on manufacturers and increased support for commercial patient deductibles 
Tymlos captured  on average  30  of the U S  anabolic osteoporosis market  based on Patient Months on Therapy  TRx PMOT  in the first quarter of 2019 and 42  of new anabolic patient starts  At the end of the first quarter of 2019  the drug was covered for approximately 283 million U S  insured lives  representing approximately 99  of U S  commercial  67  of Medicare and 97  Medicaid Other insured lives  Growth in new scripts in the commercial business was also strong  with a 17  increase from the fourth quarter of 2018 
Research and development expenses for the reported quarter were  23 3 million  up 1 7  year over year due to increases in elacestrant project costs and abaloparatide patch project costs  General and administrative expenses decreased 14  to  41 2 million 
Pipeline Updates
The pipeline includes abaloparatide injection for potential use in the treatment of men with osteoporosis  abaloparatide patch for potential use in osteoporosis  and elacestrant  RAD1901  for potential use in hormone receptor positive breast cancer 
Radius Health presented a post hoc subset analysis on postmenopausal osteoporosis patients with type 2 diabetes from the phase III ACTIVExtend Study at the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists conference in April 2019  The ACTIVE Study cohort included patients with Type 2 diabetes  The data from the study showed that use of abaloparatide SC for 18 months led to significant improvement in lumbar spine TBS  trabecular bone score  and suggested that abaloparatide SC improved bone microarchitecture 
As the incidence of both type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis increase with age  they frequently coexist and represent a high unmet medical need population with a lower diagnosis rate for osteoporosis  compromised bone quality and higher fracture risk 
The company is developing two formulations   abaloparatide Subcutaneous  SC  and abaloparatide transdermal patch  Radius Health is on track with its preparations for the phase III trial on abaloparatide patch and expects to start the study in August 2019 
2019 Sales Guidance Updated
Radius Health expects Tymlos net revenues to be  160  175 million  previous guidance was  155  175 million in 2019  
Our Take
The narrower than expected loss in the first quarter was encouraging 
The company s sales surpassed expectation in the first quarter of 2019 as Tymlos continued to gain traction 
Tymlos market share increased in April  with a 34  share of the U S  anabolic osteoporosis market and more than 44  of new anabolic patient starts 
Shares of Radius Health have gained 28 2  in the year so far  outperforming the  s growth of 8 7  

 
During the second half of 2019  Radius Health expects the drug to become the NBRx anabolic market leader by reaching more than 50  of new patient starts 
Although the osteoporosis market in the United Sates has great potential  Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly   Co s   NYSE LLY   Forteo and Amgen s   NASDAQ AMGN   Prolia

149377,370893,AMGN,Pricing is key for new heart drugs challenging cheap generics,news,"By Ben Hirschler BARCELONA  Reuters    Doctors looking at highly encouraging clinical trial results for new heart drugs at the world s largest cardiology meeting this week are missing one piece of data that will be critical to their success   the price 
While new treatments on show in Barcelona are certainly moving cardiovascular medicine forward after a series of setbacks in recent years  cardiologists say that cost will be key in determining how widely they are used 
 We are entering a new era of treatment and  of course  it will cost a lot of money  which is a problem   said Michel Bertrand  emeritus professor at the University of Lille and a past president of the European Society of Cardiology  ESC  
Hopes have spiked for a heart failure drug from Novartis and an innovative class of injectable anti cholesterol agents known as PCSK9 inhibitors after the release of data at the ESC s annual meeting indicated that they can save more lives than standard therapies 
The pharmaceuticals industry  however  faces a challenge because the new drugs are designed to replace or supplement a range of older medicines that have lost patent protection and are now widely available as bargain basement generics 
Novartis s new heart failure drug LCZ696  for example  was tested in a pivotal trial against enalapril  a generic drug in the so called ACE inhibitor class  a month s supply of which can be bought at Wal Mart stores for only  4 
The Swiss company has yet to say what it will charge for LCZ696  but based on the cost of recently launched drugs such as Bayer and Johnson   Johnson s anticoagulant Xarelto  analysts expect between  7 and  8 a day   or about  225 a month   with a lower price in Europe 
LARGE MARKET
It would be a big price for a big population   heart failure affects about 26 million people across the United States and Europe   and analysts have forecast peak annual sales of  5 billion plus 
Doctors  too  are keen that insurers and governments should see beyond the upfront cost to the long term benefits 
 Unfortunately  many insurance companies focus strictly on the cost of the pill   Elliott Antman  professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and president of the American Heart Association  told Reuters 
 But if we only look at the per pill cost we have blinders on  We have to think about the impact on the health delivery system overall   and if a more expensive new drug reduces symptoms to the extent that patients aren t hospitalized as much  then that has enormous economic impact  
That chimes with the message from Novartis pharmaceuticals head David Epstein  who argues that the cost of a generic  is not the way to think about this product  
Still  with LCZ696 now in a position to replace an array of cheap medicines that have been the mainstay of heart failure treatment for more than 20 years  many cardiologists expect inevitable delays as healthcare providers haggle over access 
 A lot of payers will probably initially deny this because of costs   said Alfred Bove  emeritus professor at Temple University   Normally it takes about two years for something like this to get ingrained into routine care  
COST EFFECTIVENESS CHALLENGE
While LCZ696 may involve wholesale switching of treatment  the emerging class of PCSK9 agents present a different cost effectiveness challenge 
They are designed to complement existing drugs  such as statins  and are likely to cost about twice as much as LCZ696 because they are complex biotech products that have to be injected  according to industry analysts 
Sanofi  working with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  is racing Amgen to bring the first PCSK9 drug to market in 2015  with Pfizer lagging slightly behind 
Once again the data is looking good  but in this case cardiologists expect uptake to be much more targeted  initially focused on people with a rare familial condition that raises their cholesterol dangerously  as well as high risk and statin intolerant patients 
 I think doctors will be quite cautious and I would expect a very stratified approach   said the University of Edinburgh s Keith Fox  who chairs the ESC s congress program committee   I don t see these drugs going out in the same broad way as statins  
However  this high risk group alone totals about 21 million in the United States and Europe  Sanofi estimates  pointing to a multibillion dollar sales opportunity 
For cardiologists  the expected launch next year of two important types of treatment is a breath of fresh air  Heart medicine has recently been eclipsed by advances in oncology  with U S  regulators approving five new cancer drugs this year against only one for cardiovascular conditions 
What is more  some heart drugs launched in recent years have not been used as widely as initially hoped  including AstraZeneca s Brilinta and Pfizer and Bristol Myers Squibb s Eliquis  a rival to Xarelto 
These drugs  however  did not offer the innovative mechanisms used with LCZ696 or PCSK9  which Freek Verheugt  of the Rotterdam Thorax Center  says should make a difference when the success stories from Barcelona finally reach patients 

 A brand new thing that saves lives should be adopted quickly   he said

The world s largest biotechnology company recorded a  376 million charge related to restructuring moves announced July 29 and expects to take another charge of up to  150 million in the fourth quarter  as well as additional charges next year 
Amgen shares rose 1 percent  They are up about 20 percent since the restructuring announcement that involved plant closings and job cuts  now expected to exceed 2 900  The company had previously estimated 2 400 to 2 900 job cuts as it looks to reallocate resources to prepare for the launch of new medicines  including a potential multibillion dollar cholesterol drug 
Further details of the restructuring are expected to be laid out at a business update for analysts and investors in New York on Tuesday 
Excluding items  Amgen earned  2 30 per share  exceeding analysts  average expectations by 19 cents  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S 
Amgen said it now expects 2014 adjusted earnings of  8 45 to  8 55 per share  up from the boosted forecast it provided in July of  8 20 to  8 40 per share  The company expects full year revenue of  19 8 billion to  20 billion  It previously forecast  19 5 billion to  19 7 billion 
 The numbers on the top line were a little better than we thought and on the bottom line in particular they were very strong   said Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt 
 The guidance went up  It looked very conservative  but also certainly welcome   he added 
Amen posted a net profit of  1 24 billion  or  1 61 per share  down from a profit of  1 37 billion  or  1 79 per share  a year ago 
Revenue for the quarter rose 6 percent to  5 03 billion  edging past Wall Street estimates of  4 96 billion 
Sales of the white blood cell booster Neulasta rose 5 percent to  1 19 billion  topping the  1 13 billion analysts had expected 
Kyprolis  the multiple myeloma drug at the heart of Amgen s nearly  10 billion acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals last year  had sales of  94 million  exceeding analysts  expectations of  87 million and the previous quarter s  78 million  Kyprolis still lags Celgene s new rival drug Pomalyst  which rang up sales of  181 million for the quarter 
Sales of the osteoporosis treatment Prolia jumped 43 percent to  255 million  topping analysts  estimates of  236 million  but down from  264 million in the prior quarter 
The blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel saw sales fall three percent to  1 12 billion  shy of the  1 17 billion analysts were expecting  Inventory stocking issues hurt Enbrel in the quarter  the company said

Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 32 by a penny  Earnings rose 2  year over year Including asset impairment  restructuring and other special charges  first quarter earnings per share were  4 31 compared with  1 16 reported in first quarter 2018 Revenues in DetailIn the first quarter of 2019  Lilly reported revenues of  5 1 billion  Sales grew 3  year over year  backed by strong demand for its new drugs  namely Trulicity  Taltz  Jardiance and Basaglar  which compensated lower sales of older products like Cialis and Strattera Foreign exchange hurt sales growth by 2  in the quarter  Also  lower realized prices had a negative impact of 3  on sales  Volumes rose 7   U S  revenues grew 3  to  2 9 billion and ex U S  revenues inched up 2  to  2 2 billion Forteo sales were flat at  312 9 million  Humalog sales declined 8  to  730 8 million  Humulin sales fell 9  to  297 7 million Cialis sales plunged 38  to  308 2 million as U S  sales were hurt by the entry of generic products  Outside U S  sales were hit by currency headwindsAmong the new products  Trulicity generated revenues of  879 7 million  up 30  year over year  driven by higher demand Cyramza revenues were  198 3 million  up 8  year over year  attributable to higher demand Jardiance sales surged 35  to  203 6 million  boosted by increased demand trends within the SGLT2 class of diabetes medicines in the United States and an expanded volume outside the United States Basaglar recorded revenues of  251 4 million  soaring 51  year over year  In the United States  sales jumped 56   benefiting from higher demand  which offset the impact of lower realized price changes in estimates to rebates and discounts Taltz fetched in sales of  252 5 million  up 72  year over year as U S  sales gained from solid demand  which made up for lower realized prices  Ex U S  sales were aided by higher volume from launches across new countries Lartruvo generated revenues of  83 5 million in fourth quarter 2018 but did not contribute to the top line in the quarter under review  Notably  in February this year  Lilly announced that Lartruvo  which had won conditional approval two years back  failed to improve survival in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma in a late stage confirmatory study  ANNOUNCE  Continued approval was contingent on the verification of clinical benefit in a confirmatory study  With the ANNOUNCE study failing to confirm clinical benefit  management stated that it will stop promoting Lartruvo  The company has been working with regulatory agencies to facilitate the withdrawal of Lartruvo from the market New rheumatoid arthritis drug  Olumiant  generated sales of  82 1 million in the quarter  backed by the launch uptake across new European markets compared with  70 1 million in the previous reported quarter  In the United States  Olumiant registered sales of  6 4 million  higher than  4 2 million in the earlier reported quarter New advanced breast cancer treatment medicine  Verzenio  generated sales of  109 4 million in the quarter  which was more than  83 1 million sequentially  This is because of solid demand and to some extent  higher realized prices The newly launched CGRP antibody  Emgality  galcanezumab   generated sales of  14 2 million in the quarter  higher than  4 9 million in the sequential quarter Notably  in March this year  the FDA granted a priority review to Lilly s regulatory application looking for the label expansion of Emgality injection to address the preventive treatment of episodic cluster headache in adult patients Amgen s   NASDAQ AMGN   Aimovig and Teva s   NYSE TEVA   Ajovy were two other CGRP antibodies unveiled last year  which pose a strong competition to Emgality Meanwhile  Lilly divested its Elanco animal health unit as an independent publicly traded company   Elanco Animal Health Incorporated   NYSE ELAN     via an initial public offering  IPO  of a minority stake in 2018  Lilly sold the remaining 80 2  interest in the new company through a  tax efficient transaction  this March Gross Margin   Operating IncomeAdjusted gross margin of 80 2  in the quarter expanded 160 basis points  Operating income decreased 8  year over year to  1 33 billion on higher operating expenses  Operating expenses increased 12  year over year to  2 7 billion due to steep marketing costs to support the introduction of Emgality 2019 Sales Outlook LoweredThe earnings forecast was raised from a range of  5 55  5 65 per share to the  5 60  5 70 band  Lilly now expects revenues between  22 0 billion and  22 5 billion in 2019  down from the prior expectation of  25 1 billion  25 6 billion Despite the earnings beat  Lilly s shares declined more than 2  in pre market trading for trimming its full year revenue prediction  However  so far this year  shares of Lilly have gained 3 4  against the  dip of 0 9  Our TakeIn 2019  revenue growth is anticipated to be driven by elevated demand for the company s newer medicines including Trulicity  Jardiance  Taltz  Verzenio and Emgality besides some older drugs like Cialis  which lost patent exclusivity  However  generic competition for several drugs including Cialis  the rise in pricing

149413,370929,AMGN,AstraZeneca Cancer Drugs Seen As Draw For Pfizer,news,"By    LONDON  Reuters    Pfizer Inc  NYSE PFE  may come back to bid for British drug company Astrazeneca Plc  AZN ST  after its reported 60 billion pound   101 billion  takeover approach was rejected  since a deal could make sense for the U S  pharmaceuticals giant as it seeks to build up its cancer franchise               
In addition to adding promising   though still risky   experimental medicines known as immunotherapies that boost the body s immune system to fight tumors  acquiring AstraZeneca could also generate significant cost savings  according to industry analysts               
As a result  a deal at around a 25 percent premium to the current share price funded by cash  cheap debt and some stock could boost Pfizer earnings immediately  they believe               
Both companies have declined to comment on a report in the Sunday Times  which cited senior investment bankers and industry sources saying that Pfizer approached the British pharmaceuticals group about a deal  The newspaper said no talks were currently under way after AstraZeneca resisted the approach               
Citi analyst Andrew Baum said he believed the report was  very likely genuine  and Pfizer could return to the fray  given the attractiveness of AstraZeneca s pipeline of cancer drugs  its expertise in autoimmune diseases and the scope for taking out costs               
 We anticipate Pfizer to push aggressively ahead with a second approach   Baum wrote in a research note on Monday  adding that AstraZeneca might seek to structure any deal as a merger of equals as a defense strategy 
Betaville  a British financial blog  on Monday said AstraZeneca had hired Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to act as  defense  advisors in the event Pfizer makes a new effort to acquire the London based drugmaker  The two investment banks already act as AstraZeneca s corporate brokers 
The blog also said that Pfizer may be working with JP Morgan to work on any potential bid  AstraZeneca and Pfizer declined to comment on the investment bankers  and officials at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley could not immediately be reached               
Pfizer shares closed up 2 percent  while AstraZeneca shares rose 8 8 percent  both on the New York Stock Exchange               
Pfizer has a long track record of making major acquisitions  with the  68 billion purchase of Wyeth in 2009 its last major deal  after earlier acquisitions of Pharmacia and Warner Lambert               
The drugmaker has more recently been divesting certain operations and mega mergers have fallen out of fashion in the pharmaceuticals industry following skepticism about how well some of them have worked  But Chief Executive Officer Ian Read has said he would still consider a large deal that made sense               
Read also has an incentive to buy assets overseas rather than in the United States since Pfizer has tens of billions of dollars accumulated through foreign subsidiaries  which if repatriated to the U S  would be heavily taxed 
OTHER BIDDERS              
A Pfizer move on AstraZeneca might flush out other bidders  U S  biotech giant Amgen Inc  NASDAQ AMGN  already has a tie up with AstraZeneca in autoimmune medicines to treat diseases such as psoriasis and severe asthma  Novartis  NOVN SIX  and larger Glaxosmithkline  GSK LSE  have also been mentioned in the past as potential suitors  although GSK has in recent years said publicly it is not interested in making a large acquisition  while Novartis is in the middle of strategic review and already has a presence in cancer immunotherapy 
Mark Schoenebaum  an analyst at ISI  agreed cancer immunotherapy was likely the main lure for Pfizer  since the field is expected to become one of the biggest areas of modern medicine in the next few years               
However  Mark Clark at Deutsche Bank said Pfizer would be making something of a  leap of faith  since AstraZeneca s most exciting cancer drugs are still at an early stage of development               
Pfizer has a highly promising breast cancer drug in late stage development called palbociclib but otherwise its cancer portfolio is relatively weak 
 Notably  Pfizer appears to be nowhere in the important field of immuno oncology  which Bristol Myers Squibb  Roche  Merck   Co and AstraZeneca currently dominate   Schoenebaum said               
Bristol  Roche and Merck are viewed as being ahead of AstraZeneca in the new cancer field but the British firm believes it can make up ground by pioneering drug combinations  including the use of a medicine known as tremelimumab that it licensed from Pfizer               
AstraZeneca and its rivals will present the latest clinical data on promising new cancer drugs at the May 30 to June 3 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology               
DRUG PIPELINE              
The London market was closed on Monday for Easter but the talk of Pfizer s interest in AstraZeneca is likely to overshadow dealings when trade resumes on Tuesday               
AstraZeneca Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot  who has been credited for progress in rebuilding the company s new drug pipeline since taking over in 2012  fuelling a rally in the shares  will also come under pressure to address the reported Pfizer approach when he presents half year results on Thursday 
Speculation over such a takeover  which would be potentially the biggest ever foreign takeover of a British company  is likely to trigger concerns about jobs in Britain s pharmaceuticals sector  which is viewed as a key industry by the government but which has been under pressure               
AstraZeneca has already laid off thousands of scientists and other staff as it shrinks its cost base to cope with a fall in sales due to patent losses on blockbuster medicines               
With heartburn treatment Nexium losing U S  patent protection next month and cholesterol fighter Crestor facing patent expiry in 2016  the decline in sales is expected to continue for several years              
In an attempt to reshape the company  Soriot is currently moving its research and corporate headquarters to Cambridge  England  Pfizer has also made the university city a research hub after shuttering a large research site in Sandwich  southern England               
The Cambridge connection is only one link between Pfizer and AstraZeneca  highlighting how the companies know each other well               
AstraZeneca s head of innovative medicines Mene Pangalos also used to work at Pfizer and the two firms are familiar with each other s products from working together on projects  such as a pioneering of a new kind of clinical trial for cancer drugs announced last week ",2014-04-21,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/astrazeneca-cancer-drugs-seen-as-draw-for-pfizer-278556,278556

149425,370941,AMGN,Teladoc  TDOC  To Report Q1 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"Teladoc Health  Inc    NYSE TDOC    the global leader in virtual care  will release first quarter 2019 results on Apr 30  2019  after the market closes 
The company is expected to post a loss of 44 cents per share  which is wider than the loss of 39 cents  sustained in the year ago quarter  Revenues of  128 14 million are expected to grow 43  year over year 
In the last reported quarter  the company sustained a loss of 35 cents per share  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The same was also lower than the year ago quarter s loss of 50 cents per share  The decline in losses was supported by increase in revenues  partly offset by rise in expenses 
Let s see the factors affecting Q1 results
We expect to see higher visit revenues in the first quarter of 2019  attributable to increased adoption of virtual care and benefits from the company s diversification strategy  pursuant to which it had broadened the scope of clinical services offered 
In the recent past  the company launched Teladoc Global Care that enables multinational organizations to provide expats and travelers with a single solution for convenient and easy to navigate access to quality care  regardless of geographic location  This should buoy the company s revenue from international operations  Moreover  the company has already closed meaningful cross selling expansion contracts in 2019  in sync with the aim of selling its full suite of products around the world 
The company is constantly witnessing growth in its client roster due to the addition of new clients across multiple market segments  Its emphasis is on increasing value add clients through product innovation that will also help to retain customers  In the first quarter  the company s growing clients should aid the top line 
Teladoc has been banking on acquisitions to boost growth  The buyouts of Advance Medical and Best Doctors should result in membership growth thus aiding revenues 
Per management  the first quarter is typically the least profitable quarter of the year as the company realizes the expense of on boarding millions of new members in advance of associated visit revenue  Therefore adjusted EBITDA should decline in the first quarter of 2019  compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 
Also rise in expenses primarily due by higher marketing and advertising  technology and development  and legal expenses  should compress margins 
Company s Guidance
For the first quarter  the company expects total revenues of  126  129 million and total adjusted EBITDA of  0  2 million  It projects total visits between 950 000 and 1050 000  Net loss per share  based on 70 8 million weighted average shares outstanding  is expected to range from a loss of 44 cents to 46 cents per share 
Earnings Surprise History
The company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history having surpassed estimates in three of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 4 4  This is depicted in the graph below

149440,370956,AMGN,Radius Health  RDUS  Rallies 33 4  YTD On Robust Tymlos Sales,opinion,"Shares of Radius Health  Inc    NASDAQ RDUS   have gained 35 3  in the year so far  outperforming the  growth of 12 4  

 
The company primarily focuses on the development of endocrine therapeutics in the areas of osteoporosis and oncology  
Radius Health got a significant boost with the FDA approval of Tymlos  abaloparatide  SC  injection for the treatment of postmenopausal women with high risk osteoporosis for fracture   defined as history of osteoporotic fracture   multiple risk factors for fracture  or patients  who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapies 
The drug was approved in 2017 and continued to gain traction in 2018  In October 2018  the FDA approved a labeling supplement for Tymlos to include additional information from the ACTIVExtend study  The labeling now reflects that after 24 months of open label alendronate therapy  the vertebral fracture risk reduction achieved with Tymlos therapy was maintained 
The drug captured  on average  20  of the U S  anabolic osteoporosis market  based on Patient Months on Therapy  TRx PMOT  in 2018  In the first six weeks of 2019  the drug captured a 29  share of the U S  anabolic osteoporosis market and more than 40  of new anabolic patient starts 
The company is also developing an abaloparatide transdermal patch  abaloparatide patch  for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis 
Apart from Tymlos  Radius Health is working on the development of elacestrant   The company initiated the phase III EMERALD study on elacestrant in November 2018   This is the first phase III study to evaluate treatment benefit for second  and third line breast cancer patients following CDK 4 6 inhibitor therapy and compare outcomes in patients whose tumors harbor estrogen receptor 1 gene  ESR1  mutations  The study is open to enrollment  with a planned recruitment period of 18 21 months and potential data read out in 2021 
While the market for postmenopausal osteoporosis provides significant commercial potential  it is pretty crowded given the presence of products like Amgen s   NASDAQ AMGN   Prolia and Lilly s   NYSE LLY   Forteo  among others  The recent approval of Amgen s Evenity will further intensify competition for Tymlos  Novartis    NYSE NVS   Reclast is also approved for osteoporosis  Hence  it remains to be seen what the growth trajectory will be for Tymlos in 2019  Moreover  the drug has been refused approval in Europe

  Updates to add Amgen after results  volume 
 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK  July 27  Reuters    U S  stocks rose slightly on
Monday in a late rally as investors rotated into financial
shares  which had lagged in the recent two week run up 
 Upbeat data on new home sales underpinned financial
stocks  the session s strongest sector  and prompted investors
to snap up the shares of several regional banks  which had
been among the worst hit by credit losses tied to a weak
housing market 
 Regions Financial Corp jumped 8 9 percent to  4 02 on the
New York Stock Exchange and Zions Bancorporation soared 13
percent to  12 65 on the Nasdaq  while the KBW Bank Index rose
3 1 percent 
 Financials had lagged in the previous weeks  but Friday
saw the beginning of a rotation into the sector and out of
technology  which continued Monday  according to Michael
James  senior trader at Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles 
 The Dow Jones U S  home construction index shot up 4 3
percent after data showed U S  new home sales posted their
biggest monthly gain in eight years in June  suggesting the
housing market may be starting to recover from its worst slump
since the Great Depression of the 1930s 
 Stronger than expected earnings  coupled with upbeat
economic data  have lifted indexes recently  giving stocks
their best two week run since just after the S P 500 hit a
12 year closing low in the beginning of March  The three major
indexes rose about 11 percent each over the past two weeks 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 15 27 points  or
0 17 percent  to close at 9 108 51  The Standard   Poor s 500
Index gained 2 92 points  or 0 30 percent  to 982 18  The
Nasdaq Composite Index added 1 93 points  or 0 10 percent  to
end at 1 967 89 
  There was a little more willingness to bid stocks up two
weeks ago on positive earnings surprises   said Wedbush
Morgan s Michael James   You re seeing people less willing to
do that now  given the move the market has had in the last two
weeks  
 Shares of Dow component Verizon Communications fell 1 6
percent to  31 after the company reported second quarter
earnings that fell from a year ago 
 Aetna shares shed 2 7 percent to  25 72 after the company 
one of the biggest U S  providers of employer based health
insurance  cut its full year outlook  citing
higher than projected medical costs 
 AMGEN JUMPS AFTER THE BELL
 After the closing bell  shares of Amgen Inc rose 3 2
percent to  62 72 as the biotechnology company raised its
full year earnings forecast and reported a
better than expected quarterly profit  Amgen said its results
were helped by strong sales of its rheumatoid arthritis drug
and a tax benefit  The stock closed on Nasdaq at  60 77  down
0 25 percent  or 15 cents  before the release of the results 
 In the regular session  volume was light on the New York
Stock Exchange  where about 1 04 billion shares changed hands 
less than last year s estimated daily average of 1 49 billion 
On the Nasdaq  about 2 16 billion shares traded  below last
year s daily average of 2 28 billion 
 Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a ratio of
9 to 5  while on the Nasdaq  about 13 stocks rose for every 10
that fell

149446,370962,AMGN,5 Oncology Stocks Investors Should Be Watching,opinion,"Cancer is a devastating ailment that continues to be a challenge for patients and the medical professionals that dedicate their lives to treating them  Due to the difficult to treat nature of various types of cancer  many patients and physicians are left with few to no options as it relates to treatment 
If you follow news on biotechnology stocks  you ve seen that there are several companies that are working to change this  many of which have already had incredible success  both in the clinical setting and the real world setting  Moreover  these companies have driven incredible investor interest  creating market opportunities that are hard not to watch  Today  we ll talk about the top 5 companies that I believe to be presenting the strongest opportunities in the oncology space 
 1  Novartis AG  NVS    Continued Innovation Likely To Drive Further Growth
Novartis is a name that is well known in the investing community  and for good reason  While the company focuses on several disease areas  the majority of its efforts are spent within the oncology space  In fact  the company has received marketing approval for about 25 cancer fighting drugs to date  Of course  the value of this commercial stage oncology portfolio is incredible  earning the company the  220 billion  market cap that it currently enjoys 
Nonetheless  it is believed that the value of the company will continue to grow for multiple reasons  Of the most pressing are 
First and foremost  the growth in sales of the company s commercially available oncology treatments has been very strong  This shows that the team behind Novartis is highly effective when it comes to the commercialization of its drugs 
It s also worth mentioning that Novartis has an incredible oncology pipeline  In fact  the company currently has approximately 30 clinical phase programs focused on the oncology space  more than half of which are in the midst of late stage trials  Considering this  there are multiple catalysts ahead 
Finally  Novartis is actively building its pipeline  both organically and through acquisitions  In fact  the company recently acquired Advanced Accelerator Applications in a deal worth  3 9 billion as well as Endocyte in a deal worth  2 1 billion  Both of these acquisitions brought high value oncology candidates to the table 
All in all  Novartis is an oncology giant that has earned its spot at the top of the list  Moreover  the value proposition only seems to be growing as the company s work continues 
 2  Celgene  NASDAQ CELG    A Company With A Proven Record
Celgene is another company that has made a great name for themselves in the Oncology space  Currently  the company has eight treatments approved in the United States  with seven of these treatments being indicated for various forms of cancer 
Moreover  as with Novartis  Celgene has a proven ability when it comes to commercialization of these treatments  This can be seen by the strong sales growth that the company has experienced quarter over quarter and year over year for several consecutive years  On top of that  the company has greatly expanded earnings for investors over the years  In fact  in the last four quarters alone  the company has increased earnings from  1 61 per share for the quarter ending May 4  2018 to  2 20 per share for the quarter ending January 1  2019 
Key reasons to watch Celgene 
As with Novartis  Celgene has consistently produced growth in sales  leading to strong growth in revenue as well as earnings per share  With the company s positive track record in terms of sales growth  there s no reason to expect a plateau any time soon 
Also  the company has an impressive pipeline of products under development  In fact  there are 19 clinical development programs currently taking place at the company  These development programs are centered around the treatment of three of the most difficult to treat types of cancer  and many of them have already yielded positive results 
Finally  while Celgene is incredibly active in the oncology space  the company is also active among other high value indications  Two of the highest value indications in this list include Myelofibrosis and Multiple Sclerosis 
 3  Cellectar Biosciences  CLRB    A Highly Undervalued Oncology Play
Cellectar Biosciences is a relatively small company  with a market cap of just over  10 million  However  the low market cap actually provides the basis for many bullish opinions as compared to others at its level  it is highly undervalued  Nonetheless  a feeling of undervaluation isn t necessarily the motive for a decision to get involved in a stock  Nonetheless  there are several reasons to be excited here 
Cellectar Bioscience is a clinical stage oncology company that may be on the verge of a significant breakthrough  The company s claim to fame is its proprietary Phospholipid Drug Conjugates  or PDCs  This proprietary technology gives the company the ability to target cancerous tumors in a way that is unmatched elsewhere  and it is the delivery method that has proven to be effective through multiple clinical trials of its flagship candidate  CLR 131 
Key reasons to watch Cellectar Biosciences 
First and foremost  the company s proprietary PDC delivery method comes with several benefits  Due to the highly targeted nature of this delivery method  radiation is proportionately delivered to tumor cells  avoiding surrounding tissue and leading to a low risk of serious adverse events  SAEs   In fact  to date  there have been no SAEs reported in any clinical trials for the treatment  In the treatment of cancer  this is unheard of 
Another reason to keep tabs on Cellectar Biosciences is that the company has several catalysts ahead  In fact  the company is expecting to share a minimum of 7 clinical data readouts with investors in the year 2019 alone  This  combined with interim analysis announcements  potential presentations  and peer reviewed publications  means that catalysts are likely to come in droves ahead  leading to strong potential opportunities 
Finally  the company is not targeting the easy to treat populations that we see with other companies on the list  Instead  their clinical trials have included patients that have already received at least 5 prior lines of therapy  With potential efficacy dropping off of a cliff after the third line of therapy  this can be a very risky move  However  in a recent clinical trial  the company showed that even in this difficult to treat patient population  CLR 131 was able to extend overall survival by 22 months  This is an unheard of accomplishment in the addressed patient population 
 4  Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN    Taking Proactive Steps To Further Improve Shareholder Value
Next in the line  we have Amgen  This is yet another company with a proven history in oncology  Currently  Amgen has 17 therapies that are approved for commercialization in the United States  Of these  nearly half  8  have been approved for oncology related indications 
Through the years  Amgen has shown its ability to successfully commercialize treatments  earning a market cap of more than  116 billion  However  the company s previous success isn t the only reason that this oncology stock is one to keep an eye on 
Key reasons to watch Amgen 
As with many of the companies on this list  Amgen has a proven track record of solid growth in sales  As a result  the company has experienced strong revenue growth and earnings growth  providing an incredible return of value to its investors by consistently growing earnings  which have beat analyst expectations for the past four consecutive quarters 
Amgen is also making smart moves with regard to targeted indications  In fact  the company currently has a pipeline that includes 35 programs  most of which are targeting serious conditions with few to no options for patients and the physicians treating them  As a result of this focus on serious conditions with high medical need  the company has earned various Orphan Drug Designations and is well positioned to take the lion s share of various markets as these pipeline products make their way to commercialization 
Finally  Amgen is on an acquisition hunt at the moment  As generic competition starts to encroach on sales  the company is working to increase value for investors by acquiring others that have products with the potential to drive strong revenue increases  When companies of this size make proactive moves to combat potentially declining sales  we generally see strong growth in value in the long run 
 5  Exelixis  EXEL    A Blockbuster Product And A Strong Pipeline Make This Hard To Ignore
Finally  we have Exelixis  With a market cap of just over  7 billion  this is an up and coming oncology company that could quickly grow to a valuation like what we ve see with Celgene and Novartis 
The company s flagship product is known as Cabometyx  The treatment was designed as a second line option for renal cell carcinoma  also known as RCC  In both clinical and real world settings  Cabometyx has proven to be effective  improving objective response rates  progression free survival rates  and overall survival rates 
Key reasons to keep an eye on Exelixis 
First and foremost  Cabometyx is a blockbuster drug  In 2018  the treatment generated  619 million in sales  showing an impressive 77  year over year increase  Moreover  the FDA recently expanded the label of the drug to include second line advanced hepatocellular carcinoma  HCC  as an approved indication  This could lead to strong sales growth in the year ahead as the commercial rollout for this indication hits full swing 
Also  Exelixis isn t planning on putting a halt to innovation any time soon  In fact  the company recently submitted several Investigational New Drug  IND  applications to the FDA  The ultimate goal is to develop XL092 as an option for various types of cancer  Although XL092 is currently in the early stages of development  the treatment has shown promising preclinical data and could be yet another blockbuster down the line 
Finally  according to Finviz  institutional investor interest is incredibly high  with institutional investors currently holding well over 70  of shares 
Final Thoughts
The oncology space is an exciting one to follow  With a massive market opportunity in any cancer indication  and innovation taking place at a rapid rate  investor interest in the space is climbing and will likely continue to do so  With the advancements the companies above have made and are continuing to make in the space  these stocks are hard to ignore

149447,370963,AMGN,Analysts Estimate Amgen  AMGN  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Amgen  AMGN  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This world s largest biotech drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 39 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 3  
Revenues are expected to be  5 55 billion  down 0 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 93  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Amgen 
For Amgen  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 06  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Amgen will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Amgen would post earnings of  3 26 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 42  delivering a surprise of  4 91  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Amgen doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-amgen-amgn-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200409586,200409586

149462,370978,AMGN,Why Amgen  AMGN  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Amgen  AMGN   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry 
This world s largest biotech drugmaker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 6 40  
For the last reported quarter  Amgen came out with earnings of  3 42 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 26 per share  representing a surprise of 4 91   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  3 42 per share and it actually produced earnings of  3 69 per share  delivering a surprise of 7 89  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Amgen lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Amgen currently has an Earnings ESP of  4 31   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on April 30  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

149516,371032,AMGN,Regeneron  Sanofi Get EC Nod For Label Expansion Of Praluent,opinion,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ REGN   announced that the European Commission  EC  has approved a label expansion of its PCSK9 inhibitor  Praluent 
The drug s label has been expanded to reduce cardiovascular  CV  risk in adults with established atherosclerotic CV disease  ASCVD  by lowering low density lipoprotein cholesterol  LDL C  levels as an adjunct to correction of other risk factors 
The trial met its primary endpoint  showing that Praluent significantly reduced the relative risk of major adverse CV events  MACE  by 15  in patients who had suffered a recent ACS   The data also showed that MACE occurred in 9 5  of patients in the Praluent group compared with 11 1  in the placebo group  Moreover  Praluent was associated with a 15  lower risk of death from any cause  Adverse events were similar in the Praluent and placebo groups  except for injection site reactions 
We note that Praluent is already approved in the EU for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia  HeFH  or clinical ASCVD  in adults   The drug is also approved for use as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with HeFH or clinical ASCVD who require additional lowering of LDL C in the United States 
We remind investors that data from ODYSSEY OUTCOMES have also been submitted to the FDA and the regulatory body has set a target action date of Apr 28  2019 
Regeneron has a collaboration agreement with Sanofi   NASDAQ SNY   for Praluent  The label expansion of the drug should further boost sales  
Earlier  both the companies decided to implement a 60  cut in U S  list price of Praluent  following a similar action last year by rival Amgen  Inc    NASDAQ AMGN   to cut the U S  list price of its PCSK9 inhibitor  Repatha by 60  to improve access and affordability 
Regeneron inked another collaboration agreement with Sanofi  per which the latter records sales for commercialized products  Dupixent  Praluent and Kevzara  and the former has the right to co promote such products on a country by country basis  Regeneron has exercised its option to co promote Dupixent  Praluent and Kevzara in the United States 
Regeneron s stock has gained 20 7  in the past twelve months  against the  s decline of 13 2  

While the overall biotech sector was in doldrums in 2018  Regeneron s performance has been steady  backed by strong growth of two drugs   Eylea and Dupixent  Eylea continues to drive sales  and label expansion of the drug into additional indications has further boosted growth in 2018 
The company has co developed Eylea with the HealthCare unit of Bayer  DE BAYGN  AG   OTC BAYRY

149520,371036,AMGN,Nuevolution  Small Molecules  Big Ambitions,opinion,"Positive progress in Nuevolution s  ST NUEVOL  ROR t partnership with Almirall  LON 0O9B  has triggered a  1m milestone payment  SEK10 5m  and we continue to forecast that it will enter the clinic in 2019  FY18 was defined by the progress in the Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  partnership as it opted in for two oncology programmes  further validating Nuevolution s Chemetics technology  In Nuevolution s BET BD1 programme  a development candidate  NUE20798  has been nominated  data in animal cancer models highlight that it may have synergistic effects in combination with immunotherapies  The FY18 net loss was down year on year to SEK99 7m  from SEK117 5m  as a result of lower R D costs  Net cash of SEK108m  FY17  SEK110 6m  should fund operations into 2020  We value Nuevolution at SEK20 7 share 

Almirall milestone achieved with positive CD data
Almirall and Nuevolution have completed significant characterisation of its candidate drug  CD  leading them to believe the program could have potential best in class attributes  Almirall will now press forward with its plans to start a clinical trial programme in moderate to severe psoriasis patients  The partnership includes  172m in development milestones and  270m in regulatory milestones  in addition to tiered royalties on future net sales  The timing and design of any clinical trial is ultimately Almirall s decision and we await further information on these elements 
Amgen opt ins proving the worth of NUEV technology
Nuevolution continues to demonstrate that it has the in house ability to execute and deliver on its partnerships  In 2018  Amgen opted in on two programmes and is now covering development costs  If Amgen exercises its option to license a candidate  Nuevolution will receive an initial licensing fee of at least  10m and potential milestone payments of up to  400m per candidate  With the collaboration spanning multiple undisclosed targets  significant financial potential exists 
Internal pipeline continues to add value
Nuevolution continues to build and strengthen its pipeline of preclinical assets and aims to monetise some of those in the near term via out licensing  We have no visibility on the timelines for potential new deals for Nuevolution  but believe the BET BD1 programme  which is the most advanced internal candidate  is well positioned and most likely to be out licensed or partnered 
Valuation  SEK20 7 share  SEK1 026m 
We value Nuevolution at SEK20 7 share  SEK1 026m   vs SEK19 7 share  SEK974m  previously  The increase in value is driven by the rolling forward of our model  and we have updated net cash and FX rates

149538,371054,AMGN,Sanofi Regeneron Disagree With Jury Verdict In Amgen s Favor,opinion,"Sanofi   NASDAQ SNY   and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ REGN   strongly disagreed with a Delaware jury verdict that upheld the validity of three of five asserted claims of two U S  patents owned by Amgen  Inc    NASDAQ AMGN   for its PCSK9 inhibitor  Repatha  Notably  Sanofi and Regeneron also market a PCSK9 inhibitor  Praluent  The companies believe that all Amgen s asserted U S  patent claims are invalid based on lack of written description Sanofi Regeneron intend to appeal against the jury verdict and request a new trial  The two patents describe and claim monoclonal antibodies of PCSK9 In October 2014  Amgen had filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Sanofi and Regeneron in the U S  District Court of Delaware to prevent the manufacture  use and sale of Praluent  In March 2016  a Delaware jury ruled in favor of Amgen declaring that the two patents were valid  and that Sanofi and Regeneron had failed to invalidate them due to the lack of written description and enablement  In January 2017  the U S  District Court in Delaware granted Amgen permanent injunction against infringement by Sanofi and Regeneron of two patents owned by Amgen for Repatha  Later  a federal circuit court reversed in part the judgment of the Delaware district court and demanded a new triaI We note that both Repatha and Praluent are used to inhibit a protein known as PCSK9  which lowers the liver s ability to remove  bad  cholesterol  LDL C  from the blood  While both the drugs hit the market in 2015 within a month  the companies have been working rigorously on securing deals with health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers  However  sales of both these PCSK9 inhibitors have been below expectations since launch due to payer restrictions  Despite Sanofi Regeneron and Amgen s efforts to improve access to their products  patients face significant hurdles due to high co pay expenses Earlier this month  Sanofi Regeneron announced a 60  cut in the U S  list price of Praluent  following a similar action last year by Amgen to improve access and affordability of the product  The price cuts have been taken to encourage payers to improve access to Praluent and Repatha  which will encourage use of these drugs  It goes without saying that the price cuts will significantly dent Sanofi s and Amgen s profits from their respective PCSK9 inhibitors Sanofi s shares have risen 7 7  in the past year  Sanofi currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Sanofi Price and Consensus

149542,371058,AMGN,Radius  RDUS  Posts Narrower Q4 Loss On Robust Tymlos Sales ,opinion,"Radius Health  Inc  NASDAQ RDUS   reported encouraging results for the fourth quarter of 2018  wherein loss was narrower than expected and sales beat estimates Radius Health  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   The company reported a loss of  0 66 per share in the quarter  narrower than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  0 82 and the year ago period s loss of  1 36   Increase in revenues led to the narrower than anticipated loss on a year over year basis 
The company reported Tymlos  sales of  34 4 million  marginally surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  34 million 
Quarter in Detail
Tymlos  sales also increased 25  sequentially  We remind investors that Radius Health obtained the FDA approval for Tymlos  abaloparatide  injection in April 2017 for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture  The company began shipments of the drug to wholesalers at the end of May 2017  Hence  revenues recorded in the year ago quarter were  7 7 million only 
Tymlos captured  on average  20  of the U S  anabolic osteoporosis market  based on Patient Months on Therapy  TRx PMOT  in 2018  During the fourth quarter of 2018  Tymlos  average U S  anabolic market share grew to 26  and achieved a 39  share of new anabolic patient starts 
In October 2018  the FDA approved a labeling supplement for Tymlos to include additional information from the ACTIVExtend study  The labeling now reflects that after 24 months of open label alendronate therapy  the vertebral fracture risk reduction achieved with Tymlos therapy was maintained 
As of Jan 1  2019  Tymlos was covered for approximately 283 million U S  insured lives  representing approximately 99  of U S  commercial  67  of Medicare and 96  Medicaid Other insured lives 
Research and development expenses for the reported quarter were  23 9 million  up 4  year over year  driven by increases in elacestrant project costs and abaloparatide patch project costs  General and administrative expenses decreased 13  to  43 9 million due to decreases in compensation and travel related expenses  and professional fees 
Pipeline Updates
The pipeline includes abaloparatide injection for potential use in the treatment of men with osteoporosis  abaloparatide patch for potential use in osteoporosis  and elacestrant  RAD1901  for potential use in hormone receptor positive breast cancer 
The company is developing two formulations   abaloparatide Subcutaneous  SC  and abaloparatide transdermal patch  Radius Health is on track with its preparations for the phase III trial on abaloparatide patch and expects to start the study in mid 2019 
Radius Health initiated the phase III EMERALD study of elacestrant late November 2018   This is the first phase III study to prospectively evaluate treatment benefit for second  and third line breast cancer patients following CDK 4 6 inhibitor therapy as well as to prospectively compare outcomes in patients whose tumors harbor estrogen receptor 1 gene  ESR1  mutations  The study is open to enrollment with a planned recruitment period of 18 21 months and potential data read out in 2021 
In December 2017  the company reported mature data from its multiple part phase I dose escalation and expansion study of elacestrant in postmenopausal women with ER positive and HER2 negative advanced breast cancer  These results showed that elacestrant was well tolerated with the most commonly reported adverse events being low grade nausea  dyspepsia and vomiting 
A phase I study  evaluating the safety and maximum tolerated dose of RAD140 in patients with hormone receptor positive  locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer  is currently enrolling patients and expected to continue through the first quarter of 2019  A provisional maximum tolerated dose  MTD  was identified and an additional cohort has been opened to further confirm tolerability  pharmacokinetics  and on treatment pharmacodynamics effects of RAD140 at that dose 
2019 Sales Guidance Reiterated
Radius Health expects Tymlos net revenues around  155  175 million in 2019 
Our Take
The company s narrower than expected loss in the fourth quarter was encouraging as sales of Tymlos continued to gain traction 
In the first six weeks of 2019  Tymlos has captured a 29  share of the U S  anabolic osteoporosis market and more than 40  of new anabolic patient starts 
Although the osteoporosis market in the United Sates has great potential  Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly   Co s   NYSE LLY   Forteo and Amgen s   NASDAQ AMGN   Prolia

149554,371070,AMGN,Is Amgen  AMGN  A Profitable Pick ForValue Investors Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Amgen Inc    NASDAQ AMGN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Amgen has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 4  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Amgen s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 14 7 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares pretty favorably with the Medical Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 4  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is much undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Amgen has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 12 9  which is significantly lower than the current level  So  it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Amgen stock in the near term too PEG RatioWhile earnings are certainly important  it is essential to know how much you are paying for the growth of earnings as well  One can easily do that with the PEG ratio  ratio of the P E to the expected future earnings growth rate   The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture of the valuation of a stock than the P E ratio Amgen s PEG ratio stands at just 2 2  compared with the Zacks Medical Biomed  Genetics industry s average of 3 8  This suggests a bit undervalued trading relative to its earnings growth potential right now Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Amgen currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Amgen a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio for Amgen is 10  a level that is quite lower than the industry average of 14 96x  Clearly  AMGN is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Amgen might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has Growth score of C and Momentum Scores of A  This gives AMGN a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been bearish  The current quarter has seen two upward revisions in the past sixty days compared to three downward revisions  while the full year estimate has seen three upward and ten downward revisions in the same time period This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined by 4 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has also dipped by 2 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Amgen Inc  Price and Consensus   Despite the bearish analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAmgen is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 28  of more than 250 industries  instils our confidence However  with a Zacks Rank  3 it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Top 10 Stocks for 2019In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you like to know about our 10 finest buy and holds for the year Who wouldn t  Our annual Top 10s have beaten the market with amazing regularity  In 2018  while the market dropped  5 2   the portfolio

149575,371091,AMGN,Merck s  MRK  Stock Up Almost 50  In A Year  Here s Why,opinion,In the past year  Merck   Co   Inc     NYSE MRK   has been one of the biggest gainers along with Eli Lilly   NYSE LLY     Merck s stock has risen 45 2  in the past year compared with a 7 4  increase for the   Merck s performance in 2018 was supported by strong quarterly results and positive pipeline and regulatory updates  It looks well poised to maintain the bullish run in 2019 Strong Sales   Earnings PerformanceMerck s full year 2018 sales rose 5  to  42 3 billion while adjusted earnings per share rose 9  to  4 34 per share  Pharmaceutical segment sales rose 6  in 2018 while that of the Animal Health unit rose 9   Importantly  Merck issued a decent earnings and sales guidance for 2019 on the fourth quarter conference call Strength in Keytruda  Bridion  Gardasil and Animal Health offset headwinds from loss of exclusivity for some products and competitive pressure for Zostavax and Zepatier  Keytruda continued its robust performance on strong demand  Animal health and vaccine products are also performing strongly and remain core growth drivers for Merck Keytruda  A Key Growth CatalystMerck s outperformance in the past year can largely be attributed to strong performance and positive regulatory updates related to its PD 1 inhibitor  Keytruda  In a very short span of time  Keytruda has become Merck s largest product  It is now already approved for use in 15 indications across 10 different tumor types in the United States  The drug generated sales of  7 17 billion in 2018  reflecting a massive 88  surge year over year  Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally Keytruda sales are gaining particularly from strong momentum in the indication of first line lung cancer as it is the only anti PD 1 approved in the setting in certain patients both as a monotherapy as well as combination therapy The Keytruda development program is also progressing well and the drug is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 900 studies  including more than 500 combination studies  Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   Incyte   NASDAQ INCY    Glaxo and Pfizer  NYSE PFE  separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens We believe that Keytruda has strong growth prospects based on increased utilization  recent approvals for new indications and potential additional approvals worldwide Other Pipeline Regulatory SuccessKey new drug approvals for Merck in the past year included that of Steglatro and its fixed dose combinations for type II diabetes  two new HIV drugs   Pifeltro and Delstrigo   containing doravirine and Prevymis  letermovir  for cytomegalovirus  CVM  infection Merck also gained several label expansion approvals for Keytruda and another cancer drug Lynparza  which it markets in partnership with AstraZeneca   NYSE AZN    For Keytruda  a key FDA approval in October was the label expansion as a first line treatment for metastatic squamous non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC    a difficult to treat lung cancer patient population   based on data from the phaseIII KEYNOTE 407 study Lynparza was alsoapproved by the FDA in the first line maintenance setting in December  becoming the first PARP inhibitor to be approved as a first line maintenance therapy for BRCA mutated advanced ovarian cancer  These new products and line extensions should bring in additional sales in 2019 and beyond Merck also announced positive data from several late stage studies  mainly evaluating Keytruda for further line extensions Merck also signed a co development deal with Japan s Eisai Co   Ltd for the latter s tyrosine kinase inhibitor  Lenvima  It also agreed to buy Viralytics Limited  an Australian pharmaceutical company that develops oncolytic immunotherapies for a range of cancers  which should strengthen its oncology portfolio In December  Merck announced plans to acquire privately held animal health technology provider Antelliq Group from BC Partners  Last month  Merck exercised its option to in license a once monthly insulin sensitizer  NGM313  from partner NGM Biopharmaceuticals  Inc   being developed for the treatment of NASH and type II diabetes What to Expect in 2019 For Keytruda  several regulatory decisions for new indications in the United States as well as in Europe are due in 2019  which  if approved  can further boost sales  Key FDA decisions expected in the first half will be on regulatory filings for label expansion of Keytruda as an adjuvant therapy in patients with high risk stage III melanoma and for patients with non squamous or squamous lung cancer whose tumors express PD L1 protein levels of 1 percent or greater  TPS of  1 percent  Meanwhile  Keytruda  Bridion  Lynparza  Gardasil and Animal Health should continue the strong performance  driving sales and profits in 2019  This should make up for headwinds from loss of exclusivity  LOEs   softness in the diabetes franchise  and competitive pressure on Zepatier and Zostavax Merck will also continue to focus on cost cutting initiatives  which should drive its bottom line Merck currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Is Your Investment Advisor Fumbling Your Financial Future See how you can more

149576,371092,AMGN,Roche s  RHHBY  BLA For Lymphoma Drug Gets Priority Review ,opinion,"Roche   OTC RHHBY   announced that the FDA has accepted the company s Biologics License Application  BLA  for anti CD79b antibody drug conjugate  ADC  polatuzumab vedotin in combination with bendamustine plus Rituxan  BR   for the treatment of patients suffering from relapsed or refractory  R R  diffuse large B cell lymphoma  DLBCL   and granted Priority Review status to the same 
A decision from the FDA is expected by Aug 19  2019 
We note that Priority Review designation is granted to drugs that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the safety and effectiveness of the treatment  prevention or diagnosis of a serious disease 
Polatuzumab vedotin was earlier granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA and PRIME  PRIority MEdicines  designation by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of patients with R R DLBCL in 2017   Polatuzumab vedotin is being evaluated for the treatment of several types of non Hodgkin lymphoma  NHL  
A potential approval will boost Roche s hematology portfolio  which comprises approved drugs like MabThera Rituxan  Tecentriq  Gazyva and Venclexta in collaboration with AbbVie   NYSE ABBV   
The pipeline includes polatuzumab vedotin and a small molecule that inhibits the interaction of MDM2 with p53  idasanutlin RG7388   The company also has Hemlibra in its portfolio  a bispecific monoclonal antibody for the treatment of haemophilia A 
Concurrently  the FDA accepted the company s New Drug Applications  NDAs  and granted Priority Review status to pipeline candidate entrectinib  The candidate is being evaluated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase  NTRK  fusion positive  locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have either progressed following prior therapies or as an initial therapy when there are no acceptable standard therapies  and for the treatment of people with metastatic  ROS1 positive non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC    A decision from the FDA is expected by Aug 18  2019 
The candidate is being developed across a range of solid tumor types  including breast  cholangiocarcinoma  colorectal  gynaecological  neuroendocrine  non small cell lung  salivary gland  pancreatic  sarcoma and thyroid cancers 
Roche s stock has gained 12 6  in the last six months compared with the  s growth of 2 5  

 
Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche  as its legacy drugs like Herceptin and MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars 
Novartis   NYSE NVS   has already launched its bisomilar version of Rituxan  MabThera in Europe  Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN   also obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin for the treatment of five types of cancers including lung  colorectal  glioblastoma  renal cell carcinoma and cervix  Entry of biosimilars of these key drugs adversely impacted sales in Europe in 2018

149599,371115,AMGN,Lilly  LLY  Lags Q4 Earnings  Lowers 2019 View  Stock Down,opinion,Eli Lilly   Company   NYSE LLY   reported fourth quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of  1 33  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 36  and matched the lower end of the guided range of  1 33    1 38 per share Earnings rose 17  from the year ago quarter backed by robust growth in new product sales and higher operating income  A reduction in shares outstanding from shares repurchase also led to higher earnings in the quarter Including asset impairment  restructuring  and other special charges  fourth quarter earnings per share were  1 10 against a loss of  1 58 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 However  as expected  earnings declined sequentially from third quarter levels due to U S  generic competition for key erectile dysfunction drug Cialis and launch costs for its newly launched CGRP antibody  Emgality Revenues in DetailQuarterly revenues of  6 44 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 34 billion  Sales grew 5  year over year backed by strong demand for its new drugs led by Trulicity  Taltz  Jardiance and Basaglar  which made up for lower sales of established products like Cialis and Forteo Foreign exchange hurt sales growth by 1  in the quarter  Also  lower realized prices had a negative impact of 5  on sales  Volumes rose 11   U S  revenues grew 7  to  3 66 billion and ex U S  revenues rose 1  to  2 77 billion Pharmaceutical revenues rose 5  in the quarter driven by volume growth  Established products that recorded growth during the quarter included Strattera  up 9  to  107 2 million  and Alimta  up 6  to  556 9 million   Sales of all other established products declined in the quarter Forteo sales declined 15  to  437 1 million  Cymbalta sales declined 4  to  184 5 million  Humalog sales dropped 2  to  770 4 million  Zyprexa sales were down 27  to  110 8 million  Erbitux sales declined 5  to  159 8 million  Humulin sales declined 7  to  337 4 million Cialis sales declined 41  to  350 7 million as U S  sales were hurt by entry of generic competition  Outside U S  sales were hurt by loss of exclusivity in Europe  In September  Teva Pharmaceuticals   NYSE TEVA   announced the launch of a generic version of Cialis  which led to rapid erosion of sales in the quarter Among the new products  Trulicity generated revenues of  924 7 million  up 42  year over year driven by higher demand Cyramza revenues were  220 6 million  up 8  year over year driven by higher demand Jardiance sales surged 35  to  193 2 million  driven by increased demand trends within the SGLT2 class of diabetes medicines in the United States and increased volume outside the United States Basaglar recorded revenues of  232 2 million  up 51  year over year  In the United States  sales rose 59   benefiting from higher demand  which offset the impact of lower realized prices  due to increased volume in Medicare Part D  Taltz brought in sales of  307 0 million  up 78  year over year as U S  sales gained from higher demand  which made up for lower realized prices  Ex U S  sales were driven by increased volume from new launches  Taltz was launched for the second indication of psoriatic arthritis in late 2017 early 2018 in both the United States and Europe  which contributed to sales growth in the quarter Lartruvo generated revenues of  83 5 million in the quarter  higher than  76 9 million in the previous quarter  However  earlier this month  Lilly announced that Lartruvo  which had won conditional approval two years back  failed to improve survival in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma in a late stage confirmatory study  ANNOUNCE  Continued approval was contingent on verification of clinical benefit in a confirmatory study  With ANNOUNCE failing to confirm clinical benefit  Lilly said it will stop promoting Lartruvo while being in discussion with global regulators to determine the next steps for the drug  Though the negative update did not have any impact on fourth quarter results  sales of the drug should decline sharply in 2019 New rheumatoid arthritis drug  Olumiant generated sales of  70 1 million in the quarter backed by launch uptake in new European markets  compared with  55 6 million in the previous quarter  In the United States  Olumiant recorded sales of  4 2 million  higher than  0 8 million in the previous quarter  In the United States  only the lower dose of the medicine is approved for marketing Advanced breast cancer treatment  Verzenio  launched in the Unites States in late 2017  generated sales of  83 1 million in the quarter  which was less than  84 5 million in the previous quarter  This is because increased demand was more than offset by the negative impact of wholesaler buying patterns and lower realized prices The newly launched CGRP antibody  Emgality generated sales of  4 9 million in the quarter Animal Health segment sales rose 3  to  816 5 million Gross Margin   Operating Income Adjusted gross margin of 76 6  in the quarter rose 50 basis points driven by manufacturing efficiencies  which offset the negative impact of lower prices Operating income increased 15  year over year to  1 62 billion on higher revenues and lower operating costs  Total operating expenses  including research and development and marketing  selling and administrative expenses   as a percent of revenues  declined 190 basis points in the quarter to 51 1   This is because the company s cost saving efforts offset the impact of higher marketing costs to support Emgality s launch 2018 ResultsFull year 2018 sales rose 7  to  24 56 billion  marginally beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  24 46 billion  Revenues were slightly above the guided range of  24 3 billion to  24 5 billion Adjusted earnings for 2018 were  5 55 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 58 but up 30  year over year  Earnings came in at the lower end of the guided range of  5 55 to  5 60 per share Lowers 2019 OutlookLilly lowered its previously issued earnings and sales guidance for 2019 to account for the costs related to the pending acquisition of Loxo Oncology  Inc    NASDAQ LOXO   and the hit from the study failure for Lartruvo Earlier this year  Lilly announced a definitive deal to acquire small cancer biotech  Loxo Oncology for  8 billion in cash to broaden the scope of its oncology portfolio into precision medicines The earnings forecast was reduced from a range of  5 90 to  6 00 to  5 55 to  5 65 per share  Lilly now expects revenues to be between  25 1 billion and  25 6 billion in 2019  down from the prior expectations of  25 3 billion and  25 8 billion Our TakeLilly s fourth quarter results were mixed as it beat estimates for sales but missed the same for earnings  Shares of the drug giant declined almost 3  in pre market trading due to the guidance cut by the company  However  in the past year  Lilly s shares have risen 56 9  compared with the  s increase of 6 1    In 2019  revenue growth is expected to be driven by higher demand for its newer medicines including Trulicity  Jardiance  Taltz  Verzenio as well as newly launched migraine drug  Emgality as some older drugs like Cialis lose patent exclusivity  Lilly has launched 10 medicines over the past five years  most of which were successful  Emgality could emerge as a significant contributor to Lilly s long term growthLilly expects U S  regulatory action for nasal glucagon for hypoglycemia and lasmiditan for acute migraine in 2019 as well as line extension approvals for several medicines  which could drive revenue growth in 2019 However  competitive pressure on Lilly s drugs is expected to rise in 2019  Generic competition for several drugs including Cialis  rising pricing pressure in the United States and some international markets  currency headwinds and the impact of the failed Lartruvo study are expected to put pressure on the top line Also  Emgality faces strong competition from Teva and Amgen s   NASDAQ AMGN   CGRPs  Ajovy and Aimovig  respectively  which were also launched last year Lilly currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You

149601,371117,AMGN,Teva  TEVA  To Report Q4 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd    NYSE TEVA   will report fourth quarter and full year earnings on Feb 13  before market open  In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 23 64  
This generic drugmaker s shares have declined 1 4  this year so far compared with the  s decline of 14 2  

 
Teva s earnings surpassed expectations in all the last four quarters  with the average positive surprise being 23 28  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd  Price and EPS Surprise
 

    
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Teva reports under two segments   North America  United States and Canada   Europe and International Markets 
Pricing erosion in U S  generics market  lower sales of key multiple sclerosis drug  Copaxone and divestiture of some non core assets in the Women s Health business are expected to hurt North America segment sales in the fourth quarter  On the third quarter call  management had said that despite generic competition for the 20 mg as well as the 40 mg formulation  Copaxone maintained its market share in the United States  Copaxone sales in the quarter were better than management expectations as pricing pressure on the 40 mg dose was less than forecast  It remains to be seen if the positive trend continues in the fourth quarter 
Importantly  sales of all other branded products Bendeka  Treanda  ProAir and Qvar declined in the past two quarters  The chances of sales trends improving in the fourth quarter are minimal 
Meanwhile  additional competition for Teva s largest product  Concerta authorized generic  will also hurt generics sales in the quarter  Importantly  on the third quarter call  the company said it is seeing signs of stabilization in U S  generic drug pricing 
The company also said that the rate of sales erosion in the North American Generic business slowed significantly in the third quarter from second quarter levels due to optimization of its generics product portfolio as well as product launches  The positive trend is expected to continue in the fourth quarter  Important generic launches in the third quarter were that of Mylan s   NASDAQ MYL   EpiPen  epinephrine  auto injector for severe allergy treatment and Lilly s   NYSE LLY   erectile dysfunction drug Cialis 
Importantly  on the call  investors will be keen to know the initial launch update of Teva s newly launched anti calcitonin gene related peptide   CGRP   drug  Ajovy  fremanezumab  injection  as a preventive treatment for migraine  Investors will also be interested to know how management plans to capture market share for Ajovy against Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  and Lilly s CGRPs  which were also launched last year 
Meanwhile  in Europe as well as International Markets  loss of revenues from the divestiture of the women s health business and discontinued business activities are likely to hurt sales  The decline in sales of generic medicines and Copaxone is expected to continue  which can offset the positive impact of generic launches  The currency tailwind that this segment enjoyed in the first half reversed in the third quarter  which hurt revenues  Currency is expected to remain a headwind in the fourth quarter as well 
Cost savings from Teva s aggressive restructuring initiatives are likely to provide some support to the bottom line  Teva has a new organizational structure in place  is closing plants  cutting down its generics portfolio  divesting non core assets  eliminating low value R D projects  and is significantly cutting its global workforce  Teva expects to save almost  3 billion by the end of 2019 from these initiatives  
However  marketing costs are expected to be higher in the fourth quarter due to investments to support Ajovy s launch 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Teva is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Earnings ESP  Its Earnings ESP is  0 45   The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 56 cents per share  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Teva s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  or  5  Strong Sell  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
A generic drugmaker  which has the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around is Mallinckrodt Public Ltd  Company   NYSE MNK    Mallinckrodt is slated to announce financial figures on Feb 26  The company has an Earnings ESP of  2 25  and is a Zacks  2 Ranked stock  You can see

149611,371127,AMGN,Key Takeaways From Eli Lilly s  LLY  Q4 Earnings Report,opinion,"Eli Lilly   Company s   NYSE LLY   fourth quarter and full year 2018 results were mixed as it beat estimates for sales but missed the same for earnings   While earnings of  1 33 per share rose 17  from the year ago quarter  sales rose 5  backed by strong demand for its new drugs led by Trulicity  Taltz  Jardiance and Basaglar  which made up for lower sales of established products like Cialis and Forteo 
Other than the usual top and bottom line numbers  Lilly s CEO Dave Ricks also discussed Lilly s outlook for 2019  He threw light on Lilly s excellent pipeline progress in 2018 with internal and external innovation investments yielding multiple approvals  submissions  and positive phase III readouts  along with several significant first in class additions to the company s late stage pipeline
New Drugs to Drive Top Line in 2019  Since 2014  Lilly has launched 10 medicines  the latest being its CGRP antibody for the preventive treatment of migraine  Emgality  Most of Lilly s new drugs have been successful and are expected to account for 45  of Lilly s pharmaceuticals sales in 2019  much higher than 34  in 2018  Meanwhile  most of these new drugsare also being evaluated for additional indications label expansions 
At the Q4 conference call  management highlighted that in 2019  Lilly s revenue should be driven by higher demand for its newer medicines including Trulicity  Jardiance  Taltz  Verzenio as well Emgality as some older drugs like erectile dysfunction medicine  Cialis face generic competition  Lilly lost exclusivity for Cialis in September 2018 and generic versions entered the market in the same month resulting in rapid erosion of sales 
Lilly expects U S  regulatory action for its nasal glucagon for hypoglycemia and lasmiditan for acute migraine in 2019 as well as line extension approvals for several medicines  which could drive revenue growth in 2019  Loxo s newly approved marketed drug Vitrakvi should also support the top line believes Lilly s management  In January this year  Lilly announced a definitive deal to acquire  Oncology  Inc  for  8 billion in cash 
Pipeline Successes in 2018  On the call  Dave Ricks also discussed the company s significant pipeline progress in 2018 with several positive late stage data readouts  multiple approvals and regulatory submissions  A key regulatory success for Lilly was the FDA approval of Emgality  which could emerge as a significant contributor to long term growth  Other important approvals in 2018 were that of JAK inhibitor  Olumiant  baricitinib  in the United States and breast cancer drug Verzenio in first line setting in the United States  Europe as well as Japan 
In fact  the pipeline successes were the key reason for the stock s massive outperformance in the past year  Lilly s shares have risen 55 1  compared with the  s increase of 5 2  in the said time frame 

 
New Collaboration and Loxo Acquisition Strengthens Portfolio  Lilly also added promising new pipeline assets in 2018 through business development deals  The pending acquisition of Loxo Oncology is expected to broaden the scope of Lilly s oncology portfolio into precision medicines  In addition  with the acquisition of California based immuno oncology biotech  ARMO Biosciences in June 2018  Lilly added pancreatic cancer candidate  pegilodecakin  to its pipeline 
At the recently held prestigious J P  Morgan Healthcare Conference  Ricks said that the company will continue to evaluate other potential deal targets to enhance its position in its core therapeutic areas like cancer  immunology and neuroscience 
Headwinds Remain
Though new drugs should drive the top line in 2019  generic competition for several drugs including Cialis  rising pricing pressure in the United States and some international markets  currency headwinds and the impact of the failed Lartruvo study are expected to put pressure on the top line  We remind investors that in early 2019  Lilly announced that its drug Lartruvo  which had won conditional approval in 2016  failed to improve survival in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma in a late stage confirmatory study  ANNOUNCE  With ANNOUNCE failing to confirm clinical benefit  Lilly stopped promoting Lartruvo 
In fact  the study failure and costs related to the pending acquisition of Loxo led Lilly management to lower the previously issued 2019 sales and earnings guidance  The earnings forecast was reduced from a range of  5 90 to  6 00 to  5 55 to  5 65 per share  Revenues are now expected to be between  25 1 billion and  25 6 billion in 2019  down from the prior expectation of  25 3 billion and  25 8 billion 
Importantly  all eyes will be on the performance of Emgality in 2019  It will face intense competition from other CGRP antibodies Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN   Novartis    NYSE NVS   Aimovig and Teva Pharmaceutical s   NYSE TEVA   Ajovy  Both were launched in the United States in the latter half of 2018

149625,371141,AMGN,Amgen  AMGN  To Report Q4 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,We expect Amgen Inc    NASDAQ AMGN   to beat estimates when it reports fourth quarter and full year 2018 results on Jan 29  after market close  Amgen delivered positive earnings surprise of 7 89  last quarter Amgen shares have risen 0 4  in the past year against 23 9  decrease registered by the  during this period   Amgen s performance has been modest  with the company delivering a positive surprise in three out of the trailing four quarters  The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 4 80  Let s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter Factors at PlayAmgen s newer products like Prolia  Kyprolis  Xgeva  Blincyto are expected to perform well backed by higher demand  making up for lower sales of mature brands like Enbrel  Aranesp  Epogen  Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure High demand and share gains in both the United States and international markets should drive sales of Prolia  Though seasonality hurt sales of the product somewhat in the third quarter  it should not have any impact in the fourth quarter In 2018  Xgeva gained approval in both United States and EU for the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with multiple myeloma  The approval for the expanded patient population drove higher volumes of Xgeva in the past two quarters  a trend we expect will continue in the fourth quarter In the third quarter  Blincyto was approved in Japan and for the pediatric patient population in the United States  This label expansion may add significantly to sales in the fourth quarter Kyprolis sales should continue to be driven by increased demand and robust uptake in outside U S  markets  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Prolia  Xgeva  Blincyto and Kyprolis is pegged at  613 million   445 million   61 million and  260 million  respectively Sales of Amgen s PCSK9 inhibitor  Repatha  have suffered since launch due to payer restrictions  On the Q3 call  the company said that despite its efforts to improve access to Repatha  patients still face significant hurdles due to high co pay expenses  In response  Amgen cut the U S  list price of Repatha by 60  to improve access and affordability of Repatha  Though lower price may impact Repatha sales in the near term  management is optimistic about better volume growth in the fourth quarter and beyond  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Repatha is  163 million Amgen s newly launched secondary hyperparathyroidism treatment Parsabiv recorded significantly improved sales in the third quarter  We expect the drug to generate higher sales in the fourth quarter However  Amgen s mature drugs like Enbrel  Aranesp  Epogen  Neupogen and Neulasta are facing an array of branded and generic competitors  Novartis    NYSE NVS   generic arm Sandoz and Teva are marketing biosimilar versions of Neupogen in the United States  thereby hurting Neupogen s sales  Mylan s biosimilar version of Neulasta  Fulphila  which is priced at a discount of 33  to Neulasta s list price  was launched in the United States in July  This led to a sharp decline in sales of Neulasta in the third quarter with the negative trend expected to continue in the fourth  Pfizer s Retacrit  the first biosimilar version of Epogen  was launched in November 2018 and may hurt Amgen s branded drug sales in the fourth quarter Investor focus on the call will be on management s comments on sales uptake of its newly approved migraine drug  Aimovig  Aimovig erenumab for prevention of migraine was approved and launched in the United States in second quarter of 2018  Aimovig was approved in EU in July  On the Q3 conference call  the company said that Aimovig is off to a strong start  Regarding competitive pressure from Teva s and Lilly s CGRPs  which were also approved in 2018  management sounded confident of its ability to compete with Aimovig s differentiated product profile On the third quarter call  Amgen warned that operating costs in the fourth quarter are expected to increase in the range of 12  15  sequentiallyEarnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Amgen is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for a likely positive

Quarter in Detail
Novartis operates under three segments  Innovative Medicines  pharmaceuticals   Alcon  ophthalmology unit  and Sandoz  generics  
The Innovative Medicines division recorded sales of  9 billion  up 9   Both pharmaceuticals and oncology business units recorded growth  Pharmaceuticals unit was up 8   while the Oncology unit increased 11    Psoriasis drug  Cosentyx continues to gain traction  Cosentyx sales increased to  806 million  up 33   driven by strong demand growth in all indications in the United States and EU  Entresto s sales grew 76  to  318 million  driven by increased worldwide uptake 
Oncology franchise grew 11   driven by Promacta Revolade  the Tafinlar plus Mekinist combination  and contribution from the Advanced Accelerator Applications  AAA  acquisition  Sales from AAA came in at  135 million  driven by the launch of Lutathera   81 million 
Sales at the Sandoz division were  2 5 billion  down 5  due to price erosion in the United States  Sales in the United States declined due to pricing pressure  Biopharmaceuticals sales grew 29   mainly driven by launches of Rixathon  the biosimilar version of Rituxan  rituximab   Erelzi  the biosimilar of Enbrel in the EU  and Zarxio  filgrastim  in the United States

Business Restructuring
In September 2018  Novartis announced that it agreed to sell selected portions of its Sandoz US portfolio  specifically the Sandoz US dermatology business and the US oral solids portfolio  The divestiture is in accordance with Sandoz s strategy of focusing on complex generics  value added medicines and biosimilars to achieve sustainable and profitable growth in the United States in the long run  The transaction will be completed in 2019 
Earlier  Novartis announced that it intends to spin off its ophthalmology division  Alcon  into a separately traded standalone company to grow as a medicines company solely  The spin off will be completed in the first half of 2019 
Novartis also sold its stake in consumer healthcare joint venture to GlaxoSmithKline   NYSE GSK   for  13 billion 
Outlook Updated
The company expects net sales in 2019 to grow mid single digit  Innovative Medicines is projected to grow mid single digit  Revenues from Sandoz are expected to be broadly in line with that in 2018 
Pipeline Update
Gene therapy Luxturna was approved in EU to restore vision and prevent blindness in patients with biallelic RPE65 mutations  We remind investors that Novartis licensed ex U S  rights for Luxturna from Spark Therapeutics   NASDAQ ONCE   
The FDA approved Promacta for first line treatment of severe aplastic anemia  SAA   and Breakthrough Therapy designation was granted to the drug for the treatment of low platelet counts in people exposed to radiation 
Gilenya was approved in Europe for the treatment of multiple sclerosis  MS  in pediatric patients  based on the results of the PARADIGMS study 
Sandoz s biosimilar of Amgen s   NASDAQ AMGN   Neulasta was approved in Europe 
Our Take
Novartis  fourth quarter results missed estimates  The last year was a transformative year for Novartis as it restructured its business and plans to focus on becoming a core drug focused company  powered by data and digital technologies 
The company is looking to solidify its presence in the gene therapy space  It acquired U S  based clinical stage gene therapy company  AveXis  Inc  The company also acquired Endocyte to expand expertise in radiopharmaceuticals  We expect further acquisitions in the coming months as the company looks to further restructure its business 
Novartis  stock has gained 3 8  in the last six months far compared with the  s 9 0  growth

 
However  the generic division  Sandoz continues to face pricing pressure  The division also suffered a blow when the FDA issued a CRL to its generic of Advair Diskus

149682,371198,AMGN,Can Amgen  AMGN  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Amgen  AMGN   This company  which is in the Zacks Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This world s largest biotech drugmaker has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 8 35  
For the last reported quarter  Amgen came out with earnings of  3 69 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 42 per share  representing a surprise of 7 89   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  3 52 per share and it actually produced earnings of  3 83 per share  delivering a surprise of 8 81  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Amgen  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Amgen has an Earnings ESP of  0 25  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 29  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-amgen-amgn-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200377701,200377701

positive pipeline and regulatory updates Strong Third Quarter ResultsLast month  Amgen reported impressive third quarter 2018 results  It beat estimates for both earnings and sales and also increased its guidance for the year Third quarter 2018 earnings of  3 69 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 42  Earnings increased 13  year over year driven mainly by lower tax rate and share repurchases  Total revenues of  5 90 billion in the quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 80 billion and increased 2  year over year Total product revenues increased 1  from the year ago quarter as increasing demand for newer products like Prolia  Kyprolis  Xgeva  Blincyto and Parsabiv was partially offset by lower sales of mature brands like Enbrel  Aranesp  Epogen  Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure Amgen raised its sales and earnings guidance for 2018 driven by a better than expected performance in the third quarter and an optimistic guidance for the fourth quarter  The company now expects revenues in the range of  23 2  23 5 billion compared with the previous prediction of  22 5  23 2 billion  The high end of the guidance assumes that no Sensipar generics are launched this year Pipeline   Regulatory Successes This year  Amgen made rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions Aimovig erenumab for prevention of migraine was approved and launched in the United States in the second quarter of 2018  Aimovig was the first FDA approved treatment  specifically developed to treat migraine by blocking calcitonin gene related peptide  CGRP   Aimovig was approved in the EU in July  Amgen has developed Aimovig in partnership with Novartis   NYSE NVS   On the third quarter conference call  the company said that Aimovig is off to a strong start and 100 000 patients have started treatment with Aimovig since launch through 12 000 different prescribers  Regarding competitive pressure from Teva s   NYSE TEVA   and Lilly s   NYSE LLY   CGRPs  which were also approved this year  management sounded confident in its ability to compete with Aimovig s differentiated product profile Amgen also gained approval for several line extensions this year   Prolia and Xgeva were approved for new indications  glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis and prevention of SRE in multiple myeloma patients  respectively  in the United States and EU  Blincyto was approved in the United States for a new indication  minimal residual disease  MRD  positive B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia   ALL   The line extensions expanded the eligible patient populations of these drugs and will drive their sales higher in future quarters  Also  in 2017 early 2018  Amgen gained regulatory approvals to include overall survival data from key studies on the labels of Kyprolis and Blincyto  which added to sales of these products Biosimilars  A Long Term Growth DriverAmgen has also delivered on its biosimilars pipeline so far this year  which represents significant growth opportunity  Two of its biosimilars  Kanjinti  a biosimilar of Roche s cancer drug Herceptin  and Amjevita  biosimilar of Abbvie s blockbuster RA drug  Humira  were launched in EU this year and can contribute to sales in the future quarters  Amgen has eight biosimilars in its pipeline  which could be an important long term growth driver for the companyChallenges in StoreAmgen faces challenges related to its more mature products such as launch of competing biosimilar versions of Neulasta and Epogen  further sales erosion of Neupogen and Aranesp and increasing competitive pressures on Enbrel Novartis  generic arm Sandoz and Teva are already marketing biosimilar versions of Neupogen in the United States  which are hurting Neupogen s sales  Mylan s biosimilar version of Neulasta  Fulphila  which is priced at a discount of 33  to Neulasta s list price  was launched in the United States in July and hurt sales of Neulasta in the third quarter of 2018 More biosimilars are expected to be launched by the end of next year  which will put further pressure on Neulasta sales  Pfizer s Retacrit  the first biosimilar version of Epogen  was approved in May 2018 and may be launched soon  Sensipar lost patent exclusivity in March 2018 and generics may to be launched  at risk  this year The softness in sales of Enbrel  Amgen s largest product  is also a cause for concern  Pricing pressure and stiff competition are hurting sales of Enbrel  one of the main drivers of Amgen s revenues Meanwhile  uptake of key new drug  Repatha has been slow due to payer restrictions  On the third quarter conference call  the company said that despite its efforts to improve patient access to Repatha  patients still face significant hurdles due to high co pay expenses

	For the second time this week  a potentially huge market moving event played out as planned  Generally speaking  there were no big surprises in the midterm elections  and nor were there any bombshells in today s Fed statement  Stocks were a bit listless on Thursday with two of the major indices in the red for the session  but overall most of yesterday s sharp rally was maintained 
	The Dow soared nearly 550 points on Wednesday after it became clear that the new Congress would be split between the parties  The index held onto all of that today with a rise of 0 04  to 26 191 22  though it had been higher by more than 100 points earlier in the day 
	The other major indices didn t come along for the ride  Though off their lows of the session  the NASDAQ declined 0 53  to 7530 88 and the S P slipped 0 25  to 2806 83  It was another rough session for the FANGs with all of them moving lower 
	The Fed kept interest rates unchanged today  as was widely expected  However  the fourth hike of the year is almost definitely coming next month  And looking even further out  Powell   Friends plan to continue with  gradual  hikes in 2019 
	With the market protecting much of the midterm rally  stocks go into Friday s session solidly in the green for the week  Absent any sharp downturns  the major indices have a good chance to match or even beat last week s impressive returns that saw the NASDAQ climb 2 7  and the Dow and S P each rise 2 4   Fingers crossed that we have another session with no surprises tomorrow Today s Portfolio Highlights Surprise Trader  The market may have let its attention on earnings season waver a bit in the face of midterms and the Fed meeting  but Dave never did   On Thursday  the editor made his third buy of the week with a 12 5  allocation in cloud computing company NetApp  NASDAQ NTAP   The company has a positive Earnings ESP for the quarter coming after the bell on Wednesday  November 14  Furthermore  analysts are expecting earnings to grow more than 22  from last year  Dave also sold Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  and Archer Daniels Midland  ADM  for profits of 3 7  and 2 5   respectively  Read the full write up for more Income Investor   The central bank unsurprisingly held rates steady  setting us up for a fourth and final rate hike of 2018 next month 
	 Investors were hoping that the Fed might take notice of recent volatility in financial markets and walk back its hawkish tone slightly  but the new policy statement made no mention of the selling 
	 The only noticeable tweaks to the Fed s policy statement were a mention that unemployment had declined since its last meeting  and a note acknowledging that the  growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year  
	 Slowing business investment could be a concerning sign for investors  but no changes to the planned rate hike schedule and acknowledgment of our historic labor market balanced that out  and Wall Street effectively shrugged at the statement      Ryan McQueeneyCounterstrike   Markets were quiet after a couple wild days  Nothing wrong with a break in the action and I think that s what we saw today and will see tomorrow as we head into the weekend 
	 We have gotten past a lot of potential risk and the market will now digest what has happened  Most of the big earnings  the election and the Fed are all past us  so now we let the market show us the appropriate direction  I still think the highs are in for the year  but a strong Santa Claus rally fueled by positive China trade deal news is always possible      Jeremy Mullin

regulatory body for a triplet cancer combination for multiple myeloma Recap of the Week s Most Important StoriesEarnings  Lilly s third quarter  as it beat estimates for earnings but missed the same for sales  Lilly  however  raised its previously issued outlook for adjusted earnings while increasing the lower end of the total revenue guidance  Going forward  new products like Trulicity  Taltz  Basaglar  Cyramza  Jardiance  Lartruvo  Verzenio and Olumiant are expected to drive revenues AstraZeneca in the third quarter and maintained its previously issued outlook for 2018  AstraZeneca s product sales rose 9  at CER in the quarter to  5 27 billion  Higher sales of newer medicines  particularly cancer drugs  and strong performance in emerging markets  mainly China  offset lower sales of many other legacy medicines to drive product sales  With its product sales returning to growth after a long time  Pascal Soriot  AstraZeneca s chief executive officer  said this marks  the start of a period of sustained growth  for several years Pfizer Gets FDA Nod for Another Cancer Medicine  Pfizer gained FDA s accelerated approval for a cancer medicine  lorlatinib  to be marketed by the trade name of Lorbrena  Lorbrena can be prescribed for the treatment of patients with ALK positive metastatic non small cell lung cancer   NSCLC   who have received prior treatment with one or more ALK TKIs This is the third cancer medicine approval for Pfizer in less than two months  In late September  it gained FDA approval for Vizimpro  dacomitinib  for the first line treatment of metastatic non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  in patients with EGFR activating mutations  In October  the FDA approved Talzenna  talazoparib   an orally available PARP inhibitor for advanced breast cancer Bristol Myers Cancer Combination Drugs in Focus  Bristol Myers gained FDA approval for a new immunotherapy combination   a triplet combination of Empliciti  elotuzumab   pomalidomide and dexamethasone for certain previously treated patients with multiple myeloma Pharmaceuticals to evaluate a combination of its PD 1 inhibitor  Opdivo and Infinity s investigational immunotherapy  IPI 549 for the treatment of advanced urothelial cancer  The companies plan to initiate MARIO 275  a randomized  global phase II study to evaluate the combination drugs in the first half of 2019  The combination drugs are already

Trulicity  which showed that the GLP 1 receptor agonist led to superior reduction in cardiovascular events like death  non fatal myocardial infarction  heart attack  or non fatal stroke in a broad range of type II diabetes patients  Importantly  only 31  of the participants in the REWIND study had established CV disease compared to other CV outcomes studies  which have a much greater percentage of type II diabetes patients already with a heart disease  The statistically significant heart risk reduction shown by Trulicity in the study demonstrates that the drug may be able to cater to a much broader patient population if the data is approved to be included on the label Meanwhile  initial data from a real world study  EMPRISE  showed that Jardiance was associated with reduced risk for hospitalization for heart failure compared with DPP 4 inhibitors in type II diabetes patients with and without cardiovascular disease Lilly signed a multi year collaboration deal with small cancer biotech  NextCure  Inc  to develop novel cancer targets utilizing the latter s proprietary discovery platform   FIND IO  For the deal  Lilly will make an upfront payment of  25 million to NextCure and

Estimate of  3 42  Earnings increased 13  year over year driven mainly by lower tax rate and share repurchases Total revenues of  5 90 billion in the quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 80 billion and increased 2  year over year So far this year  Amgen s stock has risen 8 8  against 19 8  decrease of its    Quarter in DetailTotal product revenues increased 1  from the year ago quarter to  5 51 billion  U S    4 26 billion  ex U S    1 25 billion  as increasing demand for newer products like Prolia  Kyprolis  Xgeva  Blincyto and Parsabiv was partially offset by lower sales of mature brands like Enbrel  Aranesp  Epogen  Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure Prolia revenues came in at  532 million  up 15  from the year ago quarter  attributable to 16  volume growth resulting from higher demand and share gains in both the United States and international markets Xgeva delivered revenues of  433 million  up 12  from the year ago quarter mainly due to higher demand  which drove volumes  This year  Xgeva gained approval in both United States and EU for the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with multiple myeloma  The approval for the expanded patient population drove higher volumes of Xgeva this quarter Vectibix revenues came in at  181 million  up 8   driven by higher demand  which made up for lower prices Kyprolis recorded sales of  232 million  up 12  year over year  driven primarily by robust uptake in outside U S  markets  Early this month  Amgen gained FDA approval for a once weekly dosing regimen of Kyprolis in combination with dexamethasone Blincyto sales increased 12  from the year ago period to  58 million  reflecting rise in demand  In the third quarter Blincyto was approved in Japan and for pediatric use in EU Amgen s PCSK9 inhibitor  Repatha  generated revenues of  120 million  up 30  year over year as higher unit demand was offset by lower prices  Last week  Amgen announced its decision to cut the U S  list price of Repatha by 60  to improve access and affordability of Repatha  Sales of the drug have suffered since launch due to payer restrictions  Though lower price may impact Repatha sales in the near term  management is optimistic to see better volume growth Parsabiv  launched in several markets including United States in the first quarter  recorded sales of  102 million in the third quarter  much higher than  73 million in the previous quarter Amgen s newly launched CGRP inhibitor for migraine prevention  Aimovig  erenumab  recorded sales of  22 million in the quarter  Aimovig was approved in the EU in July However  Amgen s mature drugs like Enbrel  Aranesp  Epogen  Neupogen and Neulasta are facing an array of branded and generic competitors  While Neupogen has been facing U S  biosimilar competition for some time now  Neulasta began facing the same this year  Also biosimilar versions of Epogen and Sensipar may be launched anytime soon Revenues of Amgen s erythropoiesis stimulating agent  ESA   Aranesp  declined 8  from the prior year quarter to  477 million on lower demand primarily due to increased competitive pressure Revenues of the other ESA  Epogen  declined 5  to  252 million due to lower selling prices as the category has become extremely competitive  Also Pfizer s   NYSE PFE   Retacrit  the first biosimilar version of Epogen  was approved in May 2018 and may be launched soon  With the launch of Retacrit and other biosimilars  there could be a further decline in selling price Neulasta revenues declined 6  to  1 05 billion from the year ago period on lower volumes and selling prices due to biosimilar competition in the United States  Mylan s   NASDAQ MYL   biosimilar version of Neulasta  Fulphila  which is priced at a discount of 33  to Neulasta s list price  was launched in July  which hurt sales of Neulasta in the third quarter  More biosimilars are expected to be launched by the end of next year  which will put further pressure on Neulasta sales Also increased competition from PD 1s and other new cancer therapies are hurting demand for the class of medicines to which Neulasta belongs  However  the Neulasta Onpro kit  on body injector  continues to perform well  commanding a market share of more than 60  in the United States for all Neulasta sales Neupogen recorded a 38  decline in sales to  85 million due to biosimilar competition in the United States  which hurt demand and prices  Novartis    NYSE NVS   generic arm Sandoz and Teva are marketing biosimilar versions of Neupogen   In July  Pfizer also gained FDA approval for its biosimilar version of Neupogen Enbrel delivered revenues of  1 29 billion  down 5  from the year ago quarter due to lower prices and increased competition  which hurt demand  The adverse effect was somewhat offset by some favorable accounting adjustments Sensipar Mimpara revenues declined 11  to  409 million hurt by Parsabiv launch  which is also marketed for secondary hyperparathyroidism  Sensipar also lost patent exclusivity in March 2018 and generics may be launched  at risk  this year Other product sales rose 36  to  87 million  Other revenues of  394

149883,371399,AMGN,Radius Health  RDUS  Posts Narrower Than Expected Q3 Loss,opinion,"Radius Health  Inc    NASDAQ RDUS   reported encouraging results for the third quarter of 2018  wherein loss was narrower than expected  while sales beat estimates 
Following the announcement of the results  shares gained 12 1   However  Radius Health s shares have lost 41 9  in the year so far  compared with the  growth of 3 6  

 
The company reported a loss of  0 85 per share in the quarter  narrower than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  1 01 and the year ago period loss of  1 12  An increase in revenues led to the narrower than anticipated loss on a year over year basis 
The company reported Tymlos  sales of  27 6 million  marginally surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  27 3 million 
Quarter in Detail
Tymlos  sales also increased 22  sequentially  We remind investors that Radius Health obtained the FDA approval for Tymlos  abaloparatide  injection in April 2017 for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture  The company began shipments of the drug to wholesalers at the end of May 2017  Hence  revenues recorded in the year ago quarter were  3 5 million only 
Total prescriptions accounted for 22  of total U S  anabolic osteoporosis market  based on Patient Months on Therapy  TRx PMOT  in the quarter 
In October 2018  the FDA approved a labeling supplement for Tymlos to include additional information from the ACTIVExtend study  The labeling now reflects that after 24 months of open label alendronate therapy  the vertebral fracture risk reduction achieved with Tymlos therapy was maintained 
Research and development expenses for the reported quarter were  26 8 million  up 28  year over year  General and administrative expenses decreased 9  to  43 7 million  owing to decrease in compensation and travel related expenses 
Pipeline Updates
The pipeline includes abaloparatide injection for potential use in the treatment of men with osteoporosis  abaloparatide patch for potential use in osteoporosis  and elacestrant  RAD1901  for potential use in hormone receptor positive breast cancer 
The company is developing two formulations   abaloparatide Subcutaneous  SC  and abaloparatide transdermal patch  Radius Health is on track with its preparations for the phase III trial on abaloparatide patch and expects to start the study in mid 2019  The company is in the process of conducting development activities for the phase III trial and a potential NDA filing 
The company s Marketing Authorisation Application  MAA  for abaloparatide SC in Europe  for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis  was under review  However  in July 2018  the company announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP   the scientific committee of the European Medicines Agency  EMA   has communicated a negative trend vote for the MAA  following a re examination procedure  Thereafter  the CHMP communicated that it maintained its negative opinion on the MAA at its formal final vote 
During the third quarter  Radius Health finalized the phase III study protocol for elacestrant based on regulatory feedback and additional considerations  The phase III trial will be a single  randomized  open label  active controlled study of elacestrant as a second  or third line monotherapy in approximately 460 patients with ER  HER2  advanced metastatic breast cancer who have received prior treatment with one or two lines of endocrine therapy  including a cyclin dependent kinase  CDK  4 6 inhibitor 
Patients in the study will be randomized to receive either elacestrant or the investigator s choice of an approved hormonal agent  The primary endpoint of the study will be progression free survival  PFS  
Secondary endpoints will include evaluation of overall survival  OS   objective response rate  ORR   and duration of response  DOR   Radius Health expects to submit marketing approvals for elacestrant as a second  and third line monotherapy in the U S   European Union  EU   and other markets based on results from the trial  The phase III study will be initiated in the fourth quarter of 2018 with a planned recruitment period of 18 21 months and potential data read out in 2021 
Guidance
Radius Health expects Tymlos net revenues around  95  98 million in 2018 and  155  175 million in 2019 
Our Take
The company s narrower than expected loss in the third quarter was encouraging as sales of Tymlos continue to gain traction 
Radius Health expects Tymlos to capture an average of 19 21  of the U S  anabolic osteoporosis market in 2018  while anabolic market in the United States is expected to increase 7 9  in volumes   Tymlos is expected to be covered for approximately 274 million insured lives  representing approximately 95  of U S  commercial and 64  of Medicare insured lives effective Jan 1  2019 
Although the osteoporosis market in the United Sates has great potential  Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly   Co s   NYSE LLY   Forteo and Amgen s   NASDAQ AMGN   Prolia

149900,371416,AMGN,Teva  Investors Split On Outlook,opinion,"Fremanezumab Chronic Cluster Trial Failure Seen as Non Issue  but Cluster Pathway Still Unclear
On June 15  Teva Pharma Industries Ltd ADR  NYSE TEVA  announced that they would be discontinuing its fremanezumab clinical trial for chronic cluster headaches  CCH   Investors have largely noted that the discontinuation of the clinical trial for CCH does not materially impact their thesis or estimates  However  Teva still faces a number of obstacles before fremanezumab can be filed 
To provide some background  we should first talk about the size and scope of cluster and migraine headaches  The addressable market in the US for migraine headaches is about 10 million people  that qualify for migraine preventives   and it is among the top 10 causes of global disability  Cluster headache prevalence in the US is about 350 000 people  Within that 350 000 people experiencing cluster headaches  there are two kinds of cluster headaches  episodic and chronic  Episodic cluster headaches can last from 7 days to a year  and include 1  months of pain free remission periods  These make up about 80 90  of cluster headaches  The remaining 10 20  is chronic cluster headaches  which can last longer than a year  and either have no remission or a brief remission of less than a month 
Getting positive clinical trial data for both chronic and episodic cluster headaches would have been great for a couple reasons  First  there are currently no approved therapy options for cluster headaches  Second  it s an extremely debilitating illness for many people 
However  chronic cluster headaches impact the smallest number of people within the three types of headaches  Teva still is pursuing the larger indications   episodic cluster headaches and migraine headaches  Additionally  Eli Lilly s galcenezumab had already failed a phase 3 trial for the same CCH indication  Investors already knew that there was more risk around the cluster headache indication  and therefore had not actually baked in any cluster headache sales in their consensus estimates for fremanezumab  Consensus estimates remain largely unchanged 
This does not mean that Teva is in the clear on fremanezumab  though  In particular  the filing path for episodic cluster headaches remains unclear  Teva management noted that they could potentially receive results for the episodic cluster headaches in 1H19  Even if they receive approval  it is unclear if they would need to run an additional phase 3 trial before filing with the FDA  If they do need an additional trial  submission could be pushed out by several more years 
There is also risk around the migraine headache path  Recall that the company has a PDUFA action date on September 16  Some analysts and investors have expressed reservations around the company s ability to get all inspections and resubmissions ready by that date  However  should they be able to do so  and receive approval  the company could essentially be in line with Eli Lilly s galcanezumab to market  and closely behind Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  s Aimovig 
The company recently announced that they will be presenting more fremanezumab clinical trial data at the American Headache Society  which is occurring right now as of this writing  June 28 July 1  
Copaxone Has Proven More Resilient than Expected  but Longer Term Outlook Remains In Question
Copaxone and its rate of sales erosion remains a key topic among investors  Copaxone generated roughly 17  of total sales in 2017  Late last year  Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  received approval for both its 20mg and 40mg Copaxone generic  which caught many investors by surprise  After the approval  investors widely expected significant sales erosion for Teva  especially after Mylan was able to capture roughly 10  of the market out of the gate  Expectations for Teva s Copaxone sales lowered even further after Momenta Sandoz received approval for its 40mg generic in February this year 
However  since the beginning of the year  share gains by Mylan have slowed  as Teva notes that the generic Copaxone has only captured 15  of the market  Momenta Sandoz also struggled to launch their generic despite receiving approval over 4 months ago 

As a result  investors have raised Teva s Copaxone sales expectations for the year as the drug has proven more resilient than expected  This has been a major reason for Teva s recent stock outperformance  the stock is now up over 100  since its bottom in November of last year   One reason cited by analysts for the resilience has been aggressive discounting by Teva  which has eliminated the financial incentive for physicians to recommend switching to the generic version  Additionally  physician feedback has suggested that Teva s patient support network was much stronger than generic companies   which was a major deciding factor  Momenta Sandoz cited supply issues for its launch delay 
Moving forward  the outlook remains highly uncertain  Bulls would likely point to near term strength in Copaxone sales and its potential to outperform vs  consensus expectations  Bears would point to upcoming generics   Momenta Sandoz will likely address its supply issues  Amneal has guided to a generic Copaxone 20mg later this year and a 40mg potentially next year  and Dr  Reddy could have a generic Copaxone in 2020  In such an environment  bears believe it is inevitable that generic market share will rise more significantly 

ProAir Competition Delayed  Estimates Move Up
Similar to Copaxone  competition for Teva s ProAir has also been unexpectedly delayed  In early May  Perrigo announced a CRL for its generic ProAir  This would represent the third CRL for Perrigo s ProAir generic   the company received a CRL in 2016  and one in 2017  Perrigo management previously expected its ProAir generic to launch in 4Q18  investors are now expecting this to be a 2019 event  Lupin also has an upcoming action date this year  but given the issues in getting generic approval  investors do not expect an approval this year 
As a result of the delays  Teva s ProAir sales estimates  which previously factored in generic competition this year  are now being revised slightly upward  Should Perrigo or Lupin face any further headwinds  estimates could potentially move higher  In contrast  if they receive positive news or approval  Perrigo estimates may be revised downwards further  Consensus bakes in a more significant erosion in 2019 

Conclusion  Near Term Outlook Brighter  but 2019 Concerns Remain
Teva stock is controversial on the street  Bulls focus on the resilience of Copaxone sales  the new CEO  positive Austedo traction  indications that fremanezumab is still on track  signs of a recovery in the generic pricing environment  and the near term belief that consensus estimates will move higher 
Bears see the potential for continued weakness in the generic pricing environment  upcoming competition in Copaxone and ProAir that could lead to lower consensus estimates  uncertain details around the future of fremanezumab  and expensive valuation that leaves little room for error 
Copaxone s performance vs  consensus and the upcoming PDUFA date for fremanezumab on September 16 will be key factors for the stock ",2018-07-03,The Non-Consensus,https://www.investing.com/analysis/teva-investors-split-on-outlook-nearterm-outlook-not-as-bad-but-longerterm-con-200329012,200329012
149901,371417,AMGN,2 Reasons The Market Frowned After AbbVie s Blowout Q2,opinion,"AbbVie posts fantastic Q2 numbers but its stock falls  Here s why    and why the negative reaction is missing the bigger story 
AbbVie Inc  NYSE ABBV  did it again  The big drugmaker posted fantastic numbers in its first quarter results reported in April  AbbVie announced more great results with its second quarter earnings update on Friday 
Net revenue jumped 19  year over year to  8 28 billion  Adjusted earnings per share  EPS  soared nearly 41  in the second quarter to  2  Both numbers topped Wall Street estimates  AbbVie even boosted its full year 2018 adjusted EPS guidance from between  7 66 and  7 76 to between  7 76 and  7 86 
Despite AbbVie s blowout Q2 results  the market frowned  The big pharma company s share price declined in early trading on Friday  Here are two reasons behind this surprising response    and one big reason why investors actually should be excited about AbbVie s Q2 update 
AbbVie did it again  The big drugmaker posted fantastic numbers in its first quarter results reported in April  AbbVie announced more great results with its second quarter earnings update on Friday

Despite AbbVie s blowout Q2 results  the market frowned  The big pharma company s share price declined in early trading on Friday  Here are two reasons behind this surprising response    and one big reason why investors actually should be excited about AbbVie s Q2 update 
A big reason to be excited
There were actually several reasons why investors should have responded more enthusiastically to AbbVie s impressive Q2 results  However  I think I can roll the main reasons for excitement into one statement  Non Humira growth should be the big storyline for AbbVie going forward 
Of course  Mavyret will continue to be a key way that AbbVie s non Humira sales grow  But we can t leave out Imbruvica  Q2 sales for the cancer drug soared nearly 36  year over year  Approvals for more indications could be on the way 
Speaking of approvals  AbbVie just snagged a big one for Orilissa  elagolix   The FDA approved the drug in managing pain associated with endometriosis on July 24  AbbVie is also evaluating Orilissa in a late stage study targeting treatment of uterine fibroids 
In April  AbbVie submitted for FDA approval of risankizumab in treating psoriasis  The drug  along with another candidate  upadacitinib  is an important component of AbbVie s strategy to maintain its dominance in the immunology market even after Humira loses patent protection  They re also key reasons why market research firm EvaluatePharma ranks AbbVie s pipeline as No  2 in the industry 
But could sinking sales for Humira keep the spotlight off of AbbVie s other bright spots  Maybe  However  don t believe the doomsayers predicting that AbbVie is in trouble  The company recently signed an agreement to keep Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  s biosimilar to Humira off the U S  market until 2023 in a similar deal that it made last year with Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   AbbVie should have plenty of time for its current drugs and pipeline candidates to generate growth and offset any decline in sales for Humira 
Is the negative reaction to AbbVie s second quarter warranted  I don t think so  Imbruvica  Mavyret  Orilissa  a loaded pipeline  and a great dividend should turn investors  frowns into smiles over the long run ",2018-07-30,Keith Speights,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2-reasons-the-market-frowned-after-abbvies-blowout-q2--and-1-reason-it-should-200334464,200334464
149903,371419,AMGN,How To Buy Your Favorite Stocks At 14  Off  With Yields Up To 7  ,opinion,"If you ve read the headlines about tech s woeful slump in the past couple weeks  you might think stocks are out of favor 
You d be wrong and this chart proves it 
Forget the Headlines  Stocks Are Rolling 
After February s gut wrenching plunge  the S P 500 has more than recovered and is up 6 2  year to date  If this trend continues  we re looking at a 12 4  return on the year 
But look at the orange line above that s the tech benchmark PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   which is up 13 2  year to date  even after this latest correction in tech  That adds up to a monstrous 26 4  return for 2018 if that trend continues 
And I see these trends continuing  for both the market as a whole and for tech  as investors come back to this beleaguered sector 
Economic Strength Won t Be Denied
There are a couple reasons why I see stocks generally finishing up strong this year and a little further on I ll show you 2 great ways to pick up your favorite household names  and those of a certain Warren E  Buffett  too  at double digit discounts 
Oh  and you ll pocket cash dividends up to 7  while you do 
But first  back to where this incredible market run is headed from here 
One reason it s set to continue is that last week s report that US GDP rose a stunning 4 1  annualized in the second quarter is driving a lot of economists to raise their expectations for the full year  with 3  growth becoming increasingly expected 
This growth is largely thanks to two things  a stronger American consumer and increasingly profitable American companies 
Americans Go Back to Work   
A tighter job market means initial jobless claims have been falling at a steady rate over the last year  cutting the unemployment rate from 4 4  to 4   That s helping sales soar 
So far in the second quarter  73  of S P 500 companies are reporting sales above expectations  according to FactSet  That s also boosting stocks  earnings across all sectors 
  Sending Profits Soaring 
In normal times  a widespread earnings bonanza like this would be impressive  But expectations were already high  Going into the second quarter s earnings season  analysts forecasted a 21 3  profit increase from a year ago  so far  earnings for S P 500 companies have risen by just that  21 3  
And the good times aren t going to stop anytime soon companies have boosted expectations for next quarter  and analysts have boosted their expectations  too  Now all of 2018 is expected to provide a 20  jump in earnings  far above the S P 500 s still impressive 6 2  price gain 
That s another way of saying that stocks are actually cheaper in relation to forecast earnings than they were at the start of the year  despite their price gains and that points to more upside around the corner 
Like Rewinding the Clock 1 Year
If you ve been sitting on the sidelines watching this earnings surge  you might feel disheartened  But don t worry  you re not too late 
Because I want to show you 2 little known funds closed end funds  CEFs  to be specific that let you get into this strong stock market at a discount  Think of it as being able to buy today at prices we saw a year ago 
So let s get going  starting with 
CEF Pick No  1  Buy Like Buffett for 14  Off
Looking to get into the Oracle of Omaha s favorite stocks including his own company  Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  at a big discount 
You can do just that with the Boulder Growth and Income Closed Fund  NYSE BIF   a value investing CEF that puts a third of its assets in Berkshire while allocating much of the rest to Buffett s top picks  like JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM   Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  and Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  
By using Buffett s value investing approach  BIF has provided these returns to investors in the last year 
The Master s Strategy Delivers Nice Gains for BIF Holders 
And here s the best part BIF is far cheaper than it should be 
Thanks to a quirk in the CEF structure  BIF trades for less than the net asset value  NAV  of its portfolio  In fact  it s trading at a 13 9  discount to that NAV  which means you can buy every dollar of the shares BIF holds for about 86 cents if you buy BIF directly where you d get no discount if you bought those shares on the open market 
Plus  since BIF is diversified across dozens of strong large cap companies  you get diversification on top of a share of the Buffett style investing method that made the man famous 
And I haven t even gotten to the best part  dividends 
An Income Stream You Can Count On
BIF  like many closed end funds  pays out an attractive dividend to shareholders  Right now  BIF s yield is 3 5   or roughly double that of the S P 500 
The fund can pay those dividends because of its strong portfolio  Since BIF has earned much more than 3 5  on its investments on an annualized basis  it s able to maintain those payouts without being forced to sell stocks from its portfolio to do so 
And BIF isn t even the highest yielding CEF out there  which leads me to the next fund I want to show you now 
CEF No  2  A 7 4  Dividend and Market Beating Performance
Many CEFs pay 7  or more  and some of them even beat the S P 500 while doing it  Take  for instance  the Nuveen Core Equity Alpha Closed Fund  NYSE JCE   which trades at a small  1   discount to NAV and currently pays out a 7 4  dividend to shareholders 
That is not a typo  JCE s dividend is over 4 times bigger than that of the S P 500 
And JCE has managed to pay this out while crushing the market  Over the last decade  this fund s return has been nearly double that of the S P 500 
JCE Crushes the Index 
With market outperformance and a superior dividend yield  who wouldn t want to get into JCE 
Yet a lot of investors bypass this fund  simply because they don t know it  and CEFs generally  exist  Since JCE only has about  250 million in assets under management  it s too small to warrant being aggressively advertised like ETFs  which make up over  4 trillion in clients  money 
That means these smaller CEFs are one of Wall Street s best kept secrets and a corner of the market I cover exclusively in my CEF Insider service  Because JCE  BIF and many other CEFs provide market busting incomes and market outperformance that are impossible to find in the ETF world 
And now that stocks look set to soar even further from their current levels  it s a great time to compound your profits with a discounted fund like BIF or JCE 
My Top Secret Bonus Pick  Buy NOW for 8 5  Dividends and 276   Gains 
JCE and BIF are both strong funds  but I held off till the end to tell you about my very best CEF pick now  which has all the tools to lead the market  and JCE and BIF  higher in the critical 6 months to come 
The best part is that this unsung pick pays you a sky high 8 5  dividend today nearly 5 times as much as that of your typical S P 500 stock and more than twice as much as BIF  So a big part of the total return you haul in from this fund will be in cash 
And how has my top CEF pick performed in the long haul 
Answer  This off the radar biotech champ has obliterated the S P 500 in the last decade 
A Market Dominator 
Best of all  my top pick trades at a 5  discount to NAV  which may not sound like much  but it s traded at nice discounts in the past as recently as last September  which points to some nice upside ahead 
To sum up  here s what you re getting in this 5   markdown sale  

All the stocks in this fund s portfolio rock solid names with long histories of dividend growth  like Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  and Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  
Market crushing outperformance  with 276  gains  and most of that return in cash  over the last decade

149952,371468,AMGN,JAK Inhibitors  Prospects Strong  4 Stocks Ruling The Space,opinion,There is no approved therapy that can completely cure autoimmune or inflammatory diseases  The development of new treatment technologies is ongoing  Meanwhile  it is difficult to control autoimmune diseases in the majority of patients  The newest class of medications to treat these diseases is janus kinase   JAK   inhibitors  which are providing patients a better treatment option  This class of therapies has generated significant interest due to their better efficacy compared to tumor necrosis factor   TNF   inhibitor therapies Autoimmune DiseasesIn patients with autoimmune diseases  the body s immune system mistakenly attacks the healthy cells  Scientists are yet to find the reason behind this abnormality  However  the incidence of autoimmune diseases is on the rise  There are multiple types of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis   RA    psoriasis  multiple sclerosis   MS    inflammatory bowel disease   IBD    etc  Several companies are dedicated to bringing better drugs for the treatment of these diseases  The symptoms include fatigue  muscle aches  swelling  and redness in the affected body parts The most common and first line treatment for autoimmune disease is disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs  DMARDs   especially methotrexate  Apart from methotrexate  there are several classes of DMARDs including TNF inhibitor therapies approved for these diseases that are performing well  AbbVie s   NYSE ABBV   Humira and Amgen s   NASDAQ AMGN   Enbrel are blockbuster TNF inhibitor drugs among others  However  these treatments have serious safety issues which include increased risk tuberculosis and lymphoma among others JAK InhibitorsSeveral pharma companies are developing JAK inhibitors  which work by blocking a particular signal of a body s immune response  cytokines  instead of suppressing the immune system as done by DMARDs  Patients treated with JAK inhibitors in clinical studies have shown faster and better response to the disease  However  the safety concern still looms large  The segment is attractive for companies as there are only two JAK inhibitors  presently approved for the treatment of autoimmune diseases  especially RA  However  several companies are developing their candidates  which is likely to increase competition going forward The segment was in news recently as Eli Lilly s   NYSE LLY   Olumiant  a JAK inhibitor  received approval in the United States and AbbVie   NYSE ABBV   announced top line data from a late stage study evaluating its JAK inhibitor candidate upadacitinib 4 Pharma Biotech Companies in FocusGiven the growing interest in JAK inhibitors  let s take a look at some pharma and biotech companies that are looking to change the way autoimmune diseases are treated Pfizer s   NYSE PFE   Xeljanz  tofacitinib  is the first approved JAK inhibitor in the United States for the treatment of RA  It has been available in the market since 2012  The drug is also approved for psoriatic arthritis  It generated sales of  326 million in the first quarter of 2018  up 30 4  year over year  A regulatory application seeking line extension of the drug in ulcerative colitis was approved late last month in the United States  Regulatory applications seeking approval in the above three indications are under review in Europe The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Eli Lilly s JAK inhibitor  Olumiant  baricitinib   is the second drug to receive approval for treating RA in the United States  The drug was approved early this month  However  it was launched in certain European countries in 2017  We note that the FDA rejected the company s new drug application seeking approval of Olumiant in April 2017 citing safety concerns  Lilly develops and commercializes the drug in partnership with Incyte Corporation  The drug generated sales of  32 2 million in the first quarter  sequentially up 40   Lilly is currently evaluating the drug in another autoimmune indication  atopic dermatitis  eczema   in a late stage study The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  AbbVie is another company  which is focused on developing JAK inhibitor based treatments  The company s JAK inhibitor  upadacitinib  showed promising results in late stage studies evaluating the candidate in RA patients  It is also being developed for atopic dermatitis in a late stage study for which it enjoys breakthrough therapy status in the United States  Another late stage study is evaluating the candidate in Crohn s disease The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  3 Galapagos NV   NASDAQ GLPG   is developing its JAK inhibitor candidate  filgotinib  in collaboration with Gilead Sciences  Inc    NASDAQ GILD    Separate late stage studies are evaluating the candidate in RA  Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis  Moreover  several mid stage studies are evaluating the candidate in multiple autoimmune indications including ankylosing spondylitis  psoriatic arthritis and cutaneous lupus erythematosus among others  Data from a mid stageI study evaluating filgotinib in psoriatic arthritis showed significant improvement in patients The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  3 Prospects of JAK Inhibitors With several blockbuster DMARDs nearing patent expiration  this new class of drugs holds potential to replace the existing treatments  This boosts the prospects of the companies that have these drugs candidates in their pipeline or commercial portfolio However  JAK inhibitors also have several side effects  which may delay their approval  We note that a lower dose of Lilly s Olumiant was approved along with a boxed warning stating risk of serious infections

149953,371469,AMGN,My No  1 Buy For 8 5  Dividends And 20  Gains  By 2019 ,opinion,"I don t want to alarm you  but if you ve got a lot of cash sitting on the sidelines right now  you re about to miss out on a double digit stock market gain in the next 6 months 
In a moment  I ll show you 5 funds you can buy today to lock in these quick  life changing profits  and dividend payouts  too   To make it even easier for you  I ve ranked these 5 popular buys from worst to first 
But first  let me tell you what I m basing this bold prediction on  The story starts in early February of this year 
You no doubt recall those wild days  after a sharp run up in stocks in January  which itself was on the heels of a 23  gain for the S P 500 in 2017  the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  suddenly did this 
A Nosedive
Panic was in the air so much so that I was getting calls from worried family and friends asking me what was causing the selloff and what it meant for their retirements  I wrote about that in this article  
My response   It means nothing  
That s also what I told readers I explained how there was a bit of profit taking and a much needed break from the bull market we d enjoyed for so long  And I also said that stocks would recover long before the end of 2018 a theme I wrote about again even as the market kept falling in February and again in March 
And now the market is doing this 
The Recovery Kicks In
I don t have a crystal ball I have something better  data  A lot of it  And it s telling me you need to act now if you want to grab your share of the profits from  stage 2  of the 2018 market boom 
Your Buy Window Is Closing Fast
Whether it s corporate profits  which rose to a record high in the first quarter of 2018 and are set to rise again in Q2   falling unemployment  now at a shockingly low 3 8   or wage growth  which is reaching 3    the signs of a resurgent economy were all there in early February 
On top of that  the S P 500 s forward P E ratio was 17 lower than it s been for most of the last 30 years  even though the index is now dominated by tech companies boasting higher P E ratios 
All of that screamed  buy  
Fast forward to today  and the market has finally realized that  yes  the economy is strong  which means your window to buy into the recovery is closing fast 
But don t worry  it s not closed yet 
With continued economic strength lifting most US firms  there s plenty of reason to expect stocks to end the year up at  or at least near  double digits 
So how do we get in before it s too late 
5 Funds to Play the Rebound Ranked From Worst to First
The obvious candidate  and worst of my 5 picks  would be an index fund  You can take your pick here  SPY or the Vanguard 500 ETF  VOO   Both will get you the same thing  market matching performance and a pretty sad 1 8  dividend 
Next up is the Invesco QQQ Trust  QQQ   which gives you a growth burst through its exposure to the tech companies of the NASDAQ 100 index  including the big payment giant Visa  NYSE V   which is up a handsome 16 7  so far in 2018  QQQ is already up a nice 11 9  for 2018 after falling into negative territory in early February 
But you are sacrificing income to get that growth  the fund yields just 0 75  as I write 
A slightly better option is the iShares S P 500 Growth ETF  IVW   which goes beyond tech stocks while focusing on companies that are seeing the biggest sales growth and dodging  old economy  laggards like Xerox  NYSE XRX  and Time Warner  NYSE TWX   Its dividend  at 1 5   is above that of QQQ but still behind the index funds 
I m sure you re seeing a theme here  and it s a major downside with all 3 of these funds  if you want a meaningful income stream  you ll have to supplement their meager dividends by selling your shares 
Trouble is  you ll have to be very careful not to do so into a downturn  And that kind of market timing is beyond the reach of most mortals  which gives my top ETF pick a decided edge 
I m talking about the iShares Core High Dividend ETF  HDV   Its 3 8  yield is far ahead of the payouts on the 3 funds I just showed you  and it also offers exposure to American large cap firms boasting either a long history of growing dividends such as Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  and Pfizer  NYSE PFE  or big yields right now  like Verizon  NYSE VZ  and AT T  NYSE T  
And since HDV still hasn t recovered for 2018  it s down 5 6  year to date   it s a great bet for the contrarian who sees a market wide recovery in the future  as I do 
My  1 Pick  Buy NOW for 8 5  Dividends and 276   Gains 
But I have to tell you something here  I still have one serious reservation about HDV  it s just a little too focused on  old economy  stocks and underweight on the tech and biotech firms setting the pace for tomorrow s economy 
And that could set the stage for a steady drip lower while the rest of the market races away 
Luckily  my No  1 fund pick which I m going to tell you about now doesn t have that problem  It s got all the tools to lead the market higher in the critical 6 months to come 
This off the radar biotech champ has obliterated SPY in the last decade and that s just the start 
A Market Dominator
You see  because this chart includes dividends  most of this monstrous return was in CASH  so owners didn t have to worry about selling shares into a crash  hello  2008 09   like SPY holders did 
And those dividend payouts are still massive  this fund currently yields a mind blowing 8 5  nearly 5 TIMES as much as SPY  Oh  and it drops those fat cash payouts into your account monthly too 
I m not done yet 
The secret behind this off the radar fund lies in its very structure  it s a closed end fund  CEF  
Don t let the technical name fool you  All this really means is that this fund trades at a market price that s different than the value of its underlying holdings 
And right now  that difference amounts to a 5  discount  This is basically free money 
To sum up  here s what you re getting in this 5   markdown sale  

All the stocks in this fund s portfolio rock solid names with long histories of dividend growth  like Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  and Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD  
Market crushing outperformance  with 276  gains  and most of that return in cash  over the last decade 
1 click access to the top talent in biotech  this fund s manager  with more than two decades of experience himself  hires doctors and researchers with  boots on the ground  expertise at finding the next breakthrough treatment 

I ll give you all the details on this breakthrough income play when you click here 
And that s still not all 
You see  this fund is part of a 5 fund  mini portfolio  I crafted exclusively for members of my CEF Insider service  Now  for a limited time  I ll show it to you at no cost  Taken together  these 5 totally ignored CEFs will hand you a safe 8 2  yield now

149977,371493,AMGN,Why Is Amgen  AMGN  Up 3 7  Since Its Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Amgen Inc    NASDAQ AMGN    Shares have added about 3 7  in that time frame 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is AMGN due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers Amgen First Quarter Earnings   Sales BeatAmgen reported first quarter 2018 earnings of  3 47 per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 23 by 7 4   Earnings increased 10  year over year driven by higher product sales  seasonally low expenses in Q1  a lower tax rate and lower share count Total revenues of  5 55 billion in the quarter marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 46 billion  The top line also registered an increase of 2  year over year Quarter in DetailTotal product revenues increased 3  from the year ago quarter to  5 34 billion  U S    4 15 billion  ex U S    1 20 billion  as increasing demand for newer products like Prolia  Kyprolis  Xgeva  Repatha and Blincyto  was partially offset by lower sales of mature brands like Enbrel  Aranesp  Epogen  Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure Revenues of Amgen s erythropoiesis stimulating agent  ESA   Aranesp  declined 11  from the prior year quarter to  454 million due to lower demand  primarily due to increased competitive pressures Revenues of the other ESA  Epogen  declined 10  to  244 million due to lower selling price owing to a newly negotiated contract with DaVita Inc Neulasta revenues declined 5  to  1 16 billion from the year ago period due to lower demand and unfavorable comparisons to last year s first quarter  Increased competition from PD 1s and other new cancer therapies is hurting demand for Neulasta  However  the Neulasta Onpro kit  on body injector  continues to perform well  commanding a market share of about 62  in the United States for all Neulasta sales  Amgen is optimistic that it will see more global utilization of Onpro in 2018 Neupogen recorded a 30  decline in sales to  103 million due to biosimilar competition in the United States Enbrel delivered revenues of  1 11 billion declined 6  from the year ago quarter due to lower selling prices and increased competition  which hurt demand  Unfavorable comparisons to last year s first quarter  which benefited from favorable changes in accounting estimates  also hurt Enbrel sales Prolia revenues came in at  494 million  up 16  from the year ago quarter due to higher demand  The osteoporosis drug witnessed continued growth in new patient starts and strong repeat injection rates  which drove year over year growth Xgeva delivered revenues of  445 million  up 11  from the year ago quarter mainly due to higher demand Sensipar Mimpara revenues rose 18  to  497 million  mainly riding on higher demand and some inventory build probably due to a shift in reimbursement from U S  Medicare Part D to Part B at the beginning of 2018 Vectibix revenues came in at  169 million  up 15   driven by higher demand Kyprolis recorded sales of  222 million  up 17  year over year  driven by increased demand and a robust uptake from outside U S  markets  In Europe  the majority of sales came from triplet regimens and Kyprolis continues to take market share from Velcade Blincyto sales surged 44  from the year ago period to  49 million  reflecting rise in demandRepatha generated revenues of  123 million compared with  98 million in the previous quarter driven by volume growth  On the call  the company said that access to Repatha for high risk cardiovascular patients has improved over the past few months with the outcomes data included on the Repatha label Other revenues declined 20 4  to  211 million due to lower milestone payment received than the first quarter of 2017 Parsabiv  launched in several markets including the United States  recorded sales of  41 million in the quarter  On the call  the company said that in the United States  Parsabiv has witnessed a solid uptake in the midsized dialysis providers Operating Margins DecreaseAdjusted operating margins declined 70 basis points  bps  to 56 9  due to higher operating costs SG A spend increased 6  to  1 1 billion on higher investments to support growth products as well as the pre launch preparations for Aimovig and bio similar products  R D expenses were almost flat at  739 million compared with the year ago figure The adjusted tax rate was 13 7  for the quarter  a 4 8 point decrease from the first quarter of 2017 Amgen repurchased 56 4 million shares worth  10 8 billion in the first quarter and plans to repurchase between  2 billion and  4 billion of stock in the second quarter 2018 GuidanceAmgen raised the lower end of its sales and earnings guidance for 2018  Better than expected first quarter earnings and a revised tax outlook led to the increase in the earnings guidance The company now expects its revenues in the range of  21 9  22 8 billion compared with the previous prediction of  21 8  22 8 billion  Adjusted earnings are now anticipated in the range of  12 80  13 70 in 2018 compared with the previous projection  12 60  13 70 The guidance assumes the approval and launch of migraine candidate  Aimovig and Amgevita in 2018  Also  management seems quite confident that Repatha will become an important growth driver for the company with the inclusion of outcomes data on its label  Nonetheless  other than continuing competitive dynamics for Enbrel  possible generic competition to Sensipar and new competition for Neulasta and Aranesp could be the new challenges in 2018 and are accounted for in the 2018 revenue guidance Operating margin is expected to be between 52  and 54  in 2018  Operating margin is expected to be lower in the remaining quarters of 2018 due to the timing of expenses  Operating expenses  as a percent of products sales  were seasonally low in the first quarter and the ratio is expected to be higher in the remaining quarters of the year and normalize to around 2017 levels Adjusted tax rate is now estimated at approximately 13 5  14 5   lower than the past range of 14 15   reflecting the impact of the latest tax reform Hoping to achieve an improved cash position following the new tax law  Amgen plans to invest approximately  750 million this year in capital expenditures

Zessly is approved for use in all indications of the branded drug including rheumatoid arthritis  adult Crohn s disease  pediatric Crohn s disease  adult ulcerative colitis  pediatric ulcerative colitis  ankylosing spondylitis  psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis 
The approval from the European Commission is based on review of a comprehensive development program  including analytical  preclinical and clinical data  which confirmed Zessly matching Remicade in terms of safety  efficacy and quality 
An approval was in the cards as the CHMP had given a positive opinion on the same in March 
The approval will strengthen Sandoz s already strong biosimilar portfolio with five marketed biosimilars  Omnitrope  a human growth hormone  Binocrit  an erythropoiesis stimulating agent used to treat anemia  and filgrastim for neutropenia under the brand names Zarzio outside the United States and Zarxio in the United States

With Zessly s approval  Sandoz will now have six approved biosimilars in its portfolio  Zessly is the third biosimilar which has been approved by the EC in the last 12 months for Sandoz 
The FDA also approved biosimilar Erelzi in 2016  However  the launch is pending in the United States due to an ongoing litigation with Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN   
We note that Sandoz acquired the biosimilar of infliximab from Pfizer   NYSE PFE   in February 2016 for the 28 EU countries plus Norway  Iceland and Liechtenstein that form the European Economic Area 
Novartis  shares have declined 2 6  over a year  compared with the  s fall of 5 5

We remind investors that the FDA accepted for review the company s BLA for fremanezumab  in December 2017 and  granted fast track designation to the candidate  However  in January 2018  Teva s partner Celltrion received a warning letter from FDA for a facility in South Korea  following an inspection of the fill finish side of the facility  thus delaying the approval of the drug  This facility manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients  APIs  for fremanezumab 
Teva  thus  stated in its first quarter 2018 earnings call that it did not expect to receive FDA approval on its BLA for fremanezumab on the mid June date  The company was in a constructive dialogue with the FDA in close collaboration with partner Celltrion 
Recently  we note that Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN   and partner Novartis   NYSE NVS   have received FDA approval for their pipeline candidate Aimovig  erenumab  for the prevention of migraine  The drug is the first FDA approved treatment  specifically developed to treat migraine by blocking calcitonin gene related peptide   CGRP   receptor 
Another Pharma giant Eli Lilly   NYSE LLY   has anti CGRP candidate  galcanezumab  which is under review in the United States  A decision on galcanezumab is expected in the third quarter of the year

149980,371496,AMGN,Merck s  MRK  Keytruda Lung Cancer Data In Focus At ASCO ,opinion,Merck   Co   Inc  s   NYSE MRK   PD L1 inhibitor  Keytruda ruled at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology  ASCO  in Chicago as the drug giant presented additional data from two pivotal lung cancer studies on the drug Merck presented additional data from the pivotal KEYNOTE 042 study in patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous or squamous non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  whose tumors express PD L1 protein levels of 1 percent or greater   TPS of  1 percent  In April  Merck had said that in such patients  Keytruda led to a significant survival benefit compared with platinum based chemotherapy  With the latest release  the company said that in patients with TPS of  1 percent  median overall survival  OS  was 16 7 months in the Keytruda arm versus 12 1 months in chemotherapy arm  In the PD L1 TPS  50 percent patient population  median OS was 20 months while that in patients with TPS of  20 percent was 17 7 months versus 12 2 months and 13 months  respectively for chemotherapy alone Also  Merck said the risk of progression or death or progression free survival  PFS    the secondary endpoint   was 19  in the PD L1 TPS  50 percent population at the time of interim analysis  which was not statistically significant Notably  Keytruda monotherapy is already marketed for the first line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD L1 protein levels of 50 percent or greater  TPS of  50 percent  based on data from the KEYNOTE 024 study If the OS data from KEYNOTE 042 study are approved to be included in Keytruda s label  the drug can be prescribed to treat an expanded lung cancer patient population  further reinforcing its position in the lung cancer market  Later in the year  Merck will file regulatory application to get the OS data from the study included in the label of Keytruda Merck also announced data from a second interim analysis of a pivotallung cancer study on Keytruda   phase III KEYNOTE  407 study   which evaluated Keytruda in combination with carboplatin paclitaxel or nab paclitaxel  chemotherapy  for the first line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC  The data from the study showed that the combination of Keytruda plus chemotherapy led to significant improvement in both OS and PFS regardless of PD L1 expression  The risk of death  OS  was reduced by 36  compared to chemotherapy alone  The median OS was 15 9 months in the Keytruda combination group versus 11 3 months in the chemotherapy arm  The PFS improvement was nearly half for patients in the Keytruda combination group compared with chemotherapy alone  The median PFS was 6 4 months in the Keytruda combination group versus 4 1 months in the chemotherapy arm A regulatory application to include data from this study was submitted to the FDA in May  At the same time  the company had presented data from the first interim analysis of the KEYNOTE  407 study  It said that the study met a pre specified secondary endpoint of overall response rate  ORR  in an early cohort of participants  At ASCO  the company said that ORR was 57 9  in the Keytruda arm compared to 38 4  for chemotherapy aloneMetastatic squamous NSCLC is a difficult to treat population  which accounts for about 30  of lung cancer cases  If the Keytruda combination is approved to treat this difficult to treat population  lung cancer sales of the drug should improve further This year so far  Merck s shares have outperformed the   Its shares have risen 7 6  in the period against the industry s decline of 4 5  Keytruda is the second largest product in Merck s portfolio  It is marketed for many types of cancer and treatment settings including lung cancer  melanoma  head and neck cancer  classical Hodgkin s lymphoma  gastric cancer  bladder cancer and microsatellite instability high  MSI H  or mismatch repair deficient cancer The treatment fetched sales of  3 8 billion in 2017  up almost 172  year over year  This upside is driven by the global launch of new indications  which further bolstered demand   Keytruda sales are gaining  particularly from strong momentum in the first line lung cancer indication  In fact  Keytruda is the only anti PD 1 approved in the first line setting for certain lung cancer patients both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly s   NYSE LLY   cancer drug  Alimta  pemetrexed  and carboplatin  pem carbo  Meanwhile  Keytruda is being evaluated in several lung cancer studies across multiple settings and stages of the disease  both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy At ASCO  Merck also presented data from several combination studies of tyrosinekinase inhibitor  Lenvimaplus Keytruda at ASCO The studies evaluating the Lenvima Keytruda combination in four different tumor types   unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma  HCC   squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck  SCCHN   advanced renal cell carcinoma  RCC   and advanced endometrial carcinoma  EC    demonstrated encouraging ORR as well as safety profile of this cancer combination We remind investors that in March  Merck formed a deal with Japan s Eisai to co develop and commercialize Lenvima  both as a monotherapy as well as in combination with Keytruda for several types of cancer At ASCO  Merck also presented interim data from a mid stage study  KEYNOTE 427  evaluating Keytruda monotherapy for the first line treatment of advanced clear cell RCC  The data showed that in the Keytruda arm  the ORR   the primary endpoint   was 38 2   Meanwhile  in a sub group of patients whose tumors expressed PD L1  the ORR was 50  Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer  in more than 700 studies  including in excess of 400 combination studies  Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN    Incyte  Glaxo   NYSE GSK   and Pfizer  NYSE PFE  separately for

149982,371498,AMGN,Novartis Announces Positive Data On Kisqali And Tasigna ,opinion,"Novartis   NYSE NVS   presented positive results from the third phase III trial on breast cancer drug Kisqali  ribociclib  in advanced or metastatic breast cancer at the 54th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology  ASCO  in Chicago 
The phase III trial  MONALEESA 3  showed Kisqali plus Faslodex significantly prolonged progression free survival  PFS  compared to Faslodex alone in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive  human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative  HR  HER2   advanced breast cancer 
The median PFS was not reached in the subgroup of patients taking Kisqali plus fulvestrant in the first line setting  However  70  were estimated to remain progression free at median follow up of 16 5 months 
Moreover  results from MONALEESA 7 showed consistent treatment benefit among premenopausal women with HR  HER2  advanced breast cancer  regardless of prior chemotherapy treatment in the advanced setting 
We remind investors that Kisqali was approved by the FDA in Mar 2017 and by the European Commission in August 2017  as initial endocrine based therapy for postmenopausal women with HR  HER2  locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor 
Novartis is currently in discussions with the FDA to submit a supplemental New Drug Application  sNDA   seeking approval of Kisqali plus Faslodex for the treatment of postmenopausal women with HR  HER2  advanced breast cancer 
The company also presented data from two long term Treatment free Remission  TFR  studies  ENESTop and ENESTfreedom in patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive  Ph   chronic myeloid leukemia  CML  in the chronic phase  CP   The results from the open label phase II trials  ENESTop and ENESTfreedom  show sustained TFR in patients treated with both front line and second line Tasigna  nilotinib  therapy 
The 144 week trials evaluate the potential to maintain molecular response  MR  after stopping therapy in eligible adult patients with Ph  CML CP  Data showed durability and safety of TFR with Tasigna  Nearly all patients who lost TFR regained major molecular response after restarting therapy 
Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor  Exjade  Jakavi  Zykadia  Tasigna  Jadenu and Kisqali  which continue to boost sales  The approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost  given the potential in the CAR T therapy space  The FDA recently expanded Kymriah s label which should boost sales 
Last week  Novartis completed the divestiture of its 36 5  stake in a consumer healthcare joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline PLC   NYSE GSK   for  13 billion 
The company also announced that its generic arm  Sandoz  obtained a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  of the European Medicines Agency for marketing authorization of a proposed biosimilar of AbbVie s  blockbuster drug Humira  The generic division is seeking approval of the proposed biosimilar for use in all indications of the branded drug including those in rheumatology  gastroenterology and dermatology  
A tentative approval will further boost the generic division  which has been struggling with competitive pricing  Last month  Sandoz obtained approval for Zessly  a biosimilar version of Remicade  in Europe  With Zessly s approval  Sandoz now has six approved biosimilars in its portfolio  Zessly is the third biosimilar that has been approved by the EC in the last 12 months for Sandoz 
The CHMP has also recommended approval for Aimovig  erenumab  for the prevention of migraine in adults who have at least four migraine days per month  The drug was recently approved by the FDA  Novartis and Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN   are co commercializing the drug in the United States  While Amgen has exclusive commercialization rights to the drug in Japan  Novartis has exclusive rights to commercialize in the rest of the world 
Novartis  shares have declined 7 4  in the last six months compared with the  s decline of 1 9  

 
The approval of new drugs bode well for Novartis as the company is facing the loss of patent protection for some of the key drugs

150000,371516,AMGN,Trump Announces Plan To Reign In Drug Prices And Pharma Stocks Rally ,opinion,"On Friday  President Trump unveiled his much anticipated plan to control drug prices in the U S   During his presidential campaign  Trump had promised to take on the big drug companies and it was feared that the plan would include provisions that would hurt profits in the pharmaceutical industry 
As the president began speaking  the stock prices of the biggest drug companies did in fact briefly decline  only to reverse course and ended the day broadly higher 
The reason   The plan doesn t seem to be  taking them on  at all 
The biggest fear was that the new plan would include provisions for Medicare to negotiate directly with drug companies on price  Roughly 30  of the dollar value of prescriptions filled in the U S  is paid for by Medicare  making the U S  government the single biggest customer for pharmaceuticals by a wide margin   Drug companies have been staunchly opposed to the idea of direct negotiation as it would almost certainly damage profits 
Once it was clear direct negotiation wasn t on the agenda  investors snapped up shares of the biggest U S  drug makers  including Abbvie     Amgen    and Merck  NYSE MRK      each of which finished the day 2  or more above their mid speech lows 
The President Takes on Softer Targets 
Trump decried the participation of what he referred to as  middlemen   meaning primarily Pharmacy Benefit Managers   intermediaries between manufacturers and doctors and pharmacies 
 He also took aim at small pharmaceutical companies who buy up off patent generic drugs and raise the prices sharply   Because this strategy is mainly the practice of small companies  think Martin Shkreli and Turing Pharmaceutical   it won t affect the big names and Trump s plan to speed FDA approval of generic drugs could actually help big pharma 
Finally  Trump took aim at a familiar target   foreign countries   Explaining that other countries pay  a tiny fraction of what the medicine costs in the U S   Trump continued    it s time to end the global freeloading  
Drug prices in the U S  can often be three times as much as in the U K  and the E U  and the president thinks those countries should pay their fair share of the costs of research and development of U S  manufactured pharmaceuticals  It s not immediately clear how exactly the administration could go about raising drug prices off of U S  soil  but the mere suggestion of concentrating on higher prices elsewhere as a catalyst to lower prices here at home was wind in the sales of the drug makers

150009,371525,AMGN,Roche  RHHBY  Announces Positive Data On Hemophilia Drug ,opinion,"Roche   OTC RHHBY   announced full results from the phase III study  HAVEN 3  evaluating haemophilia A drug Hemlibra  emicizumab  
The randomized multicenter  open label  phase III study evaluated the efficacy  safety and pharmacokinetics of Hemlibra prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis  episodic on demand factor VIII treatment  in patients with hemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors   
The trial results show that Hemlibra reduced treated bleeds by 96  compared to no prophylaxis in HAVEN 3 study in haemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors  Moreover  in a subset of patients included in the study  who previously received factor VIII prophylaxis  which is the standard of care  Hemlibra reduced bleeds by 68  compared to their prior therapy 
Almost 55 6  of patients treated with Hemlibra every week and 60  of patients treated with Hemlibra every two weeks experienced zero treated bleeds  compared to none of patients treated with no prophylaxis 
Additionally  results from another phase III study  HAVEN 4  showed Hemlibra administered every four weeks provides clinically meaningful control of bleeding in people with or without factor VIII inhibitors 
We remind investors that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Hemlibra in April 2018 for patients with hemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors  based on data from the HAVEN 3 study  The drug is already approved by the FDA for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults and children with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors 
Hemlibra was also approved by the European Commission in February 2018 for routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in people with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors 
Roche s hematology portfolio includes approved drugs like MabThera Rituxan  Gazyva Gazyvaro  Tecentriq and Venclexta 
We note that Roche is developing Venclexta in collaboration with AbbVie   NYSE ABBV    Both companies are jointly commercializing the drug in the United States  AbbVie is commercializing the drug outside the United States as well 
Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche as its legacy drugs like Herceptin  MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars 
Roche s stock has lost 7 3  in the last six months compared with  gain of 0 5  

 
Novartis   NYSE NVS   has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan  MabThera in Europe  Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN   has also obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer  colorectal cancer  glioblastoma  renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which with the calendar about to turn from April to May sees the equity markets are floundering  They could sure use some May flowers after all the spring rain  Elsewhere look for Gold to continue its broad consolidation while Crude Oil remains in an uptrend  The US Dollar Index is showing signs of life and attempting to reverse higher while US Treasuries are bouncing in their downtrend 
The Shanghai Composite looks weak and possibly on the verge of a big move lower while Emerging Markets continue to churn at the highs  Volatility looks to drip lower and out of the nearly 3 month range  which would be a positive for equities  The equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   all seem stuck in tightening consolidation and holding over important support on the longer timeframe  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

Estimate for both earnings and sales in the first quarter 2018  J J s performance was driven by continued positive momentum since the second half of 2017 and improvement in Consumer segment sales How Did J J Perform in Q1 J J s earnings of  2 06 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 01  Quarterly revenues were  20 billion  which also beat the consensus mark of  19 48 billion  Buoyed by its strong performance  the company upped its previously issued sales outlook for 2018   Read More    J J s Pharmaceutical segment sales grew 19 4  year over year in the first quarter of 2018 due to strong sales in both domestic and international markets and favorable currency impact  Sales in the U S  market rose 9 9  in the quarter while international sales grew 33 1  New products like Imbruvica  cancer  and Darzalex  multiple myeloma  continued to perform well  Oncology sales increased 45  during the quarter to  2 3 billion  constituting almost a quarter of the pharmaceutical sales  Core products like Xarelto  Stelara  Zytiga  Simponi Simponi Aria and Invega Sustenna also contributed to growth  Imbruvica sales rose 43 5   The drug is marketed by J J in partnership with AbbVie  Inc    NYSE ABBV   Edurant sales rose 40 9  while Prezista sales increased 11 2  However  Concerta sales continue to decline due to generic competition  Sales of Risperdal Consta also fell 5 3   Sales of Invokana Invokamet declined 12 7  due to higher managed care discounting  while blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug  Remicade  marketed in partnership with Merck   Co   Inc    NYSE MRK   fell 16 9  J J s Pharma segment achieved some clinical milestones during the quarter including FDA approvals of prostate cancer drug  Erleada for the treatment of men with non metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and line extension of already marketed prostate cancer drug  Zytiga in combination with prednisone in the first line setting These will certainly boost sales in 2018  J J now expects revenues in the range of  81 0 to  81 8 billion  higher than  80 6 billion to  81 4 billion expected previously Overall  in 2018  J J expects the Pharmaceutical segment to remain strong while the Consumer and Medical Device segments will continue to improve  We expect other companies like Merck  Amgen  Inc    NASDAQ AMGN    Pfizer  NYSE PFE  and Lilly to follow suit Novartis Reports Encouraging Q1 ResultsNovartis AG   NYSE NVS   also reported this week  The Swiss pharma giant beat earnings and revenue estimates driven by strong performance of key drugs  Cosentyx and Entresto  Novartis reported core earnings of  1 28 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 25 and up from  1 13 recorded in the year ago quarter  Revenues increased 10  to  12 7 billion  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  12 3 billion   Read more   Sales of the Innovative Medicines division grew 6  to  8 4 billion driven by volume growth of Cosentyx and Entresto  However  entry of generics for Gleevec in the United States and Europe impacted sales unfavorably Cosentyx sales increased to  580 million  up 35  driven strong growth in all indications and expanded access  Entresto s sales increased 126  to  200 million driven by increased uptake Oncology franchise  excluding Gleevec  grew 6  driven by Promacta Revolade  Tafinlar   Mekinist  Jakavi and recent launches  However  sales at the Sandoz division were  2 5 billion  down 4  due to price erosion in the Unites States However  this year so far  J J s shares have lost 8 8  and Novartis  shares are down 6  against 4 3

Ibrance  breast cancer  as well as older products like Lyrica  neuropathic pain   Chantix  smoking cessation  and Eliquis  blood thinner  in the soon to be reported quarter  Moreover  line extension of Xeljanz  Sutent and Bosulif received in the fourth quarter of 2017 is also expected to bring in more sales However  loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for Pristiq in the United States and Lyrica in Europe  and product shortages for legacy Hospira will likely affect sales negatively  Blockbuster drug Enbrel sales should continue to decline in the quarter due to biosimilar competition In 2018  the company s sales are expected to increase in low single digits from 2017 levels  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings for Q1 is pegged at  13 03 billion and 73 cents  respectively  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in 2018 currently stands at  54 52 billion  representing year over year growth of 3 7   Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  MerckMerck s blockbuster drug  Keytruda  along with Lynparza and Bridion Injection is expected to boost revenues in the first quarter  Keytruda sales are gaining momentum through approval and launch of Keytruda in new indications  especially in first line lung cancer However  rising competitive and pricing pressure are expected to hurt sales of Zostavax  Zepatier  Januvia and Isentress Animal health franchise sales are likely to remain strong in the first quarter Merck carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings for Q1 is pegged at  10 11 billion and 99 cents  respectively  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 sales is  41 81 billion  representing a 4 2  year over year increase Eli Lilly  LLY Sales of Lilly s diabetes drugs  Trulicity and Jardiance are expected to grow driven by market share gains  Other new drugs such as Cyramza  Taltz  and Lartruvo are also expected to boost the top line due to continued strong demand  Verzenio is also expected to generate higher sales in the first quarter However  patent expiry in some countries for Cymbalta  Strattera  Effient  Axiron  Zyprexa  Evista and competitive pressure mainly from immuno oncology agents for Alimta will hurt sales of these drugs We expect strong uptake of new products to offset decline in sales of established products this quarter too The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings for Q1 is pegged at  5 52 billion and  1 13  respectively  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 sales stands at  23 43 billion  representing a rise of 2 4  year over year  Lilly carries a

150051,371567,AMGN,Roche  RHHBY  Q1 Earnings  Ocrevus  Perjeta Drive Sales Beat,opinion,"Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG   OTC RHHBY   posted strong sales number for the first quarter of 2018 propelled by demand for new drugs amid biosimilar competition for legacy drugs 
Sales came in at  14 5 billion  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  13 8 billion  The Swiss pharma giant reported sales of CHF13 6 billion in the first quarter  up 6  from the year ago period 
The company reports results under two divisions  Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics  All growth rates mentioned below are on a year over year basis and at constant exchange rates 
Sales at the Pharmaceuticals division increased 7  driven by strong growth in Ocrevus and Perjeta  which more than offset lower sales of MabThera Rituxan  Tarceva and Avastin  Diagnostics division sales climbed 5  primarily on the back of strong immunodiagnostic business 
Results in Detail
Herceptin sales grew 2  due to increasing demand in the United States  Perjeta sales grew 18  following increased demand in the neoadjuvant and metastatic settings  Sales also got a boost from the FDA approval of Perjeta for use in combination with Herceptin and chemotherapy for adjuvant  after surgery  treatment of HER2 positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence in late 2017  Sales of Kadcyla   6   were driven by increasing demand in international markets 
Strong Ocrevus sales further boosted the top line  The drug  used to treat two forms of multiple sclerosis  continued to gain traction in the United States  The company also launched it in Europe and other countries worldwide during the first quarter 
Recently launched drugs  Tecentriq and Alecensa for lung cancer have also had an encouraging start  Immuno oncology drug  Tecentriq  recorded 29  growth in sales  Alcenesa sales were up 81  as it witnessed solid demand in the United States  Europe and in Japan 
Performance of the immunology franchise was driven by increased sales of Actemra RoActemra  13   and Xolair  7    Gazyva Gazyvaro sales were up 27  due to growth in the United States and Europe 
Ophthalmology drug Lucentis  sales were up 6   The growth was driven by increased demand for 0 5 mg prefilled syringes in wet age related macular degeneration and continued growth in diabetic retinopathy 
However  sales of Avastin fell 2  due to increasing use of cancer immunotherapy medicines in lung cancer  Sales of Rituxan MabThera were also down 8  due to entry of biosimilars in the market 
However  sales of Tarceva declined  32   due to growing use of other therapeutic options  Sales of Xeloda  2   continue to be hit by generic competition 
Revenues at the Diagnostics division climbed 5  on the back of solid performance of the Centralised and Point of Care Solutions   4   unit  which was in turn  propelled by Immunodiagnostics   5    Tissue Diagnostics   7   and Molecular Diagnostics   6   also performed impressively   Diabetes Care sales increased 5  
2018 Outlook Raised
Roche s sales expected to grow in low single digits compared to the earlier guidance of being stable or grow in low single digits  The company expects core earnings to grow in high single digits  The company intends to further increase dividend in 2018 in local currency 
Pipeline Progress
In January 2018  the European Medicines Agency   EMA   approved Ocrevus for the treatment of relapsing and primary progressive forms of multiple sclerosis  In February 2018  the EMA also granted approval for Hemlibra for people with haemophilia A with inhibitors to factor VIII  In March 2018  the FDA approved Lucentis 0 3 mg prefilled syringe as a new method of administering the medicine to treat all forms of diabetic retinopathy 
In April 2018  the FDA granted Hemlibra a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia A without inhibitors to factor VIII 
During the quarter  Roche acquired Flatiron Health and Ignyta  Inc  While Flatiron Health will enable accelerate development and delivery of breakthrough medicines for oncology patients  Ignyta s lead molecule entrectinib targets tumors with one of two genetically defined gene rearrangements  ROS1 fusions in NSCLC  and NTRK fusions across a broad range of solid tumors 
Our Take
Roche beat estimates in the first quarter of 2018 driven by contribution from newly launched drugs  The label expansion of key drugs  Perjeta  Tecentriq and Alecensa will further drive growth  Ocrevus and Hemlibra have been successfully launched  However  sales of Avastin and Tarceva continue to decline 

Roche s stock has lost 12 9  in the last 12 months compared with  s gain of 8 4  
Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche as its legacy drugs like Herceptin  MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars  Novartis   NYSE NVS   has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan  MabThera in Europe  Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN   also obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer  colorectal cancer  glioblastoma  renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer

150106,371622,AMGN,Amgen Stock In Trouble  Despite Strong Results ,opinion,"Amgen Inc  NASDAQ AMGN  reported its full year 2017 results on February 1st  On a non GAAP basis  the California based biotech giant earned  12 58 per share  an 8  increase from 2016  But instead of celebrating another year of strong business performance  investors punished Amgen stock  which fell from an all time high of  201 22 to  168 45 between January 29th and February 9th 
The selloff was probably driven by the company s earnings miss in the fourth quarter  Or maybe it was the poor guidance for 2018  In our opinion  investors only used these as an excuse to get rid of the stock  The real reason for the decline  we believe  was the market itself  which was already anticipating bad news by the time Amgen s report became public  Trouble is  the  suggests this was just the beginning of an even bigger pullback   The weekly price chart of Amgen stock shows that the uptrend from  39 16 to  201 22  which has been under construction for almost 10 years since March 2008  took the shape of a five wave   labeled  1   2   3   4   5   Wave  3  is extended  but the five sub waves of the  pattern in wave  5  are also visible 
The bad news for Amgen stock investors is that according to the Wave principle  this pattern should be followed by a three wave decline  whose targets lie near the support area of wave  4   Wave  4  ended at  130 09 in late September  2015  With the stock currently at  182  we can expect another  50 to disappear from the share price  To reinforce the negative outlook  the MACD indicator shows a bearish divergence between waves  5  and  3   Now let s take a closer look at Amgen stock s post earnings drop  
Unfortunately  the hourly chart only tilts the table even more in the bears  favor  by revealing the impulsive structure of the plunge to  168 45  Impulses point in the direction of the larger sequence  which in this case tell us that Amgen stock s weakness is likely to continue  The weekly and hourly charts point in the same direction  so as long as the top of wave 5 of  5  at 201 22 holds  the bulls  resistance remains futile ",2018-03-22,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/amgen-stock-in-trouble-despite-strong-results-200299836,200299836

150125,371641,AMGN,Is Amgen Inc   AMGN  A Great Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Amgen Inc    NASDAQ AMGN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Amgen has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 1  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 5x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Amgen s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having increased rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares unfavorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 34 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Amgen has a forward PE  ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 3  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Amgen stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Amgen has a P S ratio of about 6  This is higher than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well above the lows for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Amgen currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40   of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Amgen a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Amgen might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  B  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives AMGN a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been upbeat  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to four lower  while the full year estimate has seen nine up and three down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 3 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Amgen Inc  Price and Consensus    The stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAmgen is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 27  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Breaking News  Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed  700 billion   more than a 3 800  increase in the previous 12

150148,371664,AMGN,Radius Health  RDUS  To Disappoint Investors In Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"Radius Health  Inc    NASDAQ RDUS   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2017 results on Mar 1   Radius Health s shares have lost 7 9  over a year compared with the  0 9   slip Radius Health has a disappointing track record  The company has reported wider than expected loss in the trailing four trailing quarters with an average negative earnings surprise of 8 37  Let s see how things are shaping up for this quarter  Radius Health  Inc  Price and Consensus
     
Factors at Play  Radius Health develops therapeutics for the treatment of osteoporosis  oncology and endocrine diseases The company s lead drug  Tymlos  was approved in the United States in April 2017  The drug was approved for treating postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture  defined as history of osteoporotic fracture and multiple risk factors for fracture  The drug can also be used for patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapies The company reported sales of Tymlos  abaloparatide  of  3 5 million in third quarter 2017 Hence  we expect investors to focus on the uptake of the drug during the upcoming earnings call Although the osteoporosis market in the United States has great potential as approximately 1 4 million postmenopausal women experience osteoporotic fractures each year  Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly  Co s   NYSE LLY   Forteo and Amgen s   NASDAQ AMGN   Prolia Meanwhile  the company s Marketing Authorisation Application for Eladynos  abaloparatide SC  in Europe for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis was under review   However  in December 2017  Radius Health announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use   CHMP   will issue a third Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues in its regulatory review of abaloparatide SC  The CHMP informed the company that it will refer the marketing authorisation application to a scientific advisory group for additional advice as part of its ongoing risk benefit assessment  Hence  the CHMP expects to give an opinion on the same during the first half of 2018  In July 2017  the CHMP provided a second Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues and requested additional data analyses related to the safety and efficacy of abaloparatide SC for their ongoing regulatory review  The delay in approval in Europe is disappointing given the potential the market holds Meanwhile  the FDA granted Fast Track designation to pipeline candidate elacestrant  an experimental selective estrogen receptor down regulator degrader for the treatment of women with ER  and HER2  advanced or metastatic breast cancer  The elacestrant clinical development program is currently ongoing with two phase I studies in patients with ER   HER2  advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have been heavily pre treated  median of three prior lines of therapy  and have evaluable disease   In December 2017  Radius Health provided encouraging data from the phase I 005 clinical study of elacestrant  RAD1901  in patients with estrogen receptor positive  ER   breast cancer at the 2017 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium Approximately 40 patients were treated at the 400 mg dose in the elacestrant phase I dose escalation and expansion cohorts  Of the enrolled patients  22 patients met the RECIST measurable disease criteria at baseline and there were six confirmed partial responses in this group  Elacestrant was well tolerated with the most common adverse events being low grade nausea  dyspepsia and vomiting  Consequently  Radius Health plans to initiate a phase II study of elacestrant monotherapy  a potentially pivotal study  for women suffering from advanced or metastatic ER  HER2  breast cancer early in 2018  Hence  we expect the management to throw light on pipeline progress

150149,371665,AMGN,4 Buy Ranked Large Cap Pharma Stocks To Boost Your Portfolio,opinion,After rising 16 3  last year  the  industry has risen 1 9  this year so far  It has however underperformed the 4  gain for the S P 500 in the same time frame Though the sector was off to a strong start in 2018  it struggled a little thereafter probably on broader market correction  Also  the mention of high drug prices by President Donald Trump in his State of the Union address hurt investor sentiment  However  the sector is largely expected to rebound as the year progresses 2017 was a good year for pharma and biotech stocks with the sector witnessing some positive developments that led to a much awaited recovery The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gained 11 8  in 2017  in sharp contrast to the decline witnessed in 2016  which was a tough year for pharma stocks given the furor over rising drug prices A key reason for the sector s improved performance was the willingness of investors to look beyond the drug pricing controversy and focus more on fundamentals instead  Although the drug pricing controversy will remain a headline risk  investors appear more comfortable with the issue  Moreover  a significantly higher number of FDA approvals in 2017 restored investor confidence in the sector  The approval of the first gene cell therapy last year was a major breakthrough for the sector Coming back to 2018  we believe that new product sales ramp up with rising demand  successful innovation and product line expansion  strong clinical study results  more frequent FDA approvals  continued strong performance from key products  growing demand for drugs especially for rare to treat diseases  an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep the sector on track  A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow down innovation should also provide benefits Possibilities of more mergers and acquisitions  M As  are also high now that the tax reform is in place and big players are on the lookout for companies with innovative pipelines technology  There has already been quite a bit of M A buzz this year about potential deals  Sanofi   NYSE SNY   and Celgene   NASDAQ CELG   have already announced two deals each Meanwhile  with the Large Cap Pharma industry being among the top 30  of the 256 Zacks ranked industries  it would make sense to look at some Buy ranked stocks in the space Investing in stocks with a large market cap is a much more reliable investment because of the fact that they control a large portion of their given industry  Also companies with a larger market cap have performed well in 2017 and look well poised to earn higher profits in 2018 Here is a look at four large cap pharma companies that sport a favorable Zacks Rank     1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  H  Lundbeck A S   OTC HLUYY  Denmark based Lundbeck specializes in psychiatric and neurological disorders  The company s key areas of focus include depression  schizophrenia  Parkinson s disease and Alzheimer s disease  According to Lundbeck  about 700 million people across the world suffer from psychiatric and neurological disorders with many receiving inadequate treatment YTD  Lundbeck has outperformed the Large Cap Pharmaceutical industry with shares gaining 4 7   In addition to delivering revenue growth of 12   in local currencies  in 2017  Lundbeck issued an upbeat outlook for 2018  Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 31 2   Meanwhile  earnings estimates for 2019 are up 8 5  over the past 30 days AbbVie  Inc    NYSE ABBV  AbbVie beat estimates for both earnings and sales in the fourth quarter  It also raised its earnings expectations for 2018 based on continued strong operational performance  AbbVie s key drug  Humira has been performing well based on strong demand trends  despite new competition  AbbVie s shares have outperformed the industry in the past year  supported by a series of positive news including promising data from several pivotal studies  regulatory nods  including approval for its competitive HCV medicine Mavyret and two approvals for Imbruvica  and settlement of its Humira patent disputes with biotech major  Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN   AbbVie s shares are up an impressive 22 3  this year so far  outperforming the industry Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 33 9   Meanwhile  estimates for 2018 and 2019 are up 8 4  and 7  respectively  over the past 30 days Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE  New York based  Pfizer is one of the most well known names in the pharmaceutical sector not just for its medicines and vaccines but also for its consumer healthcare products Pfizer reported better than expected fourth quarter 2017 results as it beat estimates for earnings as well as sales and provided an upbeat outlook for 2018  We believe that Pfizer snew products like Ibrance  contribution from acquisitions  cost cuts and share buybacks should help the company earn profits in the future quarters  Pfizer s shares have risen 1 6  this year so far Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 11 3   Meanwhile  estimates for 2018 and 2019 are up 6 1  and 4 1   respectively  over the past 30 days Novo Nordisk  CO NOVOb  A S   NYSE NVO  The year 2017 was eventful for this Denmark based pharma giant as it

150150,371666,AMGN,Radius  RDUS  Q4 Loss Wider Than Expected On Higher Expenses,opinion,Radius Health  Inc    NASDAQ RDUS   reported a loss of  1 59 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017  wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of  1 48 and the year ago quarter loss of  1 22  Increase in general and administrative expenses led to the wider than anticipated net loss year over year Radius Health  Inc  Price and Consensus   The company reported sales of Tymlos  abaloparatide  of  7 7 million surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 7 million Quarter in DetailResearch and development expenses for the reported quarter were  22 9 million  down 10 5  year over year due to the reduction in R D expenses associated with the elacestrant projects and the development of Tymlos   Radius Health received FDA approval for Tymlos in April 2017 for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture and began shipments to wholesalers at the end of May 2017 Tymlos continues to gain traction with approximately 259 million covered lives and 93  coverage in commercial plans  Tymlos market share reached approximately 32  of new patients starting anabolic therapy  NBRx  and 13  of total prescriptions in the anabolic market General and administrative expenses for the reported quarter jumped to  50 7 million from  27 5 million primarily due to personnel  promotional  and consulting expenses related to the launch of Tymlos Pipeline UpdatesThe company is developing two formulations of abaloparatide SC and abaloparatide transdermal  A labeling supplement for Tymlos was submitted to the FDA in the fourth quarter with the positive 43 month data from the ACTIVExtend study  which showed continued significant risk reduction in fractures in patients who were transitioned to receive an additional 24 months of bisphosphonate therapy  In January 2018  Radius Health met with the FDA to discuss the regulatory development path for the abaloparatide patch  The FDA agreed that  depending on the study results  a single  randomized  open label  active controlled  non inferiority  to abaloparatide SC  study of up to 500 patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis at high risk of fracture would be sufficient to gain approval for the abaloparatide patch  The primary endpoint in the study will be change in lumbar spine bone mineral density at 12 months  Radius Health expects to initiate this pivotal trial in mid 2019 Meanwhile  Radius Health  Marketing Authorisation Application   MAA   for Eladynos  abaloparatide SC  for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in Europe is under review by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use   CHMP   of the European Medicines Agency   EMA    The company however suffered a setback when the CHMP issued a second Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues  In December 2017  the CHMP issued a third Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues and informed the company that it intends to refer the MAA to a scientific advisory group for additional advice  The Company expects an opinion from the CHMP regarding the MAA in the first half of 2018   Radius Health and the FDA have also agreed on the design of a clinical trial in men with osteoporosis  which  if successful  will form the basis of an sNDA seeking to expand the use of Tymlos to treat men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture  The study is expected to be initiated in the first quarter of 2018 The company also plans to initiate a clinical trial in men with osteoporosis  which  if successful  will form the basis of an sNDA seeking to expand the label to treat men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture  The study is expected to be initiated in the first quarter of 2018 Meanwhile  the company presented positive data on elacestrant for breast cancer in December 2017  The FDA also granted Fast Track designation to elacestrant in October 2017  In February 2018  Radius Health obtained scientific advice from the EMA regarding a potential single arm monotherapy phase II trial of elacestrant in patients with ER positive HER2 negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer  Based on feedback from the EMA and the FDA  the company will conduct a single  randomized  controlled phase II trial of elacestrant as a third line monotherapy in approximately 300 patients with ER positive HER2 negative advanced metastatic breast cancer Our TakeThe company s wider than expected loss in the fourth quarter was due to escalated expenses with the commercialization of Tymlos  The drug continues to gain traction and grab further market share Radius Health  shares have gained 0 2  in the last six months compared with the   gain of 2 7  Although the osteoporosis market in the United Sates has great potential as approximately 1 4 million postmenopausal women experience an osteoporotic fractur each year  Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly  Co s   NYSE LLY   Forteo and Amgen s   NASDAQ AMGN   Prolia Moreover  the approved label carries a boxed warning of osteosarcoma  a malignant bone tumor   The company also a setback when the CHMP issued a third

Gazyva for untreated advanced follicular lymphoma and Avastin for glioblastoma in adult patients whose cancer has progressed after prior treatment Alecensa was also approved as a monotherapy for the

primary progressive forms of multiple sclerosis and Hemlibra was granted a positive opinion by the CHMP Meanwhile  Tecentriq in combination with Avastin showed positive study results in lung cancer and kidney cancer On the diagnostics front  Roche entered into a strategic  long term partnership with GE Healthcare to jointly develop and co market digital clinical decision support solutions Our TakeRoche performance in 2017 was strong driven by contribution from newly launched drugs  The label expansion of key drugs  Perjeta  Tecentriq and Alecensa will further drive growth  Ocrevus and Hemlibra have been successfully launched  However  sales of Avastin and Tarceva continue to decline Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche as its

150212,371728,AMGN,Amgen  AMGN  Q4 Earnings   Sales Lag  2018 Sales View Soft,opinion,"Biotech major Amgen Inc    NASDAQ AMGN   reported fourth quarter 2017 earnings of  2 89 per share  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 04 by 4 9   Earnings were flat year over year as lower sales and higher operating costs offset the benefit of a lower tax rate Including a  6 1 billion charge related to U S  tax reform  fourth quarter 2017 loss per share was  5 89 against earnings of  2 59 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016 Total revenues of  5 80 billion in the quarter missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 86 billion  Revenues declined 3  year over year Quarter in DetailTotal product revenues declined 2  from the year ago quarter to  5 57 billion  U S    4 35 billion  ex U S    1 22 billion  as increasing demand for newer products like Prolia  Kyprolis  Xgeva and Blincyto was not enough to make up for lower sales of some of Amgen s largest products like Enbrel  Aranesp  Epogen  Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure Revenues of Amgen s erythropoiesis stimulating agent  ESA   Aranesp  declined 7  from the year ago quarter to  491 million due to lower demand and unfavorable changes in currency rates Revenues of the other ESA  Epogen  declined 15  to  270 million due to lower selling price owing to a newly negotiated contract with DaVita Inc Neulasta revenues were flat at  1 14 billion from the year ago period as lower demand was offset by changes in accounting estimates Increased competition from PD 1s and other new cancer therapies is hurting demand for Neulasta  However  the Neulasta Onpro kit  on body injector  continues to perform well  commanding a market share of about 60  in the United States for all Neulasta sales Please note that Neulasta and Epogen could start facing biosimilar competition in the United States this year  which will hurt sales further Neupogen recorded a 27  decline in sales to  126 million due to biosimilar competition in the United States  Zarxio  Sandoz s  Novartis    NYSE NVS   generic arm  biosimilar version of Neupogen  was launched in the United States in September 2015 and is hurting sales Enbrel delivered revenues of  1 42 billion  down 13  from the year ago quarter due to lower selling prices and increased competition  which hurt demand  Amgen launched the Enbrel AutoTouch  an autoinjector device in November last year Prolia revenues came in at  574 million  up 24  from the year ago quarter due to higher demand  The osteoporosis drug witnessed continued growth in new patient starts and strong repeat injection rates  which drove year over year growth Meanwhile  Xgeva delivered revenues of  391 million  up 4  from the year ago quarter mainly due to higher demand and favorable changes in inventory levels Earlier this year  Amgen gained FDA approval for an expanded label for Xgeva to include prevention ofskeletal related events  SREs  inpatients with multiple myeloma  Until now Xgeva was only approved for the prevention of SREs in solid tumors in patients with bone metastases  The approval for the expanded patient population may drive sales of Xgeva in future quarters Sensipar Mimpara revenues were flat at  411 million as higher price increases were offset by unfavorable inventory changes Vectibix revenues came in at  159 million  up 11   driven by higher demand Kyprolis recorded sales of  227 million  up 24  year over year driven by higher demand and robust uptake from outside U S  markets Amgen s regulatory application in the United States to include overall survival data from the ENDEAVOR study on the label of Kyprolis was granted approval by the FDA earlier this month  Also  earlier this week Amgen announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  has given a positive opinion recommending addition of ENDEAVOR on Kyprolis label in the EU  The study demonstrated that a combination of Kyprolis plus dexamethasone led to superior overall survival when compared to Takeda s Velcade plus dexamethasone  This overall survival data  if approved  can help drive usage and boost sales of Kyprolis Blincyto sales surged 59  from the year ago period to  46 million  reflecting higher demand Amgen s PCSK9 inhibitor  Repatha generated revenues of  98 million compared with  89 million in the third quarter Uptake of the drug  which gained FDA approval in August 2015  has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re imbursement issues payer restrictions  Sanofi   NYSE SNY   and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals also faced similar issues with their PCSK9 inhibitor  Praluent  The priority for Amgen right now is to improve patient access to Repatha In December  Amgen gained FDA approval to include a new indication   risk reduction of major cardiovascular events data   on Repatha s label based on data from the phase III cardiovascular outcomes study  FOURIER This makes Repatha the first PCSK9 inhibitor to prevent heart attacks  strokes and coronary revascularizations in adults with established cardiovascular disease  With the cardiovascular indication approved to be included in Repatha s label  patient access to Repatha is expected to improve Operating Margins DecreaseAdjusted operating margins declined 460 basis points  bps  to 45 9  due to higher operating costs and  79 million in expenses related to Hurricane Maria recovery efforts R D expenses declined 3  in the quarter due to lower late stage pipeline related costs and lower payments for in licensing transactions  SG A spend increased 8  due to higher investments to support new product launches  which partially offset the impact of October 2016 expiration of Enbrel residual royalty payments This month  Amgen s board of directors approved a new share buyback plan of  10 billion  bringing the total existing share repurchase authorization to  14 4 billion 2017 ResultsFull year 2017 sales of  22 85 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  22 90 billion  Revenues were within the guidance range of  22 7 billion to  23 0 billion  Sales declined 1  year over year Adjusted earnings for 2017 were  12 58 per share  also missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  12 69 per share  Earnings were within the guidance range of  12 50 to  12 70  Earnings rose 8  year over year 2018 GuidanceThe company expects total revenues in the range of  21 8 billion to  22 8 billion  which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  22 90 billion  Adjusted earnings are now expected in the range of  12 60 to  13 70 in 2018  The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at  12 65 per share Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 14  15   much lower than 18  in 2017 reflecting the impact of tax reform On expectation of an improved cash position following the tax reform  Amgen plans to invest approximately  3 5 billion over the next five years in capital expenditures  Approximately 75  of this investment will be made in the United States including setting up a new drug substance manufacturing plant in the country Our TakeAmgen had a rather poor quarter as it missed expectations for both earnings and sales and also issued a lower than expected sales guidance for 2018  Shares lost 1 7  in after market trading in response  However  in the past year  Amgen s shares have returned 10 7   better than the 4 6  increase registered by the  Though Amgen s newer products   Prolia  Xgeva  Vectibix  Nplate and Sensipar   are all performing well  their volume growth is not enough to offset the decline in mature brands like Enbrel due to competitive pressure  However  Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline and expects approval and launch of migraine candidate  Aimovig this year  Also  Amgevita  Amgen s biosimilar version of AbbVie s   NYSE ABBV   blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug  Humira is expected to be launched in Europe later this year  Parsabiv  a specialty product for kidney disease  was launched in the United States last month  Also  management seems quite confident that Repatha will become an important growth driver for the company with the inclusion of outcomes data on its label  Nonetheless  other than continuing competitive dynamics for Enbrel  possible generic competition to Sensipar and new competition for Neulasta and Aranesp could be the new challenges in 2018 Amgen carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see Amgen Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

150283,371799,AMGN,3 Large Cap Pharma Stocks To Watch Out For This New Year,opinion,"The year 2017 has turned out to be pretty impressive for the pharma biotech stocks  Though the industry was hampered by drug pricing issues in 2016  it bounced back and made a considerable headway in 2017  courtesy of a slew of FDA approvals  The regulatory body approved 46 novel drugs last year  easily surpassing 2016 s total tally of 22 
Particularly  large cap players in the industry raked in stellar returns  up 15 8  in the last 12 months  Nonetheless  the same space also posted a 5 2  decline in 2016 
Upbeat quarterly results  rise in demand for new product sales  successful innovation and product line expansion  strong clinical study results as well as a continued strong performance of legacy products propelled the large cap drug sector to scale new highs in 2017  Moreover  these tailwinds are expected to drive the sector s growth in 2018 
Meanwhile  jubilant Republicans have of late passed the tax overhaul bill for the first time in 30 years  The bill slashes corporate tax rates from 35  to 21   Such tax reduction is likely to further boost profit margins of these companies with more cash left in hand  This  in turn can also be used for striking strategic deals this year  which were relatively fewer in 2017 
Notably  the  sub industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of  104  placing it among the top 39  of the 265 plus Zacks industries  Our backtesting shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one 
Banking on such positive trends  investing in sound large cap pharma stocks this year seems judicious  We have therefore identified three Large Cap stocks based on a favorable combination of a solid Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and a strong VGM Score of A or B  These stocks are backed by sound fundamentals and ensure a steady stream of cash inflows 
Back tested results show that only stocks with an impressive  of A or B when combined with a bullish Zacks Rank of 1 or 2  offer the best upside potential 
Below are the selected three companies  poised to continue their winning streak this year 
AbbVie Inc    NYSE ABBV  
This Illinois based biopharmaceutical company is a lucrative option  The stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and a VGM Score of B  Shares of the company have soared 57 9  in a year s time  Moreover  the stock s earnings and sales are further estimated to increase 18 2  and 11 8   respectively  in 2018 

 
These positive trends were supported by a series of positive news in the past few months  AbbVie presented promising data from several pivotal studies  gained key regulatory approvals and settled its Humira patent disputes with Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN   
With several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones expected in 2018  the bullish run of the stock is expected to continue this year 
Novo Nordisk A S   NYSE NVO  
We also recommend Novo Nordisk  CO NOVOb   the Denmark based global healthcare company and a leader in the worldwide diabetes market   Shares of the company have surged 51 2  in a year s time  Moreover  the stock s earnings and sales are further estimated to increase 5 3  and 1 5   respectively  in 2018 
Currently the stock  with VGM Score of B  carries a Zacks Rank of 2  You can see  

 
Novo Nordisk has been in news for the past few months based on the encouraging progress of its diabetes pipeline  In December 2017  Novo Nordisk announced that the FDA has approved its semaglutide once daily pre filled pen to improve glycaemic control in type II diabetes patients  It will be marketed by the trade name of Ozempic 
The company expects to launch Ozempic in the United States in the beginning of 2018  Meanwhile  in September  the FDA had approved Fiasp  fast acting insulin aspart  for treating adults with diabetes 
In August  the FDA had approved label expansion of the company s diabetes drug  Victoza  now approved to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type II diabetes 
The company s label expansion efforts and the corresponding approvals bode well for its growth 
Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG   OTC RHHBY  
Investors can count on Switzerland based Roche Holding with a VGM Score of B  The company is a Zacks  2 Ranked player with its shares having gained 10 1  in the last 12 months 

 
Roche dominates the breast cancer space with strong demand for its HER2 franchise drugs like Herceptin  Perjeta and Kadcyla  The company also has a dominant position in lung cancer market 
The company is looking for a label expansion of drugs namely  Actemra  which was approved for the treatment of giant cell arteritis last May  This is the sixth FDA approval for Actemra since the medicine was launched in 2010 
Moreover  the recent FDA approval of Hemlibra for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia A is encouraging  Also  the potential acquisition of Ignyta   announced a couple of weeks earlier   is likely to strengthen Roche  s pipeline as the integration will add a mid stage cancer candidate entrectinib to its portfolio 
Continuous label expansions of key drugs  regular approvals and a robust pipeline are expected to drive the stock in 2018

150367,371883,AMGN,Pfizer s Cancer Drug Sutent Gets FDA Nod For Label Expansion,opinion,"Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE   announced that the FDA has approved a label expansion for its cancer drug Sutent  sunitinib malate   With this latest approval  Sutent s label has been expanded as an adjuvant treatment of adult patients at high risk of recurrent renal cell carcinoma   RCC   following surgery  This approval makes it the first and only adjuvant therapy for recurrent RCC  the most common type of kidney cancer 
Sutent is marketed for the first line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma  RCC  
We remind investors that the supplemental new drug application  sNDA  for the drug was accepted by the FDA earlier in May  Subsequently  in September  the drug s label for the expanded indication got a mixed response from the FDA s Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee  ODAC   The committee voted six in favor and six against the benefit risk profile for Sutent for the expanded indication  However  the drug s label expansion was approved earlier than the target action date in January 2018 
Pfizer s shares have underperformed the  so far this year  The stock has gained 9 5   comparing unfavorably with the industry s 14 7  rally during the period 

Notably  the FDA approval was based on positive data from a phase III study  S TRAC   evaluating Sutent as an adjuvant treatment in patients at high risk of recurrent RCC  following nephrectomy  surgical removal of the cancer containing kidney   Full data presented in October last year  showed that the trial met the primary endpoint of improving disease free survival   DFS    determined by a blinded independent central review in such patients  Data demonstrated that Sutent extended DFS by 6 8 years compared with 5 6 years in the placebo arm  resulting in an overall risk reduction of 24  
An application for use in the same patient population is also under review in the EU 
Significantly  the kidney cancer market is already pretty crowded  The drug faces stiff competition from Bristol Myers Squibb s   NYSE BMY   Opdivo  Novartis    NYSE NVS   Afinitor and Votrient  Bayer  DE BAYGN  s and Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  s Nexavar  Roche s   OTC RHHBY   Avastin and Tecentriq among others 
Sutent generated sales of  805 million year to date  down 2  year over year due to competitive pressure  However  with this approval for the expanded patient population  sales of the drug should improve 
Per information provided by the company  RCC accounts for around 90  of all kidney cancers  Also  those at high risk of recurrence represent approximately 15  of all patients  It is estimated that 60  of high risk patients will have RCC recurrence within five years  Hence  the potential market opportunity for the drug is huge for this additional indication Pfizer  Inc  Price

S    1 16 billion  as strong demand for newer products like Prolia  Kyprolisand Blincyto was not enough to make up for lower sales of mature brands like Enbrel  Epogen  Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure Revenues of Amgen s erythropoiesis stimulating agent  ESA   Aranesp  declined 3  from the year ago quarter to  516 million due to lower demand Revenues of the other ESA  Epogen  declined 21  to  264 million due to lower selling price owing to a recently negotiated contract with DaVita Inc  Unfavorable changes in inventory also hurt Epogen sales Neulasta revenues declined 6  to  1 12 billion from the year ago period dueto unfavorable shift in timing of purchases by some large customersand increased competition from PD 1s and other new cancer therapies  However  the Neulasta Onpro kit  on body injector  continues to perform well  commanding a market share of about 56  in the United States for all Neulasta sales Neupogen recorded a 25  decline in sales to  138 million due to biosimilar competition in the United States  Zarxio  Sandoz s  Novartis    NYSE NVS   generic arm  biosimilar version of Neupogen  was launched in the United States in September 2015 and is hurting sales Enbrel delivered revenues of  1 36 billion  down 6  from the year ago quarter due to lower selling prices and increased competition  which hurt demand Enbrel lost market share by less than 1 point in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments Prolia revenues came in at  464 million  up 22  from the year ago quarter due to higher demand  The osteoporosis drug witnessed market share gains in both the United States and international markets Meanwhile  Xgeva delivered revenues of  387 million  down 2  from the year ago quarter mainly due to unfavorable shift in timing

Kyprolis recorded sales of  207 million  up 13  year over year driven by higher demand and robust uptake from outside U S  markets Amgen s regulatory applications in the United States and EU to include overall survival data from the ENDEAVOR study on the label of Kyprolis are under review  The study demonstrated that a combination of Kyprolis plus dexamethasone led to superior overall survival when compared to Velcade plus dexamethasone  This overall survival data  if approved  can help drive usage and boost sales of Kyprolis  The FDA is expected to give its decision on Apr 30 next year Blincyto sales surged 79  from the year ago period to  52 million  reflecting higher demand  In July  the FDA approved the inclusion of overall survival data from the TOWER study on the label of Blincyto to convert the accelerated approval to a full approval  The addition of the data must have boosted sales Amgen s PCSK9 inhibitor  Repatha generated revenues of  89 million  not a very significant improvement from  83 million in the second quarter  Changes in inventory and accounting adjustments that favourably affected second quarter sales were missing in the third quarter Uptake of the drug  which gained FDA approval in August 2015  has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re imbursement issues payer restrictions  Sanofi   NYSE SNY   and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ REGN   also faced similar issues with their PCSK9 inhibitor  Praluent  The priority for Amgen right now is to improve patient access to Repatha Amgen s regulatory applications to include data from the phase III cardiovascular outcomes study  FOURIER  on Repatha s label is under priority review with a decision from the FDA expected on Dec 2  We remind investors that data from the FOURIER study  presented in the first quarter  had revealed significant reduction in myocardial infarctions and strokes  The data is key to commercial success of Repatha as it will broaden the use of the drug  Though data from the study looks good  it is not very clear if payers will be willing to improve access to Repatha based on this data Operating Margins IncreaseAdjusted operating margins rose 270 basis points  bps  to 55 6  due to lower operating costs  reflecting continued benefits from transformation and process improvement efforts R D expenses declined 11  in the quarter due to lower late stage pipeline related costs and lower upfront payments for in licensing transactions than third quarter of last year  SG A spend declined 6  due to the October 2016 expiration of Enbrel residual royalty payments  which offset investments to support new product launches Amgen bought back shares worth  0 8 billion in the quarter  This month  Amgen s board of directors approved a new share buyback plan of  5 billion 2017 GuidanceWhile Amgen slightly raised the lower end of the previously issued sales outlook  it raised the earnings guidance on the back of effective cost management The company expects total revenue in the range of  22 7 billion to  23 0 billion compared with  22 5 billion to  23 0 billion expected previously  Adjusted earnings are now expected in the range of  12 50 to  12 70 in 2017 compared with  12 15 to  12 65 per share expected previously However  the company tightened its reported earnings guidance to a range of  10 96  11 20 per share from  10 79  11 37 to account for the costs related to the hurricane recovery efforts at its Puerto Rico manufacturing facility  Though the company does not expect any negative impact on product supply  the expenses related to Hurricane Maria are expected to hurt earnings per share by 15 18 cents Operating expenses are expected to be higher in the fourth quarter than the third Our TakeThough Amgen beat expectations for both earnings and sales and raised its earnings guidance for the full year  shares lost more than 1  in after market trading due to the decline in sales and probably due to disappointing sales of Repatha  a key new drug  However  so far this year  Amgen s shares are up 21 4   better than the 6 9  increase registered by the  Though Amgen s newer products   Prolia  Xgeva  Vectibix  Nplate and Sensipar   are all performing well  their volume growth may not be enough to offset the decline in mature brands like Enbrel due to competitive pressure  However  Amgen s

Sales in Detail
Currency movement hurt Pfizer s third quarter revenues slightly   54 million  while the divestiture of Hospira infusion systems business hurt sales by 2  in the quarter  In February 2017  Pfizer divested its Hospira infusion systems  HIS business to ICU Medical  Inc    NASDAQ ICUI    Excluding currency headwinds and HIS revenues  sales rose 4  
Strong performance of newer products like Ibrance  breast cancer   Xtandi  prostate cancer  and Xeljanz  rheumatoid arthritis  offset lower sales of Enbrel  Viagra and the Prevnar Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise and loss of exclusivity for some products 
International revenues rose 2   up 3  an operational basis  to  6 63 billion  Meanwhile  U S  revenues were flat at  6 53 billion 
Segment Discussion
Pfizer s reporting segments are Pfizer Innovative Health  IH  and Pfizer Essential Health  EH  
Pfizer IH sales grew 11  on a reported and operational basis from the year ago period to  8 12 billion  Pfizer IH revenues were driven by persistently strong momentum of Ibrance and Eliquis globally and growth of Lyrica and Xeljanz primarily in the United States 
While Ibrance revenues rose 60  to  878 million in the quarter  Xeljanz rose 48  to  348 million  Lyrica sales rose 10  to  1 15 billion  Eliquis alliance revenues and direct sales rose 43  to  644 million 
Revenues from the blockbuster prostate cancer drug  Xtandi  added to Pfizer s portfolio following the September 2016 Medivation acquisition  also contributed to U S  revenues  Xtandi recorded alliance revenues of  150 million in the quarter compared with  141 million in the second quarter 
This was partially offset by continued decline in revenues from Prevnar 13 in the United States and lower revenues of Enbrel and Viagra 
Enbrel revenues declined 13  to  613 million in key European markets due to biosimilar competition  Pfizer has exclusive rights to Amgen  Inc  s   NASDAQ AMGN   blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis  RA  drug  Enbrel  outside the United States and Canada  Total Viagra  IH EH  sales declined 20  to  308 million  Lower demand and wholesaler destocking ahead of the potential generic competition in December hurt sales of Viagra 
Global Prevnar 13 Prevenar 13 revenues declined 1  to  1 52 billion  Prevnar 13 revenues tanked 4  in the United States due to continued decline in revenues for the eligible adult patient population  However  Prevenar 13 revenues rose 5  in international markets due to favorable timing of government purchases in some emerging markets 
Consumer Healthcare revenues rose 4  to  829 million  Global Oncology revenues surged 46  to  1 62 billion driven by Ibrance  Global Vaccine revenues rose 1  to  1 65 billion  Internal Medicine rose 9  to  2 46 billion  The Inflammation   Immunology franchise rose 4  to  1 billion  Additionally  the portfolio of Rare Disease declined 3  to  569 million 
Earlier this month  Pfizer said that it is exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Healthcare segment including a partial or a full separation through a spin off  sale or other transaction  A decision is expected next year 
Pfizer EH segment sales recorded a decline of 12   down 11  operationally  to  5 05 billion  Excluding HIS revenues  EH sales declined 7  
EH revenues were hurt by the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products primarily Pristiq in the United States and Vfend and Lyrica in Europe  lower revenues from legacy Hospira products due to product shortages and divesture of HIS  However  in the EH business  biosimilars and emerging markets did well in the quarter 
Pfizer launched Inflectra  a biosimilar version of Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   and Merck s blockbuster RA drug Remicade  in November last year  While Inflectra recorded sales of  34 million in the United States and  112 million globally  all other biosimilars brought in sales of  28 million  down 16   from outside the U S  markets  Emerging markets revenues grew 7  operationally 
Adjusted selling  informational and administrative  SI A  expenses declined 1   operationally  in the quarter to  3 48 billion  Adjusted R D expenses also declined 1  to  1 85 billion 
2017 Guidance Updated
While Pfizer raised its adjusted earnings guidance  it tightened the revenue expectations for the year  Revenues are expected in the range of  52 4 billion to  53 1 billion compared with  52 billion to  54 billion expected previously  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  52 65 billion 
Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of  2 58    2 62 compared with  2 54    2 60 expected previously  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  2 56 per share 
At the mid point  adjusted EPS is expected to increase 8   previously 7   
Research and development expenses are expected in the range of  7 5  7 8 billion  previously  7 5  8 0 billion   while SI A spending is projected in the range of  14 0  14 5 billion  previously  13 7  14 7 billion  
Our Take
Pfizer s third quarter results were mixed as it beat earnings estimates but delivered in line sales  However  the company raised its adjusted earnings guidance for the year  Shares were down 0 5  in pre market trading  So far this year  Pfizer s shares are up 8 2   comparing unfavorably with an increase of 14 6  for the 

 
Pfizer continues to face headwinds in the form of genericization of key drugs  lost alliance revenues  pricing pressure and rising competition  which are hurting the top line  Nonetheless  we believe that new products like Ibrance  contribution from acquisitions  cost cutting efforts and share buybacks should help the company achieve its guidance 
Pfizer also boasts a strong pipeline and expects a  multiyear wave of potential new product launches and product line extensions   Bavencio is being considered a key long term growth driver for Pfizer 
Bavencio avelumab received FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma  MCC  in March this year and for advanced bladder cancer in May  Bavencio was also approved in EU and Japan in September for MCC 
Two other leukemia treatments   Besponsa inotuzumab ozogamicin for relapsed refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia  ALL  and Mylotarg for newly diagnosed CD33 positive acute myeloid leukemia  AML    were also approvedby the FDA in the third quarter  Besponsa was also approved in the EU in June

ImmunoGen s shares have significantly outperformed the  year to date  The stock has soared 194 1  compared with the industry s increase of 2  during the same time 

 
The IND application for IMGN632 was supported by positive data from preclinical studies  which demonstrated IMGN63 s selective activity against AML cells  while sparing normal bone marrow cells 
We remind investors that ImmunoGen had earlier entered into a strategic collaboration and option agreement with Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC   NASDAQ JAZZ   in August for the development and commercialization of IMGN632  The collaboration also included another program s IMGN779   a CD33 targeting ADC   already in phase I stage for the treatment of AML 
Notably  ImmunoGen is focused on developing targeted cancer therapeutics using its proprietary ADC technology  In fact  this innovative technology of the company is also used in Roche s   OTC RHHBY   marketed product  Kadcyla and in three other development stage candidates in its pipeline 
Additionally  the ADC technology is used in development programs by ImmunoGen s partners Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN    Bayer AG  DE BAYGN   Biotest  CytomX  Eli Lilly  Novartis  Sanofi  PA SASY  and Takeda 
Per the company s press release  approximately 21 380 patients are expected to be diagnosed with AML this year in the United States  Among them  around 10 590 patients are anticipated to succumb to the disease  Hence  IMGN632 s potential market opportunity is huge in the country  if successfully developed ImmunoGen  Inc  Price

reportedly 10    A similar tax move was made for bringing in overseas cash reserves by the Bush administration in 2004 for one time tax of 5 25   A number of companies repatriated an amount exceeding  300 billion The current tax code allows tax repatriation at 35  rate  However  it gives tax credit for the amount of tax paid in overseas country Anticipated ImpactThe reforms have been proposed to create new jobs and aid economic growth through expanded investment as more cash will available to companies through tax cuts and repatriation  However  the extent to which these steps will be successful is uncertain  A large portion of the repatriated cash in 2004 was used to fund share buybacks and dividend payments  Though the buybacks fueled a stock rally  there was no actual economic growth The tax reforms are expected to benefit companies which have operations around the globe  A similar buyback this time is also expected to help the stocks grow   Large cap pharma companies based in the United Sates with major operations worldwide including J J  Amgen Inc    NASDAQ AMGN    Gilead Sciences and others are sitting on huge pile of cash reserves stashed in overseas countries  The repatriation will benefit these large drug biotech companies more than the tax savings due to rate cutsMoreover  repatriation of cash held overseas will create a surplus in domestic cash reserve  which may fuel merger   acquisition  M A  in the sector  The industry has seen only two major acquisitions this year  Actelion by Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   and Kite Pharma  Inc    NASDAQ KITE   by Gilead Sciences  Inc    NASDAQ GILD    which is expected to close by 2017 end Let s discuss the impact of tax reform on the some drug biotech giants Johnson   JohnsonJohnson   Johnson is a well known brand all over the world catering to a wide variety of medical needs  The company has paid tax at an effective rate of 16 5   19 7  and 20 6  for 2016  2015 and 2014  respectively  Therefore  a revision of tax rate to 15  will not bring a huge positive change in post tax earnings  As of June end  J J had  12 9 billion in cash reserve  down almost 70  from 2016 year end  The company has used a major chunk of its cash reserves in 2017  Hence  J J is expected to be least impacted by these reforms AmgenThe company has a strong presence in the oncology hematology  cardiovascular disease  inflammation  bone health and nephrology markets  The effective tax rate for Amgen in 2016  2015 and 2014 were 15 7   13  and 7 6   respectively  Hence  a tax rate cut will have minimal effect  Amgen had nearly  35 billion in overseas cash as of 2016 fiscal end  per a Bloomberg report  The total cash reserve of the company has changed minimally in the first six months of 2017  So  the repatriation reform may initiate a buyback  Moreover  after 10  tax  it will have more than  30 billion in domestic cash reserve  if the total overseas cash is repatriated  This increase in domestic cash can also be used in acquiring new drug technologies like CAR T therapy Gilead SciencesGilead recently announced its plan to acquire Kite Pharma for nearly  12 billion  adding the latter s CAR T therapy candidate to its pipeline  Gilead is planning to complete the acquisition through a combination of cash and debt  Per a Bloomberg report  Gilead had  29 3 billion of cash reserves in overseas countries at the end of 2016  A repatriation will help the company to pay off the debt quickly  The effective tax rate has been between 16  and 21   which suggests a minimal impact due to tax rate cut

150500,372016,AMGN,OncoSec Medical Inc   ONCS   Seeks Accelerated Approval To Treat,opinion,"The fight against cancer has always been at the forefront of the biotech industry  As the methods of attacking and healing cancer can vary greatly between different companies  researchers are always searching for newer and more effective ways to combat the disease  Likewise  experienced biotech investors are always on the lookout for emerging opportunities that show promise in bringing a new treatment to the table  OncoSec Medical Incorporated  NASDAQ ONCS  is maturing as one of those niche companies that has earned significant interest from investors and sector partners alike  thanks to its robust and differentiated approach to cancer treatment 
ONCS Advances With Novel Platform
OncoSec  a San Diego based biotechnology company  is combining over two decades of research and development processes that may very well define a new chapter in how disease gets treated  The company s mission is laser focused on developing new and effective ways of treating various types of cancer  specifically through their innovative and proprietary immunotherapy treatments  OncoSec s focus is intent on developing immunotherapy benefits designed to address an unmet medical need in the market by providing a proven safe and clinically effective treatment for anti PD 1 relapse refractory patients  alongside other cancer indications 
Immunotherapy  as biotech investors know  has become an industry buzz word  and in its simplest form  works by using the body s immune system to engage its war against cancer  The therapy attempts to increase the uptake and absorption of DNA based treatments directly into the tumor  OncoSec is well on their way to demonstrating best in class potential built out by compelling proof of concept clinical trials  Data published by ONCS is impressive  showing a 48  BORR  Best Overall Response Rate  in patients diagnosed with immunologically  cold  tumors   Cold  tumors are those designated as difficult for the body s immune system to treat on its own  and carries a high likelihood of relapse 
Recognizing its value  immunotherapy is now considered a primary option for tumor treatment  and scientists are looking toward innovative and combination therapies to treat these diseases  To address that need  OncoSec has established its use of electroporation technology to deliver a safe and targeted method of gene transmission  Additionally  ONCS is working to broaden its deliverables by building upon multi gene plasmid constructs to meet next generation treatment strategies  OncoSec has secured Fast Track Designation from the FDA  and alongside an Orphan Drug Status for additional pipeline candidates  the company sits on the verge of earning an FDA review for accelerated approval for their lead program in 2019  Furthermore  ONCS has in place a drug supply and clinical collaboration agreement with Merck  NYSE MRK   a globally recognized player in the pharmaceutical industry  Overall  the convincing clinical capability built out by OncoSec may indeed provide them with a sizable advantage amongst competitors in securing a valuable and competitive place in the market 
OncoSec s Approach Makes A Difference
Although OncoSec may be a relatively small company at the moment  the company s targeted strategy has allowed them to not only keep pace with their competitors but in several clinical aspects surpasses them  supported by published and compelling clinical data  While most competitors  programs are still in Phase 1 or 2 studies  OncoSec is now advancing its Phase 2 registration enabling clinical trials in an expedited manner  Additionally  the company s projected milestone for treatment approval in early 2019 suggests that OncoSec may further distance themselves from market competitors and emerge as a market leader in targeted cancer treatment  enjoying licensing and partnership opportunities intended to exploit the multi billion dollar market potential 
Being a disruptor may be an advantage  and the innovative technology within OncoSec s pipeline is a key factor that sets the company apart from its competitors  potentially leading to ONCS s ability to alter the course of cancer treatment  OncoSec s flagship treatment  ImmunoPulse  IL 12  is an innovative  non viral gene delivery platform designed to utilize the power of the human immune system to target and attack tumors in the body  The non viral treatment works by introducing a controlled amount of IL 12 in the tumor s microenvironment  which allows the immune system to recognize the tumor and assemble an army of killer t cells to eliminate the diseased target  In clinical trials  the ImmunoPulse  IL 12 system was shown to deliver equal gene transmission rates  while maintaining a higher safety profile than other currently available viral and non viral therapies  ImmunoPulse  IL 12 benefits are proven and validated through multiple human clinical trials across multiple disease types  and as there is no limit on size or number of genes delivered to the patient  the therapy can be specifically targeted to address multiple disease indications  With this advantage  the device carries the opportunity to be the first of its kind on the market  putting OncoSec in a potentially lucrative and enviable position by cementing a landscape for both a strategic and partnership opportunity 
The ImmunoPulse  Effect  A Key Advantage
As stated earlier  the ImmunoPulse  IL 12 system works by delivering a certain amount of IL 12 into the patient s tumor  IL 12  or Interleukin 12  is a powerful and pro inflammatory cytokine  and tavokinogene teslaplasmid  or  Tavo   is a plasmid DNA encoding for IL 12  The process plays out by Tavo getting injected into the microenvironment of the tumor  then delivering the Tavo inside the cells  which in turn secretes the IL 12 inside the tumor  Subsequently  the body s T cells can better identify and determine how to fight against the cancerous cells  leading to a proficient anti tumor response from the body  The intratumoral delivery made possible by the ImmunoPulse  device carries a notably low toxicity level for any immunotherapeutic treatment  making it a safe yet powerful treatment unlike anything currently on the market  Another important feature of the ImmunoPulse  system is its flexibility  The platform allows for precisely measurable variability in the number of genes delivered to a targeted area  which allows physicians to adjust the treatment to bring out the best possible anti tumor immune response in patients  Finally  and intrinsically important  is that the device has proven effective in its ability to deliver multiple genes into the tumor simultaneously  which may significantly reduce the likelihood for the tumor to avoid the internal defenses of the body s immune system after treatment 
And  while industry limitations exist in overcoming the tumors ability to challenge an immune response  the strategy in place by OncoSec  utilizing the ImmunoPulse  platform  aims to target and defeat that limitation  Currently  the majority of patients with solid tumors do not respond to anti PD 1 therapy  regardless of the cancer type  This occurrence  of course  begs the question  what is causing these patients to not receive any benefit from this kind of therapy  Scientists have found that in general  patients who DO respond to anti PD 1 therapies have what is known as a  hot  or  inflamed  tumor  meaning that the tumor already has a high expression of PD L1 in its cells  along with a higher density of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes  A  hot  tumor is more easily detected by the body s immune system  thus more responsive to anti PD 1 therapies  opening the door to OncoSec s novel technology  Complimented by the ImmunoPulse  platform  interim clinical studies have shown that the ONCS treatment has the potential to convert  cold  tumors to  hot   actually increasing the patient s odds of responding positively to anti PD 1 therapies  During these clinical trials  ImmunoPulse  IL 12 was shown to have a noticeable response in patients that were confirmed to have  cold  tumors  After the treatment regimen  results showed a 48  Best Overall Response Rate  BORR  in patients provided with ImmunoPulse  IL 12 combined with anti PD 1  proving the value in patients who initially had a lower chance of benefiting from the anti PD 1 treatment alone  The published data suggests that people who were unable to receive healing treatment are now able to significantly increase their chances at responding to the same therapy after using ImmunoPulse  IL 12  If these test results prove to be durable throughout the upcoming clinical trials  OncoSec could be very well positioned to introduce a lucrative and game changing cancer treatment technology to a receptive market 
All Signs Point To Yes
Alongside the development of their ImmunoPulse  IL 12 treatment  OncoSec is strategizing on how to best take advantage of the company s expected developments and market opportunities  Primarily  ONCS has set their target patient population to those with a pathological diagnosis of unresectable or metastatic melanoma  stage III IV  that fail anti PD1 therapy  Currently  there are over 10 200 of these patients in the United States that could potentially benefit from ImmunoPulse  IL 12 therapy in combination with anti PD 1  For example  there are an estimated 9 900 patients currently undergoing anti PD 1 therapy in the U S  Of these 9 900 people  around 6 400 have shown poor response rates to anti PD 1 therapy alone  demonstrating that a significant subset of individuals could receive a tremendous benefit from treatment via the ImmunoPulse  IL 12 platform  And  with over 80 000 new cases of melanoma diagnosed in the U S  per year  OncoSec s ImmunoPulse  device  utilizing combination therapies  could prove to be a revolutionary treatment for those who are unresponsive to current procedures  And  researchers within the company have expressed that their early proof of concept in melanoma patients indicates a potential for the ImmunoPulse  IL 12 platform to work on other ailments with similar characteristics  For instance  diseases such as triple negative breast cancer and head and neck cancers are known to have accessible tumors  and similar to melanoma  also carry a very high rate of non response to anti PD 1 therapy alone  The characteristics of both of these cancers point to a likely possibility of patients responding to the ImmunoPulse  IL 12 platform similarly to how it works in patients with melanoma  and OncoSec has established plans to investigate additional ways of broadening the device s reach  From the inhibition of a tumor s immunosuppressive environment to cell signaling and trafficking  OncoSec researchers are already aware of many potential applications of Interleukin 12 delivered through the ImmunoPulse  device  and company management acknowledges that the application s power may be an extremely profitable opportunity 
Investors will be pleased to know that the market and medical community interest in melanoma and immunotherapy treatments are significant and that a gap in the market is waiting to get filled by a responsive company  like ONCS  who is demonstrating the ability to provide a reliable  safe  and curable treatment to cancer patients  In the past  companies have spent vast sums of money on earlier programs that dealt with the same issues focused on by OncoSec  For example  Amgen s 2011 acquisition of BioVex demonstrated the proof of interest and need for an effective melanoma treatment  BioVex was a company that had been researching and developing a treatment against melanoma called Imlygic  also known as T VEC  T VEC was an oncolytic viral therapy that aimed to promote a similar anti tumor response to OncoSec s ImmunoPulse   The company showed promise  and in 2011  was purchased by Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  for  1 billion in hopes that the treatment would prove revolutionary  Unfortunately  as additional clinical data continued to become available  it was found that the treatment was not as effective as initially hoped  and as of 2016  there is little evidence that the treatment was able to extend the life of people with melanoma  Additionally  T VEC was known to cause a myriad of undesirable side effects  including fever  nausea  and other flu like symptoms in over 30  of those treated  Although the treatment proved unsuccessful  the BioVex deal was still one of the largest deals in the immunotherapy field at the time and signaled a voracious interest in bringing to market a more effective product  And  keeping this goal in mind  OncoSec may hold the potential to provide the treatment that T VEC was unable to deliver 
ONCS On The Fast Track
OncoSec  in some respects  is in a similar position to BioVex before their acquisition by Amgen   the company has robust clinical data to date  and as their Phase 2 data continues to unfold  the company is sure to spark the interest of respected players within the biotech industry  Not only has the initial testing of their ImmunoPulse  IL 12 platform brought positive results  but it is also doing so without causing many of the uncomfortable side effects caused by earlier and similar treatments  Additionally  the FDA s granting of Orphan Drug Status and Fast Track Approval to the company will allow them to more quickly develop and undergo research trials for their products  removing many of the restrictions that may be faced by competitors  Finally  as stated earlier  OncoSec has indicated that their ImmunoPulse  system is likely able to work on multiple tumor types  allowing the company to expand their label across different kinds of diseases  rather than simply melanoma 
As for what s currently in store for OncoSec  the company plans to initiate their enrollment for a phase 2 trial and collaboration with Merck  referred to as PISCES  by the end of 2017  The company also intends to hold an End of Phase 2  EOP2  meeting with the FDA during the 1H of 2018  which is anticipated to grant ONCS with an accelerated approval path for anti PD 1 non responders in melanoma  along with an approval of their plans for phase 3 trials  This phase 3 confirmatory study is expected to run throughout 2018 and carry on into late 2019  where the company has set milestone goals to obtain a marketing authorization to penetrate a market in need of a viable and responsive cancer treatment 
OncoSec may be considered by some to be a small company  but what can t get overlooked is that they have built an enviable foundation and scientific infrastructure  And  from a position of clinical strength  ONCS may be ideally placed to reap enormous benefit from the development of their promising immunotherapy treatment system  If ImmunoPulse  IL 12  with combination therapy  continues to deliver positive results  OncoSec may very well be the company the market has been waiting to embrace  providing game changing cancer treating technology that may alter the therapeutic landscape and fill a void to address unmet medical needs

OPTIMA is a phase IIIb international  multicenter  randomized  open label  non comparator study  314 patients with CSU symptoms despite treatment with H1 antagonists were initially randomized 4 3 to Xolair 150 or 300 mg for 24 weeks in the first dosing period  Thereafter  patients who responded well to the treatment were given a break and then  if symptoms returned were retreated 
Per the data  90  of CSU patients who responded well to initial treatment with Xolair regained symptom control within 12 weeks following a treatment interruption based on Weekly Urticaria Activity Score  UAS7  criteria  UAS7  6   Data from the study re confirmed that almost two thirds of patients treated with Xolair 300 mg for 6 months are well controlled 
We note that Xolair is approved for the treatment of CSU in the EU and the United States  chronic idiopathic urticaria   Xolair is also approved for the treatment of moderate to severe or severe persistent allergic asthma 
Novartis has a collaboration agreement with Roche Holdings AG   OTC RHHBY   to develop and co promote Xolair in the United States 
We note that Novartis is a global leader in Immunology   Dermatology with drugs like Cosentyx  Xolair  Zortress and Myfortic and Ilaris 

 
Novartis  stock has rallied 20 3  in the year so far compared with the  s 19 4  gain 
Novartis is currently going through a transitional stage  The company s blockbuster drug  Diovan  is facing stiff generic competition in the United States  EU and Japan  Gleevec lost exclusivity in the United States in February 2016  The company also lost patent protection for the drug in EU in December 2016 leading to generic competition 
The loss of patent protection for these top selling drugs continue to hurt sales  Hence  Novartis expects the next growth phase to begin in 2018 driven by Cosentyx  in psoriasis  psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis indications   Entresto  Kisqali and a deep pipeline with candidates like BAF312  AMG 334  RTH258 
Moreover  with the recent approval of Kymriah  Novartis is the first company to bring CAR T cell therapy for cancer treatment  Going forward  we expect that the approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing ones to bode well for Novartis 
On the other hand  generic division  Sandoz is a leader in biosimilar market with five marketed biosimilars  Omnitrope  a human growth hormone  Binocrit  an erythropoiesis stimulating agent used to treat anemia  and filgrastim for neutropenia under the brand names Zarzio outside the United States and Zarxio in the United States

150539,372055,AMGN,OncoSec Medical Seeks Accelerated Approval,opinion,"The fight against cancer has always been at the forefront of the biotech industry  As the methods of attacking and healing cancer can vary greatly between different companies  researchers are always searching for newer and more effective ways to combat the disease  Likewise  experienced biotech investors are always on the lookout for emerging opportunities that show promise in bringing a new treatment to the table  OncoSec Medical  NASDAQ ONCS  is maturing as one of those niche companies that has earned significant interest from investors and sector partners alike  thanks to its robust and differentiated approach to cancer treatment 
ONCS Advances With Novel Platform
OncoSec  a San Diego based biotechnology company  is combining over two decades of research and development processes that may very well define a new chapter in how disease gets treated  The company s mission is laser focused on developing new and effective ways of treating various types of cancer  specifically through their innovative and proprietary immunotherapy treatments  OncoSec s focus is intent on developing immunotherapy benefits designed to address an unmet medical need in the market by providing a proven safe and clinically effective treatment for anti PD 1 relapse refractory patients  alongside other cancer indications 
Immunotherapy  as biotech investors know  has become an industry buzz word  and in its simplest form  works by using the body s immune system to engage its war against cancer  The therapy attempts to increase the uptake and absorption of DNA based treatments directly into the tumor  OncoSec is well on their way to demonstrating best in class potential built out by compelling proof of concept clinical trials  Data published by ONCS is impressive  showing a 48  BORR  Best Overall Response Rate  in patients diagnosed with immunologically  cold  tumors   Cold  tumors are those designated as difficult for the body s immune system to treat on its own  and carries a high likelihood of relapse 
Recognizing its value  immunotherapy is now considered a primary option for tumor treatment  and scientists are looking toward innovative and combination therapies to treat these diseases  To address that need  OncoSec has established its use of electroporation technology to deliver a safe and targeted method of gene transmission  Additionally  ONCS is working to broaden its deliverables by building upon multi gene plasmid constructs to meet next generation treatment strategies  OncoSec has secured Fast Track Designation from the FDA  and alongside an Orphan Drug Status for additional pipeline candidates  the company sits on the verge of earning an FDA review for accelerated approval for their lead program in 2019  Furthermore  ONCS has in place a drug supply and clinical collaboration agreement with Merck  NYSE MRK   a globally recognized player in the pharmaceutical industry  Overall  the convincing clinical capability built out by OncoSec may indeed provide them with a sizable advantage amongst competitors in securing a valuable and competitive place in the market OncoSec s Approach Makes A DifferenceAlthough OncoSec may be a relatively small company at the moment  the company s targeted strategy has allowed them to not only keep pace with their competitors but in several clinical aspects surpasses them  supported by published and compelling clinical data  While most competitors  programs are still in Phase 1 or 2 studies  OncoSec is now advancing its Phase 2 registration enabling clinical trials in an expedited manner  Additionally  the company s projected milestone for treatment approval in early 2019 suggests that OncoSec may further distance themselves from market competitors and emerge as a market leader in targeted cancer treatment  enjoying licensing and partnership opportunities intended to exploit the multi billion dollar market potential 
Being a disruptor may be an advantage  and the innovative technology within OncoSec s pipeline is a key factor that sets the company apart from its competitors  potentially leading to ONCS s ability to alter the course of cancer treatment  OncoSec s flagship treatment  ImmunoPulse  IL 12  is an innovative  non viral gene delivery platform designed to utilize the power of the human immune system to target and attack tumors in the body  The non viral treatment works by introducing a controlled amount of IL 12 in the tumor s microenvironment  which allows the immune system to recognize the tumor and assemble an army of killer t cells to eliminate the diseased target  In clinical trials  the ImmunoPulse  IL 12 system was shown to deliver equal gene transmission rates  while maintaining a higher safety profile than other currently available viral and non viral therapies  ImmunoPulse  IL 12 benefits are proven and validated through multiple human clinical trials across multiple disease types  and as there is no limit on size or number of genes delivered to the patient  the therapy can be specifically targeted to address multiple disease indications  With this advantage  the device carries the opportunity to be the first of its kind on the market  putting OncoSec in a potentially lucrative and enviable position by cementing a landscape for both a strategic and partnership opportunity The ImmunoPulse  Effect  A Key
Advantage
As stated earlier  the ImmunoPulse  IL 12 system works by delivering a certain amount of IL 12 into the patient s tumor  IL 12  or Interleukin 12  is a powerful and pro inflammatory cytokine  and tavokinogene teslaplasmid  or  Tavo   is a plasmid DNA encoding for IL 12  The process plays out by Tavo getting injected into the microenvironment of the tumor  then delivering the Tavo inside the cells  which in turn secretes the IL 12 inside the tumor  Subsequently  the body s T cells can better identify and determine how to fight against the cancerous cells  leading to a proficient anti tumor response from the body  The intratumoral delivery made possible by the ImmunoPulse  device carries a notably low toxicity level for any immunotherapeutic treatment  making it a safe yet powerful treatment unlike anything currently on the market  Another important feature of the ImmunoPulse  system is its flexibility  The platform allows for precisely measurable variability in the number of genes delivered to a targeted area  which allows physicians to adjust the treatment to bring out the best possible anti tumor immune response in patients  Finally  and intrinsically important  is that the device has proven effective in its ability to deliver multiple genes into the tumor simultaneously  which may significantly reduce the likelihood for the tumor to avoid the internal defenses of the body s immune system after treatment 
And while industry limitations exist in overcoming the tumors ability to challenge an immune response  the strategy in place by OncoSec  utilizing the ImmunoPulse  platform  aims to target and defeat that limitation  Currently  the majority of patients with solid tumors do not respond to anti PD 1 therapy  regardless of the cancer type  This occurrence  of course  begs the question  what is causing these patients to not receive any benefit from this kind of therapy  Scientists have found that in general  patients who DO respond to anti PD 1 therapies have what is known as a  hot  or  inflamed  tumor  meaning that the tumor already has a high expression of PD L1 in its cells  along with a higher density of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes  A  hot  tumor is more easily detected by the body s immune system  thus more responsive to anti PD 1 therapies  opening the door to OncoSec s novel technology  Complimented by the ImmunoPulse  platform  interim clinical studies have shown that the ONCS treatment has the potential to convert  cold  tumors to  hot   actually increasing the patient s odds of responding positively to anti PD 1 therapies  During these clinical trials  ImmunoPulse  IL 12 was shown to have a noticeable response in patients that were confirmed to have  cold  tumors  After the treatment regimen  results showed a 48  Best Overall Response Rate  BORR  in patients provided with ImmunoPulse  IL 12 combined with anti PD 1  proving the value in patients who initially had a lower chance of benefiting from the anti PD 1 treatment alone  The published data suggests that people who were unable to receive healing treatment are now able to significantly increase their chances at responding to the same therapy after using ImmunoPulse  IL 12  If these test results prove to be durable throughout the upcoming clinical trials  OncoSec could be very well positioned to introduce a lucrative and game changing cancer treatment technology to a receptive market All Signs
Point To Yes
Alongside the development of their ImmunoPulse  IL 12 treatment  OncoSec is strategizing on how to best take advantage of the company s expected developments and market opportunities  Primarily  ONCS has set their target patient population to those with a pathological diagnosis of unresectable or metastatic melanoma  stage III IV  that fail anti PD1 therapy  Currently  there are over 10 200 of these patients in the United States that could potentially benefit from ImmunoPulse  IL 12 therapy in combination with anti PD 1  For example  there are an estimated 9 900 patients currently undergoing anti PD 1 therapy in the U S  Of these 9 900 people  around 6 400 have shown poor response rates to anti PD 1 therapy alone  demonstrating that a significant subset of individuals could receive a tremendous benefit from treatment via the ImmunoPulse  IL 12 platform  And  with over 80 000 new cases of melanoma diagnosed in the U S  per year  OncoSec s ImmunoPulse  device  utilizing combination therapies  could prove to be a revolutionary treatment for those who are unresponsive to current procedures  And  researchers within the company have expressed that their early proof of concept in melanoma patients indicates a potential for the ImmunoPulse  IL 12 platform to work on other ailments with similar characteristics  For instance  diseases such as triple negative breast cancer and head and neck cancers are known to have accessible tumors  and similar to melanoma  also carry a very high rate of non response to anti PD 1 therapy alone  The characteristics of both of these cancers point to a likely possibility of patients responding to the ImmunoPulse  IL 12 platform similarly to how it works in patients with melanoma  and OncoSec has established plans to investigate additional ways of broadening the device s reach  From the inhibition of a tumor s immunosuppressive environment to cell signaling and trafficking  OncoSec researchers are already aware of many potential applications of Interleukin 12 delivered through the ImmunoPulse  device  and company management acknowledges that the application s power may be an extremely profitable opportunity 
Investors will be pleased to know that the market and medical community interest in melanoma and immunotherapy treatments are significant and that a gap in the market is waiting to get filled by a responsive company  like ONCS  who is demonstrating the ability to provide a reliable  safe  and curable treatment to cancer patients  In the past  companies have spent vast sums of money on earlier programs that dealt with the same issues focused on by OncoSec  For example  Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  s 2011 acquisition of BioVex demonstrated the proof of interest and need for an effective melanoma treatment  BioVex was a company that had been researching and developing a treatment against melanoma called Imlygic  also known as T VEC  T VEC was an oncolytic viral therapy that aimed to promote a similar anti tumor response to OncoSec s ImmunoPulse   The company showed promise  and in 2011  was purchased by Amgen for  1 billion in hopes that the treatment would prove revolutionary  Unfortunately  as additional clinical data continued to become available  it was found that the treatment was not as effective as initially hoped  and as of 2016  there is little evidence that the treatment was able to extend the life of people with melanoma  Additionally  T VEC was known to cause a myriad of undesirable side effects  including fever  nausea  and other flu like symptoms in over 30  of those treated  Although the treatment proved unsuccessful  the BioVex deal was still one of the largest deals in the immunotherapy field at the time and signaled a voracious interest in bringing to market a more effective product  And  keeping this goal in mind  OncoSec may hold the potential to provide the treatment that T VEC was unable to deliver 
ONCS On The Fast Track
OncoSec  in some respects  is in a similar position to BioVex before their acquisition by Amgen   the company has robust clinical data to date  and as their Phase 2 data continues to unfold  the company is sure to spark the interest of respected players within the biotech industry  Not only has the initial testing of their ImmunoPulse  IL 12 platform brought positive results  but it is also doing so without causing many of the uncomfortable side effects caused by earlier and similar treatments  Additionally  the FDA s granting of Orphan Drug Status and Fast Track Approval to the company will allow them to more quickly develop and undergo research trials for their products  removing many of the restrictions that may be faced by competitors  Finally  as stated earlier  OncoSec has indicated that their ImmunoPulse  system is likely able to work on multiple tumor types  allowing the company to expand their label across different kinds of diseases  rather than simply melanoma 
As for what s currently in store for OncoSec  the company plans to initiate their enrollment for a phase 2 trial and collaboration with Merck  referred to as PISCES  by the end of 2017  The company also intends to hold an End of Phase 2  EOP2  meeting with the FDA during the 1H of 2018  which is anticipated to grant ONCS with an accelerated approval path for anti PD 1 non responders in melanoma  along with an approval of their plans for phase 3 trials  This phase 3 confirmatory study is expected to run throughout 2018 and carry on into late 2019  where the company has set milestone goals to obtain a marketing authorization to penetrate a market in need of a viable and responsive cancer treatment OncoSec may be considered by some to be a small company  but what can t get overlooked is that they have built an enviable foundation and scientific infrastructure  And  from a position of clinical strength  ONCS may be ideally placed to reap enormous benefit from the development of their promising immunotherapy treatment system  If ImmunoPulse  IL 12  with combination therapy  continues to deliver positive results  OncoSec may very well be the company the market has been waiting to embrace  providing game changing cancer treating technology that may alter the therapeutic landscape and fill a void to address unmet medical needs

the momentum in the second half While earnings per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter  it met the same in the second  Earnings rose 4 9  on a reported basis in the first half of 2017 and 2 7  at constant currency rates  CER  on a year over year basis First halfnet sales rose 8 7  on a reported basis and 5 5  at CER   In Jan 2017  Sanofi swapped its Merial Animal Health businesses with Boehringer Ingelheim s Consumer Healthcare  CHC  business  Reflecting this exchange and full consolidation of Sanofi s European vaccines operations  sales rose 2  at constant structure and CER  We remind investors that Sanofi terminated its Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture with Merck  Co   Inc    NYSE MRK   in Europe in December last year A strong performance by Genzyme s Specialty Care  Genzyme  and Vaccines units is making up for an accelerated decline in the diabetes franchise to support the top line In fact  at the second quarter conference call  Sanofi raised its previously issued profit outlookbacked by a better than expected performance in the first half and cost discipline despite a tough U S  payer environment hurting sales in theDiabetesunit Sanofi expects 2017 business earnings to be broadly flat at CER  This outlook compares favorably with the previous expectation of flat to down 3  at CER So what will work in Sanofi s favor in the second half Continued strong performance of the Genzyme unit  especially the multiple sclerosis drugs  Aubagio and Lemtrada and the rare disease drugs like Myozyme Lumizymeand Fabrazyme is a positive  The Vaccines unit is also expected to perform well  Sales  including emerging markets  rose 14 3  at CER in the Genzyme unit and 24 5  at CER in the Vaccines unit in the first half of 2017 Meanwhile  Sanofi  at the second quarter conference call  sounded quite optimistic about the sales prospects of its newly launched drug Dupixent for treating atopic dermatitis  The drug  which was launched in the U S in March 2017  generated sales of  26 million in the second quarter  backed by strong demand Management waspleased with the drug s uptake  We are optimistic on sales prospects of Dupixent  which could prove to be an important growth driver for the company  Other than Dupixent  other new drugs like Kevzara  launched in the U S  in June 2017 and Soliqua  a once daily titratable fixed ratio combination of Lantus and Lyxumia  launched in the U S  in January 2017 should also bring in higher sales in the back half of the year However  management expects U S  diabetes franchise sales to decline faster in the second half due to the impact of formulary exclusion at CVS Health Corporation   NYSE CVS   and UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH  and difficult comparisons from last year U S  diabetes sales declined 19 1  in the first half of 2017 Sanofi s Diabetes franchise is under significant pressure with key product  Lantus  facing increasing competitive pressure at the payor level and biosimilar competition in several European markets and Japan In the cardiovascular franchise  it also remains to be seen if sales trends of Sanofi s anti PCSK9 therapy  Praluent improve in the second half  Uptake of PCSK9 inhibitors like Praluent and Amgen  Inc  s   NASDAQ AMGN   Repatha have been slower than expected due to significant payer utilization management restrictions in the U S  and limited market access in Europe  Praluent s uptake could remain limited until guidelines supporting broader use of the treatment are issued and phase III cardiovascular outcome study data are out Also generic competition will continue to hurt sales of many key drugs in Sanofi s portfolio including its blockbuster drug  Plavix Despite these challenges  we believe that new drug approvals  a solid pipeline and aggressive savings will pave the way for growth in the second half What Do the Numbers Say So far this year  Sanofi s share price has risen 22   better than a 7 8  increase for the  The strong quarterly results and the back to back product approvals this year have led to an uptick in estimates as well  Sanofi s earnings estimates for 2017 went up 2 5  while that for 2018 moved up 1 5  in the past 30 days  Sanofi s earnings performance has also been pretty impressive  with the company reporting positive surprises consistently  The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 5 10  Sanofi carries

150598,372114,AMGN,Amgen  AMGN  Stock Falls Despite Q2 Earnings   Sales Beat,opinion,"Biotech major Amgen Inc    NASDAQ AMGN   reported second quarter 2017 earnings of  3 27 per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 09 by 5 8  and increased 15  from the year ago period  Better revenues and lower operating costs drove the bottom line  A lower tax rate and share count also pulled up profits 
Total revenue rose 2  to  5 81 billion in the quarter  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 67 billion by 2 5   An unfavorable impact of foreign exchange hurt sales by 1  in the quarter 
While U S  revenues rose 2  and ex U S  sales grew 8   excluding currency headwinds 
Quarter in Detail
Total product revenue rose 2  from the year ago quarter to  5 57 billion  U S    4 39 billion  ex U S    1 19 billion  as strong demand for newer products like Prolia  Xgeva  Kyprolisand Blincyto somewhat made up for lower sales of mature brands like Enbrel  Epogen  Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure 
Revenues of Amgen s erythropoiesis stimulating agent  ESA   Aranesp  rose 6  from the year ago quarter to  535 million due to higher unit demand in the U S 
Revenues of the other ESA  Epogen  declined 12  to  292 million due to lower selling price owing to a recently negotiated contract with DaVita Inc 
Neulasta revenues declined 5  to  1 09 billion from the year ago period due to lower unit demand following competition from PD 1s and other new cancer therapies  Neupogen recorded a 30  decline in sales to  137 million due to biosimilar competition in the U S  Zarxio  Sandoz s  Novartis AG s   NYSE NVS   generic arm  biosimilar version of Neupogen  was launched in the U S  in Sep 2015 and is hurting sales 
The company expects Neulasta and Neupogen sales to continue to be hurt by competitive dynamic through the rest of 2017  However  management did specify on the call  that  no new U S  biosimilar competition  is expected this year  This suggests that Neulasta and Epogenmay not start facing any biosimilar competition in the U S  this year  contrary to previous expectations 
However  the Neulasta Onpro kit  on body injector  continues to perform well commanding a market share of about 55  in the U S  for all Neulasta sales 
Enbrel delivered revenues of  1 47 billion  down 1  from the year ago quarter due to increased competition  which offset favorable changes in inventory and price 
However  in the quarter  market volume growth improved in the rheumatology dermatology segments compared with the first quarter with Enbrel experiencing relatively stable unit share in these markets 
Prolia revenues came in at  505 million  up 15  from the year ago quarter due to higher demand  The osteoporosis drug witnessed market share gains in both the U S  and our international markets 
Meanwhile  Xgeva delivered revenues of  395 million  up 4  from the year ago quarter mainly due to higher demand 
Sensipar Mimpara revenues increased 10  to  427 million due to higher price increases 
Vectibix revenues came in at  168 million  up 5   driven by higher demand 
Kyprolis recorded sales of  211 million  up 23  year over year driven by higher demand 
In the quarter  Amgen submitted regulatory applications in the U S  and EU to include overall survival data from the ENDEAVOR study on the label of Kyprolis  The study demonstrated that a combination of Kyprolis plus dexamethasone led to superior overall survival when compared to Velcade plus dexamethasone
This overall survival data  if approved  can help drive usage and boost sales of Kyprolis 
Amgen also announced final data from the phase III ASPIRE study of Kyprolis this month  which showed that a triple combination regimen of Kyprolis plus Celgene Corporation s   NASDAQ CELG   Revlimid  lenalidomide  and dexamethasone  KRd   significantly improved overall survival  OS  in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma compared to Revlimidand dexamethasone Rd  
Blincyto sales surged 43  from the year ago period to  43 million  reflecting higher demand  Earlier this month  the FDA approved the inclusion of overall survival data from the TOWER study on the label of Blincyto  The addition of the data should help boost sales 
Amgen s PCSK9 inhibitor  Repatha generated revenues of  83 million  higher than  49 million in the first quarter driven by higher demand 
Uptake of the drug  which gained FDA approval in Aug 2015  has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re imbursement issues payer restrictions  Sanofi   NYSE SNY   and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals also faced similar issues with their PCSK9 inhibitor  Praluent 
We remind investors that a phase III cardiovascular outcomes study  FOURIER  on Repatha had revealed significant reduction in myocardial infarctions and strokes in the first quarter  The data is key to commercial success of Repatha as it would broaden the use of the drug  Though data from the study looks good  it is not very clear if payers will be willing to improve access to Repatha based on this data  Amgen filed regulatory applications in both the U S  and EU to include FOURIER data on Repatha s label in Jun 2017 
Operating Margins Increase
Adjusted operating margins rose 380 basis points  bps  to 55 2  due to lower operating costs  reflecting continued benefits from transformation and process improvement efforts 
R D expenses declined 3  in the quarter due to lower late stage pipeline related costs  SG A spend declined 7  due to the Oct 2016 expiration of Enbrel residual royalty payments  which offset investments to support new product launches 
Amgen bought back shares worth  1 billion in the quarter  At the end of the second quarter  Amgen had  2 5 billion remaining under its  5 billion stock repurchase plan 
2017 Guidance
While Amgen slightly cut the lower end of the previously issued sales outlook  it raised the earnings guidance to account for strong first half profits 
The company expects total revenue in the range of  22 5 billion to  23 0 billion versus  22 3 billion to  23 1 billion expected previously  Adjusted earnings are now expected in the range of  12 15 to  12 65 in 2017 compared with  12 00 to  12 60 per share  expected previously  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues in 2017 is pegged at  12 40 per share and  22 62 billion  respectively 
Operating expenses are expected to be higher in the second half 
Our Take
It was a rather strong quarter for Amgen as it beat expectations for both earnings and sales and raised its earnings guidance  Shares  however  lost 2 4  in after market trading probably due to concerns related to the tightened revenue guidance  However  so far this year  Amgen s shares are up 23 7   better than the 12 7  increase registered by the  
Though Amgen s newer products   Prolia  Xgeva  Vectibix  Nplate and Sensipar   are all performing well  their volume growth may not be enough to offset the decline in mature brands like Enbrel due to competitive pressure  However  Amgen s restructuring plan should make it leaner and more cost efficient  Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline  including biosimilar drugs  given quite a few regulatory and data updates scheduled for the second half 
Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see Amgen Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

150599,372115,AMGN,Radius  RDUS  Q2 Loss Wider Than Expected On Higher Expenses,opinion,"Radius Health  Inc    NASDAQ RDUS   posted a loss of  1 58 per share in the second quarter of 2017  wider than the loss of  1 01 per share in the year ago quarter and wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of  1 35  The year over year increase in net loss was attributable to an increase in general and administrative expenses 

Radius  share price increased 13 3  year to date against the  gain of 1  
The company reported sales of Tymlos  abaloparatide  of  1 0 million from the first four weeks of launch  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 96 million 
Quarter in Detail
Research and development expenses for the reported quarter were  19 6 million  down 27  year over year due to a decrease in regulatory and professional fees associated with abaloparatide SC regulatory applications  decrase in elacestrant  RAD1901  project costs and a decrease in development costs associated with abaloparatide TD 
General and administrative expenses for the reported quarter jumped to  50 1 million from  17 2 million  The increase was attributed to growth in professional support costs  including the costs associated with increasing headcount for the commercialization of Tymlos  Higher compensation expenses  including stock based compensation  due to an increase in headcount were also responsible for increased costs Radius Health  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Pipeline Updates
On Apr 28  the FDA approved Radius Health s lead candidate Tymlos injection for the treatment of postmenopausal women with high risk osteoporosis for fracture   defined as history of osteoporotic fracture   multiple risk factors for fracture  or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy 
The company is developing two formulations of abaloparatide  abaloparatide SC and abaloparatide transdermal 
Meanwhile  Radius Health  Marketing Authorisation Application  MAA  for Eladynos  abaloparatide SC  for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in Europe is under review by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  of the European Medicines Agency  The company however suffered a setback when the CHMP issued a second Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues  Consequently  Radius is working with the CHMP to address these issues and the company expects a response prior to the end of 2017 
In May  Radius Health announced positive top line results from the completed 24 month ACTIVExtend clinical trial on Tymlos  which met all of its primary and secondary endpoints  The company expects to submit a sNDA to the FDA in connection with the ACTIVExtend results by year end 
The company reported positive data from its ongoing phase I dose escalation and expansion study on elacestrant in advanced metastatic breast cancer  The company discussed these data from the ongoing phase I studies with the FDA to determine the next steps for elacestrant breast cancer program  including the design of a phase II trial 
Following this discussion  the FDA agreed that a single arm monotherapy phase II study of under 200 patients is appropriate  The agency also provided additional feedback on the proposed clinical protocol  including confirmation that the primary endpoint will be objective response rate  along with durability of response  The FDA also stated that if the study results demonstrate superiority to the then available therapies  the single arm phase II trial could be considered a pivotal study for accelerated approval as long as the company has also commenced a confirmatory study by the time of its new drug application  NDA  submission 
In addition  elacestrant is also being evaluated at low doses as an estrogen receptor ligand for the potential relief of the frequency and severity of moderate to severe hot flashes in postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms  The company expects to report results from its phase IIb clinical study of elacestrant for the potential treatment of postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms in the second half of 2017 
Our Take
The company s wider than expected loss in the second quarter was disappointing as expenses continue to increase with the launch of Tymlos  The company is moving ahead with its plans in contracting with managed care organizations with access to over 133 million covered lives across Commercial and Medicare Part D plans 
Although the osteoporosis market in the U S  has great potential as approximately 1 4 million postmenopausal women in the U S  experience an osteoporotic fracture each year  Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly  Co s   NYSE LLY   Forteo and Amgen Inc s   NASDAQ AMGN   Prolia  Moreover  the approved label carries a boxed warning of osteosarcoma  a malignant bone tumor   The company  however  suffered a setback when the CHMP issued a second Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues

150670,372186,AMGN,What Lies Ahead For Pharma ETFs In Second Half 2017,opinion,"We are halfway through 2017 and pharma stocks have recovered nicely with their performance representing a sharp contrast to 2016 when the sector was under immense pressure due to the drug pricing issue  Another factor that weighed on pharma stocks last year was the noticeably lower number of FDA approvals  2016 saw only 22 treatments gaining FDA approval  well below 45 approvals in 2015 and 41 in 2014  The industry was also hit by some high profile R D failures as well as mixed results  slower than expected new product launches and increasing competition 
 
However  the sector has fared better this yearand the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index is up 10 1  year to date  YTD   New product sales ramp up  R D success and innovation  strong results  a higher number of FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products are some of the factors that could contribute to a sustained recovery in the sector  Tax reforms and cash repatriation would support a recovery as well   Read   
 
Importantly  investors now seem to be more comfortable with the drug pricing scenario and are willing to look at the fundamentals of the sector  Although the drug pricing issue will remain a headwind this year as well  expectations are that steps taken by the Trump administration to drive down drug prices will not be as draconian as previously expected  
 
Deregulation and increased competition seem to be some of the ways that will be used to control drug prices  FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb recently said that the agency is working on a plan to lower healthcare costs by speeding up the development of next generation treatments  especially for rare diseases or targeted cancer therapies 
 
Faster Drug Approval Process 
 
At a meeting with pharma majors earlier this year  President Trump spoke about speeding up the FDA approval process  The President said that the FDA will be streamlined and the drug approval process will be much faster  The 21st Century Cures Act is a step in this direction 
 
With the passing of this Act  expectations are that there will be more innovation in the sector and  maybe  a surge in new drug approvals  According to an IMSQuintiles report  the late phase R D pipeline for the industry indicates that there should be about 40 45 new brand launches every year through 2021 
 
Meanwhile  the FDA has already surpassed last year s total tally with 23 drugs being approved so far in 2017    Read   
 
Will M As Pick Pace 
 
There has been a lot of consolidation in the pharma industry over the last few years with quite a few deals being announced completed in 2016  Expectations are high that M As will increase as the year progresses    potential tax reform and cash repatriation are expected to lead to a boost in this area  While not too many deals have been announced so far in 2017  we could see several M A agreements being announced in the coming quarters though companies are wary of bidding wars leading to over priced deals 
 
Companies with innovative technologies and pipelines are highly sought after  Niche disease areas like nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH   immuno oncology and multiple sclerosis are in demand  Treatments for orphan diseases are also much sought after with quite a few deals being signed in these areas   Read   
 
Innovative Pipelines   Catalyst Rich 2017 
 
Pharma companies continue to work on bringing innovative new treatments to market  and there could be significant catalysts in the coming quarters in the form of important new product approvals as well as major data read outs especially in key therapeutic areas like immuno oncology  Alzheimer s  central nervous system disorders  and immunology inflammation 
 
Cancer remains a key focus area  According to IMSQuintiles  68 new cancer drugs were approved for 22 indications from 2011 to 2016 while worldwide costs for cancer therapeutics and supportive care drugs shot up from  91 billion in 2012 to  113 billion in 2016  More than 600 molecules are in late stage development with the majority being targeted therapy 
 
Meanwhile  sales of products that gained approval over the last two years as well as line extensions should ramp up and boost growth

150705,372221,AMGN,Gold Bounces At Long Term Support  The Nikkei Probes Higher,opinion,"VIX continues to challenge both Short term and Intermediate term resistance before closing beneath them  A rally above Long term resistance at 12 60 implies that VIX may challenge its Ending Diagonal trendline at 17 50 in the following move 
Despite calls from investment banks that market tumult is on the horizon  Wall Street traders seemed to be taking it easy this Friday  A measure of expected volatility hit a two week low  while major stock market indices meandered modestly higher 
The Vix index  which tracks expected S P 500 volatility over the next month  slipped as much as 0 5 point to 9 98 per cent  the lowest level in two weeks  and well below the long term average of about 20 
SPX caught between support and resistance 

SPX appears to be caught between the upper trendline of its larger Ending Diagonal and the lower trendline of the smaller Ending diagonal  A break of the lower Diagonal trendline and Short term support at 2406 29 may be the star of a decline that completely retraces the rally from the February 2016 low

NDX retraces two thirds of its loss 

NDX retraced 67  of its loss from the June 9 decline The next move to look for is a challenge of the trendline and supports beneath it  A decline beneath the rally trendline and Cycle Top support at 5614 79 may suggest a deeper correction is in order 
 BusinessInsider  Technology stocks suffered from a little anxiety attack in the markets last week 
It didn t last long and really wasn t all that serious   Yet   It was nothing worse than what everyone called  normal volatility  10 years ago 
But the lack of concern it generated this time    
High Yield Bond Index puts in a secondary high 

The High Yield Bond Index rallied until Tuesday  then tested Intermediate term support at 166 29 before a small bounce into the weekly close  The sell signal may be reinstated beneath that support level  The Cycles Model suggests weakness may continue 
High yield corporate bonds have been a remarkably resilient asset class throughout the post crisis period  This included emerging from the rising default wave that spread across the asset class in 2015 and 2016  And  while high yield bonds continue to hover near all time highs  a renewed threat that first emerged for the category back in the spring is continuing to pick up steam  It remains to be seen how much longer high yield bonds can resist the pressure 
USB continues higher 

The Long Bond continues to rally aboveLong term support at 154 60  signaling more strength ahead  The operative formation is the Head   Shoulders which may require the completion of the right shoulder near 165 00 before plunging through the neckline 
Lots of hand wringing these days about the flattening yield curve   We still maintain our position that the signal from the bond market is significantly distorted due to the global central bank intervention  QE  into the bond markets  See  
Most of what is happening with the U S  yield curve is technical  Sure  traders can get a wild hair up their arse  believing the economy is slowing and try and game duration by punting in the cash or futures markets  Given the small relative float of the U S  Treasury bond market  however  it doesn t take much buying to move yields  In the words of economists  the supply curve of outstanding Treasuries is very inelastic 
The euro testing support 

The euro attempted a test of Short term support at 110 81  making a probable Master Cycle low  The follow up appears to be a potential probe to the weekly Cycle Top resistance at 115 32 over the next three weeks 
You may think the reflation trade is dead  Actually  it s simply traveled across the Atlantic 
Instead of betting on the dollar and better economic growth in the U S   currency investors are coming to terms with the possibility that the dollar s best days are behind it after three years of record breaking strength  More and more  traders are starting to count on the euro to take the dollar s place as the overarching trade of the  5 1 trillion market 
Euro Stoxx bounces at Intermediate term support 

The Euro Stoxx 50 Index probed Intermediate term support at 3522 64 before a bounce  There may be a brief period of strength lasting up to a week before Euro Stoxx plunges through that support 
European stocks closed lower on Friday as investors monitored oil prices and business activity in Germany dipped to a four year low 
The pan European Stoxx 600 slipped 0 23 percent with most sectors and major bourses in negative territory  For the week  bourses were little changed

The yen tests Intermediate term support 

The yen challenged Intermediate term support at 89 64 closing above it  This week s pullback appears to be an important test of support prior to launching higher  It is probable that the rally may resume in the next week  A breakout above Long term resistance at 90 70 may alter the pace of the rally 
The Nikkei probes higher 

The Nikkei may have made the final probe of its rally from mid Cycle support  although another week of strength cannot be ruled out  The Cycles Model suggests areversal may be developing  but a sell signal may not be generated until the NIKK declines beneath Short term support at 19785 60 Further confirmation of the decline lies at Intermediate term support at 19444 10 
US dollar uppressed at mid Cycle resistance 

USD continues to be suppressed at mid cycle resistance at 97 47 for the past five weeks  The Cycles Model does allow for a potential false breakout to challenge Short term resistance at 97 85 in the next week or so before a plunge lower 
Speculators boosted net long positions on the U S  dollar  after slashing them the previous week to their lowest level since last August  according to calculations by Reuters and data from Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday 
The value of the dollar s net long position rose to  7 82 billion in the week ended June 20  from  6 48 billion the previous week  The previous week s net long dollar position was the lowest since the third week of August last year 
Last week s interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve along with its hawkish statement have spurred speculators buy back dollars again 
Gold bounces at Long term support 

Gold declined to Long term support at 1241 38 before bouncing to Short term resistance at 1256 57  The Cycles Model suggests that the expected Master Cycle low may not have occurred yet  This next week may see a decline beneath Long term support to challenge mid Cycle support at 1212 25 with a minimum target of 1220 00 1224 00 
Crude slips beneath the Head   Shoulders neckline 

Crude slipped beneath the Head   Shoulders neckline at 44 00 this week and may be ready for the next leg of its decline  There are now three formations indicating the probable target for the coming decline this Summer 
Crude oil has officially entered a bear market  and Commodities king Dennis Gartman told CNBC the pain is far from over 
In a recent interview  the editor and founder of The Gartman Letter said oil conglomerate OPEC was losing the war on oil  especially in light of the ascension of Saudi Arabia s new crown prince  Mohammed bin Salman  Crude oil is down nearly 20 percent in 2017  and is tracking for its biggest six month drop since the late 1990s 
Gartman said 

He understands that crude oil  over the course of the next 20 to 40 years  is going to be a worthless commodity  It will be supplanted by something else 

Shanghai Index challenges Intermediate term resistance 

The Shanghai Index attempted a challenge of Intermediate term resistance at 3175 48  but closed beneath it  The Shanghai Index appears to have completed a rather flat correction  The potential for a sharp sell off is rising 
For the 10th day in a row  China s bond yield curve remains inverted  the longest in history  
With yields at 3 year highs  corporate bond issuance is evaporating  and has now emerged as the latest major  and most imminent  threat facing China s financial sector and  10 trillion corporate debt market 
However  it appears Chinese authorities have reached their max pain point 
In a very symbolic move overnight  China s Ministry of Finance bought 1 26 billion yuan of 1 year bonds for the first time in history via the secondary market 
The Banking Index completes its correction 

BKX appears to have made its final rally high on Monday before declining beneath Intermediate term support at 92 11  The sell signal has been activated again  The expected weakness may develop as BKX declines beneath its Short term support at 91 43

ECB shuts down Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza 
When banks fail and regulators decide to liquidate them  it happens on Friday evening so that there is a weekend to clean up the mess  And this is what happened in Italy   with two banks 
It s over for the two banks that have been prominent zombies in the Italian banking crisis  Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza  in northeastern Italy 
The banks have combined assets of  60 billion  a good part of which are toxic and no one wanted to touch them  They already received a bailout but more would have been required  and given the uncertainty and the messiness of their books  nothing was forthcoming  and the ECB which regulates them lost its patience 
Australian bankers are furious after the country s smallest state levied a  surprise  tax on the country s five biggest banks that could siphon off  280 million in profits during its first four years on the books  according to Reuters  The tax was imposed by South Australia  which is struggling with the country s highest unemployment rate and thanks the banks should be doing more to pitch in 
Major central banks should press ahead with interest rate increases  the Bank for International Settlements said on Sunday  while recognizing that some turbulence in financial markets will have to be negotiated along the way 
The BIS  an umbrella body for leading central banks  said in one of its most upbeat annual reports for years that global growth could soon be back at long term average levels after a sharp improvement in sentiment over the past year 
Though pockets of risk remain because of high debt levels  low productivity growth and dwindling policy firepower  the BIS said policymakers should take advantage of the improving economic outlook and its surprisingly negligible effect on inflation to accelerate the  great unwinding  of quantitative easing programs and record low interest rates ",2017-06-26,Anthony M.

150737,372253,AMGN,Is Amgen  AMGN  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Amgen Inc    NASDAQ AMGN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Amgen has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 79  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 37  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Amgen s current PE ratio below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having trended roughly downwards over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Medical   Biomedical and Genetic sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 32 26  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Amgen has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 35  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Amgen stock in the near term too PEG RatioWhile earnings are certainly important  it is essential to know how much you are paying for the growth of earnings as well  One can easily do that with the PEG ratio  ratio of the P E to the expected future earnings growth rate  The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture of the valuation of a stock than the P E ratio Amgen s PEG ratio stands at just 2 18  compared with the Zacks Medical   Biomedical and Genetics average of 2 75  This suggests a decent undervalued trading relative to its earnings growth potential right now Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Amgen currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Amgen a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Amgen might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives AMGN a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  C    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower  while the full year estimate has seen eight up and five down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched down by almost 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched upper by 0 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Amgen Inc  Price and Consensus
     This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAmgen is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 36  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech TrendZacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy   Last year  it was generating  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the world s first trillionaires    but that should still leave plenty of money for those who make the right trades early ",2017-06-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-amgen-(amgn)-a-great-stock-for-value-investors-200195644,200195644

150739,372255,AMGN,Small Cancer Biotech Space In Focus  3 Stocks Up 100    More,opinion,"The oncology space has always been keenly watched by investors interested in the pharma biotech sector  Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the U S  preceded only by heart disease  According to a report by the American Cancer Society  almost 1 7 million cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in 2017  which creates significant need for effective cancer medication  While there are various types of cancer treatments including surgery  radiation  targeted therapy and chemotherapy  immuno oncology or immunotherapy is presently a hot therapeutic area with huge commercial potential   Immuno oncology or immunotherapy is a new class of cancer therapies that utilize certain parts of the immune system to fight the disease  This can be done by stimulating the immune system to attack cancer cells or by introducing immune system components into the body   Immuno oncology drugs and their combinations are in great demandWith big pharma and biotech companies like Merck   Co  Inc    NYSE MRK    Pfizer  Inc    NYSE PFE    Amgen  Inc    NASDAQ AMGN   and others in trouble due to generic competition for their key drugs  drug pricing issues and rising competition  focus is gradually shifting to smaller innovative biotechs  mainly the ones making cancer drugs  These companies are in the limelight on account of important advances in clinical studies of their experimental cancer drugs and are fast approaching the path to FDA EU approval  These stocks are also hot targets for acquisitions 
Let s discuss three of these smaller companies making cancer drugs whose shares are up 100  and more so far this year  All the three companies have a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see Kite Pharma  Inc    NASDAQ KITE  Santa Monica  CA based Kite Pharma  focused on the development of immuno oncology treatments  has a market cap of  5 05 billion  Shares of the company are up 103 4  so far this year Kite Pharma s lead drug axicabtagene ciloleucel  previously KTE C19  is an anti CD19 CAR based therapy currently under priority review in the U S  for treating aggressive non Hodgkin lymphoma  NHL  with a FDA decision expected on Nov 29  The Biologics License Application  BLA  filing was based on data from the ZUMA 1 study  In Europe  a regulatory application is expected to be filed in the third quarter of this year  We believe that the solid efficacy profile demonstrated by the pivotal ZUMA 1 study should support the drug s approval this year Meanwhile other studies with axicabtagene ciloleucel and additional candidates including KITE 585 and KITE 718 are also advancing  A number of key data readouts are expected in 2017  which should keep investors glued to the stock Clovis Oncology  Inc    NASDAQ CLVS  Boulder  CO based Clovis Oncology develops treatments targeting specific subsets of cancer population  The company has a market cap of  3 93 billion  Shares of the company are up 99 6  so far this year Clovis got a huge boost with the FDA granting accelerated approval to its advanced ovarian cancer treatment  Rubraca last December  Rubraca has bright prospects  given the tremendous demand for PARP inhibitors  Successful commercialization will significantly boost Clovis  sales  Rubraca is also under review in the EU for a comparable ovarian cancer indication Importantly  the stock shot up this week after it announced promising progression free survival and safety results from the pivotal maintenance study  ARIEL3  earlier this week  The study data showed that Rubraca has a meaningful impact in delaying disease recurrence in advanced ovarian cancer patients  Overall  the study results suggest that advanced ovarian cancer patients can stay on Rubraca treatment for a longer time while gaining benefit  irrespective of their tumor genetics  The positive results may expand Rubraca s label  which could improve the commercial uptake of the drug Several studies on Rubraca  targeting different types of ovarian cancer patients  are currently underway  Also  Clovis is also looking to expand Rubraca s label into additional indications like prostrate  breast and pancreatic cancers  among others  either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents Puma Biotechnology  Inc    NASDAQ PBYI  This Los Angeles  CA based cancer focused company has a market cap of  2 97 billion  Shares of the company are up 155 9  so far this year Puma got a huge boost last month after an FDA advisory committee recommended the approval of its lead pipeline candidate  neratinib for the extended adjuvant treatment of HER2 positive early stage breast cancer as a single agent  The recommendation was mainly based on a favourable benefit demonstrated by neratinib in reducing the risk of disease recurrence in a phase III two year ExteNET study The positive vote significantly raised the chances of neratinib gaining FDA approval  While it is not mandatory for the FDA to go by the suggestions of its advisory panels  it usually does so  With Puma being a development stage company  neratinib s approval would be a major milestone for the stock Neratinib is also under review in the EU for the same indication  Meanwhile  several additional studies on neratinib targeting different types of breast cancer patient populations are currently underwayA couple of other cancer focused companies like Bluebird Bio  Inc    NASDAQ BLUE   and Incyte Corporation   NASDAQ INCY   also deserve a mention Earlier this month at ASCO  Bluebird Bio presented promising results from an early stage refractory multiple myeloma study on its investigational anti BCMA CAR T cell therapy  bb2121  which it is developing in collaboration with Celgene Corporation   NASDAQ CELG    Data from the study showed that 100  of the 15 evaluable patients in active dose cohorts achieved an objective response  Overall response rate  ORR  across all cohorts  n 18  is 89   The investment community believes that the data  though early stage  bodes well for the candidate s future development  While shares of the company are up 83 2  this year so far  the stock has gained more than 150  since Jun 5  when the data were presented Coming to Incyte  a promising immune therapy in its pipeline is epacadostat   a novel  potent and selective inhibitor of the enzyme IDO1  The candidate is being studied in combination with other immuno oncology agents  Incyte has collaboration agreements with Merck  Bristol Myers  AstraZeneca MedImmune and Roche Genentech to evaluate epacadostat with their respective anti PD 1 and anti PD L1 agents  At ASCO  Incyte also presented encouraging data from several combination studies  Shares of the company are up 24 2  this year ConclusionMounting competition in the cancer market  mainly in immuno oncology  is a significant concern  Several bigwigs are looking to develop and bring cancer treatments to market  Merck is conducting numerous studies to evaluate its anti PD 1 therapy  Keytruda for more than 30 types of cancer in 500 trials  Almost half of these trials are in combination with other cancer drugs  Recently approved cancer drugs like AstraZeneca s Imfinzi  durvalumab  and Pfizer s Bavencio avelumab are being evaluated for multiple cancers  either alone or in combination with other regimens  and have bright long term prospects  Meanwhile  many cancer drugs  already approved for quite a few indications like J J and AbbVie s Imbruvica  Pfizer s Ibrance  Bristol Myers  Opdivo  Celgene s Revlimid are being evaluated in several studies for label expansion  Several of these pharma biotech giants have significant financial resources at their disposal and have even collaborated with each other to pool their resources and technology  This makes it all the more difficult for smaller biotechs to match up to them However  these smaller companies can give their bigger counterparts a tough run as there is ample scope for growth in the immuno oncology space  be it in terms of revenues or patient outcomes  Any breakthroughs achieved by them will take the stocks to new highs

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which showed equities mixed heading into the June Options Expiration Week  with the iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and SPY  NYSE SPY  looking strong but the PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  weak as there was rotation out of the QQQ and into IWM 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue lower while Crude Oil also looks better to the downside  The US Dollar Index continues to be biased lower while US Treasuries pullback in the uptrend  The Shanghai Composite is back to its upward drift and Emerging Markets are biased to continue higher 
Volatility looks to remain at very low levels keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   IWM and QQQ  Their charts show strength in the IWM and consolidation in the SPY short term with the QQQ looking diseased  Longer term all trends remain higher with real strength returning to the IWM  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

Cosentyx  fully human monoclonal antibody  is already approved in the U S  and EU for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis  The drug is also approved in the EU for the treatment of adults with ankylosing spondylitis  AS  who have responded inadequately to conventional therapy  such as non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  The drug is also instrumental for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis  PsA  in adults when the response to disease modifying anti rheumatic drug therapy is unsatisfactory 
In Jan 2016  Cosentyx obtained the FDA approval for the treatment of adults with active ankylosing spondylitis and for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis 
The data shows sustained improvement in the signs and symptoms for active AS at three years  The new data also revealed that Cosentyx provides rapid and sustained pain relief in patients with PsA out to 2 years 
Data from the phase III study  MEASURE 1 extension study  showed 80  of AS patients consistently achieved an ASAS 20 response at 3 years  in tandem with previous findings from the FUTURE 1 study on Cosentyx for active PsA  Additionally  a 2 year post hoc analysis of the FUTURE 2 study evaluated Cosentyx in PsA  where 99  patients reported moderate to extreme pain or discomfort before initiating treatment  At week 3  half of the treated with Cosentyx reported clinically meaningful improvements in pain of over 20   as measured by Visual Analogue Scale 
Meanwhile  patient recruitment is underway for the new head to head clinical trial  EXCEED  to evaluate the superiority of Cosentyx versus AbbVie s   NYSE ABBV   Humira in PsA 
Novartis  has outperformed the Zacks classified industry over the last six months  The stock has rallied 12 2  compared with the  industry s gain of 4 5  
The uptake of Cosentyx has been strong and the company has grabbed market shares from rivals  Humira and Amgen s   NASDAQ AMGN   Enbrel  Cosentyx achieved blockbuster status in 2016 recording over  1 billion of sales 
Novartis expects the next growth phase to begin in 2018 driven by Cosentyx  in all three indications psoriasis  psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis  Entresto  and Kisqali and a deep pipeline with candidates like CTL019  BAF312  AMG 334  RTH258  Going forward  we expect that the approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing ones will bode well for Novartis

150870,372386,AMGN,Mylan  MYL  Beats On Q1 Earnings  Revenues Miss Estimates,opinion,"Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL   reported first quarter 2017 results wherein earnings of 93 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and was up from 76 cents reported in the year ago quarter 

We note that shares of Mylan have outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the year so far with the stock dipping 2 2  compared with the industry s decline of 3 4  
First quarter revenues of  2 72 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 83 billion  Nevertheless  the top line recorded 24  year over year growth on the back of acquisitions 
Quarter in Detail
The company report results in three segments on a geographic basis   North America  Europe and Rest of the World 
North America segment third party net sales came in at  1 21 billion  up 5  due to contribution from the acquisitions of Meda AB and the non sterile  topicals focused business of Renaissance Acquisition Holdings  LLC which more than offset the decline in sales of new products and  negative impact of lower pricing and reduced volumes of existing products due to increased competition  Sales of the EpiPen Auto Injector declined in the current quarter as a result of increased competition and the impact of the authorized generic launch 
Third party net sales from Europe were  892 million  up 53   propelled by the acquisition of Meda which was partially offset by a net decrease in net sales from new products and lower volume and pricing on existing products   Unfavorable foreign currency translation had an impact of 4  within Europe 
Rest of World segment third party net sales of  580 5 million was up 34  fueled by the Meda acquisition  Moreover  net sales from existing products increased due to higher sales from the anti retroviral franchise while sales from new products and higher volumes on existing products more than offset lower pricing  Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of 3  in the Rest of the World segment 
Adjusted gross margin declined to 53  from 54  in the year ago quarter due to lower gross profit from the sales of existing products in North America  including the EpiPen Auto Injector  partially offset by the contributions from the acquired businesses 
2017 Outlook Reiterated
Mylan expects revenues between  12 25 and  13 75 billion in 2017  The company projects earnings in the range of  5 15  5 55 per share for 2017 
Our Take
Mylan s first quarter results beat on earnings but missed the top line due to decline in EpiPen sales as a result of increased competition and entry of generics  Pricing continues to impact results and the company projects mid single digit price erosion globally for the year  The company recent suffered a few setbacks 
Mylan received a complete response letter from the FDA regarding its abbreviated new drug application  ANDA  for the generic version of GlaxoSmithKline s   NYSE GSK   asthma drug Advair Diskus  In Apr 2017  Mylan received a warning letter from the FDA for its manufacturing facility in India 
The FDA cited significant violations of current good manufacturing practice  CGMP  regulations for finished pharmaceuticals in the warning letter  The violations relate to the agency s inspection in Sep 2016 and even though the company had responded to the same  the agency deemed them inadequate  The FDA warned that until Mylan redresses the violations completely and confirms its compliance with CGMP  the approval of new applications and the listing of the company as a drug manufacturer may be withheld 
The FDA has earlier accepted biologics license application for a biosimilar version of Amgen s   NASDAQ AMGN   Neulasta  pegfilgrastim  and a biosimilar version of Roche s   OTC RHHBY   Herceptin Mylan N V  Price and Consensus

Lilly s shares have outperformed the Zacks classified  industry so far this year  Shares of the company rallied 9 0   while the industry registered gain of 8 6  

Coming back to galcanezumab  it is being evaluated for the prevention of episodic migraine in EVOLVE 1 and EVOLVE 2 as well as chronic migraines in REGAIN phase III studies in two subcutaneously injection dosages of 120 mg and 240 mg  On one hand  the EVOLVE 1 study showed an average reduction of 4 7 days for 120 mg dosage and 4 6 days for 240 mg dosage in comparison with a reduction of 2 8 days for placebo for both the doses 
On the other hand  the EVOLVE 2 study showed an average reduction of 4 3 days for 120 mg dosage and 4 2 days for 240 mg dosage in comparison with a reduction of 2 3 days for placebo  Notably  both the studies evaluated the drug over a six month period 
The REGAIN study treated patients over a three month period with galcanezumab and showed an average reduction of 4 8 days for 120 mg dosage and 4 6 days for 240 mg dosage in comparison with a reduction of 2 7 days for placebo 
All these three studies reported that the most common side effects of galcanezumab were pain and other reactions at the injection site  Detailed data from these studies are likely to be presented in scientific meetings and published in peer reviewed journals  later this year 
Based on the positive data from the studies  Lilly plans to submit a Biologics License Application  BLA  to the FDA in the second half of 2017 and to other regulatory agencies internationally  later 
Additionally  the company is planning to evaluate the candidate for the treatment of cluster headache based on the results from the phase III study expected next year  Lilly s migraine pipeline also includes lasmiditan for oral treatment of acute migraine in a phase III study  We note that Lilly added lasmiditan in its pipeline with the acquisition of Cambridge  MA based biotech firm  CoLucid Pharmaceuticals in March 
In fact  Lilly s galcanezumab uses calcitonin gene related peptide  CGRP  antibody for the prevention of migraine  Moreover  Amgen Inc  s   NASDAQ AMGN   erenumab  Alder Biopharmaceuticals Inc s   NASDAQ ALDR   eptinezumab and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited s   NYSE TEVA   TEV 48125 are being evaluated for treatment of the same diseases using anti CGRP Eli Lilly and Company Price and Consensus

150872,372388,AMGN,Celgene s  CELG  Revlimid Looks Solid On Label Expansion,opinion,"We issued an updated research report on Celgene Corporation   NASDAQ CELG   on May 15  2017 
Celgene is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of drugs targeting cancer and inflammatory diseases through next generation solutions in protein homeostasis  immuno oncology  epigenetic  immunology and neuro inflammation 
Celgene s key growth engine is Revlimid  Revlimid  an oral immunomodulatory drug  is currently approved for several indications including MM  myelodysplastic syndromes  MDS  and mantle cell lymphoma  MCL   The drug performed well in the first quarter and combated the deterrents of uneven buying patterns and coverage gap challenges  Continued momentum in the core indication  label expansion and global launches are likely to help the product to boost the top line 
Market share gains in key markets and longer treatment duration are contributing to the drug s growth  Meanwhile  Celgene is working on expanding Revlimid s label further  Revlimid received FDA approval for use as a maintenance treatment in NDMM patients after they receive an autologous stem cell transplant  The drug was also approved in the EU for the same  NDMM market share continues to grow outside of the U S   with a positive uptake both in the EU and in Japan 

Celgene s share price movement shows that the stock outperformed the Zacks classified  industry in the past year  Specifically  the stock gained 18 7   during this period  compared with a decline of 4 4  for the industry 
Celgene is also currently working on label expansion of drugs like Pomalyst Imnovid  Abraxane and Otezla among others  which is encouraging  Pomalyst Imnovid is being evaluated in multiple combination studies in relapsed refractory MM 
Meanwhile  Celgene has a robust pipeline  Interesting candidates include GED 0301  phase III   Crohn s disease  phase II   UC   CC 486  phase III   high risk MDS  phase II   NSCLC   enasidenib  phase III   relapsed refractory AML   regulatory application filed in the U S   and luspatercept  phase III   lower risk MDS and beta thalassemia  
Successful development and subsequent approval of these candidates will be a huge boost for the company  The NDA for Idhifa was granted Priority Review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act  PDUFA  action date of Aug 30 
While Revlimid sales continue to be impressive  we are concerned about the company s dependence on the product for growth  Lower than expected sales of the drug could adversely impact the company s growth prospects  On the other hand  Otezla sales in the first quarter were impacted by managed care dynamics that drove lower total marketplace prescriptions for psoriasis therapies in the first quarter 
Higher gross to net adjustment related to new contracts with several large payers that were implemented in January and a modest decline in inventory levels also impacted sales  Moreover  the hematology  oncology  inflammation and immunology markets are dominated by several major players like AbbVie   NYSE ABBV   and Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN    among others 
Zacks Rank   Key Pick
Celgene currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
A better ranked stock in the healthcare sector is VIVUS  Inc    NASDAQ VVUS   which currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see

150873,372389,AMGN,Merck s  MRK  Keytruda Gets FDA Nod For Two New Indications,opinion,"Merck   Co   Inc     NYSE MRK    announced that the FDA has approved two new indications for Keytruda  pembrolizumab   the company s anti PD 1 therapy   The drug is now approved for the first line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma  who are ineligible for cisplatin containing chemotherapy 
The first indication is approved under the accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response  The approval is based on data from a single arm study  KEYNOTE 052  investigating Keytruda in 370 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who were not eligible for cisplatin containing chemotherapy 
The second approval came in for patients in second line setting for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma  who have disease progression during or following platinum containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum containing chemotherapy  The second line approval is based on data from a KEYNOTE 045 study  evaluating Keytruda in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma with disease progression on or after platinum containing chemotherapy 
Notably  Keytruda is approved for use in these indications at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity  or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression Merck s shares has rallied 8 5  year to date  comparing favorably with the Zacks classified  industry s gain of 8 4  
 We note that Keytruda is already approved in the U S  for the treatment of previously untreated metastatic non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  in patients whose tumors express high levels of PD L1 and previously treated metastatic NSCLC in patients whose tumors express PD L1  as well as advanced melanoma  and previously treated recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer  HNSCC  
In fact  Keytruda is the first anti PD 1 therapy to gain the FDA approval and is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in 500 trials  half in combination with other cancer drugs  Also  Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen  Inc    NASDAQ AMGN    Incyte  GlaxoSmithKline plc   NYSE GSK   and Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE   separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens  The last few months too witnessed a series of positive news on Keytruda  thereby raising sales expectations for the drug  Further  label expansion of the drug is expected to significantly boost Merck s top line  going forward

150914,372430,AMGN,Amgen  AMGN  Q1 Earnings Top  Sales Miss  Shares Decline,opinion,"Biotech major Amgen Inc    NASDAQ AMGN   reported first quarter 2017 earnings of  3 15 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 00 by 5  and increasing 9  from the year ago period  Higher operating margins offset a weak top line performance to drive the bottom line  Total revenue declined 1  to  5 46 billion in the first quarter of 2017  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 68 billion by 3 8   Excluding the impact of foreign exchange  sales were flat year over year While U S  revenues declined 1   ex U S  sales grew 3   excluding currency headwinds Quarter in DetailTotal product revenue declined 1  from the year ago quarter to  5 2 billion  U S    4 10 billion  ex U S    1 10 billion  as strong demand for newer products like Prolia  Xgeva  and Blincyto was offset by lower sales of mature brands like Enbrel  Aranesp  Epogen  Neulasta and Neupogen Revenues of Amgen s erythropoiesis stimulating agent  ESA   Aranesp  declined 4  from the year ago quarter to  511 million as higher unit demand in the U S was offset by currency headwinds and lower inventory and selling price Revenues of the other ESA  Epogen  declined 10  to  270 million due to lower selling price Neulasta revenues rose 2  to  1 21 billion from the year ago period as a favorable accounting benefit and higher price offset lower unit demand  Neupogen recorded a 31  decline in sales to  148 million due to biosimilar competition in the U S  Zarxio  Sandoz s  Novartis AG s   NYSE NVS   generic arm  biosimilar version of Neupogen  was launched in the U S  in Sep 2015 and is hurting sales The company expects Neulasta to face biosimilar competition in the U S  from the fourth quarter of 2017  Neupogen is expected to face continued competitive pressure in 2017 from existing and potentially new biosimilars However  the Neulasta Onpro kit  on body injector  continues to perform well commanding a market share of more than 50  in the U S  for all Neulasta sales Enbrel delivered revenues of  1 18 billion  down 15  from the year ago quarter due to increased competition and soft demand trends in the rheumatology dermatology market  Enbrel s market share in both rheumatology and the dermatology segments declined sequentially in the first quarter  Meanwhile  lower inventory levels also hurt Enbrel sales in the quarter On the call  management maintained that it expects minimal net price growth for Enbrel in 2017 while volume trends this year will be similar to 2016 levels Prolia revenues came in at  425 million  up 21  from the year ago quarter due to higher demand  Prolia volume growth continued to improve as the company continues to capture share across U S  and EU Meanwhile  Xgeva delivered revenues of  402 million  up 6  from the year ago quarter mainly due to higher demand Sensipar Mimpara revenues increased 15  to  421 million due to higher price and volume growth Vectibix revenues came in at  147 million  up 2   driven by higher demand  which offset the negative impact of foreign currency Kyprolis posted sales of  190 million  up 23  year over year driven by higher demand Blincyto sales surged 26  from the year ago period to  34 million  reflecting higher demand Amgen s PCSK9 inhibitor  Repatha generated revenues of  49 million  lower than  58 million in the fourth quarter  At the call  management said that Repatha s sequential performance was hurt by a booking of a Middle East tender in the previous quarter  which was not repeated in the first quarter of 2017 Uptake of the drug  which gained FDA approval in Aug 2015  has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re imbursement issues payer restrictions  Sanofi   NYSE SNY   and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ REGN   also faced similar issues with their PCSK9 inhibitor Praluent We remind investors that a phase III cardiovascular outcomes study  FOURIER  on Repatha reported positive data in the first quarter of 2017 The outcomes data is considered the key to the commercial success of Repatha as it would broaden the use for the drug  Though data from the study looks good  it is not very clear if payers will be willing to improve access to Repatha based on this data Operating Margins IncreaseAdjusted operating margins rose 300 basis points  bps  to 57 6  due to lower operating costs  reflecting continued benefits from transformation and process improvement efforts R D expenses declined 13  in the quarter due to lower late stage pipeline related costs  while SG A spend declined 6  due to the Oct 2016 expiration of Enbrel residual royalty payments  which offset investments to support new product launches Amgen bought back shares worth  555 million in the quarter  At the end of the first quarter  Amgen had  3 5 billion remaining under its  5 billion stock repurchase plan 2017 GuidanceWhile Amgen retained the previously issued sales outlook  it raised the earnings guidance to account for the first quarter earnings beat The company expects total revenue in the range of  22 3 billion to  23 1 billion  same as the previous guidance  However  adjusted earnings are now expected in the range of  12 00 to  12 60 in 2017 compared with  11 80 to  12 60 per share expected previously Meanwhile  operating margin is expected to be lower in the rest of the quarters this year due to the timing of expenses Our TakeIt was a rather mixed quarter for Amgen as it beat earnings expectations while missing the same for sales  Shares lost 3 1  in after market trading  However  so far this year  Amgen s shares are up 8 7   better than the 4 7  increase registered by the Zacks classified industry Though Amgen s newer products   Prolia  Xgeva  Vectibix  Nplate and Sensipar   are all performing well  investors are concerned that their volume growth may not be enough to offset the decline in mature brands like Enbrel  Meanwhile  Neulasta and Epogen could start facing biosimilar competition this year while minimal sales price increases  Stiff competition is beginning to hurt sales of Enbrel  However  Amgen s restructuring plan should make it leaner and more cost efficient  Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline given quite a few regulatory and data updates scheduled for the coming quartersAmgen currently carries a Zacks Rank  3

150916,372432,AMGN,Radius Health  RDUS  Posts Wider Q1 Loss  Tymlos Approved ,opinion,"Radius Health  Inc    NASDAQ RDUS   posted a loss of  1 32 per share in the first quarter of 2017  compared with a loss of 94 cents per share in the year ago quarter and wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of  1 25  The year over year increase in net loss was attributable to an increase in general and administrative expenses 

Radius  share price decreased 9 7  year to date compared with the Zacks classified  industry s gain of 5 3  
Quarter in Detail 
Research and development expenses for the reported quarter were  19 5 million  down 28 9  year over year  The decline was attributed to a decrease in Tymlos abaloparatide SC  abaloparatide TD and elacestrant program development costs  partially offset by an increase in RAD140 development costs 
General and administrative expenses for the reported quarter jumped to  38 1 million from  13 6 million  The increase came on the back of growth in professional support costs  including the costs associated with increasing headcount for the commercialization of Tymlos  including the completion of the build out of the commercial organization in the first quarter of 2017  This increase was also driven by an increase in compensation expenses  including stock based compensation  due to an increase in headcount 
Pipeline Update
On Apr 28  the FDA approved Radius Health s lead candidate Tymlos  abaloparatide  injection for the treatment of postmenopausal women with high risk osteoporosis for fracture   defined as history of osteoporotic fracture   multiple risk factors for fracture  or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy  It is currently under review in the EU  The company expects an opinion from the European Medicines Agency s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use in Jul 2017 
The company is also developing abaloparatide transdermal as a short wear time transdermal patch  The company posted positive results from the trial in Sep 2016  The company is currently focused on completing the manufacturing  scale up  and other required activities needed to initiate a pivotal study to evaluate bioequivalence to abaloparatide SC 
The company also completed enrolment in its ongoing phase I studies of elacestrant in advanced metastatic breast cancer  Radius Health reported encouraging results from its ongoing phase I studies  The company plans to take the next steps for the program in the first half of 2017  which would include the design of a phase II trial  Additionally  it anticipates reporting results from its completed phase IIb trial in vasomotor symptoms in the first half of 2017 
Furthermore  the company submitted an investigational new drug application to the FDA for RAD140  which is a selective androgen receptor modulator   The application has been accepted  Moving ahead  it expects to commence a first in human phase I study in women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer in 2017 Radius Health  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

   Our take
The FDA s approval of Radius Health s lead candidate  Tymlos  is a significant boost for the company  However  shares were down 9 6  on the company s wider than expected loss in the first quarter as expenses continues to rise  Although the osteoporosis market in the U S  has great potential as approximately 1 4 million postmenopausal women in the U S  experience an osteoporotic fracture each year  Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly   Co s   NYSE LLY   Forteo and Amgen Inc s   NASDAQ AMGN   Prolia  Moreover  the approved label carries a boxed warning of osteosarcoma  a malignant bone tumor  
Hence  we expect investors to focus on the drug s pricing and uptake post launch 
Zacks Rank   Stock to Consider
Radius Health currently has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  
A better ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Heska Corporation   NASDAQ HSKA   which sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Heska s earnings estimates for 2017 have increased to  1 65 from  1 53 over the last 60 days  The company posted positive surprises all the four trailing quarters with an average beat of 291 54   Its share price has increased 47 2  this year so far

150950,372466,AMGN,Gilead  GILD  Q1 Earnings  Stock Likely To Beat Estimates ,opinion,"Gilead Sciences Inc    NASDAQ GILD   is scheduled to report first quarter 2017 results on May 2  after the market closes  Last quarter  the company beat expectations by 14 3  
Gilead s track record is mixed  with the company beating estimates in two of the last four trailing and missing in the other two  Overall  the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 2 88  

Shares of Gilead lost 33 7  in the last one year  underperforming the Zacks classified  industry s decline of 12 0  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this biotech major for this announcement 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model shows that Gilead is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients  a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is at  2 77   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is  2 23 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at  2 17  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  The combination of Zacks Rank  3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat at Gilead in the upcoming release 
On the other hand  Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Factors at Play
Concurrent with the fourth quarter earnings call  Gilead provided guidance for annual guidance for 2017  Gilead expects net product sales in the range of  22 5  24 5 billion  Non HCV product sales are projected between  15 billion and  15 5 billion   HCV product sales are projected between  7 5 billion and  9 0 billion 
Adjusted R D expenses and adjusted SG A expenses are projected in the range of  3 1  3 4 billion and  3 1  3 4 billion  respectively  Adjusted product gross margin is estimated in the range of 86 88  
2016 witnessed strong performance from HIV and other antiviral product sales driven by continued uptake of its tenofovir alafenamide  TAF  based products   Genvoya  Descovy and Odefsey  We expect the trend to continue in the first quarter as well  Genvoya has already become the most prescribed regimen for both treatment na ve and switch patients since its launch 
By the end of 2016  the TAF based regimens made up 37  of Gilead s HIV prescription volume in the treatment market  Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre exposure prophylaxis setting should also boost sales   However  Gilead will lose exclusivity for Viread in 2017 in some countries outside the U S  which should impact sales 
However  the HCV franchise continues to be under competitive and pricing pressure leading to a massive decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales in 2016  Harvoni and Sovaldi face competition from AbbVie s   NYSE ABBV   Viekira Pak and Viekira XR among others  Higher discounts and payer mix continue to impact sales adversely  Total HCV treatment starts in the U S  were an estimated 231 000 in 2016  approximately 25 000 less than 2015  The company expects a further decline in patients starts in 2017 
On a positive note  the HCV portfolio was boosted when Epclusa gained approval in 2016 to become the first and only all oral  pan genotypic  STR consisting of Sovaldi and velpatasvir  an NS5A inhibitor   for the treatment of adults with genotype 1 6 chronic HCV infection  Initial uptake of Epclusa has been encouraging while formulary reviews are on track 
The recently approved HBV drug Vemlidy should also start contributing meaningfully to the top line 
On the first quarter call  investors should keep an eye on Gilead s performance while pipeline updates will also be keenly awaited  Focus would also be on the performance of Epclusa and TAF based regimens 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some other health care stocks that you may want to consider  as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Intercept Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ICPT   has an Earnings ESP of  9 13  and a Zacks Rank  3   The company is expected to release results on May 4  You can see  
Amgen Inc    NASDAQ AMGN   has an Earnings ESP of  2 33  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is scheduled to release results on Apr 26

150986,372502,AMGN,Is Shinhan Financial A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Shinhan Financial Group Co Ltd   NYSE SHG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Shinhan Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 4 13  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 06  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Shinhan Financial s current PE ratio above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number remaining roughly stable over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Banks Foreign sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 90  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Shinhan Financial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 86  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Shinhan Financial stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Shinhan Financial has a P S ratio of about 0 87  This is way lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 04 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Shinhan Financial currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Shinhan Financial a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Shinhan Financial is just 0 47  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 72  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 3 38  which is lower than the industry average of 5 77  Clearly  SHG is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Shinhan Financial might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives SHG a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade  of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  Both the current year and next year have seen one estimate go higher in the past thirty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has risen by 2 6  in the past one month  while the full year estimate has inched upper by 2 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Shinhan Financial Group Co Ltd Price and Consensus
    Buoyed by the bullish analyst sentiments  the stock has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineShinhan Financial is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a strong industry rank  among Top 19  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  1 increases our confidence on the stock However  on the flipside over the past two years  the Zacks Banks Foreign industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite the poor past performance of the industry  a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this the solid Zacks rank  favorable estimate revisions and robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  5 Trades Could Profit   Big League   from Trump Policies If the stocks above spark your interest  wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington s changing course Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals  tariffs  lower taxes  higher interest rates  and spending surges in defense and infrastructure ",2017-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-shinhan-financial-a-great-stock-for-value-investors-200183418,200183418

150988,372504,AMGN,Is J J s Pharma Sales Slowdown A Warning For Other Players ,opinion,"Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   reported mixed first quarter 2017 earnings results on Tuesday  While earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate  sales missed due to a slowdown in pharmaceutical product sales 
For the first quarter  J J s earnings of  1 83 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 77  Quarterly revenues were  17 8 billion  which missed the consensus mark of  18 0 billion   Read More    
This was the second consecutive sales miss for the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company  Shares of the drug and consumer products giant declined 3  in response 
This year so far  J J s share price is up 6 4   However  this compares unfavorably with the 6 9  increase witnessed by the Zacks classified  industry 

The impact of J J earnings caused the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index to decline 1 32  on Tuesday 
About the Pharmaceutical Division
Johnson   Johnson has several multi million dollar drugs within its pharmaceutical division covering a broad range of therapeutic areas such as neuroscience  cardiovascular and metabolism  immunology  oncology and infectious diseases vaccines  Pharmaceutical sales account for more than 45  of J J s total revenue  However  several products in this segment are facing generic competition 
How Did the Segment Perform in Q1 
J J s Pharmaceutical segment sales grew only 0 8  year over year in the first quarter of 2017 due to weaker sales in the domestic markets  Sales in the U S  market declined 1 3  in the quarter 
New products like Imbruvica  cancer  and Darzalex  multiple myeloma  continued to perform well  Other growth drivers were Stelara  Invega Sustenna and Simponi 
However  Concerta declined 9 5  due to generic competition while Zytiga sales fell 6 3  due to higher utilization of independent patient assistance foundations 
In the cardiovascular metabolic space  pricing pressure and competitive payer dynamics hurt sales of Invokana and Xarelto  Sales of Xarelto declined 9 5  due to the timing of Medicare Part D costs and higher drug access discounts while Invokana Invokamet sales declined 12 6  due to lower price  Some analysts fear these issues are not isolated for J J and other pharma biotech companies may also feel the impact of these pricing payer issues this year 
Importantly  sales of the blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade  marketed in partnership with Merck   Co   Inc    NYSE MRK    declined 6  in the quarter with U S  sales declining 2 4  and international sales declining 3  due to biosimilar competition in Europe 
In this regard  we would like to mention that Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE   launched its Inflectra injection  a biosimilar version of Remicade in the U S  late last November at risk  which did not have any significant impact on Remicade sales in the first quarter of 2017  Nonetheless  we believe that though the rate of penetration of a biosimilar entrant may be modest  the launch brings a certain element of uncertainty to the Pharma segment as there may be an additional impact as the year progresses 
J J s Pharma segment is expected to see slower growth this year as a number of key growth drivers like Remicade and Concerta have slowed down and are facing generic competition  Meanwhile  HCV sales continue to decline in the face of intense competition 
What s With Other Pharma Giants 
J J is not the only large pharma company facing a slowdown in sales of its drugs  Many others like Merck  Amgen  Inc    NASDAQ AMGN    Pfizer and others are facing loss of exclusivity and generic biosimilar competition for key revenue generators  slowdown in sales of mature drugs and competitive and pricing pressure  mainly in the U S  which is hurting their top line 
We discuss here a few companies facing similar issues 
Pfizer
Pfizer s top line is being impacted by the loss of patent exclusivity on products like Celebrex  Lipitor  Norvasc  Protonix  Camptosar  and Zoloft  Meanwhile  products like Lyrica and Chantix will lose exclusivity in the coming years  Other than that  pricing pressure and rising competition and expiry of certain key contracts are also hampering top line growth  New products like cancer drug Ibrance and contribution from acquisitions like Hospira and Medivation are expected to provide some top line support  going forward 
In 2017  the company s sales are expected to increase only slightly from 2016 levels  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in 2017 is  53 1 billion  representing year over year growth of only 0 54   Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Merck
Merck is facing generic competition for several drugs including Singulair  Maxalt  Propecia  Temodar  Cozaar Hyzaar  Zocor and Fosamax  All these drugs have recorded rapid and steep declines in revenues due to the presence of generics  In 2016  key drugs like Nasonex  Cubicin and Zetia lost patent exclusivity  which is hurting sales  In 2017  Merck will lose market exclusivity in the U S  for Vytorin  Sales of the drug are expected to decline sharply in the U S  thereafter  In addition  Isentress is facing competitive pressure and is being impacted by slowing growth of the integrase class 
While sales of drugs that have lost patent exclusivity will continue to decline rapidly  the full benefit of the ramp from new product launches such as Keytruda and Zepatier will be realized only from the second half of 2017 
Merck carries a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 sales is  39 78 billion  representing a slight year over year decline 
Amgen
While biotech major Amgen s results impressed in 2016  concerns remain about the sustainability of the performance  considering the presence of biosimilar competition and slowdown in sales of mature products  Biosimilars are already having a negative impact on key products like Neupogen and Neulasta in the EU 
Meanwhile  Neupogen sales are also being hurt by biosimilar competition in the U S  We expect competition to increase as additional biosimilars receive approval  Neulasta and Epogen could start facing biosimilar competition in the U S  this year  Moreover  minimal sales price increases and stiff competition can hurt blockbuster Enbrel sales in 2017 
Volume growth of relatively newer products   Prolia  Xgeva  Vectibix  Nplate and Sensipar   may not be enough to offset the decline in mature brands 
Amgen carries a Zacks Rank  3  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 sales is pegged at  30 billion  flat year over year 
Sanofi   NYSE SNY  
Sanofi has faced significant loss of revenues in the last couple of years as several of its key products went off patent including its blockbuster drug  Plavix  Although the company is now past its patent cliff  sales of new products are yet to pick up  Meanwhile  drugs like Lantus  Lovenox  Aprovel Avapro  Renagel and Taxotere  among others  are expected to face further generic competition in 2017  which will continue to have a negative impact on revenues in the coming quarters  Additionally  the company is facing increased genericization in Japan due to new policies 
Sanofi s Diabetes franchise is under significant pressure with key product  Lantus  facing increasing competitive pressure at the payer level  Sanofi s outlook for its Diabetes franchise is bleak  Meanwhile  the uptake of new products like its PCSK9 inhibitor Praluent has been slower than expected due to pricing and reimbursement issues 
Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY  
Genericization of Plavix  Avapro Avalide and Baraclude in the U S  due to loss of exclusivity is significantly hurting the company s top line  The company also faces stiff competition in the immuno oncology space  Meanwhile  shares are under pressure with investors expressing disappointment over the company s failed efforts to expand its key product Opdivo s label to include the first line treatment of lung cancer  which could give an edge over competitors 
Bristol Myers carries a Zacks Rank  3 
Conclusion
Most of these companies boast a deep and promising pipeline while their new products are doing relatively well  Also  these companies are looking at strategic mergers and acquisitions  in licensing deals collaboration with smaller companies to boost their product portfolio  It remains to be seen how far these efforts offset the negative impact of genericization and pricing  payer and competitive pressure in the U S

150989,372505,AMGN,Novartis  NVS  Q1 Earnings  Will The Stock Disappoint ,opinion,"Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   is scheduled to report first quarter 2017 results on Apr 25 
A look at Novartis  share price movement year to date shows that the stock has underperformed the Zacks classified  industry  Its shares have declined 0 2   as against the industry s gain of 4 2  

In the last reported quarter  Novartis recorded a positive earnings surprise of 2 75   Overall  the company has posted an average positive earnings surprise of 2 38  in the four trailing quarters  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Impact the Quarter
Novartis operates under three segments  Innovative Medicines  Pharmaceuticals   Alcon and Sandoz  Generics  
In fact  loss of exclusivity of some of the key drugs in Novartis  portfolio is hurting the top line  We expect the negative trend to continue in the first quarter of 2017 
While on one hand  the company s blockbuster drug  Diovan  is facing stiff generic competition in the U S   the EU and Japan  On the other hand  Gleevec lost exclusivity in the U S  in Feb 2016 and inthe EU in Dec 2016  thereby leading to generic competition  Exforge is also facing generic competition in the U S  and the EU  Furthermore  the oncology drugs are facing new competition in the form of immuno oncology therapies  The negative impact of generic competition is expected to impact sales by  2 5 billion in 2017 as well 
The company s ophthalmologic division  Alcon  continues to face challenges due to lower surgical equipments sales as a result of competition faced by intraocular lens and a slowdown in demand for equipment purchases We do not expect any improving trends in the division s sales in the to be reported quarter 
Novartis suffered quite a few pipeline setbacks in the quarter  The FDA issued a Complete Response Letter  CRL  to RLX030  Recently  the company also reported disappointing data from a late stage study on the candidate for the treatment of acute heart failure  Furthermore  RELAX AHF 2 did not meet its primary endpoints of reduction in cardiovascular death through day 180 or reduced worsening heart failure through day five   
We expect management to discuss the issues at the conference call Additionally  Novartis  generic arm  Sandoz  is making efforts to strengthen the biosimilars portfolio generics  The company plans to launch five biosimilars of major oncology and immunology biologics across key geographies by 2020 
In the quarter  Novartis received FDA approval of Kisqali  formerly known as ribociclib  LEE011   for use in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the first line treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive  human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative  HR  HER2   advanced or metastatic breast cancer  We expect the company to throw light on the commercialization plans of the drug at the first quarter conference call

151055,372571,AMGN,3 Reasons Why AMGN Is A Strong Buy,opinion,"The stock market is at all time highs  but biotechnology stocks like Amgen  Inc   NASDAQ AMGN  are near their 52 week lows  What gives  There are multiple reasons why the biotechnology stocks have under performed  but based on my analysis  that is starting to change  In fact  they are going to play catch up very quickly  Below are the 3 reasons why every investor should by Amgen  Inc 
1  As a majority of stocks are at all time highs  investors are looking for value  Valuations on financial stocks and many other sectors are in bubble territory  The ONLY sector that is near its 52 week lows is the biotechnology sector  Capital rotation is likely to occur as investors realize there is value here  Amgen  Inc  is one of the leaders that is most secure safe  It will see a lot of capital flow 
2  Over the last two weeks  Amgen  Inc  has seen a gentle slow grind lower known as bullish consolidation  This tells investors that big money is accumulating heavily  In addition  just yesterday price filled a gap fill to the downside  It is major support and a trigger for a move up  Today  Amgen  Inc  is already popping over  3  There is huge upside based on the stock chart  with a target to  160 00 
3  The fear of price caps on drugs is way overblown  First  it was Hillary Clinton that biotech investors were scared of  now it is Donald Trump  We know Donald Trump is extremely pro business  He is not going to kill the biotechnology sector with massive price caps  He just won t  In this case  the bark is worse than the bite ",2016-12-09,Jenny Rebekka,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reason-why-$amgn-is-a-strong-buy-200169156,200169156
151056,372572,AMGN,The Week Ahead  New Year  New Highs  New List Of Worries,opinion,"There is a normal dose of economic data this week  but we are entering a quiet  pre holiday period  As the rally faltered a bit  the Dow 20K talk yielded to a discussion of what could go wrong  I expect this discussion to continue in the coming week  and perhaps the next one as well  The punditry will be asking 
What can derail the rally  
Last Week
In a reversal from the last month  most of the economic news was soft  There was little apparent market effect 
Theme Recap
In my last WTWA  I predicted a week long fixation on the Dow 20K story  That was very accurate  with the closest call coming just as I arrived at Chicago s NBC tower for a  on my Dow 20K forecast back in 2010  I think it represents a delay rather than a jinx 
Some might attribute the selling to the Fed and Chair Yellen s press conference  an  effect  that was reversed the next day  It must have been me   I ll stay at the office for the rest of the year 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this  of the S P 500 from Doug Short  He captures the continuing rally and the move to new highs 

Doug has a special knack for pulling together all the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read his entire post where he adds analysis grounded in data and several more charts providing long term perspective 
Personal
I will have several year end posts planned for the next two weeks  but will probably skip WTWA next weekend  I am planning a Weighing the Year Ahead installment  probably in two weeks 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something very positive  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too  
This week s news was quite good almost all positive  I make objective calls  which means not stretching to achieve a false balance  If I missed something for the  bad  list  please feel free to suggest it in the comments 
The Good 
Framing lumber prices are higher  year over year   sees this as an important leading indicator for housing  so we should  too 
Initial jobless claims edged lower  to 254K 
Hotels are close to an occupancy record     
The Fed provided the expected increase in rates with almost no market reaction   That is the good part    some insight  See also  Davidson  via  
The Philly Fed showed a big gain to 21 5  7 6 prior  and trouncing expectations  I am not very interested in the Empire State survey  but it mirrored the Philly result  Business and consumer confidence have both strengthened since the election  Confidence is essential for spending  investment  and economic strength 
Inflation is still tame  even as it creeps toward the Fed s target 
Household balance sheets are much stronger  Scott Grannis regularly produces this chart  It is far more valuable than material from those focusing exclusively on debt  and ignoring assets 

Homebuilder confidence hits the highest level since 2005     

The Bad 
Industrial production declined by 0 4  from October to November 
The rail contraction continues   continues his coverage with multiple takes and time frames  Check it out 
China drone incident  The drone seizure coincided with Friday selling  a hint of market reaction to sensitive international issues  China will  and claims that the story was  hyped up  
High frequency indicators edge lower  NDD s  shows continuing strength in short leading indicators  neutral in the coincident group  and some weakness in the long term  He is downplaying the effects due to seasonality  but it bears watching 
Housing starts dropped by 18 7   This was a very bad headline number  Various sources suggest that it emphasizes multi family while single family is strong  This is a shift that is quite acceptable  so we should follow it closely  Calculated Risk  our go to source on all things housing  has a great analysis and this chart 

The Ugly 
The Young   from helping credit card companies  The choices are frequently worse than the student could find otherwise 
The Old   that cost of living adjustments may soon end  Already the inflation rate for seniors  mostly because of medical costs  exceeds the standard CPI calculation 

The Silver Bullet 
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  No award this week  but opportunities abound and nominations are welcome 
The Week Ahead 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar 
We have a normal week for data  loaded into the latter part of the week  Things will get very quiet after Friday s opening 
The  A  List 
Michigan sentiment  F   Confidence is important right now  Will the mid month preliminary high hold up 
New home sales  F   Not much change expected in this important sector 
Leading indicators  Th   This widely followed measure is likely to be flat 
Personal income and spending  Th   This important read on the economy is expected to show solid growth 
Initial claims  Th   The best concurrent indicator for employment trends 
The  B  List 
Existing home sales  W   A small decline is expected  Less important than new construction  but still relevant 
PCE price index  Th   The Fed s favorite inflation indicator   still very tame at a touch over 1  
Q3 GDP third estimate  Th   Little change expected in what is now viewed as  old news  
Durable goods orders  Th   This volatile series is expected to be much weaker than the October data 
Crude inventories  W   Recently showing even more impact on oil prices  Rightly or wrongly  that spills over to stocks 
Despite the end of the FOMC quiet period  we have little FedSpeak  Chair Yellen makes an early week appearance  and that is all I see 
Next Week s Theme 
Last week attention focused on Dow 20K  This was true even though it is a rather meaningless round number in a flawed index  It shows the power of symbolism to attract attention  When the rally fizzled out  the story swiftly turned  Everyone questions rapid  short term moves  so it is a natural for the punditry 
I expect it to carry over into a quiet week  with plenty of focus on 2017  The popular question will be about what could stop the rally  What should we worry about  It is time to rebuild the wall or worry 
What could go wrong  
Pundits were already hard at work last week 
You should  the lists or 2017 winners 
Trump s policies might not get enacted  disappointing markets   are in line for  871 billion 
Trump s policies might be enacted     Think trade matters  
Trump might make a bad decision in a crisis  An ill timed tweet 
 are still excessive  Stocks are  
The Fed and a strong dollar  
Stocks  for dividend reinvestment   You can t make this up  
Bonds are  
Or maybe we should look at the bright side

Best of the Week 
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be advice from legendary investor Peter Lynch  Instead of finding something from the last week  I wanted to find the best choice for current conditions   did the Peter Lynch report about two years ago  starting with this very relevant quotation 

Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections  or trying to anticipate corrections  than has been lost in corrections themselves 

And also  

Now no one seems to know when they are gonna happen  At least if they know about  em  they re not telling anybody about  em  I don t remember anybody predicting the market right more than once  and they predict a lot  So they re gonna happen  If you re in the market  you have to know there s going to be declines  And they re going to cap and every couple of years you re going to get a 10 percent correction  That s a euphemism for losing a lot of money rapidly  That s what a  correction  is called  And a bear market is 20 25 30 percent decline 


They re gonna happen  When they re gonna start  no one knows  If you re not ready for that  you shouldn t be in the stock market  I mean the stomach is the key organ here  It s not the brain  Do you have the stomach for these kinds of declines  And what s your timing like  Is your horizon one year  Is your horizon ten years or 20 years 


What the market s going to do in one or two years  you don t know  Time is on your side in the stock market

Final Thoughts 
My biggest reason for the 2010 Dow20K post was to alert investors to the idea of  upside risk   There is always   always   a list of plausible worries  These dominate the news and the financial discussions  The other side is difficult  It is boring to say repeatedly that things are normal and promising  Talking about some new development seems smart   attracting viewers  page views  more gigs to make you famous  and even investors who seek confirmation 
The natural process leads to a focus on problems  These are easy to see  while solutions are not  Therefore  most investors do not understand the ill named concept of the  
The new list of worries  all well known and reflected in current market prices  is a replacement for those listed on my current  investor fears  page  which replaced those from the 2010 era  It seems smart to study world events and use that knowledge to guide your investment decisions  But it is not  
You cannot make these calls as well as the market does  You are almost certain to over react 
The investor mistakes I highlighted in 2010 are still with us 
Excessive attention to headline events 
Reliance on poor forecasts of the economy  especially recessions   James Picerno has a  of typical forecasts 
Too much reliance on backward looking earnings  reflective of unusual events and times 
Ignoring the long term economic forces putting idle assets to work    on 24K 
Emphasizing politics instead of investing  In 2008 many investors hated the prospects and principles of the Obama administration  They sat out the start  and never found an entry point 
It is more profitable to accept a measure of uncertainty  rely upon the best recession and earnings indicators  and remain agnostic about politics ",2016-12-18,Jeff Miller,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/weighing-the-week-ahead:-new-year,-new-highs,-and-a-new-list-of-worries-200170028",200170028
151057,372573,AMGN,Progenics Pharmaceuticals  Inc Shares Climb On Trial Announcement News,opinion,"Progenics Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ PGNX 
Progenics Pharmaceuticals  Inc   PGNX   a global oncology company yesterday announced that an independent company has recommended continuation of its phase 3 trial of PSMA targeted SPECT CT imaging 
Progenics Pharmaceuticals  Inc  CEO s Comments

 The growing acceptance of active surveillance among men with lower grade prostate cancer presents a significant opportunity for 1404 to enable clinicians and patients to accurately and non invasively visualize and manage their disease   said Mark Baker  Chief Executive Officer of Progenics 
 We are pleased that the DMC has determined that the trial should continue  The decision to undergo more invasive treatments  such as radical prostatectomy  is a difficult one for both patients and their families given the severity of potential side effects  and we look forward to the completion of this study as we work to introduce new and effective surveillance options   Mr  Baker continued   Our modification to the protocol reflects emerging trends among men with low grade disease to increasingly favor the use of active surveillance versus more aggressive measures  consistent with treatment guidelines  We believe that this shift underscores the potential for agents such as 1404 to address the growing active surveillance market  In addition  we expect that the protocol modification will allow for a better balance in the enrollment of subjects with clinically significant disease versus those with indolent disease  with the goal of evaluating the specificity of 1404 imaging to identify patients without clinically significant prostate cancer and the sensitivity of 1404 imaging to identify patients with clinically significant disease  

PGNX Technical Analysis

PGNX opened trading yesterday at  8 93 which was up from the previous day s trading close of  8 88  PGNX closed trading yesterday at  8 86 and spiked up after market to  9 55  equivalent to a 8  increase from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see that the last time PGNX traded above these levels we have to go back to July 29th  2015 when it traded at  9 61 
Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike up PGNX had already been in an overall upward trend dating back to November 3rd when it traded at  4 92  PGNX has a float of 56 28 million shares and traded below the normal daily trading volume on Thursday  For trading purposes  I would like to see PGNX open trading on Friday above  9 30 and if it does I would be looking to take a long position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 20 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap up  Check out Ross over at where he is applying his  to these types of stocks

The strategic collaboration with Almirall gives Nuevolution a strong potential revenue stream  while allowing Almirall access to a differentiated product candidate  Almirall has multiple dermatology products  both on the market and in late stage development  and is well placed to advance the ROR t inverse agonist platform in dermatology and psoriatic arthritis  Nuevolution retain ownership of other indications   Combined potential future revenue of up to  442m  SEK4 3bn  from development  regulatory and sales milestones in addition to tiered royalties on future sales could generate significant revenue for Nuevolution  Almirall is responsible for both funding and undertaking all research and commercial activities

Notably  HoFH is a rare genetic lipid disorder that impairs the function of the receptor responsible for removing LDL C   bad  cholesterol  from the body 
Juxtapid was launched in the U S  in late Jan 2013  as an adjunct to a low fat diet and other lipid lowering treatments  including low density lipoprotein  LDL  apheresis where available  to reduce LDL cholesterol  LDL C   total cholesterol  TC   apolipoprotein B and non high density lipoprotein cholesterol  non HDL C  for the treatment of adult patients suffering from HoFH  In the U S   the drug carries a boxed warning for the risk of hepatotoxicity 
Juxtapid gained EU approval under the trade name Lojuxta in Aug 2013 
Sales of Juxtapid declined 45 5  in the second quarter and 62 6  in the third quarter of 2016 from the year ago levels due to a reduction in patients on therapy in the U S   as a result of increased competition from PCSK9 inhibitors  The launch of Amgen  Inc  s   NASDAQ AMGN   Repatha and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ REGN    Sanofi s   NYSE SNY   Praluent in the U S  market dampened Juxtapid sales and will continue to do so in the forthcoming quarters

151129,372645,AMGN,5 Top Performing Biotechnology Stocks Of November,opinion,"November was a great month for pharma biotech stocks after a rather difficult year when the industry struggled with media and political focus on high drug prices 
The pharma biotech industry responded favorably to Donald Trump s victory in the Presidential election last month on anticipation of fewer drug pricing headwinds  This is because Trump has not been as vocal as Hillary Clinton about rising drug prices and excessive cost of treatments  Trump and the Republican Congress are expected to be more lenient on the drug industry s pricing practices than Clinton would have been 
We note that post elections  biotech stocks have recovered from the sharp selloff witnessed over the past one year  The Zacks classified Drugs industry gained 1 7  since the elections but declined 16 3  on a year to date basis  In November  the Drugs industry rose 2 0  
Companies like Celgene  NASDAQ CELG   9 3    Merck  NYSE MRK   1 1    Pfizer  NYSE PFE   7 1    Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   4 1    Bristol Myers  6 2    Endo  10 3   and Regeneron  3 1   were in the positive territory post elections  However  most of these companies  shares declined on a year to date basis Medical Sector Price Index
 

Notably  Trump s intentions to repeal ObamaCare and free up cash currently held overseas for tax reasons are expected to boost the pharma biotech industry further  With the presidential election over  a group of investors believe that biotechs are geared for an extraordinary comeback 
Also  healthcare mergerand acquisition activity has gathered steam this year  In licensing activities and collaborations for the development of pipeline candidates have also increased significantly  Several pharma companies are focusing on in licensing  mid to late stage pipeline candidates that look promising instead of developing a product from scratch that take a lot of funds and time Merger and acquisitions  especially small bolt on acquisitions as well as aggressive in licensing activities and collaborations are expected to increase  going forward  This is expected to act as a huge catalyst for biotech stocks

Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   made a top in August 2015 and fell back  finding a bottom nearly 30  lower at the end of September that year  It bounced around from there for a while until rising back to that August 2015 high in August this year  It tagged it again later in the month and then pulled back to a higher low at the 50 day SMA 
Another run up to resistance in September failed to make a new high and it fell back again  This time it dropped all the way back to the rising trend support line going back to 2014  Two weeks ago it bounced up off of that level and quickly ran to the 20 day SMA  It found resistance there and has pulled back in a bull flag  A measured move out of the flag to the upside would target 157 if it continues out of the flag to the upside Monday 
The RSI is pausing at the mid line  but rising  and the MACD is crossed up and rising  There is a lot of run higher within the wide Bollinger Bands   The company pays a  1 dividend Monday  already trading ex dividend  and the company is not expected to report earnings again until January 26th as they recently reported  The stock has a small 1  short float 
The November options chain show large open interest from the 139 to 160 strikes on the put side and at 145  152 5 and 160 on the call side  No overwhelming draw this week  December options are centered at 150 on the call side with a longer tail to the upside  The December puts are biggest higher but spread more to the downside  January sees the distribution centered around 170 on the call side but at 145 on the put side

151152,372668,AMGN,Is Immunotherapy The Next Hot Industry For Biotech Stock Investors ,opinion,"Biotechnology can be a tough market for investors to break in to  The jargon is intimidating  the volatility is incredible  while there are political concerns to be cognizant of as well 
But in this edition of the Dutram Report  I take a closer look at this market  and in particular the immunotherapy world  in order to shine some light on this promising space for investors  In order to do this  I talk with Brad Loncar  the CEO of Loncar Investments  who developed a benchmark of such companies called the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy Index  which is the underlying benchmark for the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF  CNCR  
In the interview  we discuss the basics of immunotherapy  and why this technique might be a real gamechanger for the treatment of cancer  The approach looks to harness the power of someone s immune system in order to fight disease  which may help some patients improve their quality of life while still achieving great outcomes  This only scratches the surface though  as we discuss some of the more innovative and groundbreaking treatments under development in this market too 
We also discuss how someone might go about investing in this market with stocks  and why a broad biotechnology ETF like IBB or XBI might not get you exposure to this corner of the sector  We also take a deeper look at the Loncar index  and what exactly an  immunotherapy stock  means 
In particular  I note some of the large caps which find their way into the benchmark  such as Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   Merck  NYSE MRK   or AstraZeneca  AZN   But we also discuss some of the more growth oriented names that might be more in line with investors  initial assumptions about the market  such as KITE Pharma  KITE  or Juno Therapeutics  JUNO   These all fit into the theme in their own way though  and we dive into the key trends taking place in these companies  and others  that have business in this important market   
Lastly  I also wanted to note that Loncar has partnered with the   and will be giving part of its fee to the charity  Loncar Investments looks to give four basis points of the fee from assets under management to the CRI on a regular basis  in an effort to help support this basic research institution  This is definitely something that could be more of a trend in the future  and especially among the many socially conscious ETFs out there 
This was certainly an informative podcast  and I definitely learned something about this often overlooked corner of the biotechnology world  I think you will as well  so make sure to listen to this edition of the Dutram Report for additional information  And for more news and insights into the world of ETFs  make sure to be on the lookout for the next edition of the Dutram Report  and check out the

151175,372691,AMGN,5 Healthcare Stocks Poised To Trump Q3 Earnings,opinion,"The past few months have been pretty rough for the healthcare sector  with the drug pricing issue taking the center stage once again  This time  it was the massive price hike of Mylan N V  s  NASDAQ MYL  severe allergy treatment  EpiPen that sparked controversies  With no possibility of dying down any time soon  the company has drawn flak from lawmakers  consumers and the common people alike 

Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton s tweet on the issue made matters worse  which was followed by her proposal of a health care plan to keep drug prices under control  protect consumers from unjustified drug price hikes and increase the accountability of drug manufacturers 
Deals  Product Approvals   Zika Virus

Despite all these negative developments  mergers and acquisitions  and licensing deals continued to make it to the headlines  German drug maker  Bayer AG  DE BAYGN  and U S  seed behemoth Monsanto Company  NYSE MON  have finally reached an agreement under which the latter will be acquired by the former in an all cash deal valued at about  66 billion  While biotech company Horizon Pharma plc acquired California based Raptor Pharmaceuticals Corp   Pfizer Inc   NYSE PFE  took over oncology focused company Medivation  Inc  for approximately  14 billion 

Allergan  NYSE AGN pa  plc  AGN  continued with its acquisition spree  In Oct 2016  Allergan announced the intention to acquire Motus Therapeutics  Inc   a wholly owned subsidiary of Rhythm Holding Company  The acquisition should be completed by the year end  Note that Allergan announced a string of small bolt on acquisitions in Sep 2016 to expand its presence in the highly lucrative non alcoholic steatohepatitis space 

Collaborations between large cap and development stage companies are being seen mostly in the immuno oncology space  and to some extent in other therapeutic areas like autoimmune and cardiovascular 

Additionally  new product approvals  along with the label expansion of existing drugs and regular pipeline updates kept investors glued to the sector  While Eli Lilly and Company  NYSE LLY  gained accelerated approval in the U S  for Lartruvo  in combination with doxorubicin  for the first line treatment of soft tissue sarcoma  Sarepta Therapeutics  Inc  received a huge boost with the same for Exondys 51 for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy 

Meanwhile  Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG s immuno oncology drug Tecentriq was granted FDA approval for an additional indication  this time for the treatment of metastatic non small cell lung cancer 

Let us now come to biosimilars  which are being touted as the next big thing in the health care sector  Among the approved biosimilars in the U S  are Novartis AG s Erelzi  a biosimilar version of Amgen Inc  NASDAQ AMGN   s Enbrel   Amgen s Amjevita  a biosimilar version of AbbVie Inc  NYSE ABBV   s Humira  and Celltrion  and Pfizer s Inflectra  a biosimilar version of Johnson   Johnson s Remicade   In late November  Pfizer is expected to launch Inflectra in the U S 

Meanwhile  the widespread outbreak of the deadly Zika virus has brought companies focused on the disease  such as Inovio Pharmaceuticals  Inc  and Intrexon Corporation  to the forefront 

With this backdrop  let s take a look at some companies in the health care space that have the potential to beat expectations in their upcoming releases  Although the  is well underway  it s not too late to cash in on the bountiful opportunities in the health care space  These stocks are well positioned in today s market environment  and could see considerable upside on the aforementioned trends 
Medical s Performance So Far

With several pharma and major biotech companies having released their Q3 earnings results  Medical is one of the many sectors that is witnessing earnings and revenue growth this quarter  Our Q3 scorecard shows that 54 7  of the companies in the Medical sector have reported results so far  with earnings increasing 14 9  on 8 1  higher revenues  The blended beat  which represents the percentage of companies that have beaten both earnings and revenue estimates  stands at 48 3  

Quite a few pharma and biotech companies are slated to report results in this week and next  Per our Earnings Trends report  Medical is one of the eight broader sectors that are anticipated to record positive earnings growth in Q3  with projections of 6  earnings growth on a 7 3  increase in revenues  Notably  this could be the first quarter to record positive earnings growth after five quarters of back to back declines 

So far  performance of the sector has been mixed  While it was a  beat and raise  quarter for some like Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   Bristol Myers Squibb Company  NYSE BMY  and Celgene Corporation  NASDAQ CELG   Eli Lilly and Roche s quarterly numbers fell short of expectations 
Grab the Prospective Q3 Winners

With the enormity of stocks in the healthcare space  selecting stocks that have the potential to beat estimates could appear daunting  But the proprietary Zacks methodology makes it fairly simple  One way to narrow down the list of choices this earnings season is by looking at stocks that sport the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold    and a positive   More often than not  a positive earnings surprise delivered by a company leads to stock price appreciation 

The Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their upcoming earnings announcement  It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70   Please check our  that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises  

Going by this criterion  here are five healthcare stocks that we believe are poised to beat estimates this quarter 

Our first choice is Dublin  Ireland based pharma company  Allergan     which has a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  0 56   The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  3 56  The company has consistently beaten earnings expectations  In fact  Allergan s earnings have surpassed expectations in each of the last four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 3 44  

Allergan is slated to report Q3 results on Nov 2  before the opening bell 
A well known name in the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder market  Shire plc    has made it to our list of the likely Q3 winners  thanks to its Zacks Rank  2 and  1 57  Earnings ESP  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is  3 18  Also based in Dublin  Ireland  Shire has beaten expectations in all of the past four quarters  bringing the average earnings surprise to 8 41  
Shire is scheduled to report Q3 results on Nov 1  before the opening bell 

One of the leading global animal health companies  Zoetis Inc  NYSE ZTS      has an impressive track record with the company consistently beating earnings expectations  Can Zoetis keep the earnings streak alive  Its Zacks Rank  3 and Earnings ESP of  2 17  sure indicate an earnings beat in Q3  The average positive earnings surprise over the last four trailing quarters is 15 92   The Zacks Consensus Estimate currently stands at 46 cents 

Zoetis is scheduled to report Q3 results on Nov 2  before the market opens 

Oncology focused biotech company  TESARO  Inc     is focused on the development of treatments targeting cancer  Based in Waltham  MA  TESARO has a disappointing track record with the company surpassing estimates only in one of the trailing four quarters  However  its prospects for Q3 look pretty good  The stock currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 08  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  

TESARO is slated to release Q3 results on Nov 3  after the market closes  The Zacks Consensus Estimate currently pegged at a loss of  1 92 

Our last pick is QIAGEN N V      with a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  3 70   Its Zacks Consensus Estimate currently stands at 27 cents  Based in Netherlands  QIAGEN is one of the leading providers of sample to insight solutions that transform biological samples into valuable molecular insights  The company has recorded an average positive surprise of 0 20  over the trailing four quarters 

QIAGEN is set to release Q3 results on Nov 2  after the market closes 
The Bottom Line
Despite challenges like growing political pressure on drug prices in the U S   biosimilar and generic competition  European pricing pressure  stressed balance sheets and other broad based factors  newer therapies  licensing agreements  partnership acquisition deals and restructuring initiatives should help support growth  We expect investors to keep an eye on these potential outperformers given their solid Zacks Rank and positive Zacks Earnings ESP Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside

	It s been a rough year for pharma and biotech stocks with several factors weighing on the sector including media and political focus on the high price of drugs  mixed performance results  slower than expected new product launches and increasing competition 

	The impact of these issues is more evident on biotech stocks  with the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declining 20 9  year to date  YTD  while the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index has lost 10 9  YTD 

Drug Pricing to Remain in Focus

	Right now  the biggest issue that is weighing on the sector is the political rhetoric regarding drug pricing  With presidential candidates  policymakers  the media and the general public focusing on the high price tags for drugs  the drug pricing controversy is not likely to die down easily 

	In fact  the drug pricing issue heated up recently given the price hikes taken by Mylan    NASDAQ         for its life saving combination product EpiPen  Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced a health care plan that will address the excessive price hikes of treatments that have been around for years and also reaffirmed her earlier broader plan  announced in Sep 2015  with the aim to lower drug prices for all Americans 

	Insulin drugmakers like Lilly   NYSE         and Novo Nordisk  CO NOVOb  are also under attack with Senator Bernie Sanders posting a series of tweets questioning the prices of their insulin drugs 

Will M As Pick Up Pace 

	With the major price correction resulting in reasonable valuations  expectations are high that more M A deals will be announced in the coming quarters  So far in 2016  some of the announced completed acquisitions include Shire Baxalta  Bristol Myers Padlock  and Pfizer   NYSE       Medivation  among others 

	In fact  the Pfizer Medivation deal  valued at approximately  14 billion  has raised hopes that major M As will pick pace once elections are over while licensing deals and small bolt on acquisitions will continue 

	Several pharma companies are focusing on in licensing mid to late stage pipeline candidates that look promising  instead of developing a product from scratch  which involves a lot of funds and time  Small biotech companies are open to such deals  with most of them finding it challenging to raise cash  thereby making it difficult to survive and continue with the development of promising pipeline candidates  Therefore  it makes sense to seek deals with pharma companies sitting on huge piles of cash 

Divestment of Non Core Assets   Restructuring Activities

	Another trend being witnessed is the divestment of non core business segments  Companies like Pfizer  UCB  Novartis    NYSE         Glaxo and AstraZeneca have all been a part of this trend  More recently  Sanofi  PA SASY  is looking to divest its generics portfolio in Europe while Valeant is in discussions for various divestitures including the Salix business  The monetization of non core assets allows these companies to focus on their areas of expertise 

	Restructuring activities are also gaining momentum as large pharma companies look to cut costs and streamline operations  Most of these companies are re evaluating their pipelines and discontinuing programs with an unfavorable risk benefit profile 

New Products Should Gain Traction

	Highly awaited new products that gained approval last year should contribute significantly to revenues  Some of the important new product approvals include Vertex s cystic fibrosis treatment  Orkambi  Amgen s    NASDAQ       heart failure treatment  Corlanor  Pfizer s cancer treatment  Ibrance  Novartis  psoriasis treatment  Cosentyx  PCSK9 inhibitors   Amgen s Repatha and Sanofi Regeneron s Praluent  Roche s advanced melanoma treatment  Cotellic and Gilead s Genvoya  HIV  

	Meanwhile  so far in 2016  the FDA has approved 19 new drugs including Zinplava  c  difficile infection   Lartruvo  soft tissue carcinoma   Exondys 51  Duchenne muscular dystrophy   Epclusa  HCV   Ocaliva  rare  chronic liver disease   Zinbryta  multiple sclerosis   Tecentriq  urothelial cancer   Venclexta  chronic lymphocytic leukemia in patients with a specific chromosomal abnormality   Taltz  moderate to severe plaque psoriasis   Cinqair  severe asthma  and Zepatier  HCV  among others  The FDA also expanded the label of cancer drugs like Kyprolis  Imbruvica and Xalkori 

Biosimilars Gaining Importance

	With the FDA approving the first biosimilar in the U S   Zarxio  a biosimilar version of Amgen s blockbuster drug  Neupogen   the floodgates have opened  While biosimilars have been available in the EU for quite a while  there was no regulatory pathway for biosimilars in the U S 

	The second biosimilar to gain approval in the U S  was Pfizer and Celltrion s Inflectra  infliximab dyyb  with the reference product being Remicade 

Strong Stocks that Should Be in the News

	Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar  They re virtually unknown to the general public  Yet today s 220 Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buys  were generated by the stock picking system that has nearly tripled the market from 1988 through 2015  Its average gain has been a stellar  26  per year

151201,372717,AMGN,Can AbbVie  ABBV  Sustain Earnings Beat Trend In Q3 ,opinion,"We expect pharma company AbbVie Inc    NYSE ABBV   to beat expectations when it reports third quarter earnings results on Oct 28 before market open  AbbVie had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5 00  in the second quarter 
AbbVie s performance has been pretty impressive  with consistent positive surprises  The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 3 32  ABBVIE INC Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Let s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter 
Factors at Play
At the second quarter conference call  management had said that it expects third quarter earnings in the range of  1 18 to  1 20 per share  Revenues were guided to see high single digit operational growth  excluding a modest negative foreign exchange impact 
Key drug Humira should remain the main growth driver in the third quarter  Growing awareness  strong underlying demand  favorable clinical data  additional indications and market share gains should help the product to continue contributing significantly to the top line 
However  a factor to be considered for international Humira sales is the impact of Remicade and Enbrel biosimilars 
Another area of focus is the performance of Imbruvica which was added to AbbVie s portfolio following its May 2015 acquisition of Pharmacyclics  Imbruvica has multi billion dollar potential that the company is exploring to expand Imbruvica s label into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases 
The drug recorded strong sales and share gains in the second quarter  a trend we expect to continue 
AbbVie is positioning Imbruvica as a  pipeline in a molecule     a treatment that is currently used in a wide range of studies  Imbruvica is partnered with Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ    which recorded third quarter Imbruvica sales of  349 million 
Other drugs like Duopa and Creon should also do well in the quarter to be reported 
However  Abbvie s Hepatitis C virus  HCV  treatment  Viekira  will continue to be impacted by the addition of liver injury warnings to the labels of AbbVie s HCV treatments as well as new competition in the market 
What Our Model Indicates
Our proven model shows that AbbVie is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients 
Positive Zacks ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  0 83   This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise 
Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks of  1   2 and  3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  The Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
The combination of ABbVie s Zacks Rank  3 and  0 83  ESP makes us confident in looking for an earnings beat in the upcoming release 
Other Stocks to Consider
Some other stocks in the large cap healthcare sector that have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are 
Amgen Inc    NASDAQ AMGN    which is scheduled to report results on Oct 27  The company has an Earnings ESP of  1 08  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see 
Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   with an Earnings ESP of  2 54  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is scheduled to release results on Oct 25

151203,372719,AMGN,Here s Why Amgen  AMGN  Stock Slid Over 10  Today,opinion,"On Friday  shares of therapeutics company Amgen Inc    NASDAQ AMGN   are sliding  down over 10  in afternoon trading after the company  its third quarter earnings results 
Earnings per share came in at  3 02  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 79 and increasing 11  year over year Total revenues gained 2  to  5 81 billion  beating our consensus estimate of  5 74 billion by 1 2  
However  lower sales of its established product brands like Epogen  Aranesp  Neulasta  Neupogen  and especially Enbrel  have hit shares of AMGN hard  Sales of Enbrel  used to treat moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis and moderate to severe plaque psoriasis  were flat when compared to the year ago period  And  Amgen said it expects sales of the drug will see only minimal net price growth in 2017 
Amgen has depended on its legacy products for many years now Enbrel  Neulasta  and the rest of the above mentioned treatments make up  15 billion of the company s  22 8 billion total revenue this year but this reliance is now become a thorn in its side  according to   who cite Leerink s Geoffrey Porges and Bradley Canino  The analysts believe this slowdown in growth will affect AMGN stock  and it  is likely to come under pressure from both negative estimate revisions and multiple compression  
Looking ahead  Amgen management raised its full year 2016 earnings range  as well as the lower end of its revenue guidance  The company now expects earnings of  11 40 to  11 55 per share  and revenue of  22 6 billion to  22 8 billion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and sales stand at  11 34 per share and  22 74 billion  respectively

Drug Stocks to Consider as Biosimilars Pick Up Pace

	Interest in biosimilars has picked up considerably with Pfizer  Inc  s  NYSE      announcement this week regarding its plans to launch a biosimilar version of Johnson   Johnson s blockbuster drug  Remicade  in late November 

What are Biosimilars 

	A biosimilar is a biologic product whose approval is based on evidence that it is highly similar to an approved biologic  known as the reference product  Moreover  there should be no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar and the reference product where safety and effectiveness is concerned 
	While biosimilars have been available in the EU for quite a while  they are a new entrant in the U S  where a regulatory pathway was implemented recently 
	Sandoz  a Novartis AG  NYSE      company  was the first to gain approval for and launch a biosimilar in the U S  The company launched Zarxio  filgrastim sndz   a biosimilar version of Amgen Inc  s  NASDAQ      Neupogen last year 
	The second biosimilar to gain approval in the U S  was Pfizer and Celltrion s Inflectra  infliximab dyyb  with the reference product being Remicade 
	This was followed by the FDA approval of biotech giant Amgen s Amjevita  adalimumab atto   Amjevita is approved for use in all eligible indications of the reference product  Humira  adalimumab   which is used for a wide range of inflammatory diseases Biosimilars Set to Change the Competitive Landscape
	The market for biosimilars is huge and highly lucrative  Several blockbuster biologics including Humira and Lantus will lose patent protection by 2020  Biosimilars are expected to reduce healthcare costs and provide a large number of patients with access to much needed biologic treatments  According to new research released by the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics earlier this year  increasing acceptance of biosimilars across different therapeutic areas plus an active pipeline of 56 candidates are expected to lead to total savings of about  110 billion to health systems across Europe and the U S  through 2020 
	The report further says that by 2020  biosimilars will start competing with biologics that currently have annual sales of  50 billion  About 30 companies are developing biosimilars of 16 molecules   most of the biosimilars in development are for reference products like Remicade  Enbrel  etanercept   Rituxan  rituximab  and Humira  adalimumab  What about Formulary Coverage 
	Biosimilars are also gaining acceptance across formularies  CVS Health  NYSE CVS  announced that biosimilars and follow on biologics will be a key part of its 2017 standard formulary strategy  replacing higher cost drugs within the categories  The company said that its formulary list will include Zarxio  replacing Neupogen  to decrease the risk of infection in patients receiving treatment for certain forms of cancer  and the follow on product Basaglar  replacing Lantus  for the treatment of diabetes 

	Meanwhile  UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH  will be moving Basaglar from Tier 3 to Tier 1 effective Apr 1  2017  Basaglar is expected to enter the market in mid December  Sanofi s Lantus SoloStar and Lantus Vials will remain on Tier 3 untilMar 31  2017 after which they will be excluded  Zarxio will be on Tier 2  Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts said that the basal insulins category may be reassessed later in the year to reflect anticipated product launches Stocks to Consider
	With biosimilars picking up pace  it makes sense to zero in on companies that are in the biosimilars business  Here is a mix of pharma  generic and biotech stocks that should benefit from the biosimilars opportunity especially given the current scenario of increased political  media and public pressure on drug pricing  the growing interest in developing biosimilars and the potential of biosimilars to reduce healthcare costs 
	Sandoz  a Novartis company  has a strong presence in the biosimilars market being the first to launch a biosimilar  Omnitrope  in the EU way back in 2006  in Japan  Somatropin BS S C   2009  as well as in the U S   Zarxio  2015   Earlier this year  Sandoz announced that it will launch 5 biosimilars of major cancer and immunology biologics in key geographies by 2020  Some of the biosimilars that Sandoz is working on include biosimilar versions of Enbrel  Humira  Neulasta  Remicade and Rituxan   these biologics generated global sales of approximately  43 6 billion in 2015  Novartis is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock 

   

Pfizer   also has a strong presence in the biosimilars market  The acquisition of Hospira significantly expanded Pfizer s biosimilar capabilities and gave the company access to Hospira s lucrative biosimilar portfolio of both marketed and pipeline assets  The company has three marketed products in Europe and several programs including four in late stage development  Rituxan  Humira  Herceptin  and Avastin   The Zacks Rank  3 stock will be launching Inflectra in late November and has decided to price it at a 15  discount to the current wholesaler acquisition cost of Remicade 

   

Merck   Co   Inc   NYSE      has an agreement with Samsung  KS 005930  Bioepis for the development and commercialization of multiple biosimilar candidates in certain partnered territories  Earlier this year  Merck announced the filing of a Biologics License Application  BLA  for SB2  infliximab   a biosimilar version of Remicade  Moreover  Merck recently launched a website to provide clarity on and increase awareness about biosimilars  Merck is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock  You can see   

   

	Cambridge  MA based Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc   NASDAQ      is a biotech company with a focus in three areas   complex generics  biosimilars and novel drugs for autoimmune diseases  The most advanced biosimilars in the company s pipeline include M923  reference drug  Humira  and M834  reference drug  Orencia   The Zacks Rank  3 stock has a collaboration agreement with Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  for the development  manufacture and commercialization of six biosimilar candidates including M834 

   

	Although Amgen itself is a major target of biosimilar competition  the company has been quick to recognize the commercial potential of the biosimilars market and has already made significant progress in this field with quite a few late stage biosimilar candidates in its pipeline  Last month  Amgen got FDA approval for its biosimilar version of AbbVie s multi billion dollar drug  Humira  The Zacks Rank  3 stock is developing biosimilar versions of Avastin  Herceptin  Rituxan  and Remicade as well

151268,372784,AMGN,J J  JNJ  Likely To Beat Earnings Estimates In Q3 Again,opinion,"Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ    the bellwether of healthcare companies  is scheduled to report third quarter 2016 results on Oct 18  before the opening bell  Last quarter  the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 4 19  
J J has consistently surpassed earnings expectations  The company s earnings beat expectations in each of the last four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 2 88   Will J J be able to beat estimates this time as well 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise  For the third quarter of 2016  our proven model shows that J J is again likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients  Positive Zacks ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  4 88   This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the shares  Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  and  3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings However  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions  The combination of J J s Zacks Rank  3 and  4 88  ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this season 
JOHNSON   JOHNS Price and EPS Surprise   Will the Pharma Segment Continue to Drive Results 
J J s Pharmaceutical segment has been performing well and should continue the same this quarter as well on the back of strong sales of new products as well as core growth products  Robust market growth and increased share should boost sales of Simponi and Stelara  Imbruvica should benefit from increased patient uptake  New cancer treatment  Darzalex  has been off to an encouraging start in the U S  It gained EU approval in May 2016  which should further add to the drug s sales 
Xarelto and Invokana Invokamet should keep up their performance thanks to growth in prescription share  Invega Sustenna should also benefit due to strong sales 
However  Olysio sales will keep declining due to increased competition while Invega continues to face a decline in sales due to generic competition J J continues to assume no biosimilar competition for Procrit or Remicade in the U S  even though the FDA approved a Remicade biosimilar  Inflectra  earlier this April  The company also does not expect generic competition for Zytiga  Risperdal Consta  and Invega Sustenna this year 
The Medical Device business will continue to be affected by soft global market conditions and pricing challenges  The company is working on driving growth in this segment through new product launches and by transforming its commercial models 
Meanwhile  the Consumer business is slowly recovering from the impact of the manufacturing issues that had affected this segment 
The company has been quite active on the deal making front  In Sep 2016  J J announced its intention to acquire Abbott Laboratories    NYSE ABT   Abbott Medical Optics for  4 325 billion in cash  With this proposed acquisition  J J is looking to strengthen its eye care segment  The acquisition is slated to close in the first quarter of 2017 
In Jul 2016  J J acquired privately held company Vogue International in a deal worth  3 3 billion in cash  The acquisition is expected to strengthen its position in hair care and contribute to the profitability of the company s Consumer business 
J J s share buyback program  worth up to  10 billion  should boost the bottom line  Currency movement and operations in Venezuela will remain headwinds 
Stocks That Warrant a Look
J J is not the only company looking up this earnings season  Here are a couple of health care stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Amgen Inc    NASDAQ AMGN   is expected to report third quarter results on Oct 26  It has an Earnings ESP of  1 79  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  
Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   has an Earnings ESP of  7 81  and a Zacks Rank  3  It is scheduled to report third quarter results on Oct 27

151269,372785,AMGN,ETFs To Play As Biotech Juggles Election   Earnings ,opinion,Biotech stocks had a tumultuous ride in the first half of 2016  Though the sector bounced back in July and recovered half of the losses  the rally fizzled again in late September due to worries over the upcoming election This is especially true as iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF   which tracks the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index  shed 8 3  over the past one month compared with losses of 3 4  for the broad healthcare fund  XLV  and 0 5  for the broad market fund  SPY  NYSE SPY    The presidential debate so far has confirmed Clinton s lead in the race  The  after the second presidential debate showed Clinton leading Trump by 9 points  read    Inside The SlideThreats of a Hillary Clinton White House have eroded confidence in the sector as she has promised to curb the fast rising prices of specialized drug treatments and has called for increased regulatory scrutiny that will likely pressure profits margins of biotech and drug companies  Just a year ago  Clinton s tweet on  price gouging  led to a blood bath in biotech stocks and eroded about  40 billion in market value in a single trading day Several other factors have added to the weakness  The most notable among them is genomic sequencing company Illumina s slashing of its third quarter revenue guidance last week and its warning of a revenue miss  This news sent its share price down more than 25  in just one day  leading to sell off in the biotech sector Stable OutlookThe steep decline has made biotech stocks cheaper given that IBB is down 21 2  in the year to date time frame  Additionally  the Q3 earnings outlook seems decent for healthcare  which is one of the eight sectors expecting growth  The sector is expected to post 2 7  earnings growth on 7 4  higher revenues  as per the  report  see    Further  investors continue to pour money into biotech ETFs despite the recent weakness  In fact  IBB pulled in over  248 million in capital over the past one month  This suggests that investors still have an appetite for biotech stocks and ETFs  Moreover  the med biomed gene industry has a solid Zacks Rank in the top 41   suggesting that the industry could outperform in the months to come How to Play Given a good earnings trend and uncertainty surrounding the election  biotech will likely see choppy trading in the near term  Investors could capitalize this opportune moment and could play the quick moves with ETFs Trade ElectionClinton maintains her lead over Trump ahead of the third presidential debate to be held on October 19  as per number of   A recent ABC News Washington Post poll showed Clinton ahead of Trump by four percentage points while NBC News Wall Street Journal survey found Clinton s lead much wider at 11   As a result  investors could easily tap this trend with the help of inverse ETFs   Direxion Daily S P Biotech Bear 1x Shares This ETF provides inverse exposure to the performance of the S P Biotechnology Select Industry Index  It has attracted  6 million in AUM and trades in paltry volume of about 1 000 shares on average  Expense ratio comes in at 0 45   The fund added 6 6  over

79 4 million in its asset base and trades in a solid volume of more than 316 000 shares per day on average  BIS gained 18 2  over the past one month Direxion Daily S P Biotech Bear 3x Shares Investors having a more bearish view and higher risk appetite could find LABD interesting  This product provides three times  3x  inverse exposure to the S P Biotechnology Select Industry Index  It charges an annual fee of 95 bps and trades in volume of more than 2 4 million shares  The fund has accumulated AUM of  89 4 million and gained 22  in the same period  read    ProShares UltraPro Short Nasdaq

151331,372847,AMGN,As Humira Alternative Gets FDA Approval  Is Abbvie In Trouble ,opinion,"On Friday  the  to a Humira  adalimumab  alternative called Amjevita  adalimumab atto    Amjevita is one of nine programs in Amgen s   NASDAQ AMGN   pipeline of biosimilar drugs   Biosimilars are a relatively new frontier in the biotech space  and Amjevita is just the fourth one to receive FDA approval 
Biosimilars are not the same as interchangeable products such as generic drugs   Rather  a biosimilar is a biological product that gets approved if it is shown to be highly similar to an already approved product   This means that there should not be meaningful differences in clinical studies that measure the drug s safety  purity  and potency 
Humira vs  Amjevita
In the years following Humira s approval in 2002  the FDA has expanded the number of conditions that it can be used to treat   Now that Amjevita has been given the green light by the FDA  it can be used for most of the conditions which Humira treats   Amjevita is approved to treat multiple conditions afflicting adults  such as moderate to severely active rheumatoid arthritis  active psoriatic arthritis  active ankylosing spondylitis  moderate to severely active Crohn s disease  moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis  and moderate to severe plaque psoriasis   Amjevita is also approved to treat moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients who are four years of age and older 
Is Abbvie   NYSE ABBV   in Trouble 
Biosimilars are supposed to cost less than the original product which they are based off of  but there is no clear indication of how much Amjevita will cost when it is launched   On the other hand  Humira often costs about  2000 per month   Amjevita is expected to be a cheaper option than Humira  so Abbvie could see some of its dominant share in the arthritis market contract when Amgen s new drug is launched 
This could be a major concern for Abbvie  who saw Humira revenues account for over  14 billion of its total sales   22 8 billion  in 2015   Humira is ABBV s top product  and revenues generated from the drug are close to ten times higher than any of the company s other products   In the first six months of fiscal 2016  Humira generated 62 3  of Abbvie s total sales   Since Friday s announcement of Amjevita s approval  Abbvie s stock has dropped by about 1 3  
Bottom Line
Since a direct competitor is set to take on Humira in the future  Abbvie s long term cash flows will become more difficult to forecast   If you are invested in ABBV for the long run  you may want to reassess your position as more news comes out about when and how much Amjevita will cost 
Amgen looks poised to take advantage of the biosimilars market that has emerged in recent history   As mentioned earlier  the company has nine biosimilar programs in its pipeline   If you are looking to cap in on this technology which is meant to reduce drug costs for patients  then Amgen looks like a solid stock to bet on over the long run

151332,372848,AMGN,Top Trade Ideas For The Week September 26  2016  Bonus Idea,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   moved higher out of a 2011 consolidation rising for more than 3 years before running out of steam  The move increased the stock by more than 240  from a low of 50 to over 170  Since December 2014 the stock price has done nothing  Or at least that is how it appears 
When an Andrews  Pitchfork is applied a different story emerges  With this view the stock has settled at the Lower Median Line and started riding it higher again  The run higher from the late June low had it moving toward the Median Line and it seems to have bogged down between the two for now  This shows a positive trend higher 
Looking left into 2015 sees the current pause is coming at prior resistance  With a touch there in August it had a shallow pullback and then jumped back last week  A push through would give a target to 200 
The momentum indicators support more movement higher too  The RSI is bullish and rising while the MACD is turning back up  avoided a cross down  It has resistance above at 177 and then just free air above  Support lower comes at 167 and 164 before 152 and 145  Short interest is low at 1 1  and the company is expected to report earnings next October 27th  The stock currently pays a  4 00 dividend  a 2 29  yield 
Options open interest in between now and that report show a bias to the upside  The October 28 Expiry options show light open interest  November options show an upward bias but also light open interest  In January 2017 the picture is mixed 
Amgen

Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 177 with a stop at 167 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock on a move over 177 and add a October 28 Expiry 175 165 Put Spread   3 00  for protection and sell a November 180 Covered Call   3 00  for a free Collar 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the November 165 175 180 Call Spread Risk Reversal  20 cent credit

151371,372887,AMGN,Top Trade Ideas For The Week Of August 29  2016  Amgen,opinion,"Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  has had a long term trend sideways in a broad range since late 2014  In the intermediate term it broke to a higher range at the end of July and has been consolidating in the short term in a narrow range since then  That consolidation is occurring at the top of the broad long term range  The spike down in late 2015 touched a 38 2  retracement of the long move higher from 2011 
As it spins its wheels there  the RSI is pulling back in the bullish zone while the MACD is rising and positive  Notice that the recent consolidation started when the price hit the upper Bollinger Bands   After two years of sideways grind  is it ready to move higher again 
There is resistance at 176 and then nothing to stop it  Support comes lower at 170 and 165 before 150  Short interest is low at 1 1   It does carry a big 2 33  dividend yield  but just went ex dividend August 15th 
Options chains show open interest spread this week from 165 to 175 on the put side and then from 170 to 180 on the call side  The monthly September options chain shows open interest spread on the put side at 160  170 and 175  On the call side it is tighter and large  from 175 to 182 50 
October monthly options show a long tail building from 120 to biggest open interest at 170 on the put side  while the call side again is more focused and big  from 170 to 180  Finally looking at January 2017 chains  the first beyond the next earnings report October 27th  shows a distribution with a peak at 145 on the put side and 170 on the call side  No big bets to move out of the range 
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 177 with a stop at 168 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the September October 175 Call Calendar   2 30  
Trade Idea 3  Buy the September January 175 Call Calendar   7 70  
The first trade gives the upside with a stop that takes effect should it fall below the current flag  The second looks for the open interest in September to hold it near 175 until then and allows upside participation after  The third trade is similar to the second but allows for a sale of calls in October  November and December as well to lower the cost of a longer term trade 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday  Heading into the unofficial last week of summer ahead of the Labor Day holiday the equity markets are tired  consolidating at their highs and even pulling back 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue lower while crude oil extends to the upside  The US Dollar Index looks to continue higher short term in its broad range while US Treasuries are biased lower in consolidation  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are both looking like they will continue lower in the short run  more damaging for the Emerging Markets than the Chinese 
Volatility looks to remain subdued but back at more normal levels  keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETFs SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts have lost all their strength though and suggest they may continue to pause or pullback in the short run

151428,372944,AMGN,Celgene  CELG  Q2 Earnings  Can The Stock Pull A Surprise ,opinion,"Celgene Corporation   NASDAQ CELG   is scheduled to report second quarter 2016 results on Jul 28  before the market opens  Last quarter  the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 12 38  
Celgene s track record has been mixed with the company beating earnings estimates on two occasions while missing in one and posting in line results in another  Overall  the company has delivered an average positive surprise of 3 29   Let s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter 
Will Strong Product Sales Continue to Drive Q2 Results 
At the time of reporting first quarter 2016 results  Celgene raised the low end of its 2016 guidance range for both earnings and revenues with the company s products performing well  The company anticipates earnings in the range of  5 60  5 70 per share  old guidance   5 50  5 70 per share   Net product sales for 2016 are expected in the range of  10 75  11 0 billion  old guidance   10 5  11 0 billion  
Key drug  Revlimid  should continue to remain the main growth driver in the second quarter as well  Increases in duration of use and market share gains in the U S   and ongoing global launches in the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma indication should continue to be an important driver of growth and help the drug contribute significantly to the top line  Reimbursement across EU and Japan should further support revenues  For 2016  Revlimid sales are anticipated to be approximately  6 7 billion  at the high end of the previous guidance of  6 6  6 7 billion 
Meanwhile  Celgene continues to expect Pomalyst Imnovid and Otezla to generate sales greater than  1 billion in 2016  Pomalyst Imnovid growth should continue to be strong in 2016 on the back of the first full year of product sales in Japan and increase in duration of treatment along with market share gains across the world  On the first quarter call  the company noted that Pomalyst Imnovid holds a strong global position in relapsed refractory myeloma 
Commercialization of Otezla  on the other hand  continues to be encouraging with physician and consumer campaigns driving increases in brand awareness and patient requests for the drug  particularly in the U S  On the first quarter call  the company mentioned that Otezla continues to lead all other therapies in new to brand share  with approximately 40  of both the psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis markets  The company is also working on expanding its footprint in the EU by gaining reimbursement for the drug 
However  the company had lowered Abraxane s outlook for 2016  Abraxane sales are expected in the range of  950 million to  1 billion  previous guidance  greater than  1 billion  due to a highly competitive U S  market for lung and breast cancer therapy 
Meanwhile  Celgene s share buyback program should boost the bottom line 
On the second quarter call  investor focus is expected to remain on the company s performance and label expansion efforts along with pipeline updates 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Celgene is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here  as elaborated below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Celgene is 0 00  since the Most Accurate estimate stands in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 25 
Zacks Rank  Celgene carries a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with an ESP of 0 00   makes surprise prediction difficult Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions CELGENE CORP Price and EPS Surprise   Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are a few health care stocks that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Amgen Inc    NASDAQ AMGN   has an Earnings ESP of  1 10  and a Zacks Rank  3  It is scheduled to report second quarter results on Jul 27 
United Therapeutics Corporation   NASDAQ UTHR   has an Earnings ESP of  2 51  and a Zacks Rank  3  It is scheduled to report second quarter results on Jul 28

151429,372945,AMGN,Bristol Myers  BMY   Stock To Beat Earnings Again In Q2,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   is scheduled to report second quarter 2016 results on Jul 28  before the opening bell  Last quarter  the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 12 12  Bristol Myers has been seen to consistently beat earnings expectations  The company s earnings surpassed expectations in each of the last four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 27 67   Will Bristol Myers be able to beat estimates this time around as well  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors Driving Q2 ResultsBristol Myers  high profile immuno oncology drug  Opdivo  continues to demonstrate strong performance across three tumors  It is the most prescribed drug for new patients in lung cancer  The renal cell carcinoma indication has also seen strong early adoption  In the melanoma indication  robust performance of the Opdivo Yervoy  Yervoy is Bristol Myers  other immuno oncology drug  regimen is contributing to growth in both Opdivo and Yervoy Opdivo should continue to contribute to top line growth on the back of continued approvals and label expansions globally  Pricing and reimbursement in additional EU countries should further aid revenues  Other oncology drugs like Sprycel should also continue to perform well in the second quarter of 2016  Meanwhile  multiple myeloma drug  Empliciti  has been off to an encouraging start in the U S  It gained EU approval during the second quarter  May 2016  Apart from cancer drugs  anticoagulant Eliquis  performance should continue to accelerate growth across the key markets globally where its uptake has been strong across cardiology  hospitals  and in the community setting  Eliquis is well on its way to become the number one novel anticoagulant globally  The rheumatoid arthritis drug  Orencia  also contributes significantly to the company s top line With key products performing well  Bristol Myers raised both its 2016 earnings and revenue guidance driven by strong trends across the business at the time of announcing first quarter 2016 results  For 2016  the company expects earnings in the range of  2 50 to  2 60 per share  old guidance   2 30 to  2 40 per share   On the other hand  Bristol Myers expects worldwide revenues to increase in the low double digit range in 2016  Previously  the company had guided worldwide revenues to increase in the mid single digit range However  the company expects the HIV and HCV franchises to remain under competitive pressure for the remainder of the year During the second quarter  Bristol Myers continued to actively build its partnership portfolio by striking a couple of immuno oncology focused collaborations 
On the second quarter call  investor focus is expected to remain on the company s performance and updated possible revision in the guidance along with an update on business development activities 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
For the second quarter of 2016  our proven model also shows that Bristol Myers is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Positive Zacks ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  1 49   This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the shares 
Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Note that stocks with a Zacks Ranks  1   2  Buy  or  3  Hold  have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  However  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
The combination of Bristol Myers  Zacks Rank  1 and  1 49  ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this season BRISTOL MYERS Price and EPS Surprise   Other Stocks That Warrant a Look
Bristol Myers is not the only company looking up this earnings season  Here are some other health care stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

151447,372963,AMGN,Amgen And Daiichi Sankyo Team Up For Biosimilars In Japan,opinion,"Amgen Inc    NASDAQ AMGN   announced an exclusive agreement with Daiichi Sankyo Company  Limited for the commercialization of nine biosimilars in Japan including biosimilars of AbbVie s   NYSE ABBV   Humira and Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG s   OTC RHHBY   Avastin and Herceptin 
The deal with Daiichi Sankyo will see Amgen taking responsibility for the development and manufacturing of the biosimilars  While Daiichi Sankyo will file for marketing approval and will also be responsible for the distribution and commercialization in Japan  Amgen will have a limited right to co promote the products  However  Amgen will hold all additional distribution and commercialization rights for the biosimilar programs outside Japan  Specific financial terms of the agreement were undisclosed 
We note that the FDA s Arthritis Advisory Committee has voted in favor of an approval of Amgen s ABP 501  a biosimilar version of Humira  The recommendation did not come as a surprise given the favorable briefing documents that were released by the FDA ahead of the panel meeting  The advisory panel s opinion will now be reviewed by the FDA  with a final response on the approval status of ABP 501 expected by Sep 25 AMGEN INC Price   The approval of ABP 501 would be a huge boost for Amgen considering the commercial potential of Humira and the fact that Amgen itself is facing biosimilar competition for a few of its key products  like Neupogen   However  patents covering Humira should protect the drug from competition through at least 2022 
Biosimilar threats facing Amgen have gotten more intense with the FDA s Arthritis Advisory panel backing Sandoz s biosimilar version of Amgen s blockbuster drug  Enbrel  Sandoz is Novartis AG s   NYSE NVS   generic arm

151454,372970,AMGN,Gilead  GILD  Stock Likely To Beat This Earnings Season,opinion,"Gilead Sciences Inc    NASDAQ GILD   is scheduled to report second quarter 2016 results on Jul 25  after the market closes  Last quarter  the company had missed expectations with a negative earnings surprise of 1 65  
Gilead otherwise has an impressive track record  with earnings  The company s earnings surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 6 39   Will this biotech major be able to beat estimates this time  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors Likely to Impact Q2 Results
In the first quarter of 2016  Gilead s hepatitis C virus  HCV  franchise  consisting of blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni  registered both sequential  12 2   and year over year  5 6   decline  The year over year decline was mainly due to lower sales of Harvoni in the U S   down 53 3  year over year to  1 4 billion   reflecting lower patient starts and the full quarter impact of higher commercial rebates  which were entered into during the first quarter of 2015 
The sequential decline was primarily due to lower revenues in the U S  and Japan  However  Sovaldi had recorded growth in the first quarter of 2016  Performance of the HCV franchise was also disappointing in Europe 
Nevertheless  Gilead noted on the first quarter call that there was an uptick in new patients in the first quarter of 2016 and the company expects new patient starts to remain consistent through 2016  The company expects its HCV business to remain strong and sustainable 
Good news came in for the HCV franchise during second quarter 2016  Gilead was successful in its efforts to expand its HCV franchise  Late last month  the company gained FDA approval for Epclusa  the first all oral  pan genotypic  single tablet regimen for the treatment of adults with genotype 1 6 chronic HCV  It is also approved for use in certain other patient populations  Subsequently  Epclusa gained EU approval earlier this month 
As far as the HIV business is concerned  Genvoya  the company s first tenofovir alafenamide  TAF  based single tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV 1 infection uptake  has been strong both in the U S  and EU since the drug s launch in Nov 2015  Genvoya may soon be among the most prescribed products for patients new to treatment 
While Descovy was launched both in the U S  and EU during the quarter  Odefsey gained approval in the EU  Both Descovy and Odefsey are the two other TAF based regimens in the company s HIV franchise  TAF based regimens are expected to drive the HIV franchise s sales 
Given the launch of these TAF based regimens  the company expects switches out of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate  TDF  based single tablet regimens into the TAF regimens to grow significantly  The company at the same time believes it can maintain its ability to retain switch patients  implying fewer patients to switch from Gilead s TDF containing regimens to non Gilead products   The company noted on the first quarter call that 82  of Genvoya s prescriptions came from switches while 49  of the switches have come from Stribild  another HIV 1 drug belonging to Gilead  
Other antivirals and products are expected to perform well  For 2016  Gilead continues to expect net product sales in the range of  30  31 billion 
Meanwhile  Gilead is actively pursuing partnerships acquisitions to strengthen its product portfolio as well as pipeline  During the quarter  the company acquired Nimbus Apollo  Inc  and its acetyl CoA carboxylase inhibitor program in a deal worth up to  1 2 billion 
On the second quarter call  investors should keep an eye on the guidance based on the company s performance while deals acquisitions are also something to look out for 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise For the second quarter of 2016  our proven model also shows that Gilead is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients Positive Zacks ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  6 91   This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the shares Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks of  1  Strong Buy    2 and  3  Hold  have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  However  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
The combination of Gilead s Zacks Rank  2 and  6 91  ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this season GILEAD SCIENCES Price and EPS Surprise   Other Stocks That Warrant a Look

We remind investors that Kyprolis became a part of Amgen s portfolio following its acquisition of Onyx  The drug has registered total sales of  512 million in 2015  Kyprolis  label expansion would expand the patient population and increase its commercial potential significantly

151509,373025,AMGN,Novartis  NVS  Announces Positive Results On Migraine Drug,opinion,"Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   reported positive first results from the global phase II study  20120295 on pipeline candidate  AMG 334  erenumab  
The study evaluated AMG 334 at two doses  70mg and 140mg  administered subcutaneously once a month for the treatment of chronic migraine 
The data from the randomized  12 week  double blind  placebo controlled study showed that treatment with the candidate resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the number of monthly migraine days compared with placebo  Overall  patients had a mean baseline of 18 migraine days per month  The data also showed that safety and tolerability profile of AMG 334 was similar to placebo in both treatment groups 
We remind investors that Novartis is developing AMG334 in collaboration with Amgen  Inc    NASDAQ AMGN    As part of the agreement  Amgen owns commercialization rights in the U S   Canada and Japan  while Novartis has rights in Europe and rest of world  Both companies entered into a global collaboration agreement in 2015 to commercialize and develop pioneering neuroscience treatments for Alzheimer s and migraine 
Novartis is also planning to assess the benefit of AMG 334 in two ongoing phase III studies in episodic migraine  Initial data from the studies are expected later in 2016 
Approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing ones bode well for Novartis as it has been facing stiff generic competition for some of its key drugs like Diovan and Gleevec  This apart  its oncology drugs are facing competition from immuno oncology therapies  Moreover  its Alcon segment is witnessing a decline in surgical equipment sales in the U S  and emerging markets

A final decision regarding the approval status of ABP 501 is expected by Sep 25  2016  It is also under review in the EU 
Humira  an anti TNF   monoclonal antibody  is approved in many countries for the treatment of a wide range of inflammatory diseases  The drug recorded worldwide sales of  14 billion in 2015 and was one of the top selling products in the U S  in 2014 
Currently  Amgen has nine biosimilar candidates in its portfolio representing annual revenues of more than  3 billion  The company plans to launch its first biosimilar in 2017 followed by four others through 2019  subject to approval 
We note that Amgen itself is facing biosimilar competition in the U S  Zarxio  the first FDA approved biosimilar  was launched by Novartis AG s   NYSE NVS   generic arm  Sandoz  in Sep 2015  Zarxio is the biosimilar version of Amgen s blockbuster drug  Neupogen  A couple of key drugs from Amgen s portfolio   Neulasta and Enbrel   could also start facing biosimilar competition soon

151512,373028,AMGN,Xencor Stock Up On Cancer Drugs Partnership With Novartis,opinion,"Shares of Xencor  Inc    NASDAQ XNCR   rallied 32 06  after the company announced that it has entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Swiss major  Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   
Terms of the Agreement
As per the agreement terms  the companies will collaborate to develop and commercialize two pipeline candidates   XmAb14045  expected to enter clinical development for acute myeloid leukemia in 2016  and XmAb13676  to enter clinical development for B cell malignancies in 2016   The companies will share the cost of the development of the candidates  While Xencor will retain commercialization rights in the U S   Novartis will own the marketing rights in the rest of the world 
Additionally  Novartis will receive worldwide rights to Xencor s bispecific technology to develop and commercialize four targets  These targets will be selected by Novartis and Xencor may elect to co detail one of these targets in the U S  Novartis will also receive a worldwide non exclusive license to use Xencor s XmAb Fc technologies in up to 10 molecules 
Financial Details of the Transaction
Novartis will pay an upfront fee of  150 million to Xencor along with potential milestone payments totalling up to  2 41 billion  as and when milestones are achieved   Xencor is also entitled to low double digit royalties on potential sales of XmAb14045 and XmAb13676 outside the U S  mid single digit tiered royalties on global sales of the four proprietary Novartis bi specific molecules  subject to conditions  and low single digit royalties on Novartis molecules incorporating Xencor s XmAb Fc technology 
Our Take
The deal is a major positive for the clinical stage biopharmaceutical company Xencor both strategically and financially  Not only the agreement provides Xencor with the much needed funds through the upfront fee along with potential milestone payments  the company also gets to own the commercialization rights for the drugs upon approval in the U S

3 Drug Stocks Reporting Earnings Next Week

As the first quarter 2016 earnings season is well under way  results have not been as disappointing as widely apprehended  Are   

With several pharma and major biotech companies having already reported their earnings results  the spotlight shifts to the Medical sector  which is anticipated to be one of the seven sectors to record earnings growth  Earnings in the Medical sector are expected to grow 2 3  on revenue growth of 9 1  from the year ago period  per our  report 

Beats and Misses So Far

Several biotech stocks including Amgen Inc     NASDAQ AMGN    and pharma stocks like Johnson   Johnson    NYSE JNJ     Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT   and Bristol Myers Squibb Company  NYSE BMY  have not only managed to beat earnings estimates  but some among these have also raised their outlook for the year  There were misses as well 

Though label expansion and cost cutting initiatives were catalysts to growth  unfavorable currency movements and macroeconomic factors held back performances 

Eli Lilly and Company  NYSE LLY  raised its outlook for the year despite an earnings miss while Glaxo expects core earnings growth of 10 12  at constant exchange rate in 2016 

Meanwhile  a number of pharma and biotech companies are yet to report first quarter results  Let s see what awaits these three major drug stocks when they report on May 3  before the opening bell  Investors interested in the Medical sector will be keenly watching for beats and misses 

What to Expect from These Drug Stocks 

New York based Pfizer Inc     NYSE PFE    was recently in the news when it terminated its  160 billion deal to combine with Botox maker Allergan  NYSE AGN pa  plc  Focus will now be on the company s cash utilization plans  Meanwhile  the company continues to face headwinds in the form of genericization  unfavorable currency movement including the impact of the Venezuelan financial crisis and the expiration of a few co promotion agreements  However  its share buyback program should boost the bottom line  However  its share buyback program should boost the bottom line

Generic drug maker  Mylan N V  s    NASDAQ MYL    Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of the ESP  but it also has an ESP of  2 67   making a surprise prediction difficult  Mylan s track record has however been decent with the company surpassing expectations in two of the last four quarters 
	Though the company s Generics and Specialty segments should perform well in the first quarter  pricing dynamics that existed throughout 2015 would also continue in 2016  Mylan anticipates first quarter earnings to be relatively flat with the year ago period  Considering that Mylan is set to acquire a leading international specialty pharmaceutical company  Meda  focus will be on the deal  read more     

Specialty pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products manufacturer  Mallinckrodt plc s     NYSE MNK    track record has been pretty good with the company consistently beating earnings estimates  However  Mallinckrodt s Zacks Rank  4  Sell  which when combined with an ESP of  1 74  makes it difficult to predict an earnings beat when it reports its second quarter fiscal 2016 results 

Though the company will benefit from the Sep 2015 Therakos acquisition  this is the first full quarter in which Therakos will contribute to results   seasonality is expected to continue in fiscal 2016  which will hurt gross profit  read more

151628,373144,AMGN,Amgen  Looking For More Upside,opinion,"Big pharma companies are known as defensive plays when the market is unsteady  but they have been cruising along with the rest of healthcare the last few years  One that has had a rough 2015  moving sideways until the August and September swoons  is Amgen Inc  O AMGN   After moving in a channel for the first 7 months of 2015  it broke out to the upside to start August  That break out didn t even last a week  though  and followed into a rout to the downside 
From the spike to the bottom in September  the stock had dropped over 25   Since then it has rebounded and has been consolidating under 165 as resistance for 2 months  with tightening support  An ascending triangle  The chart below shows this action as price presses against 165  A break over the top would give a target from 180 to 195 depending on how aggressive you want to be about that triangle 

Both targets sound pretty good  Maybe too good for the short run  Looking left there is that prior channel with a top at 173  But even a move to 173 and a stall there is good for 6  in short order  You can sit and watch for the break out to join in and see how far it goes  Another way to participate would be to use options  With the stock set to report earnings January 26  using the January 22 expiry options chain is a good place to look for a possible run up into earnings 
The structure is then dependent upon your options knowledge and risk tolerance  A straight January 22 Expiry 165 Call for about  3 00 is a defined risk way to participate  For less cost sell the January 22 Expiry 172 5 Calls for about 65 cents  shaving about 20  of your cost but capping the return at the prior channel top  An aggressive trade could also sell the January 22 Expiry 155 Puts for about  1 30  This adds risk of being assigned the stock at 155  but there has been good support at that level

151630,373146,AMGN,ABBV  A Cheap Dividend Aristocrat Yielding Over 4 ,opinion,"AbbVie Inc  NYSE ABBV  is one of the more controversial  for several reasons  As a relatively new spin off  2013   the company has a much shorter dividend growth track record than traditional aristocrats 
The bigger challenge  however  is AbbVie s profit drivers  Most dividend aristocrats possess the characters we desire when   They have entrenched market positions  compete in slow changing industries  and generate cash flow from many different products and industries 
In AbbVie s case  over half of its business is concentrated in one product  While this can work for some companies that have powerful brands  e g  Clorox or Coca Cola   it s a risk in AbbVie s market of branded pharmaceutical drugs and makes the stock less desirable for  
However  the stock s safe 4 1  dividend yield  relatively cheap forward earnings multiple of 11 1  and above average earnings growth prospects over the next few years make it worth a closer look Business OverviewAbbVie was spun off from Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT  on January 1  2013  as a standalone biopharmaceutical company  Approximately 61  of the company s revenue comes from sales of Humira  a drug that treats arthritis  Some of its other major drugs are Imbruvica  which treats leukemia  and Viekira  which treats hepatitis C  The company reported nearly  23 billion in sales last year and sells its drugs in over 170 countries Business AnalysisThe branded pharmaceuticals industry has extremely high barriers to entry and offers potential for juicy profit margins   AbbVie generated a 33  operating margin last year and targets a 50  margin by 2020  Major pharma players invest billions of dollars and years of time in research and development to commercialize breakthrough drugs 
While the success rate is low  a successful drug can generate billions in profits that are protected for many years as a result of the intellectual property owned by the manufacturer  As seen below  AbbVie s primary markets combine to reach nearly  200 billion in size  providing the company with many different opportunities for growth 
Source  AbbVie Investor Presentation
AbbVie s management team expects the company to reach  37 billion in sales by 2020  which would represent more than a 60  increase from 2015 s revenue level  Of this total  roughly half of total sales would come from the company s arthritis drug Humira  and another 13 5  would come from sales of leukemia drug Imbruvica 
AbbVie also expects to launch over 20 new products by 2020 to reach to its goals and believes that its current pipeline has potential to achieve revenues of nearly  30 billion by 2024  As growth continues  operating margins are expected to expand by 100 200 basis points per year to drive double digit earnings growth 
The company s success will hinge on the success of its drug pipeline and its ability to protect cash flows from Humira for as long as possible from biosimilar competitors AbbVie s Key RisksWe prefer to invest in pharmaceuticals that have diversified streams of income from their drugs  It s very hard for a complete outsider to forecast the timing and profitability of a company s drug pipeline  so finding businesses with enough diversification helps reduce this risk 
Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  is a great example  While pharmaceuticals drive over half of the company s profits  it is well diversified by drug and gets reliable cash flows from its consumer products and medical devices segments  The flop of any one drug will not endanger the business 
On the other hand  AbbVie is much more concentrated  Sales of Humira accounted for over 60  of sales last year and are expected to represent nearly 50  of revenue by 2020 as well  AbbVie s composition of matter patents for Humira expire in the U S  and Europe in December 2016 and October 2018  respectively 
However  the company hopes that it can litigate against biosimilar manufacturers of Humira for at least four or five years based on industry norms and its non composition of matter patents  These patents covers area such as manufacturing and formulation and do not begin to expire until 2022 
The company obviously hopes to use these patents to litigate against new biosimilar competition for Humira  and it was successful earlier this year in defending against a patent review case filed by Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  last year  If successful  AbbVie believes it can maintain strong profitability in the U S  through 2022  but there is plenty of skepticism surrounding the matter 
Regardless of the ultimate timing  branded drugs cannot maintain their high profit margins forever  As patents expire  lower cost competition emerges with knock offs that quickly erode sales and margins  If new drugs have not been successful in the pipeline  earnings can erode very quickly 
This is a key point of controversy surrounding the stock  While management believes Humira sales can exceed  18 billion in 2020  some analysts see Humira revenue coming up at least 30  short of management s ambitions  AbbVie s forecast assumes that biosimilar versions of Humira will stay out of the U S  until 2022  whereas some analysts see competition emerging in 2019 
In addition to the risk posed by Humira s large contribution to company profits  the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  can also pose unexpected challenges  For example  during one week in October 2015  AbbVie s stock fell by more than 10  after the FDA warned that AbbVie s Viekira treatment caused liver injury to a small number of patients 
You just never know what might crop up any given week as it relates to new competition  unexpected developments in the drug pipeline  litigation  or other issues with existing treatments  For these reasons  we generally prefer to invest elsewhere in the market Dividend Analysis  AbbVieWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
For the time being  AbbVie s dividend payment is extremely safe  The company received a Dividend Safety Score of 78  which is excellent and places it in the top quartile of dividend paying stocks 
AbbVie s free cash flow payout ratio over the last 12 months is a healthy 49   which is roughly in line with the company s payout ratios realized since it was spun off in 2013  Given AbbVie s strong outlook over the next few years for continued growth  we think its payout ratio is very healthy for the time being Source  Simply Safe Dividends
In addition to its healthy payout ratio  AbbVie has generated sales growth in each of the last five years  We don t have data that goes back to the last recession  but pharma companies are generally recession resistant because consumers still need to treat their illnesses regardless of how the economy is doing  The bigger risk to sales cyclicality is patent expirations of major drugs such as Humira  AbbVie needs to develop new drugs that can eventually replace those sales or else it could see a steep revenue decline that could endanger the dividend Source  Simply Safe Dividends
As we mentioned earlier  pharma manufacturers generate excellent free cash flow when they successfully commercial a major drug  Years of research and development spending has already been realized  so the company gets to enjoy healthy profits  AbbVie has generated nice free cash flow in each of the last six years  which has provided plenty of cushion to keep paying and growing the dividend Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Few businesses can generate operating margins in the teens  much less in the 30  range like AbbVie has done  Management expects margins to hit 50  by 2020  highlighting the extreme profitability enjoyed by pharma companies  High returns allow companies to compound their earnings faster and are usually a sign of competitive advantage  intellectual property and drug development expertise  in this case  Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Some investors have expressed concern about AbbVie s balance sheet  At first glance  the company s  31 7 billion debt burden  largely resulting from AbbVie s  21 billion acquisition of Pharmacyclics in 2015  does raise some eyebrows 
However  AbbVie could cover all of its debt using the  8 4 billion it has in cash and about 3 1 years  worth of earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT   which is reasonably healthy  Standard   Poor s and Morningstar have given the company A and A  credit ratings  respectively  We would like to see AbbVie reduce its debt over the next few years while it is generating strong free cash flow from Humira  If Humira s revenue unexpectedly shrinks over the next five years  the balance sheet could become strained Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Overall  AbbVie s dividend looks very safe at the moment  The company has a healthy payout ratio  generates plenty of free cash flow  and is enjoying double digit earnings growth 
However  the trajectory that Humira s revenue takes beyond the next few years  coupled with developments in AbbVie s drug pipeline  will significantly impact the safety of the dividend from 2020 and beyond Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
AbbVie s Dividend Growth score of 89 is excellent  The company last increased its dividend by 12  in October 2015 and is included on the dividend aristocrats list despite being spun off at the start of 2013  when it continued its dividend growth streak as an independent business 
Abbott Laboratories  which spun off AbbVie  has a dividend growth streak of more than 40 consecutive years and is the reason why AbbVie is considered a dividend aristocrat  With that said  AbbVie has increased its dividend by 42  since 2013 with increases each year 
We believe AbbVie will continue recording at least a high single dividend growth rate for the next few years  Growth will be fueled by the company s reasonable free cash flow payout ratio of 49  and strong business fundamentals as drug sales and margins are expected to increase significantly through 2020 
The main wild card impacting future dividend growth beyond the next few years is the rise of Humira competition  which could come as early as 2019 or as late as 2022  We will re evaluate AbbVie s dividend growth potential as that time draws nearer ValuationABBV s stock trades at 11 1x forward earnings estimates and has a dividend yield of 4 1   For a stock with above average growth prospects over the next few years  it appears to be very reasonably priced 
The seemingly low expectations attached to the stock are a reflection of investors  concerns about AbbVie s concentration in its Humira drug  which is set to experience competition in the U S  market sometime over the next three to six years  With its European patent set to expire in 2018 as well  growth in international markets could also slow 
However  Evercore ISI s analyst Mark Schoenebaum estimated that AbbVie s 2020 guidance for sales and margins implies adjusted earnings per share of approximately  8 80  He applied a 16x P E ratio to his estimate of 2020 earnings and discounted it back to 2015 using a 9  discount rate  The stock price resulting from his analysis was about  100 per share  which is nearly 100  higher than AbbVie s most recent closing price 
With expectations for double digit earnings growth through 2020  AbbVie s total return potential certainly looks attractive at first glance  However  dividend investors must be willing to accept the higher uncertainty surrounding the company s cash flows beyond 2020 ConclusionWhile the market s expectations seem to bake in a good amount of caution today  it s still hard to get comfortable with AbbVie s competitive landscape over the next five years  The key issue is how long the company s Humira drug can profit in the U S  before biosimilar competition emerges  The difference of just a few years could really make or break the stock s performance over the coming years 
Unfortunately  we don t have an edge when it comes to analyzing this risk  nor do we have a comfortable method of evaluating AbbVie s large pipeline of new drugs that will launch over the next five years  The stock looks set to be a big winner if it delivers on management s 2020 goals  it trades for less than 7x implied 2020 earnings per share today   but we would ultimately prefer to stick with other blue chip dividend stocks that offer greater profit diversification and a slower pace of industry change ",2016-03-02,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/abbv:-a-cheap-dividend-aristocrat-yielding-over-4-200120181,200120181

Can Johnson   Johnson s diversified business model and solid financial position help it dodge the rough market conditions and for how long  This Johnson   Johnson analysis article examines the efforts the management is making to fuel more growth in the future and the risks that the company could run into that could potentially change the direction of its business  But first  here is a quick recap of last quarter s earnings 
4Q2015 highlight
Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  posted 4Q2015 EPS of  1 44  up 5 1  YoY and ahead of the consensus estimate of  1 42  But revenue reading of  17 8 billion disappointed  Revenue fell 2 4  YoY and missed the consensus estimate of  17 9 billion  Negative forex movement and pricing pressures in some markets took a heavy toll on the topline metric 
Segmentally  Pharmaceutical segment sales rose 0 8  YoY to  8 1 billion and Medical Devices sales fell 3 3  to come in at  6 4 billion  Consumer segment sales declined 7 9  to come in at  3 3 billion 
The chart below captures Johnson   Johnson s segmental revenue contribution 

2016 guidance
Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  is looking for 2016 EPS in the band of  6 43 to  6 58  Revenue is modeled in the range of  70 8 to  71 5 billion 
What s exciting about Johnson   Johnson 
Rich pipeline 
Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  has a rich portfolio of new drug candidates and candidates for label extension  Between 2015 and 2019  the management of Johnson   Johnson outlined plans to seek marketing approval of more than 10 new products  The management further emphasized that all of those new products have blockbuster potential 
Since 2009 until 2015  Johnson   Johnson had launched 14 new products  More than half of those products have already reached blockbuster status are have blockbuster potential 
To squeeze more money from its existing portfolio and also guard against generic threat  Johnson   Johnson is looking to for label extension opportunities  At least 40 drugs already launched or soon to be launched are candidates for label extension 
Growth themed deals
Johnson   Johnson boasts a well oiled R D department  which explains its solid portfolio of internally developed products  but the company leaves nothing to chance when it comes to pursuing new growth opportunities  The company has inked a number of growth focused deals including two acquisitions that particularly strengthen its play in the advanced prostate cancer market 
Acquisition of Cougar Biotechnology added to Johnson   Johnson s prostate cancer portfolio portfolio by bringing in Zytiga to the mix  Zytiga is approved for prostate cancer treatment and generated  2 2 billion in sales in 2015  An additional approval of Zytiga for chemona ve prostate cancer victims nearly tripled its addressable market 
The acquisition of Aragon also added a key prostate cancer drug candidate to Johnson   Johnson s pipeline  JNJ 927  the drug compound that Johnson   Johnson acquired through Aragon  is in Phase 3 development and is targeting pre metastatic prostate cancer  CRPC  market 
Johnson   Johnson could use JNJ 927 as a defensive product in the prostate cancer market when Zytiga s marketing exclusivity expires 
Besides outright acquisition deals  Johnson   Johnson is also fond of pairing efforts with strategic partners  The company is working with Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ ACHN  to develop a treatment for hepatitis C 
Solid new products launch record
Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  has recently launched a number of new drug products that are quickly gaining blockbuster status  The company s recent new launches include Stelara and Simponi  These products are not only doing well on the market  but comparison tests have shown them to be more effective than rival therapies from other companies  For example  Stelara beat Amgen  Inc   NASDAQ NASDAQ AMGN  s Enbrel in a measure of effectiveness on patients afflicted by plaque psoriasis 
To strike while the iron is still hot  Johnson   Johnson is working to expand the treatment mandate of these drugs by testing them for other indications  As for Simponi  the drug recently received EU approval for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
Zytiga  which raked in  2 2 billion in sales last year  has also had its label expanded to include treatment of chemona ve prostate cancer  The label expansion significantly widened the drug s patient population 
Attention on emerging markets
Every multinational pharmaceutical company these days has some plans for the emerging and developing markets and Johnson   Johnson is no exception  The reason emerging markets have become attractive in the recent times is the increased emphasis on healthcare access with insurance overage expanding to cover more population  The widening healthcare market in the emerging economies is seeing Johnson   Johnson double down in markets such as India  China and Brazil 
Huge addressable market
A huge growth opportunity lies ahead for Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  in the pharmaceutical segment  Predictions by IMS Health show that the global pharmaceutical market will increase at compound annual growth rate of about 3  from 2014 to 2019  The market was worth more than  1 trillion at the end of 2014 
What s worrying about Johnson   Johnson 
Generic threat
A number of Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  s key drugs are set to lose their marketing exclusivity  thus getting exposed to generic competition  For example  Remicade is already battling competition from copycats called biosimilars in the EU market  Invega is another product struggling to overcome generic competition  In the U S   patents for Zytiga and Xarelto are being challenged 
Although only a small number of Johnson   Johnson s blockbuster products are facing generic threat or might soon face generic competition  the fact that they are large revenue contributor means that Johnson   Johnson s revenue flow could be greatly hampered 
Negative forex movement
Johnson   Johnson has a significant portion of its operations abroad  which means massive exposure to unfavorable currency movements  A stronger U S  dollar is offsetting Johnson   Johnson s gains abroad as international sales are worth less when converted to the reporting currency which is USD 
Slowdown in China
Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  s consumer business is facing growing pressure in China  Demand in the market has slowed down as economic cold spreads and a rise of new rivals is also limiting the sale of Johnson   Johnson s consumer products 
Pipeline disappointment
Johnson   Johnson invests huge amounts of money and time to develop a drug  but the company also has a history of failed drug developments  A number of its candidates have failed to secure regulatory approval at the last minute  In some other cases the company has been forced to terminate work on certain candidates  As much as the management is optimistic that they will launch 10 new products in the next five years  there is no guarantee all of the candidates it will be seeking regulatory approval for will be cleared  Failure to get a product that has cost so much money to develop usually comes as a major setback and Johnson   Johnson is prone to that risk with its ambitious rollout plan for the next five years 
Label warning
After a box warning was added to the label of Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  s Procrit  sales of the drug contracted nearly 14  to just  1 1 billion in 2015  Label warning ensures increased safety for users of a particular product  but it hurt sales like in the sale of Procrit  There is no knowing which of Johnson   Johnson s existing products  especially blockbusters  could fall victim to negative label edit 
Takeaway
Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  s new product launches have been a huge success and its growth streak could accelerate if the coming launches also become success ",2016-04-11,InvestCorrectly,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-should-you-handle-johnson---johnson-(nyse:jnj)-200124702,200124702

Wall Street started the session on a high note  but could not hold it  Stocks slipped into the close and the Nasdaq turned red for the day  The stakes couldn t be higher for the Friday morning s August employment report  even though the month has typically been cursed by disappointment  The consensus guesstimate calls for about 215 000 to 220 000 new jobs created in August  with the unemployment rate holding at 5 3   but August is notorious for misses  From 2005 to 2014  forecasters have over estimated the initial August payrolls print seven times  including in each of the past four years 
What s more  the Labor Department  excluding annual and benchmark revisions  has marked up its first estimate in subsequent months in eight of the past 10 years  Part of the puzzle of forecasting August payrolls is the difficulty in adjusting for annual changes in the school year calendar  Financial market turmoil  at least  probably did little to impact hiring decisions in August  The government surveys households and businesses in the week that contains the 12th of the month  so the data will reflect responses covering the Aug  9 15 period  that was a few days before the market rollercoaster ride began 
Short dated Treasury debt yields  which are tied most closely to monetary policy forecasts  rose in August  with the two year note yield logging its fifth straight monthly increase  That was its longest winning streak since 2006 when the Fed last raised interest rates  Long dated Treasury yields  often seen as a safe haven from stock market volatility  are virtually unchanged on the year  suggesting that bond investors are brushing off the panic about slowing global growth  This would suggest that bond traders are bracing for an imminent rate hike 
The European Central Bank will continue its 60 billion euro a month asset purchase plan  that s the Euro version of QE  The stimulus is intended to help get consumer price inflation back toward the ECB s target of just below 2   In the year to August  it stood at 0 2   ECB President Mario Draghi today said it could go negative in the coming months following recent oil price falls  Draghi said   The risks to the euro area growth outlook remain on the downside   And if things actually do get worse  Draghi emphasized he is willing to do even more  The euro dropped against the dollar and Eurozone stock markets enjoyed a nice bounce 
Chinese markets are closed today and tomorrow to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II  The holiday is officially called  The 70th Anniversary of Victories in the Chinese people s War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Against Fascism   and right there we have a glimpse into the problems in China  Presiding over the extravaganza  President Xi Jinping said China would remain committed to  the path of peaceful development  and unexpectedly pledged to slash 300 000 troops from the country s 2 3 million strong military  The announcement came before a huge military parade  At the same time  the U S  government reported that five Chinese Navy ships were sailing in international waters off Alaska for the first time 
Treasury Secretary Jack Lew criticized China s handling of its currency devaluation  In a CNBC interview  Lew said   there s an economic and a political reality to things like exchange rates   and  how they manage their exchange rate is a matter of great concern to us and that they need to be willing to let market forces drive the value up  not just drive it down   Lew  will be participating in a meeting of G 20 financial ministers and central bankers Friday in Turkey  The treasury secretary s remarks come ahead of the Chinese premier s visit to the U S  later this month 
Tomorrow brings the big monthly jobs report for August  This will be the data that the Fed will use at their FOMC meeting September 16   17  the question is whether the report will be weak enough to keep the Fed from hiking rates or strong enough to allow a hike 
Also tomorrow  the G 20 will be meeting in Turkey  The International Monetary Fund has prepared a report for G20 finance chiefs  and the IMF says the turmoil in China and other factors like capital flow reversals were increasing the risks to economic growth around the world  It warned that advanced and emerging economies need to continue to support demand with reforms and investment to ensure that the turbulence in markets and China s troubles do not stall economic activity in the rest of the world 
The report expressed continued confidence that growth is picking up  modestly  in advanced economies in the second half of 2015 and in 2016  helped by the impact of cheaper oil  But the oil price plunge  along with other commodities  is hurting emerging market economies  and they are also being buffeted by the impact on their currencies of China s yuan devaluation and the strong dollar  The dollar s strength  the Fund warned  could take a toll on companies with dollar liabilities  The Fund highlighted an increase in risks to overall global growth  that China would not confront its slowdown with growth supporting policies  that commodity prices would slide further  that the US dollar would continue to rise  and that companies would suffer from higher debts 
Of course  writing a report doesn t make it so  The reality on the ground is that gauging China s economy is a guessing game  the Chinese simply don t measure their economy in familiar ways and they certainly run their economy a bit differently  And most analysis overlooks the fact that China s economy is changing  the service sector is now the driver of growth  so it makes sense that industrial growth is slowing down  but it doesn t necessarily mean the economy has gone over a cliff  Beijing s economic policy makers know that even though structural overhauls will moderate growth in the near term  they ll also bolster long term growth and help stave off a major deceleration

151661,373177,AMGN,S P 500 Earnings Outlook  Sell Healthcare  Buy Energy ,opinion,"By next Friday  October 2nd  2015  readers will know what the September  15 jobs report looked like  and what the new  forward 4 quarter  estimate is for the S P 500 
Primarily because of the nature of capitalism  and expense control  there is typically an upward bias to S P 500 earnings estimates and cash flow over long periods of time  That pattern plays out quarterly as well  as each quarter  beginning the first day of January  April  July and October  sees a quarterly bump to the S P 500 forward estimate typically between  3  5 per share 
2015 has been a tougher scenario for earnings estimates watchers  given the 50  60  quarterly decline in Energy earnings  but with the October 1  15 print  expect the  forward 4 quarter  estimate to reach  125  127 per share 
From a bigger picture perspective  here are the current bottom up estimates for the S P 500 as of 9 25 15 
2014  actual    118 78
2015  est    118 44
2016  est    130 80
2015 will likely be a positive year for earnings growth  given that Q4  15 will see very easy comps for the Energy sector and the US dollar  However  1  3  S P 500 earnings growth isn t much to get excited about  This could explain why the S P 500 is flat this year 
2016 earnings growth remains the question but  minimum  mid single digit  S P 500 earnings growth in 2016 
Analysis   conclusion  Healthcare and Biotech had a brutal week this past week  with many names trading near their 8 24 lows and Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  trading below its 8 24 lows  while Energy  despite the negative sentiment and bad news around Brazil and China  looks to be trading better 
As discussed here  Energy and the US dollar start to lap much easier comps starting October 1  15  That could start to make a difference in forward estimates and guidance for Energy  Industrials  and   depending on China exposure   even Basic Materials 
During 2014 s August   September 10  correction  the S P 500 bottomed in early October  14 and   despite the collapse in crude oil   had a decent Q4  14 return 
Energy  like Financials in 2015  could be a sector to hold in 2016  if only from a  less risk  perspective  The sector might show tepid earnings growth in 2016  but it is hard to fathom how any quarter in 2016 could be worse than the 55    60  y y Energy earnings declines we saw in 2015 ",2015-09-26,Brian Gilmartin,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/sp-500-earnings-update:-sell-health-care,-buy-energy--266242",266242

151684,373200,AMGN,MannKind Corporation Disappoints With Afrezza Sales,opinion,"By Sarah Roden
MannKind Corporation  NASDAQ MNKD  reported first quarter 2015 results on May 7  revealing underwhelming sales and a mediocre Afrezza launch  Shares of MannKind last closed at  4 02  just above the 52 week low of  3 52  Some analysts are beginning to doubt if the company can make a comeback 
The biotechnology company posted a net loss per share of   0 08   slightly narrower loss than the consensus of   0 09  and an improvement from   0 14  in the same quarter of last year  MannKind did not provide a revenue figure but the analyst consensus for quarterly revenue was  6 29 million 
The focus of the earnings report was Afrezza  a rapid acting inhalable insulin for adults with diabetes produced by both MannKind and Sanofi  PARIS SASY   Though Afrezza is just beginning its commercial launch  Sanofi s recent quarterly earnings revealed that the inhalable insulin only brought in  1 1 million in the first quarter far below the analyst estimate of  3 million to  4 million  MannKind anticipated the weak sales were due to the low number of prescriptions  However  MannKind executive chairman Alfred Mann pointed out that Sanofi s reported revenue for Afrezza  really covered only a portion of the quarter  since the launch only started in February  
Mann acknowledged that Afrezza s launch  may be getting off to a slower start  than anticipated  but MannKind expects to see an acceleration in sales  Mann added that  the potential diabetes market is enormous and Afrezza will fill a substantial need   Analysts and executives pointed to the positive response from people with diabetes who have used Afrezza 
Now  MannKind owes  12 4 million as its portion of the loss arrangement with Sanofi  MannKind financed the loss under Sanofi s loan facility and there is  15 4 million outstanding under the loan facility 
According to   analyst  of Piper Jaffray maintained a Neutral rating on MannKind on May 8 and lowered his price target from  7 00 to  3 50  Though MannKind revealed that Afrezza s launch fell below expectations  Schimmer pointed out that  Afrezza is well received by patients who are able to get it  but access is a limiting step   Schimmer commented    MannKind  is optimistic that measures to improve access and initiating therapy without hassle will lead to an acceleration of uptake and that deploying its technology for new pipeline programs will create value  which will be needed for shares to stabilize and or appreciate   However  the analyst is lowering his price target due to concerns regarding MannKind s  financial position increase  On average  the top analyst consensus for MannKind on is Hold Joshua Schimmer has rated MannKind 7 times since January 2010  though he has only given Sell and Hold ratings  Schimmer has earned a 50  success rate recommending the stock with a  8 1  average return when measured over a three month period  Schimmer has rated many biotechnology stocks in the past such as Amgen Inc  NASDAQ AMGN  and Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD

151708,373224,AMGN,3 Pharma Stocks That Soared Past Pfizer In 2014,opinion,"Pfizer Inc  NYSE PFE   one of the most well known large cap pharma companies in the world  had a challenging year with its top line remaining under pressure and not too many updates on the regulatory pipeline front 

Although Pfizer s earnings track record was better than expected in the last three quarters  the top line remains under pressure with several erstwhile blockbuster drugs facing generic competition 

The company ended 2014 with yet another blockbuster drug  Celebrex  losing patent protection  The impact of Celebrex generics  which entered the market in Dec 2014  will be felt in the upcoming quarters  Alliance revenues are also under pressure with the expiry of certain agreements including one withAmgen Inc  NASDAQ AMGN  for Enbrel 

Meanwhile  significant pipeline or regulatory updates were missing last year  Apart from label expansions and approval of vaccines like Trumenba  a key update was the FDA s decision to grant priority review to the company s new drug application for its experimental cancer treatment  Ibrance  palbociclib  

Pfizer was also in the news last year due to its attempt to acquire Astrazeneca Plc  NYSE AZN   Although AstraZeneca made it clear it was not interested in Pfizer s offer  rumors regarding acquisition talks surfaced again later in 2014  While the AstraZeneca deal did not happen  Pfizer did complete a few small acquisitions and entered into collaboration agreements mainly targeting immuno oncology  a key focus area for pharma and biotech companies 

A Look at Some Pharma Stocks That Fared Better than Pfizer

With Pfizer gaining just 5 88  in 2014  here s a look at some peers that fared better in 2014 and look well positioned this year 

Indianapolis based Eli Lilly and Company  NYSE LLY   which has been facing headwinds in the form of generic competition and pricing pressure  looks positioned to return to earnings growth in 2015  The Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  which saw its shares gain 40 51  in 2014  surpassed earnings expectations in two of the last three quarters and is also slated to report better than expected earnings in the fourth quarter 

Even though Lilly will be facing several headwinds this year    including foreign exchange  products like Cialis  Forteo  Strattera and Effient  the diabetes franchise  and the ex U S  animal health segment    should perform well  New products    Cyramza  Trulicity and Jardiance    should also do well  2015 will be eventful on the pipeline and regulatory front as well with several phase III data readouts and multiple regulatory actions expected 

UK based AstraZeneca  a Zacks Rank  3 stock  is another company that fared better than Pfizer in 2014  The company s track record was pretty decent with earnings surpassing expectations in two of the last three quarters  AstraZeneca was up 25 23  last year  Apart from being in the news related to Pfizer s interest in acquiring the company  AstraZeneca also gained approval for quite a few products last year and provided positive pipeline updates  The company s immuno oncology pipeline also looks interesting 

Swiss pharma company Novartis N  NYSE NVS   a Zacks Rank  3 stock with a strong presence in the oncology and ophthalmology markets  gained 21 68  in 2014  The company  which is facing generic competition for quite a few products  is working on reorganizing its portfolio so that it can focus on core therapeutic areas  Novartis has a deep pipeline and is also progressing with the development of biosimilars especially its biosimilar version of Amgen s Neupogen  Its experimental heart failure treatment  LCZ696  also represents huge commercial potential ",2015-01-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-pharma-stocks-that-soared-past-pfizer-in-2014-238007,238007

151733,373249,AMGN,Energy Sector Rains On Bulls  Parade  But Skies May Clear Soon,opinion,"Stocks have needed a reason to take a breather and pull back in this long standing ultra bullish climate  with strong economic data and seasonality providing impressive tailwinds    and plummeting oil prices certainly have given it to them  But this minor pullback was fully expected and indeed desirable for market health  The future remains bright for the U S  economy and corporate profits despite the collapse in oil  and now the overbought technical condition has been relieved  While most sectors are gathering fundamental support and our sector rotation model remains bullish  the Energy sector looks fundamentally weak and continues to rank at the bottom of our forward looking sector rankings 
In this weekly update  I give my view of the current market environment  offer a technical analysis of the S P 500 chart  review our weekly fundamentals based SectorCast rankings of the ten U S  business sectors  and then offer up some actionable trading ideas  including a sector rotation strategy using ETFs and an enhanced version using top ranked stocks from the top ranked sectors 
Market overview 
The fear of broader fallout from issues like Ebola  ISIS  Russian aggression  European malaise  and slowdown in China had subsided  so the market has been waiting for next big worry to spike the fear gauge and cause a selloff to test support levels  The Dow Industrials suffered its biggest weekly percentage loss in three years  After all  it is hard to break out to new highs when bullish conviction has not been recently tested and reconfirmed  Well  it found its next big worry in the fall of oil prices and all that it might be foretelling  such as defaults in the high yield bond segment of the Financial sector and recession in global economies 
Crude oil fell another 3  on Friday to 5 year lows and 46  below the June highs after the International Energy Agency cut its outlook for 2015  and it expects prices to fall further  Tremendous increases in domestic production through enhanced recovery techniques and the prospect of energy independence in the U S   which once was considered an impossibility  has led to a global glut  but OPEC has decided not to reduce production  The U S  dollar has gained 77  year to date against the Russian ruble 
As a result  Energy sector investments are likely dead money for the near term  although the downside might be less onerous  Moreover  those investors who sought to leverage the easy money of high oil prices and enhanced production through the high yield market are no concerned more about their return OF capital rather than a return ON capital  Any surge in defaults could be a game changer  but for the moment it appears that prices will remain above the profitability thresholds  Eventually  the search for higher returns through risk assets will shift away from leveraged plays and back to unleveraged investments like Technology and Industrial stocks  and that will be bullish for the broader markets 
To be sure  the Fed s monetary policies of zero interest rates and quant easing gave the U S  economy of tremendous boost  but now the economy has its own momentum that can t be stopped with anything the Fed might have in store  As it stands  leading economic indicators are strong  GDP forecasts are being raised  job growth is the strongest since the  90s  and corporate profits sit at all time highs 
But there is no denying the cautious behavior of investors at the moment  The US 10 Year Treasury bond yield closed Friday at 2 09  as capital flowed out of equities  Its 52 week range is 1 86 3 06  The CBOE Volatility Index  a k a  fear gauge  closed at 21 08 on Friday after reaching as high as 23 06 intraday  This is still well below the October highs that spiked above 30  Also  year to date  the Healthcare and Utilities sectors  which are traditionally defensive or all weather  are the clear leaders  And then there is the condition of Europe s economy and the imminent expiration of the ECB s long term refinancing operations  which will result in a whole bunch of assets rolling off balance sheet just when it needs to expand it 
All of this warrants a degree of caution  In addition  keep in mind that this is an option expiration week  and a lack of put open interest could result in delta hedge selling that exacerbates the downside in equities and spike in VIX 
Nevertheless  2015 seems to be shaping up to indicate more of what has worked this year  i e   owning large cap equities  particularly the NASDAQ 100   longer term bonds  and a flattening yield curve   and the U S  dollar 
But simply buying a portfolio of stocks you like probably is not the right strategy  Rather  a thoughtful approach to creating a diversified portfolio of high potential stocks is more appropriate  For example  Sabrient s annual Baker s Dozen portfolio employs a  quantamental  approach that starts with a GARP  Growth At Reasonable Price  quantitative model and then applies a fundamental overlay  including a forensic accounting review by our subsidiary Gradient Analytics to help avoid the landmines among stocks with strong apparent growth prospects but poor earnings quality and sustainability  The portfolio is completing its sixth straight year  since inception in 2009  of  
SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  SPY  closed Friday at 200 89  which is  3 6  below its all time highs from the previous Friday  This is the minor  but still significant  pullback that I projected  which is allowing the severely overbought technical condition to cycle back down to oversold  test support levels  and reconfirm bullish conviction  Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic appear have a little further to go to the downside  but could begin a reversal at any time  I think the 50 day simple moving average will provide good support this week and the market will stabilize  Otherwise  additional levels of strong support should come from the 100 day SMA at 199  the bottom of the bullish rising channel approaching 198  and the 200 day SMA around 195 

The Russell 2000 small cap index held up much better than the large caps on Friday  which is bullish for the market at this point  and in fact it might find support from the lower line of 1 month sideways channel that appears to be forming  Both the NASDAQ 100 and Composite indexes also held up better than the S P 500 on Friday  Looking at the weak Energy sector  the price chart hardly could be uglier  but the oscillators look more promising  RSI is showing a positive divergence versus the October lows  and MACD and Slow Stochastic easily could bounce strongly from their severely oversold levels 
I am hopeful that this was the minor technical pullback the market needed in order to avoid a more dramatic event in early January 
Latest sector rankings  
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 
Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financials  NYSE IYF   Technology  NYSE IYW   Industrials  NYSE IYJ   Healthcare  NYSE IYH   Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK   Consumer Services  NYSE IYC  Energy  NYSE IYE   Basic Materials  IYM   Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ   and Utilities  NYSE IDU   Whereas the Select Sector SPDR  ARCA SPY  only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 
 Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1  The rankings continue to remain stable  as Technology and Healthcare stay at the top  Technology is in the top spot with a robust Outlook score of 90  Tech stocks display the best return ratios  a good forward long term growth rate  a reasonably good forward P E  and solid support among insiders  buying activity   Healthcare scores a 73 and displays good sell side analyst support  recent upward revisions to earnings estimates   a strong forward long term growth rate  solid insider sentiment  buying activity   and good return ratios  although its forward P E is on the high side  Financial remains in third with a score of 65  and it continues to display one of the best  lowest  forward P Es  Next in the rankings  Industrial has vaulted into fourth with a more attractive forward P E  followed by Utilities and Consumer Goods Staples  a k a   Non cyclicals   Notably  prices for Consumer Services Discretionary  a k a   Cyclicals  have held up well during market weakness on the strength of strong retail sales  but this made it fall in the rankings due to a relative weaker forward P E  but the sector continues to get solid support from both analysts and insiders and boasts the best forward long term growth rate 
2  Price weakness and an improving forward long term growth rate in Basic Materials stocks has allowed its Outlook score to rise  as its forward P E is now much more attractive  But Wall Street analysts  downward earnings revisions in the Energy sector  as oil prices plummet  have kept Energy at the bottom of the rankings  Even the insiders have reduced their buying activity in this beleaguered sector  Joining Energy in the bottom two again is Telecom  which generally scores poorly across the board in most factors in the Outlook model 
3  Looking at the Bull scores  Industrial  Energy  and Basic Materials all come in with the highest score of 58  Telecom scores the lowest at 48  The top bottom spread is only 10 points  reflecting high sector correlations during particularly strong market days  i e   highly correlated risk on action  But it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations and a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold  rather than the all boats lifted in a rising tide  risk on  mentality 
4  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities again displays the highest score of 65 this week  as one would expect for this traditionally defensive sector  Utilities stocks have been the preferred safe havens on weak market days  and it is followed closely by Consumer Goods Staples  Consumer Services Discretionary  and Healthcare  Energy displays the lowest score of 36  followed by Basic Materials  The top bottom spread is a wide 29 points  which continues to reflect low sector correlations on particularly weak market days  In other words  certain sectors are holding up relatively well while others are selling off  Again  it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations and a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 
5  Technology displays the best all around combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  followed closely by Healthcare  while Energy is the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Utilities and Healthcare are the clear leaders  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   Energy is still the worst  indicating general investor avoidance  no surprise here  
6  Overall  this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings still look bullish to me  Downward earnings revisions from Wall Street have subsided  with the exception of Energy  and in fact some sectors are getting increasingly positive revisions  The top four sectors are all economically sensitive  or in the case of Healthcare  all weather   and they also display some of the highest Bull scores  Furthermore  Basic Materials and Consumer Services Discretionary are also scoring fairly well  Keep in mind  the Outlook Rank does not include timing or momentum factors  but rather is a reflection of the fundamental expectations of individual stocks aggregated by sector 
Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or defensive   continues to indicate a bullish bias this week  and it suggests holding Healthcare  Industrial  and  surprise   Basic Materials  in that order  for those portfolios that might be due for rebalance    Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be bullish from a rules based trend following standpoint because SPY is above both its 50 day and 200 day simple moving averages   
Other highly ranked ETFs from the Healthcare  Industrial  and Basic Materials sectors include SPDR   Health Care  ARCA XLV   iShares DJ Transport Average Index  ARCA IYT   and PowerShares Dynamic Basic Mat   NYSE PYZ  
For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists some top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within the top ranked sectors  some long ideas from Healthcare  Industrial  and Basic Materials sectors include Celgene  NASDAQ CELG   Amgen Inc  NASDAQ AMGN   Alaska Air Group  NYSE ALK   United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS   Valspar Corporation  NYSE VAL   and Westlake Chemical  NYSE WLK   All are highly ranked in the Sabrient Ratings Algorithm and also score within the top two quintiles  lowest accounting related risk  of our   a pure accounting based risk assessment signal based on the forensic accounting expertise of our subsidiary Gradient Analytics  We have found EQR quite valuable for helping to avoid performance offsetting meltdowns in our model portfolios 
However  if you prefer to maintain a neutral bias  the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Technology  Healthcare  and Financial  in that order   And if you prefer a defensive stance on the market  the model suggests holding Healthcare  Utilities  and Financial  in that order  
IMPORTANT NOTE  Some readers have been asking for more specifics on how to trade our sector rotation strategy based solely on what I discuss in my weekly newsletter  Thus  I feel compelled to remind you that I post this information each week as a free look inside some of our institutional research and as a source of some trading ideas for your own further investigation  It is not intended to be traded directly as a rules based strategy in a real money portfolio  I am simply showing what a sector rotation model might suggest if a given portfolio was due for a rebalance  and I may or may not update the information each week  There are many ways for a client to trade such a strategy  including monthly or quarterly rebalancing  perhaps with interim adjustments to the bullish neutral defensive bias when warranted    but not necessarily on the days that I happen to post this weekly article  The enhanced strategy seeks higher returns by employing individual stocks  or stock options  that are also highly ranked  but this introduces greater risks and volatility  I do not track performance of the ETF and stock ideas mentioned here as a managed portfolio

151751,373267,AMGN,Solid Q2  14 Earnings So Far  Stock Price Reaction Less So,opinion,"Per Thomson Reuters  the  forward 4 quarter  estimate for the S P 500 this past week was  127 07  exactly the same as the past week 
The P E on the forward estimate remained at 15 5 x   given the flat S P 500  which closed this week at 1 978 34 versus last week s 1978 22 
The PEG ratio remains at 1 76 x  
The S P 500  earnings yield  also remained flat at 6 42  versus last week s 6 42  
But  the year over year  y y  growth rate on the forward estimate rose to 8 85  versus last week s 8 51  
Good news   that forward growth rate is so key  in my opinion  
Analysis   commentary  with a little less than half the S P 500 having reported Q2  14 earnings   229 companies per Thomson   the y y growth rate in Q2  14 earnings is  6 5   or excluding the Citigroup  NYSE C  charge   8 2   Personally  I would have been surprised with 10  earnings growth for Q2  14  but I m surprised we are at 8 2  with half the S P 500 having reported to date  The bulk of earnings will have been reported by mid August  14 or another 3 weeks from now

151752,373268,AMGN,Healthcare Enjoys Growth Trends  3 Medical Stocks To Buy,opinion,"The 2014 Q2 earnings season has been impressive for the Medical sector with 16 1  year over year earnings growth on 12 5  increase in revenues  Also  among the 94  sector participants reported so far  78 7  delivered positive earnings surprises  Favorable industry trends in pharma and biotech primarily contributed to this robust growth 
Impressive Growth Trends in Pharma and Biotech
Pharmaceutical companies have been affected by genericization over the past few years  However  the worst of patent cliff is over and several companies are now on the recovery path 
Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  was the first major company from the drug manufacturing industry to post impressive second quarter earnings  Other major drug manufacturers such as Pfizer Inc  NYSE PFE  and Merck   Company Inc  NYSE MRK  also reported upbeat results 
Earnings growth in biotechnology firms such as Gilead Sciences Inc  NASDAQ GILD  and Amgen Inc  NASDAQ AMGN  became a yardstick for other stocks in the same segment 
The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index is up almost 20 1  in the last year  So far in 2014  the index increased10   As of Aug 11  2014  the Standard   Poor s biotechnology index soared 13 6  since January  compared to the S P 500 s gain of 5 1  
Pharma and bio tech space witnessed a slew of IPOs in the last few quarters  Fifty three pharmaceutical and biotech firms launched IPOs this year  The segment also witnessed a flurry of new deals in therecent months  All these boosted investors  sentiment and thus pushed the stock prices up 
New Drugs   Increased Spending Boost Growth 
Development of new drugs and an increase in healthcare spending also fueled growth of pharma and bio tech stocks 
Throughout the first half of 2014  several important products gained approval by the Food and Drug Administration  FDA   Shares of Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ ACHN  had skyrocketed  gained 83 3   after the FDA lifted the clinical hold on Achillion s lead drug sovaprevir  Merck was also immensely benefitted after the U S  health regulator approved the drug  vorapaxar 
A number of new drugs are also in the pipeline  Many companies have already announced FDA acceptance for filing of New Drug Application  NDA  
Amid all these  the Ebola outbreak is also making headlines  This has brought biotech companies such as Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation  TO TKM  into the spotlight for their experimental Ebola disease treatments 
Meanwhile  Americans are currently in a better position to meet medical costs thanks to the rebound in the U S  economy  This recovery has propelled healthcare spending  According to PricewaterhouseCoopers s  PwC  Health Research Institute  healthcare spending is expected to rise 6 8  in 2015  up from 6 5  increase forecasted for this year 
The Affordable Care Act  ACA   or  Obamacare   also pushed healthcare spending upward  An aging population also significantly contributed to healthcare spending  Most of the baby boomers are expected to turn 65 and older between 2012 and 2030  Further  U S  Census Bureau stated the nation s 65 and older population is anticipated to reach 83 7 million in 2050 
Banking on these encouraging factors along with ever increasing demand in emerging markets  drug manufacturing and biotech companies are poised to grow in the coming quarters

151810,373326,AMGN,Amgen s Dividend Policy Has Ignited Their Stock ,opinion,Founded in 1980  Amgen  AMGN  is the world s largest biotechnology company with a current market cap of just under  68 billion  However  in spite of its already large size  we believe that Amgen has ample room to continue growing their earnings at above average rates into the foreseeable future  Our optimism for future growth is predicated on several factors  First and foremost  Amgen has a strong pipeline of potential blockbuster medicines  many of which are already in Phase III trials  We will highlight some of the major candidates later In addition to a strong pipeline  Amgen is utilizing its strong cash position  cash flow generation capability and its pristine balance sheet towards making strategic acquisitions that will expand its geographic reach and bring additional candidates into its pipeline  On December 10  2012 Amgen announced that they acquired deCODE Genetics  a global leader in human genetics headquartered in Reykjavik  Iceland in an all cash transaction of  415 million On July 5  2012  Amgen announced the completion of the acquisition of KAI Pharmaceuticals  a privately held company based in South San Francisco acquiring candidate KAI 4169  a novel agent for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease who are on dialysis  And on June 12  2012  Amgen announced the completion of the acquisition of Mustafa Nevzat Pharmaceuticals  a privately held Turkish company expanding their reach into promising markets of Turkey and surrounding regions In addition to acquisitions and a strong pipeline  Amgen also recently announced that they will buy back  2 billion in shares as part of a total  10 billion authorized buyback program  Added to these catalysts for growth is Amgen s commitment to intensifying its research and development program under the leadership of new CEO Robert Bradway  Therefore  we believe Amgen is well positioned to continue growing their earnings which we believe is a key component for increasing shareholder value However  in our opinion the major catalyst attributed to its recently improving share price has been the initiation of a dividend in 2011  which is a rarity for biotechnology companies  Furthermore  on January 3  2013  Amgen announced that they will increase their dividend by 31  to   47 per share  Consequently  Amgen s PE ratio has expanded from approximately 11 times earnings prior to the initiation of their dividend to over 13 times earnings today  we see this as the beginning of a longer term trend  Therefore  an increasing earnings base coupled with PE expansion and a rapidly increasing dividend all indicate above average future returns for both the short term to the long term time horizon F A S T  Graphs  Historical Analysis of AmgenAn analysis of Amgen s historical business success utilizing the fundamentals analyzer software tool  F A S T  Graphs   reveals a great deal about Amgen and how the market has treated its operating results  Our first graph plots Amgen s earnings per share growth  the orange line  and dividends only since calendar year 1993  Here we discover that Amgen has been able to consistently grow its earnings at the high rate of 17  per annum  The green shaded area represents cumulative earnings  and the light blue shaded area represents dividends paid out of those earnings  Consequently  the initiation of a dividend policy is vividly expressed  Note  All F A S T  Graphs  include one year of forecasting for 2013  This next graph brings in monthly closing stock prices  the black line  in order to reveal the earnings and price correlation and relationship  There are several important aspects regarding how the market has treated Amgen shares over this two decade history that we believe are very interesting  First we discover that from 1993 to 1998  Amgen s stock price closely tracked and correlated to its earnings justified valuation  the orange line   Then as we entered what was dubbed the irrational exuberant period commencing in 1999  Amgen s share price became disconnected from its earnings  Interestingly  Amgen s stock price remained overvalued until the Great Recession of 2008 brought its shares back to economic reality and then to below intrinsic value From 2008 to 2011  Amgen share price languished in undervalued territory  even though operating results continued their upward trajectory  This quickly changed after they initiated their first dividend  the blue shaded area   Since that time  Amgen s share price has been rapidly moving back towards alignment with its earnings justified value  Consequently  we believe that the dividend is serving as the primary catalyst behind Amgen s strong share price performance in 2011 and 2012  We will calculate and reveal these results later in this analysis Whenever we analyze a business utilizing the dynamic F A S T  Graphs   fundamentals analyzer software tool   we always start with our longest time frame of 20 years  and then continue to run graphs with progressively shorter time periods  This process allows us to ascertain whether a given company s growth rate is accelerating  decelerating or staying the same  Although we believe that the most relevant information will be found within the shorter time frames  we also believe that there is a lot of value in analyzing the company s long term historical results as well With that said  our next graph looks at Amgen since calendar year end 1999  It s important to note that 1999 and 2000 represented the pinnacle of irrational pricing by Mr  Market  Therefore  we discovered that Amgen s stock price was virtually range bound for the better part of seven consecutive years  Excessive valuation kept the stock from advancing even though the company s earnings were growing rather nicely  However  the most important takeaway from graphing this shorter time frame is that Amgen still averaged 14 6  per annum compounded annual earnings growth This next graphic looks at Amgen over the past decade  Here we discover that the company s earnings growth had re accelerated to 16 5   which is very close to its 20 year average of 17   We believe this is a remarkable achievement by what has now become a very large enterprise At this point  we thought it would be interesting to evaluate Amgen s performance since calendar year 2003  Remarkably  even though the company was significantly overvalued at the beginning of 2003  shareholders were able to closely mirror the performance of the S P 500 thanks to the company s strong earnings growth rate overcoming its high valuation  This is true even though we would classify the shares as currently undervalued  In other words  this fast growing company s performance generated a positive rate of return even though the shares are overvalued at the beginning of the time period and undervalued at the end As we continue our process of reviewing shorter and shorter time frames  it is interesting to see how Amgen performed since the throes of the Great Recession of 2008  Amazingly  Amgen was capable of generating an average 11  compounded annual earnings growth rate  However  the most interesting aspect of this time period analysis is that the company s shares were moderately undervalued  thanks to the Great Recession  during most of this time frame  However  share price did trend upwards along with earnings When you evaluate the performance of Amgen when the company s stock price was not impaired with the headwinds of overvaluation  shareholders were able to harvest the company s exceptional earnings growth achievement  Moreover  strong earnings growth coupled with attractive valuation allowed shareholders to earn a very attractive 14  per annum compounded rate of return during a time when the S P 500 s performance was very weak  Thereby illustrating that a strong above average company purchased at a sound valuation can dramatically outperform the averages Our final set of graphics looks at Amgen since the company instituted a dividend policy  Once the dividend was established  the gap between the company s stock price and its earnings justified valuation has been rapidly closing  Moreover  we believe there is still room for Amgen s shares to run over the short to intermediate term based on accelerated earnings growth and the announcement of the 31  increase in the quarterly dividend  We feel it is more than coincidental that Amgen s performance has accelerated to such a great extent after it started paying its dividend  Clearly  as depicted by the performance results and dividend cash flow table below  much of Amgen s significant outperformance can be attributed to undervaluation and strong earnings growth  However  we would argue that now that the company is paying a dividend  it is beginning to broaden its appeal to other sets of potential shareholders  Currently  we contend that Amgen offers attractive valuation  above average potential growth and an above market and rapidly growing dividend  representing a nice kicker to its total return potential The Near and Longer Term FutureWe believe that fair value based on capitalizing earnings at a reasonable 15 PE ratio implies that Amgen s stock is worth approximately  99 a share  Furthermore  we believe there is a high probability that Amgen s PE ratio could easily expand beyond our 15 PE target  But more importantly  we think the recently instituted dividend  representing an above market yield  greatly minimizes downside risk The following estimated earnings and return calculator is based on the consensus five year earnings estimate of 59 analysts reporting to Standard   Poor s Capital IQ  We consider these estimates on the conservative side and somewhat biased towards expectations for calendar year 2013  Longer term  we believe that Amgen has the potential to grow earnings at low to mid double digit rates into the foreseeable future  Amgen s strong pipeline and intensified commitment to research and development  coupled with a pristine balance sheet capable of funding acquisitions and share buybacks supports our thesis for strong future growth Biotech  A Brief IntroductionAmgen is a biotechnology superstar engaging in pioneering science with the potential for delivering vital medicines  According to Amgen  in 1919 Karl Ereky  a Hungarian engineer  coined the term  biotechnology  to describe the interaction of biology and human technology  The biotechnology industry differs from its chemical pharmaceutical counterparts because it is based on living organisms  The pharmaceutical industry has traditionally manufactured drugs which were synthesized from chemical compounds  The biotechnology revolution created a new class of drugs referred to as the biologic Biologics are therapies derived from living organisms and include proteins  DNA vaccines  monoclonal antibodies  peptides and experimental modalities such as gene therapy  stem cell therapy  antisense nucleotides and RNA viruses  At the core  all cells have common processes they perform in order to survive  and biotechnology harnesses these processes to make products to treat illnesses and improve people s health Amgen s Products and PipelineAmgen has built their franchise on the strength of their 10 marketed products  Originally  EPOGEN and NEUPOGEN  their two important blockbuster erythropoiesis stimulating agents  ESAs  generated most of their revenues and profitability  However  they have significantly expanded on this franchise thereby generating significantly greater revenues and profitability  The following slides taken from Amgen presentations summarize the company s view of the future  First and foremost is their commitment to expanding their core business and current product portfolios In addition to expanding their current product portfolios  Amgen has several promising candidates in late stages of development in their pipeline  As we will soon address  developing biologic therapeutic compounds is a very expensive and time consuming process  Commercial success is highest for candidates in Phase 3  As can be seen from the following slide  Amgen has several promising compounds in Phase 3  as well as several that are moving through Phase 2 testing AcquisitionsAmgen s recent acquisitions provide them multiple opportunities for growth and expansion  In addition to enlarging their geographical reach  the company is also acquiring promising candidates and R D capabilities and opportunities Returning Capital to ShareholdersIn the beginning  Amgen was a pure growth stock that required all of their capital to fund their long term growth initiatives  However  in recent years  as the company has grown they are becoming a much more shareholder friendly enterprise  The following corporate slide summarizes Amgen s current commitment to returning capital to shareholders  Their focus on growing the dividend is a significant milestone in the company s maturity and development  Consequently  we believe that Amgen is evolving from a pure growth stock to an above average growth and income investment  Therefore  we believe the company is attractive for investors seeking growth as well as investors seeking current income Amgen s Moats One of Amgen s strongest moats is their size and scale  According to a BIOFACT that they present in their pamphlet  An Introduction to Biotechnology  Amgen states as follows   To bring a new drug to market  from discovery through clinical trials and FDA approval  cost an estimated  1 billion and can take 10 to 15 years or longer  Only one in 10 new drugs that makes it into human testing actually makes it to market  Given this high failure rate and the tremendous cost of bringing a new therapy to market  companies depend on successful drugs to produce enough revenue to compensate for both the R D cost of the successful therapies and the expense of the failed ones   Clearly  Amgen is one of the few companies in the biotechnology industry that is capable of investing the levels of capital and resources necessary to bring a candidate to market  Consequently  many smaller firms are often forced to partner with Amgen because they lack the resources necessary to commercialize their candidates  Advancing Science through Strategic Partnerships  With more than 100 active collaborations  Amgen is well suited to be a partner of choice in the human therapeutics business  With the capabilities and financial strength of a large company  Amgen can offer partners the resources to support a potential new medicine as it advances from lab to clinic to marketplace  At the same time  Amgen retains the agility and decisiveness of a smaller biotech  with an unwavering commitment to science and patients  Furthermore  Amgen has the capabilities to manufacture and distribute compounds that they and partners develop  The following is a brief summary of their manufacturing locations  A Pioneer in Biotechnology Manufacturing Assuring that Amgen medicines rapidly  reliably  and safely reach patients is the charge of Amgen s manufacturing  process development  quality  and distribution teams  Manufacturing therapies based on proteins found in the human body is a complex and highly specialized activity  From process development and clinical manufacturing to full scale therapeutic protein production  Amgen has built one of the industry s largest and most reliable operations  Amgen operates manufacturing facilities in California  Colorado  Rhode Island  Washington  and Puerto Rico   Summary  Amgen s legacy has been that of a fast growing biotechnology growth stock  However  more recently the company is evolving into a high quality blue chip dividend paying growth and income stock  On the other hand  since we are early in this process  the growth attributes of Amgen remain intact  Nevertheless  we believe that its recent posturing as a more shareholder friendly enterprise is serving as a catalyst for the market s desire towards capitalizing Amgen shares at higher valuations going forward  Therefore  the combination of reasonably well defined continued growth  low valuation and more shareholder friendly attitude by management are strong positives auguring well for short and long term profits  Moreover  the company s recent settlement with the US government  49 states and the District of Columbia removes a negative that we feel had been holding the stock price down  The following headlines and link provide more information  Amgen Finalizes Agreement Resolving Previously Announced Federal Investigations  For those interested in researching Amgen deeper

151850,373366,AMGN,3 Biopharma Trades Poised For Strong Short Term Gains,opinion,Zogenix  ZGNX  engages in the development and commercialization of products for the treatment of central nervous system disorders and pain  Its commercial product includes Sumavel DosePro  sumatriptan injection   a delivery system that offers needle free subcutaneous administration of sumatriptan for the acute treatment of migraine and cluster headache  The company s lead product candidate  Zohydro  is a single entity extended release hydrocodone  which has completed Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain requiring around the clock opioid therapy  Zogenix is facing an FDA Advisory Committee  for its drug  Zohydro ER  hydrocodone bitartrate extended release capsules  on December 7  2012  with an assigned PDUFA date of March 1  2013 Zohydro ER could be the first hydrocodone product to offer the benefit of less frequent dosing and the ability to treat chronic pain patients without the risk of liver injury associated with the use of acetaminophen in high dosages or over long periods of time  Zohydro ER would also be the first long acting hydrocodone based solution that is not combined with another pain relieving drug  Currently  hydrocodone is only available in immediate release  combination products  most commonly with the prior mentioned analgesic acetaminophen  These products require dosing every 4 to 6 hours  In early September  Endo Health Solutions  ENDP  announced that a subsidiary issued a  for one lot of its hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets  saying it s possible that some tablets exceed the weight specification and could be super potent  The increased acetaminophen content could result in liver toxicity  especially in patients on other medications containing acetaminophen  patients with liver dysfunction  or people who consume more than 3 alcoholic beverages a day  Endo s drug here clearly had an issue with liver toxicity as I mentioned prior as a concern with acetaminophen  This is all the more reason I feel Zohydro could be a potential large revenue generator for the company  Zalicus Inc   ZLCS  announced on August 27th that the FDA approved the supplemental new drug application  SNDA  filed by Mallinckrodt Inc   a subsidiary of Covidien plc  for the 32 mg dose strength of Exalgo  hydromorphone HCl  Extended Release Tablets  This drug is for the management of moderate to severe pain in patients requiring continuous  around the clock opioid analgesia for an extended period of time  Exalgo provides time release of hydromorphone throughout the day once a steady state is achieved after three to four days  I like Zalcius s pain killing solution here  but unfortunately for the company  it receives a very small royalty from Covidien  Both Zohydro and Exalgo represent a time released solution for patients with pain who are opioid tolerant  Existing hydrocodone containing pain relievers generate about  3 5 billion in U S  sales  Even taking a small slice of this large market  Zohydro s sales could reach  500M to  800M in my estimation  if ultimately approved by the FDA The chart above shows that the stock has strong mid term up trend support and is currently in a near term up channel making higher highs and higher lows  The price should at least touch  2 85  the 61 8  retrace point and up channel resistance   and a move over  3 is within reach as traders anticipate this Friday s FDA s Advisory Committee  Adcomm  meeting in which committee members will vote whether or not to recommend Zohydro for approval  Cyclacel Pharma  CYCC  engages in developing oral therapies that target the various phases of cell cycle control for the treatment of cancer and other serious diseases  Its core area of expertise is in cell cycle biology where the company focuses primarily on the development of orally available anticancer agents that target the cell cycle with the aim of slowing progression or shrinking the size of tumors  In addition  the company looks to enhance the quality of life while improving survival rates of cancer patients  Cyclacel s lead drug candidate is Sapacitabine  a drug undergoing research for potential use in treating blood and other types of cancers  The company s other product is Seliciclib  CYC202   a CDK  cyclin dependent kinase  inhibitor that is in a Phase IIb clinical trial for the treatment of NSCLC  The drug is also in Phase II clinical trials to treat nasopharyngeal cancer as well as Phase I clinical trials in combination with Sapacitabine to treat cancer  Sapacitabine is an oral nucleoside analog pro drug that acts through a dual mechanism  I find this oral dosing to be a big benefit if proven effective as most everyone understands the terrible side effects common from typical chemotherapy and other cancer treatments  The compound interferes with DNA synthesis by causing single strand DNA breaks and induces arrest of the cell division cycle at the G2 phase  Sapacitabine has demonstrated potent anti tumor activity in both blood and solid tumors in preclinical studies  In a liver metastatic mouse model  Sapacitabine was shown to be superior to Gemcitabine  marketed as Gemzar by Eli Lilly  LLY   in delaying the onset and growth of liver metastasis  Sapacitabine oral capsules are currently involved in the following  The SEAMLESS Phase III trial being conducted under a special protocol assessment with the FDA as front line treatment of acute myeloid leukemia  AML  in the elderly Phase II studies for myelodysplastic syndromes  MDS  and solid tumors including lung cancer Investigator led studies such as a Phase II III comparing sapacitabine to low dose cytarabine as front line treatment of elderly patients with AML or high risk MDS unfit for intensive chemotherapy  and a Phase II study in chronic lymphocytic leukemia In an   Cyclacel announced positive Phase II study results from Sapacitabine  The company reported that the drug nearly doubled the expected survival rate in elderly patients with MDS after front line therapy failure  One of these front line treatment examples is Azacitidine  marketed as Vidaza by Celgene  CELG   I looked at what the sales were for Vidaza since it can demonstrate the opportunities out there for Cyclacel  In the third quarter alone  Vidaza  had sales of  220 million  which obviously translates to close to a billion dollars when averaged out over the course of an entire year  Another example of a front line treatment is Dacogen from Astex Pharmaceuticals  ASTX   Prior to the press release  the data was discussed at The Eighth Annual Hematologic Malignancies 2012 Conference being held on October 10 14  2012  in Houston  Texas  Median overall survival to date for all 63 patients in the Phase II study is 252 days or approximately 8 months  Median overall survival for 41 out of 63 patients with 10  or more blasts in their bone marrow is 274 days or approximately 9 months  Median survival for patients with intermediate 2 or high risk disease  as defined by the International Prognostic Scoring System  IPSS   is 4 3 to 5 6 months  I thought The Life Sciences Report  TLSR  had an excellent  with John McCamant   JM  editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter  During this interview  questions were raised related to blood cancers and potential investments in this area as well as highlighting this landscape as an unmet medical need  John believes MDS and AML represent nice opportunities for investors  One exchange from the interview in particular between John  JM  and The Life Sciences Report  TLSR  highlights Cyclacel from a valuation perspective and related to the press release I mentioned earlier  TLSR  We just got some news from Cyclacel  It announced data in an ongoing Phase II trial with sapacitabine for older patients with MDS who had failed azacitidine and or decitabine  Expected survival rates were doubled  What is your opinion on this study  JM  We looked at some of the data  and the data looks solid  particularly with the Phase III trial ongoing in AML  That makes a difference for us  The key is the larger Phase III trial with AML  The potential gives the Street and analysts a little more confidence  The Phase II MDS trial does not use a placebo as the control arm  as it would be unethical to not use standard of care in elderly and frail patients  We also know that other trials are coming  using the Cyclacel compound in similar cancers  The data have been good to date  and the stock has responded nicely  We look forward to viewing the Phase III data in AML  TLSR  Do you cover Cyclacel in your newsletter  JM  No  but we ve followed Cyclacel over the years  Frankly  it has been slow in development  but things seem to be accelerating  and the valuation looks pretty attractive right now  The company is a little low on cash  so we would not be surprised to see it trying to raise some capital  Also  it does not yet have a partner  which would help validate the technology  But it has a pretty good development team and a very nice pedigree  with Christopher Henney  a co founder of Dendreon Corp   DNDN  and Immunex Corp   acquired by Amgen  AMGN  for  16 billion in 2002   as a board member  We re going to do a little more homework on Cyclacel  We are trying to sit down with management and get its take on what s going on as the company moves forward  TLSR  Because of the recent data  Cyclacel s stock is up sharply over the last month  However  even with its performance  the company only has a  46 million   46M  market cap  JM  That s the key number  We can talk about share prices and all these other numbers  but that market cap really dials us in  For a Phase III cancer company  that s an unusual valuation  The recent price rise probably increases the odds that the company can go out and raise some money  But Wall Street is skeptical when it comes to unpartnered small biotech companies  It is hard for these types of companies to gain traction or get any visibility  At the end of the day  if Cyclacel keeps doing its job and delivering good data  valuation will take care of itself  TLSR  Can you speak to Astex Pharmaceuticals  formerly SuperGen Inc    It is also heavily involved in the heme onc space  JM  Astex is a different type of company  It has been around for quite some time under a different name  It made a good move when it merged with a British company and acquired a platform technology  Now Astex appears to be making some moves forward in the heme onc space  That being said  we re looking at a much different valuation  TLSR  A  276M market cap  right  JM  The market cap is five times that of Cyclacel  But Astex has an approved MDS product    decitabine   and it generates some revenue with that product  Management is solid  Generally  investors want an exciting molecule rather than a revenue producing  older cancer drug  It can be difficult running two different companies at the same time   one having a sales organization out there marketing  and the other focusing on research and development  It is a lot for a smaller company to manage effectively  TLSR  Dacogen is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor used in MDS and AML  If Cyclacel gets sapacitabine approved for those indications  how much would that eat into Dacogen revenues  JM  Quite possibly a good bit  because we are talking about a novel oral compound from Cyclacel  Safety is more important in these elderly patients  but efficacy is needed  TLSR  Would you consider following Astex in your newsletter  JM  We have been tracking it off and on  We ve known the company as SuperGen  from back in the day  But we have learned to never say never  The acquisition of Astex Pharmaceuticals  the British company mentioned above  SuperGen changed its name to Astex following the merger   with its discovery platform  is intriguing to us  It looks like the lead molecules make sense and are in the right cancer space  But the company has a different valuation than Cyclacel  We ll do some work here  but it looks like the more exciting molecule might be at Cyclacel  I think the above speaks rather clearly on the potential Cyclacel offers here  However  as with most small cap biopharmas  there is no guarantee of success    with larger risk comes larger reward  and I think Cyclacel might offer such a reward for those willing to take the longer term buy and hold risk   The chart above shows the stock is sitting between the 50  and 61 8  retrace points after coming down from a very strong up channel  It now appears to have found new footing with a new uptrend line  I believe the stock is poised to test the  6 50 level soon  after yesterday s big move up  MEI Pharma  MEIP  MEI focuses on the clinical development of therapeutics for the treatment of cancer  It develops various lead drug candidates  including ME 143 that has completed Phase I clinical trials in patients with refractory solid tumors  ME 344  an active metabolite of NV 128  which is in Phase I clinical trials in patients with solid refractory tumors  and Pracinostat  an orally histone deacetylase inhibitor that has completed various Phase I clinical trials in patients with hematologic disorders  On 11 6 12  the company  it will be presenting data on Pracinostat  in combination with Azacitidine in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome at a poster presentation at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting on December 10  2012  The company also recently  that its lead mitochondrial inhibitor drug candidate  ME 344  has been named one of the Top 10 most licensable oncology products to watch for in 2012 by Elsevier Business Intelligence and Campbell Alliance  MEI has some interesting things going on for it  the most important being the poster presentation coming up on Monday  December 10th  at 6 PM eastern time  An abstract of the presentation  entitled   Very high rates of clinical and cytogenetic response with the combination of the histone deacetylase inhibitor Pracinostat  SB939  and 5 azacitidine in high risk myelodysplastic syndrome   submitted by Dr  Quintas Cardama and Dr  Garcia Manero of the MD Anderson Cancer Center  is available online at   Pracinostat has been tested in more than 150 patients in multiple Phase I and signal seeking Phase II clinical trials and found to be generally well tolerated with readily manageable side effects often associated with drugs of this class  including fatigue  The results of these studies suggest that Pracinostat has potential  when compared to other oral HDAC inhibitors  Pracinostat has demonstrated clinical evidence of single agent activity  including studies in patients with advanced hematologic disorders such as acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome  The results of these studies were presented at the 2010 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting  In addition  data from a Phase II clinical trial of oral Pracinostat showed activity in heavily pre treated patients with intermediate or high risk myelofibrosis  with two patients showing a clinical improvement  These results were published in the September 2012 issue of   Pracinostat has also shown evidence of activity when used in combination with a wide range of therapies in clinical and pre clinical studies  Recently published pre clinical data in the May 2012 issue of  demonstrated synergistic activity when Pracinostat was combined with Pacritinib  an experimental Janus kinase 2  JAK2  inhibitor  Daniel P  Gold  Ph D   President and Chief Executive Officer of MEI Pharma  We are very encouraged not only by the response rates reported to date  but also by the rapid appearance of the responses with the combination of Pracinostat and Azacitidine  These data are particularly compelling given that most patients in the study had treatment related MDS and expressed high risk cytogenetic abnormalities  both of which carry a poor prognosis  With these data in hand  combined with the capital raise we announced yesterday  11 5 12   we expect to be in a position to rapidly advance to the next stage of development and initiate a randomized Phase II trial of Pracinostat in combination with Azacitidine in patients with MDS by the second quarter of next year  The American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting is sure to get MEI some coverage here  and potentially positive data could rally the stock significantly higher than its current price level  Therefore  I bought some shares of it as a catalyst trade   The stock appears to consolidating in a pennant  which indicates it can make another nice run  It hasn t gone parabolic yet  and it still remains in a nice up channel  I would expect volume to pick up as the company nears the 12 10 12 trade catalyst event  with a move in the stock to around  2 25  Disclosure  I am long  MEIP

151865,373381,AMGN,Best And Worst ETFs  And Mutual Funds   Health Care Sector,opinion,The Health Care sector ranks 2nd out of the ten sectors as detailed in my   It gets my Neutral rating  which is based on aggregation of ratings of 22 ETFs and 86 mutual funds in the Health Care sector as of April 13  2012    Figures 1 and 2 show the five best and worst rated ETFs and mutual funds in the sector  The best ETFs and mutual funds allocate more value to Attractive or better rated stocks than the worst ETFs and mutual funds  which allocate too much value to Neutral or worse rated stocks    To identify the best and avoid the worst ETFs and mutual funds within the Health Care sector  investors need a predictive rating based on  1  stocks ratings of the holdings and  2  the all in expenses of each ETF and mutual fund  Investors need not rely on backward looking ratings    Investors seeking exposure to the Health Care sector should buy one of the Attractive or better rated ETFs or mutual funds from Figures 1 and 2  My ratings and free reports on all ETFs and mutual funds in this sector are available on my free ETF and mutual fund screener    Figure 1  ETFs with the Best   Worst Ratings   Top 5 Best ETFs exclude ETFs with TNA s less than 100 million for inadequate liquidity Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filingsFocus Morningstar Health Care Index ETF  s  FHC  is excluded from Figure 1 because its total net assets  TNA  are below  100 million so it does not meet our liquidity standards Figure 2  Mutual Funds with the Best   Worst Ratings   Top 5 Best mutual funds exclude funds with TNA s less than 100 million for inadequate liquidity    Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings   Icon Funds  ICON Healthcare Funds  s  ICHCX  and  s  ICHEX  are excluded from Figure 2 because their total net assets  TNA  are below  100 million so they do not meet our liquidity standards    Health Care Select Sector SPDR  s  XLV  is my top rated Health Care ETF and Vanguard World Funds  Vanguard Health Care Index Fund  s  VHCIX  is my top rated Health Care mutual fund  Both earn an Attractive or better rating  In fact  XLV is the only ETF I cover to earn my Very Attractive rating    Amgen Inc  s  AMGN  is one of my favorite stocks held by Health Care ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Very Attractive rating  AMGN offers a strong business model with a ROIC above 14  for the last 7 years  an achievement matched by less than 4  companies in the Russell 3000 over the same time  AMGN s current valuation at  66 92 implies a permanent 40  decline in profits  Strong profits and low expectations for future profitability offer appealing risk reward to investors    First Trust NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index Fund  s  FBT  is my worst rated Health Care ETF  and Fidelity Advisor Series VII  Fidelity Advisor Biotechnology Fund  s  FBTAX  is my worst rated Health Care mutual fund  Both earn a Dangerous or worse rating    Amylin Pharmaceuticals  Inc  s  AMLN  is one of my least favorite stocks held by Health Care ETFs and mutual funds  It gets my Dangerous rating  The company is a value destroyer  Not once  over the 14 years I ve covered the company  has it generated a return on invested capital  ROIC  that meets its weighted average cost of capital  WACC   To justify its current valuation of   23 7 share  the company would have to grow its revenues by 20  compounded annually for 20 years while also raising its ROIC from 3  to over 11   With so much profit growth already baked into the current valuation  I find it difficult to believe the stock has much upside    Figure 3 shows that 89 out of the 353 stocks  over 57  of the total net assets  held by Health Care ETFs and mutual funds get an Attractive or better rating  However  only 4 out of 22 Health Care ETFs  45  of total net assets  and 5 out of 86 Health Care mutual funds  less than 56  of total net assets  get an Attractive or better rating    The takeaway is  most mutual fund managers allocate too much capital to low quality stocks but investors do a great job identifying the Health Care ETFs and mutual funds with great portfolio management and low costs  Figure 3 shows that 45  of the value of ETFs and 56  of the value of mutual funds are allocated to Attractive or better rated ETFs and mutual funds    Figure 3  Health Care Sector Landscape For ETFs  Mutual Funds   Stocks  Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings   Investors need to tread carefully when considering Health Care ETFs and mutual funds  The sector does offer 9 investments worthy ETFs and mutual funds but is flooded with 99 ETFs and mutual funds that should be avoided  Figures 4 and 5 show the rating landscape of all Health Care ETFs and mutual funds    As detailed in     the fund industry offers many cheap funds but very few funds with high quality stocks  or with what I call good portfolio management    Figures 4 and 5 show the rating landscape of all Health Care ETFs and mutual funds    Our sector roadmap report ranks all sectors and highlights those that offer the best investments    Figure 4  Separating the Best ETFs From the Worst ETFs Sources  New Constructs  LLC
