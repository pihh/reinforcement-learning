146385,367900,CERN,Better Buy  Veeva Systems vs  Cerner,news,"Veeva Systems  NYSE VEEV  and Cerner  NASDAQ CERN  offer investors some unique opportunities to invest not only in healthcare but in technology as well  These two stocks can give investors the best of both worlds    growth and stability  But deciding between the two is no easy task  as investors will need to determine just how much growth they re looking for versus how much stability they require 
Veeva has been on fire and could be headed higher
Veeva s stock has skyrocketed over the past five years  rising a whopping 400   well in excess of the 62  returns that the S P 500 has generated during that time  The cloud software company works in healthcare  but Veeva isn t your typical healthcare stock  With significant technical capabilities  the company is tech giant salesforce com s  preferred worldwide partner for the pharmaceutical and biotech industry   The two companies have a partnership that extends into 2025  allowing Veeva to develop unique applications for the healthcare industry  
One of the applications that Veeva has developed with Salesforce is a customer relationship management  CRM  application designed with care providers in mind  Currently  more than 50 biopharmaceutical companies around the world use the software  It s a great growth opportunity for Veeva to reach even more healthcare providers  especially those that may not be all that familiar with CRM 

What investors will love about Veeva is that not only did the stock s revenue climb 25  in the company s fiscal third quarter  but a big chunk of its revenue came from subscriptions  Subscription services totaled  227 million during Q3 and made up 81  of the company s top line  and that s up from 79  in the prior year quarter 
The company s commercial cloud revenue  which includes CRM  makes up a little less than half  48   of Veeva s top line  Veeva Vault  a suite of apps that focuses on data management  had a slight majority this past quarter  but that wasn t the case a year ago when commercial cloud sales had the upper hand with 52  of revenue 
Cerner is more diversified but offers far less growth
Cerner is also a big player in healthcare and tech and generates significantly more revenue than Veeva does  The company released its third quarter results in October  and with revenue of more than  1 4 billion  Cerner makes more than Veeva does in 12 months  But where Cerner falls short is growth  revenue last quarter grew by just 6 7  from the prior year quarter  And over the past nine months things aren t any better as sales are up only 6 3  from a year ago  
The one strength in Cerner s financials  however  is that the company has a lot of diversification in its top line  Professional services make up the bulk of Cerner s sales  and that s still only a little more than one third of its revenue through the first nine months of 2019  The downside is that while the company has multiple segments that are growing at more than double digits  there s not one segment that s driving Cerner s growth and that investors can rally behind the way they can around Veeva 
One benefit for income investors is that Cerner pays a dividend of around 1  per year  While it may be well below the S P 500 average of 1 85   it compares favorably against Veeva  which doesn t offer investors any payout 
Why Veeva is the better stock today
Over the long term  Veeva looks like it has the edge over Cerner  especially when looking at future growth  Veeva has some exciting products that are showing terrific growth  and a partnership with Salesforce is bound to lead to even more potential down the road  The company may only be scratching the surface of its potential 
The one negative for Veeva is that the stock is very expensive  trading at 76 times earnings and a price to book multiple of 14  Cerner  however  isn t a cheap stock  either  While its P E multiple of 49 is lower than Veeva s  it s still a high price tag given the modest growth the company has generated 
When it comes to picking a good growth stock  it s key that a company has an exciting product that can drive home some strong results  And in Veeva s case  it has two    CRM and Vault ",2020-01-21,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pk-0g,2064269

earnings call can also be found in the Company s earnings release  Cerner assumes no obligation to update any forward looking statements or information  except as required by law At this time  I d like to turn the call over to Brent Shafer  Chairman and CEO of Cerner Corporation Brent Shafer    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Delim and good afternoon everyone and welcome to the call  I am joining the call from a client event  so I ll start the call with a few comments then hand it over to the team in Kansas City  including our CFO  Marc Naughton  Chief Client Officer  John Peterzalek  and EVP of Strategic Growth  Don Trigg 2019 was an important and productive year for Cerner  We began the year by introducing a new operating model to refine our organizational alignment  enhance our client focus  and to accelerate scalable innovation to make Cerner easier to do business with  We also initiated a Companywide transformation focused on operating efficiencies  business simplification  portfolio management  and refining our growth strategy to position Cerner for long term  profitable growth  Further  we enhanced our governance through the addition of four strong Board members  who  along with our existing members  have been invaluable as we work through our transformation Our 2019 progress is reflected in our fourth quarter results  which included good performance across all key metrics  including exceeding our adjusted operating margin target and delivering record free cash flow  We also returned  1 4 billion of capital to shareholders in 2019 through our share buyback program and our first two dividend payments  all reflecting our commitment to delivering value to shareholders Also significant in 2019 was the announcement of our multi faceted collaboration with AWS and Amazon  We view this relationship as an enabler to many of the growth strategies we ve discussed on previous calls  including Cerner s development of a cognitive platform and our evolution to becoming the Software as a Service healthcare IT partner  Leveraging the powerful combination of Cerner technology  the AWS infrastructure  their artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities  we expect to create next generation user experiences and innovations to deliver more predictive  patient centric care      Now before turning the call over to Marc  I d like to discuss Cerner s position on the topic of interoperability  data security  and privacy  For several decades  Cerner has been a trusted steward of health information and a leader in the pursuit of data interoperability  We ve seen a vocal proponent of    we have been  excuse me  a vocal proponent of the 21st Century Cures Act  and look forward to continuing our work with the ONC  with clients  and with other key stakeholders to ensure a secure flow of information across disparate systems and healthcare entities  We do this because it s the right thing to do And I m reminded of it today  I started my career at Intermountain Healthcare  And this is where I spent the day today talking with other leaders about the future of health and care  And we talk a lot about the fact that healthcare is too important to stay the same  And I love the chance to get together and collaborate with other organizations like Intermountain  who are working to help people live the healthiest lives possible  We fundamentally believe it s wrong to ask patients striving to get better to manage a collection of faxes  PDFs and paper filled shopping bags  It s wrong to ask providers to leave their workflows to review and leverage relevant patient information  It s wrong to waste hundreds of billions of dollars on the highest administrative costs in the world when we re in the middle of an affordability crisis in United States healthcare  So we re going to continue to be a positive voice for change in the industry  Access to the right information at the right time in the right place continues to drive our advocacy in Washington and in the global markets we serve In summary  I m very pleased with everything we accomplished in 2019  We consistently delivered against expectations we set while driving a significant amount of change throughout Cerner  This was hard work and I specifically appreciate all the Cerner associates  hard work throughout the year and their contributions to this progress  We have a lot more to do in 2020  but we re off to a good start and I m optimistic we ll continue to advance our transformation  And more importantly  I believe the work we re doing will position us to create meaningful value in healthcare  while also driving good long term growth for Cerner And now I ll turn the call over to Marc Marc Naughton    Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Brent  Good afternoon  everyone  Before I begin  I did want to cover the most important numbers from the weekend  which are 31 and 20 reflecting the 11 point win for the Super Bowl champion  Kansas City Chiefs  Go Chiefs Now I ll cover our Q4 results and future period guidance  This quarter we delivered all key metrics at or above our guidance  I ll start with bookings  which were  1 665 billion in Q4  exceeding the high end of our guidance  This is down from Q4  18 which was the second highest bookings quarter in our history  Full year bookings were  5 99 billion  which is down from  6 721 billion in 2018  Decline in Q4 and for the year was primarily due to a decline in long term bookings related to us being more selective on our outsourcing contracts as we ve discussed throughout the year  We ended the quarter with a revenue backlog of  13 71 billion  which is down 10  from a year ago  primarily due to the termination of a RevWorks agreement that I discussed on our Q3 call  Also recall that our backlog calculation of the new revenue standard excludes revenue from contracts with termination clauses  even though such clauses are rarely exercised  When you combine the expected revenue from our backlog and the additional revenue expected from contracts not included in our backlog  our revenue visibility remains at nearly 85  over the next 12 months  Revenue in the quarter was  1 442 billion  up 6  over Q4 of  18 and in line with our expectations  Total revenue for the year was  5 693 billion  reflecting growth of 6  over 2018 Now I ll go through the business model detail and year over year growth compared to Q4  18 and full year 2018  Licensed software revenue in Q4 grew 5  over Q4 of  18 million to  174 million and full year licensed software revenue grew 11  over 2018 to  681 million  both primarily due to strong growth in our SaaS offerings Technology resale of  60 million in Q4 increased 31  compared to a weak Q4 of 2018  Full year technology resale revenue was up 1  to  247 million  Subscriptions revenue grew 7  in Q4 to  93 million  Full year subscriptions revenue was  359 million  up 10  from  326 million in 2018 Professional services revenue grew 9  in Q4 to  509 million  primarily driven by solid growth in implementation services and partially offset by approximately  23 million less revenue due to termination of the RevWorks agreement we previously discussed  Full year professional services revenue grew 10  to  1 992 billion  Managed services was up 3  in Q4 to  309 million  Full year managed services revenue was  1 214 billion  an increase of 5  over 2018  Support and maintenance was down 1  to  274 million for the quarter  which is our expectation range and reflects the impact of some past attrition that we discussed last quarter  Full year support and maintenance revenue was also down 1  from 2018 at  1 105 billion  And finally reimbursed travel of  22 million was down 9  in Q4 and down 2  for the full year at  95 million Looking at revenue by geographic segment  domestic revenue was up 6  from the year ago quarter at  1 276 billion and non US revenue of  166 million was up 3  from the year ago quarter  For the full year  domestic revenue grew 7  and non US revenue grew 3  Moving to gross margin  Our gross margin for Q4 was 80 8   down from 81  in Q3 of  19 and 82 6  year over year  Full year gross margin of 81 2  is down from 82 5  in 2018  The declines in our quarterly and full year gross margin are both driven by higher third party services largely related to our federal business and a lower margin mix within technology resale Now I ll discuss spending  operating margin and net earnings  For these items  we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non GAAP results  The adjusted results exclude share based compensation expense  acquisition related adjustments  organizational restructuring and other expenses and other adjustments that are detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release Looking at our operating spending  our fourth quarter GAAP operating expenses of  982 million were up 2  compared to  965 million in the year ago period  Full year GAAP operating expenses were  4 021 billion  up 10  from  3 654 billion in 2018  Our adjusted operating expenses were up 4  for the full year with the fourth quarter essentially flat compared to Q4 of  18  reflecting good progress on our cost optimization efforts  Looking at the line items for Q4  sales and client service expense increased 1  in Q4  Software development expense increased 4  over Q4 of  18  driven by 1  increase in gross R D  a 7  increase in amortization and a 3  decrease in capitalized software  G A expense was 15  driven by decline in both personnel and non personnel expenses Amortization of acquisition related intangibles decreased slightly year over year  Moving to operating margins  our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 12 7  compared to 12  in the year ago period  Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 20 3   up from 18 7  in Q4 of  18 and 18 1  last quarter  Our Q4 adjusted operating margin is in line with our expectations and above the 20  adjusted operating margin target for Q4 of  19 that we committed to last April Our GAAP operating margin for full year of 2019 was 10 6  compared to 14 4  in 2018 and full year adjusted operating margin was 18 5  which is down slightly from 18 8  last year  We believe our ongoing business optimization efforts keep us on track for delivering our targeted Q4  20 adjusted operating margin of 22 5   I d note that some of the margin expansion is expected to be back end loaded like last year due to the timing of our initiatives and some seasonality  However  our guidance  which I ll discuss in a minute  does reflect a full year adjusted operating margin of approximately 21   which is about 250 basis points higher than 2019 and reflects the cumulative impact of all of the optimization work we have done and expect to do this year  We also believe we can continue improving profitability beyond 2020 through ongoing optimization efforts and a longer term opportunity to benefit from platform modernization As we discussed  the benefits from platform modernization will be a multi year process  particularly for Millennium and most near term benefits are largely offset by modernization investments  However  we expect the lower operating costs associated with this move  along with efficiencies and improvements we are driving in our development process  to meaningfully contribute to our profitability while also helping us deliver a differentiated solution to our clients at a lower total cost of ownership  Moving to net earnings and EPS  Our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were  154 million or  0 49 per diluted share  It is up from  0 40 in Q4 of  18  For the full year GAAP net earnings were  529 million  or  1 65 per diluted share  Adjusted net earnings in Q4 were  237 million and adjusted diluted EPS was  0 75 compared with  0 63 in Q4 of  18 For the full year adjusted net earnings were  862 million and adjusted diluted EPS was  2 68  up 9  from 2018  Our GAAP tax rate was 19  for the quarter and year  Our non GAAP tax rate was 20  for the quarter and year  For 2020  we expect our GAAP and non GAAP tax rates to be between 20  and 22  Moving to our balance sheet  we ended Q4 with  542 million of cash and short term investments  which is down from  633 million last quarter with our free cash flow being offset by our  75 million acquisition of AbleVets and  300 million of share repurchases in Q4 For the year  we repurchased 18 8 million shares for  1 3 billion at an average price of  69 06  keeping us on track against our plan to repurchase 1 5 billion by the end of Q1 of  20  Phonetic   Moving to debt  our total debt remained flat to last quarter at  1 038 billion  Total receivables ended the quarter at  1 14 billion  down from  1 155 billion in Q3 of  19  Our Q4 DSO was 72 days  which is down from 74 days in Q3 of  19 and 79 days in the year ago period  Operating cash flow for the quarter was  438 million  Q4 capital expenditures were  83 million and capitalized software was  63 million  Free cash flow  defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs  was  292 million for the quarter For the full year  operating cash flow was  1 313 billion  capital expenditures were  472 million and capitalized software was  274 million  Full year free cash flow was  568 million  which is down  166 million from 2018  driven by higher capital expenditures and restructuring costs For 2020  we expect some level of restructuring cost to continue  but we still expect higher operating cash flow and lower capex to drive strong free cash flow growth  Moving to capital allocation  as I indicated  we repurchased  1 3 billion shares of stock in 2019 and we remain on track to meet our targeted level of  1 5 billion by the end of Q1  In December  we announced that our Board authorized the repurchase of an additional  1 5 billion of stock  bringing the total authorized amount available for repurchase up to  1 7 billion  We intend to continue funding these repurchases with a combination of cash from operations and debt and the timing and amount of repurchases will depend on how much funding is used for other purposes  such as acquisitions or investments Moving to our dividend program  we paid our first three quarterly dividends of  0 18 per share on July 26th  October 9th and January 9th  Our quarterly dividend payments and the increased authorization in our share repurchase plan reflect our continued commitment to return capital to shareholders and our belief in Cerner s long term potential  I d also note that we completed our acquisition of AbleVets in Q4 and have begun to integrate their service offerings into our portfolio to accelerate our success in the federal space  As we ve discussed  we expect to be more active in M A as we believe there are opportunities that could be foundational to our growth in several of the markets our strategic growth organization is pursuing  I d also note that our portfolio management efforts are expected to lead to some divestiture activity as we look to create more focus in areas most aligned with our refined growth strategy Now I ll go through guidance  We expect revenue in Q1 to be between  1 415 billion and  1 465 billion  The midpoint of this range reflects growth of 4  over Q1 of  19  For the full year  we expect revenue between  5 725 billion and  5 975 billion with a  5 85 billion midpoint reflecting 3  growth over 2019  The midpoint of this range is slightly below consensus growth of 4   We suspect  Phonetic  this could be due to estimates not fully factoring in the impact of reduced levels of outsourcing bookings in 2019 and our continued approach of being more selective with those types of contracts Also I d like to walk you through an organic growth view of 2020  If you adjust for our exit from the Adventist Health contract by taking that revenue out of 2019  our 2020 growth would be over 5   Adjusting out AbleVets revenue would bring pure organic growth back to 4   but we don t view all of the revenue from AbleVets as inorganic because we expect to leverage their associates and performing on the VA contract as it ramps up  This normally would have been done through organic hiring  But we believe there is value in leveraging their highly qualified workforce  As we ve discussed there will likely be additional actions we take this year that could result in revenue reductions  There is also the potential that we do M A which could serve as an offset to divestiture activity  Overall  we do expect there to be several moving parts on the top line in 2020  But we believe the actions we take will set us up for solid and profitable growth Moving to EPS  We expect Q1 adjusted diluted EPS to be  0 69 to  0 71 per share  The midpoint of this range is 15  higher than Q1 of  19  Our adjusted diluted EPS guidance reflects a ramp up throughout the year that is similar to last year  With the biggest sequential increase in Q4  this reflects the expected timing of ongoing efficiency and operation efforts For the full year  we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be  3 09 to  3 19 with a  3 14 midpoint  reflecting 70  growth over 2019  As I mentioned  we also expect our adjusted operating margin to ramp during the year  With Q4  we are expected to be slightly higher than our 22 5   target due primarily to a lower mix of outsourcing revenue  I d also note that our expected full year non GAAP tax rates were approximately 21  and is 1  higher than 2019  impacting EPS by about  0 04 Moving to bookings guidance  We expect bookings revenue in Q1 of  1 1 billion to  1 3 billion  The midpoint of this range reflects a 3  decrease compared to the first quarter of 2019  driven by an expected decline in long term bookings  In summary  we are pleased with our strong results in the fourth quarter and believe we made a lot of progress this year  There is a lot of hard work left to meet our profitability and growth targets  but we have a good plan in place and expect to execute it in 2020 and beyond Before I wrap up  I d like to remind you that we will host our annual investment community meeting at HIMSS on Tuesday March 10  If you plan to attend and have not registered  please do so through the link at the top of the Investors section of cerner com  If you re unable to attend in person  there will be a webcast available With that  I ll turn the call over to John John Peterzalek    Chief Client OfficerThanks  Marc  Good afternoon  everyone  Today  I will provide results  highlights and an update on our federal business  I ll start with our bookings  As Marc mentioned  we delivered bookings ahead of our guidance range for the quarter  driven by strong contributions across multiple segments such as investor owned  academic and IDNs  We also had good contributions from revenue cycle solutions and across our strategic growth businesses which Don will discuss Consistent with recent quarters  we had a lower level of long term bookings compared to last year  which drove the decline in overall bookings  For the quarter  the percent of bookings coming from long term contracts was 29  compared to 38  in Q4 of last year  Long term bookings for the year represented 28  of total bookings  compared to 36  last year  with this decline in long term bookings  driving total bookings down for the year  Bookings excluding long term contracts increased slightly for the full year Looking at the broader marketplace  many of the same trends continued to play out during 2019  with healthcare cost growth outpacing the economy  elevated levels of industry consolidation  rising consumer expectations around cost  convenience  and service  and the continued gradual evolution of reimbursement models adding to pressure on providers to lower costs and advance their risk based strategies These forces are contributing to an overall challenging macro environment  Providers are simultaneously seeking to grow key service lines  drive operational efficiencies to make money at Medicare rates  and build out the competencies required to take and effectively manage risk and participate in value based reimbursement models  Information technology is seen as an enabler of these efforts  which represents an opportunity for Cerner  At the same time  the low margin nature of provider businesses can make it difficult to fund required investment  making it important for solutions and services to have a clear return on investment As we look at 2020  we see solid opportunity both in our installed base as well as continuing to gain new clients  This opportunity is reflected in our pipeline  which is up year over year for both new business and opportunities for sales back into our base  In our base  we are focused on getting our clients current while also filling out their Cerner solution suite  with a focus on increasing penetration of revenue cycle solutions  and solutions supported by our CareAware and HealtheIntent platforms  Our CommunityWorks pipeline remains strong and we have opportunities outside of our traditional provider base in areas such as state government  employer  and long term  post acute care  We also have opportunities to continue growing the presence of our EHR agnostic CareAware and HealtheIntent solutions beyond our EHR base Moving to our Federal business  we continued to advance both our VA and DoD projects  On the VA project  Cerner along with the VA and our partners  remain focused on the Initial Operating Capability  or IOC  go live  We have completed initial integration validation and are doing a significant amount of training and site preparation activities ahead of the scheduled go live in March  Looking beyond the initial go live  we also expect to go live at additional IOC sites in 2020 and continue to steadily scale our work to provide additional value and capabilities to the VA in upcoming quarters  As Marc mentioned  we expect to leverage the AbleVets team as these activities ramp throughout the year We are also making good progress on DoD  We successfully completed a code upgrade during the quarter and kicked off the Coast Guard project and two additional deployment waves  Go lives for these waves are slated for late 2020 With that  I ll turn the call over to Don Donald Trigg    Executive Vice President  Strategic GrowthThanks  John  Good afternoon everyone  Our Strategic Growth organization launched in 2019  Our ambition was a simple one  scale a set of focused business units that position Cerner beyond the hospital  beyond our Cerner Millennium EMR and beyond the traditional fee for service payment model The six business units that make up Strategic Growth each target large addressable markets in excess of  3 billion with a path to meaningful share in each market  They gain leverage from existing Cerner assets ranging from the industry leading data processing and aggregation capabilities of HealtheIntent to our subject matter expertise around the last mile EMR workflow  Regulatory requirements are understood  surmountable and offer opportunities for differentiation  All six businesses overweight on recurring revenue and have high gross margin potential  And finally  Strategic Growth leaders focus squarely on speed to revenue as they pursue their larger category leading positions For full year 2019  our Strategic Growth businesses generated  520 million in revenue  representing 22  growth year over year  We believe we can deliver similar growth in 2020 and look forward to our Investor Day at HIMSS in Orlando which will afford us an opportunity to review the long term targets for each business As we look at areas of particular strength in 2019  cybersecurity frames our strategic approach  U S  healthcare is seeing data breaches at a rate of one per day  Our technologies are core to how CIOs and CSIOs are building out their enterprise strategies  Cyber is an area of growing internal competence driven  in part  by our critical work to support our armed services and veterans  As a result  our security revenue from health systems grew nearly 40  in 2019 Our provider communication business  leveraging our EMR agnostic CareAware platform  also benefited from strong market tailwinds and delivered record bookings in 2019  CareAware Connect solution adoption was strong with an over 100  year over year increase in utilization to almost 75 000 monthly users We also were pleased with the full year progress in the Long Term and Post Acute Care market with 23  year over year growth  Our Behavioral Health solution  within our LTPAC solution suite  was a particular bright spot  It delivered almost forty new footprints with 80  of total bookings revenue coming from outside our Millennium base Our unified Behavioral Health solution is not only strongly differentiated in the market  it also was announced Friday as the 2019 Best in KLAS category leader  For individuals and families that seek help  our unified Cerner solution strives to make it easier for providers to deliver the integrated care that successful treatment demands While LTPAC is an area where we sell at the point solution level  it also fits solidly into our larger strategic push to build out Health Network strategies across every MSA in the U S  and all five of our focused global regions At the technical platform level  our HealtheIntent platform is a strategic linchpin of our Health Network efforts  Our market facing push to drive adoption of HealtheIntent continued to progress in 2019 bringing us to 175 HealtheIntent clients worldwide including the addition of leading providers like Prospect Health and Davita Health As Brent noted in describing our AWS partnership  HealtheIntent was built as a native cloud platform  is EMR agnostic and has been recognized by industry analysts like Chillmark as having the best product capabilities in the category  It also has been at the heart of our work with AWS  As we move nearly all of our non federal HealtheIntent clients to the AWS public cloud in the first half of 2020  it will establish the clear value proposition of the cloud technology approach for provider healthcare  We also see it as a key enabler of our Health Network strategy in focused global markets  such as England as the NHS accelerates its push to advance Integrated Care Systems Finally  with the content of healthcare digitized  we also are advancing a set of strategies around data services  Art Glasgow and team our Learning Health Network to make it easier for patients to be identified and participate in clinical trials  The Duke Clinical Research Institute partnership announced in 2019 played a central role in generating research opportunities for Cerner clients  Top health systems  such as Medstar announced yesterday  are helping us activate a network we believe can make it less expensive to create the next generation of life saving therapeutics Across all six business units  our efforts to drive strategic growth fit into an emerging enterprise discipline around portfolio management across Cerner  In 2019  we were as intentional about the things we decided not to do as the things we decided to do Several important Strategic Growth partnerships help tell this story  Our partnership with ResMed offers new revenue generating opportunities in the post acute care and also advanced analytics round sleep and respiratory  It also featured a decision to make ResMed s Brightree home health offering our preferred go to market solution  Similarly  our partnership with GetWellNetwork embedded their HealthLoop asset into our consumer application framework  It also came with a portfolio decision to not invest further in our MyStation patient engagement solution in favor of GetWell s industry leading offering We believe a combination of thoughtful build  buy  partner assessment will bring us closer to our long standing vision to build a system of health and care with the individual at the center  It is a system where consumers not only have a right to their data  but also have the ability to mobilize it in pursuit of better health We believe the entrepreneurial opportunities at the intersection of healthcare and IT have never been greater  We are excited about what 2020    and the 2020s    hold for a setting an emerging area of strategic growth for Cerner  2019 performance for its part laid a solid foundation for moving further  faster in the quarters to come With that  let me turn the call over to the operator for questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  sir   Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead Robert Jones    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGreat  Thanks for all the comments tonight and for taking the questions  I guess  Marc  just to go back to some of your comments  you highlighted 4  growth ex AbleVets addition and less the revenue cycle service contract that you guys exited  I guess just out of curiosity as we frame the year and understanding that 2020 has been put aside as kind of a transition year  how much of that remaining growth came from federal  And then clearly more importantly and I know we ll hear more in March  maybe just some of the major building blocks as you think about returning to profitable growth in the future  what are the pieces we should be at least starting to frame out as we think about growth beyond 2020 Marc Naughton    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  no this is Marc  I think from a    certainly as we look at the year and trying to get apples to apples  we ll be a little bit challenged in 2020  We re going to do our best job to do that  That s a  Phonetic  little bit why we try to talk a little bit about organic growth  I think if we get back to the overall view of top line growth  we ve talked last year about kind of that being in the 6  to 9  range  Clearly the outsourcing selectivity and certainly the Adventist contract could impact that  And I think as we look through that that s probably a 100 basis point potential impact  which would put you some place in a 5  to 8  top line growth level  I think that s certainly something that we would expect to be doable for us  I think from a    from the things that are going to continue driving  certainly federal will be part of that growth  As that contract  the VA contract ramps its way up to  1 billion a year of annual revenue  that s  250 million or so of additional annual growth in revenue that s just coming out of the VA contract depending on the time period  So that s certainly a good driver And then strategic growth is obviously another area that we re expecting to see growth out of that will take the    to  500 million to  600 million business it is today  and continue to grow that at strong growth rates  We also look at the opportunity that we have just within our existing base business  So  our core business  the opportunity to sell revenue cycle solutions back into that base  the ability to go attack the white space  all of those are things that we think overall are elements that can contribute to us having overall top line growth  And that really all of those things I talked about are primarily organic  We ve talked in the past that we also expect there to be a level of inorganic growth for us and some M A that will support primarily the opportunities and strategic growth and depending on the size of those opportunities an the size    the revenue impact they bring that certainly could be accretive to those    to the top line growth that we ve talked about But certainly as we go    get to HIMSS and can have a little bit more time with everyone  we ll try to take you through a more detailed view of strategic growth and the elements of those businesses and how we ve got    how we ve got the opportunities for growing the top line kind of just in the range that we ve traditionally discussed  But I think to your point  we have talked about 2020 being a reset year  We are looking at opportunities to divest certain things as we do our portfolio management  That s going to negatively impact revenue  The M A will positively impact revenue  And what we will try to do on a quarterly basis is kind of give you an update as to where we re going  Obviously  we ll be giving you quarterly guidance to if there is any adjustments  But right now we think the guidance we provided for the year is really solid Robert Jones    Goldman Sachs    AnalystNo  Marc  I appreciate all that  I guess  just a quick follow up on your comments then would be around those potential further divestitures and potential M A  Are those contemplated in the 2020 guidance or is this kind of best case of what we know today is just where the business stands Marc Naughton    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  the way we did our guidance was basically kind of on a same store basis  So it does not contemplate any of the divestitures  It does not contemplate any of the M A potential activity because that s still  as of today  something to be determined  We think it s going to be more effective as those items occur that we can talk about them at that point Keep in mind the AH  if you will  divestiture or that RevWorks business going away  is by far the largest item that was on the list  the items after that would be smaller items  So whether they even impact the overall guidance to a great extent will be something we determine that the point they occur  But right now  the guidance is based on current course and speed and then we will adjust as we    as anything comes up in that space  one way or the other Robert Jones    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThanks for all that Marc Naughton    Chief Financial OfficerSure OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS  Please go ahead Kevin Caliendo    UBS    AnalystHi  Thanks for    thanks for taking our call  I know you don t guide for bookings for the full year  But given the shift away from LT service bookings when do you think it s reasonable for you to assume you can return to year over year bookings growth  And when I look at the 1Q guide  is there any additional comp headwind for the shift or do you view the year over year long term bookings compares already normalized entering the year Brent Shafer    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean  I think clearly we don t guide beyond the Q1 because we do want to be pretty accurate relative to our guidance  I think as you    the solid results that we delivered in Q4 actually delivering above our guidance range with the opportunity    based on some opportunities to pull things in to the quarter based on some of the timing of our clients and their year ends  This is going to impact Q1 a little bit because those things would have normally been landed in Q1  But I think we re still normalizing for some of the outsourcing elements in the bookings  So I think for 2020 what s kind of a year for resetting the top line from a growth perspective  I think it s fair to say that the bookings we ll get through the full year of 2020 and then we should get some pretty comparable bookings to be able to do apples to apples growth thereafter  But Q1 is still being impacted by the more focused view of anything that we re going to do on the services side that might be in the outsourcing space Kevin Caliendo    UBS    AnalystOkay  And one quick follow up if I might  So we are reading the VA deputy secretary was let go yesterday and I guess he was the one who is technically in charge VA implementations  I was wondering if you had been in contact with them  with leadership over there since that decision was made  Is there any concern or any issues about timing or potential bottlenecks for the implementation of the VA contract John Peterzalek    Chief Client OfficerYeah  this is John  I won t comment specifically on the    on that activity  but what I would say is that both the veterans VA  the modernization project they have significant bipartisan support  And the fact that there are changes and political activity  it s not a surprise or unexpected  And from the beginning of this project  we took great effort in making sure that we had broad support throughout the hill  The VA  veterans groups and other constituents and supporters to ensure when things like this do happen or political activity occurs  it doesn t impact where we re going  So we don t anticipate any impact from that and we think that our broad base of support is incredibly solid and we re just going to continue on Kevin Caliendo    UBS    AnalystGreat  Thanks so much for the color on that OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee from Cowen  Please go ahead Charles Rhyee    Cowen     AnalystYeah  thanks for taking the question  Maybe you want to touch on    I think at the beginning  you guys talked about the interoperability rules  the final rules right expected soon  Any thoughts on sort of the    I know there were some concerns  particularly on providers around compress timelines or perceived compressed timelines for implementation  How do you view those challenges  And what would you  I guess  say about your preparedness to help clients to work through that  And any thoughts on maybe seeing a phased implementation schedule put in place instead Donald Trigg    Executive Vice President  Strategic GrowthYeah  So  this is Don  I think first and foremost  just to echo Brent s comments  this is a space that we ve been very vocal on and pushed aggressively on for a number of years  So we have a lot of  I think  personal passion around interoperability  Semantic interoperability and what this space needs to look like for patients and providers and payers  so that s first and foremost  I think Secondly  we feel like we re very well positioned to meet the implementation timelines that are being discussed  both from a technical and a non technical business perspective  We ll obviously finalize those strategies as the final rule comes out and they re completely understood  But we think they re manageable and that we re well positioned to do that  And I think finally  just to reiterate some of the framing on the call  we think there is going to be a ton of business opportunities associated with these elevated rates of data liquidity  So when I think about the types of things that we re doing to enable our strategies around Medicare Advantage  alternative payment models like bundled payments and BPCIA  the opportunity to think through the technical strategies required to help provider organizations make those business models work  we think  create tons of opportunity for Cerner and frankly for the industry as a whole Charles Rhyee    Cowen     AnalystGreat  And maybe if I could just follow on  in terms of sort of the strategic    the new model that you are working on  I m not sure    I might have missed it  but didn t hear any mention of Lumeris  Just curious on an update on how that partnership is working  Thanks Donald Trigg    Executive Vice President  Strategic GrowthNo  I appreciate it  We think we re making a ton of progress there and I ll tether back to the comments I just made  So  first and foremost  really the thing that was    one of the things that was super exciting to us was to take the methodology  sort of the best in class methodology of Lumeris for Medicare Advantage  our technical capabilities and their service expertise and use it to bring a total solution offering to the market In terms of progress made around that  we were very excited to use HealtheIntent as a foundational platform for running a provider sponsored plan focused on MA  And we over attained against those IP milestones over the course of 2019  And now we re deploying the solution as part of the go to market strategy for Lumeris and Cerner And again just to come back to the topic around information sharing  if you think about the Forestar MA plan that Lumeris runs in the St  Louis market  14 different practices  high degrees of technology heterogeneity and how do you think about elevated rates of data liquidity both to drive through your strategies for activating that network as well as integrating their best practice capabilities into the last mile workflow of the physician  it s nicely complementary to the regulatory trends that are playing out  And we think it represents one of several very big business model opportunities for us going forward Charles Rhyee    Cowen     AnalystGreat  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley  Please go ahead Ricky Goldwasser    Morgan Stanley    AnalystYeah  hi  Good evening  Going back to the revenue growth guidance and some of the comments  Marc  that you made  So first of all  just to clarify  because I might have missed it  I think at some point you said 5  to 8  is doable for longer term revenue growth  And just trying to understand the building block there  That s one Second of all  I think you highlighted that the VA is a long term revenue opportunity  So just wanted to make sure that we hear it right that you expected to grow that  250 million that you mentioned beyond the term of the initial contract And then lastly as we think about the potential divestitures that are not included in this guidance range that you provided us today  who is making this bit of decision  Is this a decision that you are making based on the margin mix or is this something that the client when the contract is up for renewal decides to not renew  I just    just if you can just clarify why is this taking such a long time to make a decision of what contracts are being divested or not Marc Naughton    Chief Financial OfficerSure  First of all  the 5  to 8  was really just discussing the long term growth we kind of provided last year at HIMSS of 6  to 9  with a little bit of a    100 bps haircut based on the lower amount of outsourcing activity that s going to happen  So we re going to be  as I indicated a little bit earlier  at HIMSS we will be taking you through that long term growth rate  what that looks like  where it s coming relative to our core businesses  our strategic growth businesses  our federal business  So you ll be able to see how it lays out  And then we ll give you some more details as to the strategic growth businesses that underpin all of those growth assumptions  So our goal is to lay out a very clear path that kind of falls within that range with the opportunity to over attain depending on what we do from an M A perspective Relative to the VA contract  when we first talked about it  be the  10 billion contract and it s a 10 year contract  the math would say that s  1 billion a year  Obviously there is a ramp up period  And when we talk about it    and when we talked about it  we said it ramps up over a four year period growing about  250 million a year until we get to the  1 billion  So my reference to that  250 million increase was basically the revenue we re going to be ramping up to in that contract that gets us to the  1 billion run rate  We have talked about the opportunities to certainly sell more of our solutions and services to the VA  which could increase the  1 billion to a bigger number  but certainly the  250 million I referenced is just kind of current course and speed ramping up the projects  doing more and more on implementations and how that drives that revenue stream forward  So nothing new there  That s just really reiterating what we ve talked about but it s another piece of the growth puzzle that is    we ve talked about  and does drive a good amount of growth And finally on the divestitures  AH was a little bit of an anomaly in that space  That was really a business we re looking to kind of decide whether we want to be in or not  They were our largest client in that outsourcing  So that was more of a client contractual agreement  Going forward  it will be much more of us reviewing relative to our portfolio management  relative to our growth options for the business  where do we want to focus our attention  And those areas that we don t want to    don t think are the growth areas for the Company we want to focus on  we re going to consider divesting as one of the options  We ll consider divesting  we will consider partnering  There are a variety of things that we will consider  but those divestitures will be in many cases of an existing business  It won t be a specific client relationship that will be unwound in some way  It will be an existing business that we will basically go out to market and look for opportunities to say here is this asset  it s something we re willing to let go and some of these    some of these assets have significant value So I think    and from why is it taking so long standpoint  there is a lot of work we ve done in our portfolio management to decide what are the key things we want to drive as we talk that work really was a lot of the 2019 work and really it was kind of finalizing as we ended the year  And certainly some of these activities on divestitures are already under way and ideally will be things that we can share with you in the very near future Ricky Goldwasser    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Jeff Garro from William Blair  Please go ahead Jeff Garro    William Blair    AnalystYeah  good evening  and thanks for taking the questions  I want to ask a little bit more about the AWS partnership and maybe putting aside the very important work around migration and those long term benefits of efficiency and lower TCO for clients  More curious on the consumer experience innovation side and what type of milestones either IP milestones or bookings related milestones that we can look for in 2020 from that partnership Marc Naughton    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  it s a great question  Jeff  Thanks  So let me talk to kind of multiple pieces of it  Just in terms of  one  the framework for the relationship  I think one of the things that we were excited about from a AWS and Amazon perspective was not just the opportunity to think through technical migration to the public cloud  but to really think about broader opportunities around the Amazon relationship and what it would look like  in particular to leverage their deep competencies around the consumer  coupled with their strong interest in being part of the healthcare ecosystem  So that was  I think  a design feature of the relationship  and I think we ve been very happy with our opportunity to kind of engage with them and to look at key strategies around approach  whether those are publicly disclosed activities around how they think about their employee population and some of the things that they re doing in concert with JPM and with Berkshire portfolio companies or acquisitions that they ve made around capabilities like PillPack  So we ve had good visibility to that  We think it s an exciting piece  potential piece of the relationship and an important part of how we want to think about making the partnership work going forward Secondly  from a technical perspective  I talked a little bit about the fact that HealtheIntent has really been a tip of the spear  if you will  relative to the migration to the public cloud  most of that work will be completed in the first half of the year  CareAware similarly is part of that early strategy and path  And I think we ve been very transparent in terms of saying that the time frames around Millennium will be more elongated Finally  in terms of what this is going to look like in terms of targeted bookings or revenue impact  I think there s businesses within strategic growth that are very excited about the potential pull through impact relative to revenue  I would say our consumer and employer businesses in particular have a lot of energy here and have been real drivers around the strategic collaboration  but we re probably not at a point in the life cycle of the dialog where I could put out a revenue target or a bookings target that we would feel confident we could hit or over attain Jeff Garro    William Blair    AnalystGreat  That s very helpful  One quick follow up maybe on the technical side on HealtheIntent and CareAware and those this first half migrations  maybe just some more specifics around where the benefits are for Cerner with those migrations and where the benefits are for clients Marc Naughton    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  well  first of all  I think just the ability to be able to stage and think through the migration to the public cloud has had a real value proposition for us as we try to think really comprehensively about not only the technical components but also how we have this conversation with our clients  how we think about innovation potentials in concert with our provider clients as part of the dialog and the approach In terms of benefits  I think there are clear and demonstrable benefits that our clients are going to see  There is a performance    system performance benefit that s very real  There is a benefit around latency and how we think about the path to near real time data assets that I think could be very important around strategies like hospital operations  And I think this is also relevant as we start thinking about growth opportunities like cyber security where clients need our competency and expertise around how they manage hybrid environments with on prem and cloud So I think real benefits that we re deriving from a performance perspective  from a data and utilization of the data against business strategy and some really interesting  from my perspective  conversations around capability that we have that create white space opportunities for growth Jeff Garro    William Blair    AnalystExcellent  Thanks again OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Sean Wieland from Piper Sandler  Please go ahead Sean Wieland    Piper Sandler    AnalystHi  Thanks so much  So on the restructuring cost that you re talking about  Marc  you said 2020 your restructuring costs are going to continue  Can you quantify the impact that these costs are to the operating margin that you re forecasting both in 2019 and 2020 Marc Naughton    Chief Financial OfficerWell the operating    the restructuring costs that we re incurring that are the restructuring costs currently are being adjusted out of earnings  So  our adjusted earnings  there is zero impact on that  And that is the number on which we have based our operating margin targets Sean Wieland    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  Thanks  And then    that s helpful  And then a quick clarifying question  you said you re going to move almost all your hosting clients to AWS in the first half of  20 that s consistent with what you ve said  But does that impact the revenue or profitability cadence throughout the year or are you going to be back filling that with government tenants Marc Naughton    Chief Financial OfficerWell  for the most part the    moving them to AWS the primary impact is freeing up hardware and space in our data center and that will absolutely be used to support our federal clients as well as other clients we have that are hosted by us on Millennium platform  All of these devices are basically interchangeable relative to the various architectures we use  So that will be the savings  the impact on  Indecipherable  Sean Wieland    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  Thanks very much OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Sean Dodge from RBC Capital Markets  Please go ahead Sean Dodge    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystHi  Good afternoon  Thanks for taking the questions  Maybe staying within the platform modernization for a moment  understanding the entire project is going to be multi year effort and ultimately long term positive for margin  can you give us a little more insight into the impact it will have on margins in the interim  the investments you re going to have to make as part of it  Can you put some bookings around how big  how much  are they going to be consistent or chunky and are there efficiencies you re going to be able to garner in the meantime that will help offset some of it or is this something where the margin lift really doesn t come until the entire project is done Marc Naughton    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  this is Marc  As John kind of went through  each time we move an element to AWS there is some savings garnered  So certainly from a    as we move HealtheIntent being able to manage that in the AWS environment it s    it has a savings on the people it takes for us to run those environments in our data centers  So there are incremental  they aren t significant  but they are incremental The investment we re going to make relative to our cloud investment on the other platform  primarily Millennium  that s part of our R D expense  right  Part of our portfolio management goal is to free up dollars that we re spending on things that we don t see as long term growth opportunities and put that in to some of the things that are going to be growth opportunities such as the cloud environment  We are still actually going through the exercise in the process of deciding exactly what the path to modernization is going to entail  exactly what s going to move and exactly the timing  So it s a little bit hard for me right now to give you an idea of what those dollars are  But our expectation is that much of that work is going to get funded out of our normal R D spend that we will be focused on those efforts as opposed to potentially some other efforts on things that we re going to not be moving forward with So there is    that s    it s going to be a refocus on it  So we re not going to garner some of the savings that we might have from some of those divestitures  although we will get    gather some  But we shouldn t have a large influx of costs relative to this effort  And it will  as Don said  be a period of time before that gets there No  once we get there the benefits are significant  We ve got well over  100 million of annualized costs for hosting our clients in our data center just from software that we run them on in our data center that we won t need to use when they go to the cloud  There will    the advantages of running a single version of the software in the cloud is a significant decrease in the cost we have for supporting our clients  They will get a much better experience  so clients stat goes higher  So the appetite for more solutions goes higher So those are harder to quantify at this point other than the actual cost savings from sub licensed software  But I think for the most part  that s the goal  Those benefits aren t going to happen in the next two or three years  That s    we have to get through a lot of work and would be able to give you more of an update on that as we do our work to make    to identify the path forward  But it isn t something I think is going to be a big expense impact  but the benefits will be a little bit longer term relative to margin improvement  And that s one of the things we ve kind of talked about is we ve got our path  We did    we delivered  19  we have our path to 2020  How you keep delivering thereafter you continue on the optimization and then the next iteration is going to be basically platform based that you bring these other additions and other opportunities to increase operating margins Sean Dodge    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  that s great  Thanks  Marc  And then maybe on margins more broadly  you are still expecting to exit 2020 around the 22 5  level  you said maybe even a little bit better  I think you touched on it briefly in the prepared remarks  but could you just walk us kind of quickly through what you see being the primary levers or buckets of opportunities you can take out to get you from the 20  you just printed to something north of 22 5  in the next four quarters Marc Naughton    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think the key to remember is a lot of what we did in  19 really started impacting us late in the year  right  It really    the margin improvement from Q3 to Q4 was significant  So    but we have in place over 50  of the actions we need to go drive the margin uplift for 2020  The next set of things that are going to happen are going to happen toward the end of 2020 as we do things based on location of associates and things like that that will drive kind of some of those next year benefits for us So the reason that Q4 and 2020 will be a little bit of a back end loaded once again is because those are the next tranches and it takes time and effort to go get those in place  But I would point out that basically after Q1  we ll be delivering about 250 basis points of margin improvement each quarter year over year Q2  Q3 and Q4 and actually for the full year  So that level    those margin improvements are the continuation of what we put in place in  19 and delivering on the next phases that occur in 2020 Sean Dodge    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGot it  Okay  Thanks again Marc Naughton    Chief Financial OfficerHey  just to clarify before we get to the next question  My comments around 5  to 8   it seemed like there is a little bit of confusion on people that talking about that comment  I m just trying to    the indication that I was trying to portray is that if you took our previous 6  to 9  target and lowered it for the impact of outsourcing it would reduce the range by 100 basis points  So I was just doing math and subtraction is one of the skills I do have  And we basically were taking those down to the 5     8  just based on what our prior view was and kind of what the impact of the outsourcing that we ve talked to you about is  But certainly at HIMMS we will give you a more detailed view of what we think the right answer is and how we get to that right answer  So I just want to clarify that because there s a little bit of confusion OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from George Hill from Deutsche Bank  Please go ahead George Hill    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGood morning  guys  Thanks for taking the question  This might be one for Don  I know Don  historically    this is an interoperability question  historically interface management has been an attractive part of the business with pretty good margins  And as we think about kind of changing interoperability regulations that will probably create some opportunities  So can you talk about how much business risk there might be departing the legacy business Donald Trigg    Executive Vice President  Strategic GrowthYeah  it s a good question  George  I think we re pretty comfortable that that business    I mean you re right  it s relatively small and it does have a good margin profile  I think we re relatively comfortable that the things that we ve been doing on SMART on FHIR enablement and our code program mean that the net impact is de minimis  And I think more to my earlier point  we think it s actually enabling to some of the bigger swing business strategies that we re advancing inside strategic growth So while I can t perfectly net that out for you  I think we look at it and say it enters  Phonetic  to our advantage into the upside relative to where we want to go from a top line perspective George Hill    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  that s super helpful  And then Marc maybe just two quick number follow ups  Can you talk about    can you give maybe any color around the capex guidance for 2020  You talked about the number coming down from the  471 million number in 2019  Maybe just something about that  And is any share repo assumed in the 2020 EPS guidance Marc Naughton    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think that from a capex perspective  you can take  100 million out of that number to be kind of the range that we would expect as we look at 2020 for capex based on our buildings being slowed down or basically being completed  And I think the repurchase  we obviously have  200 million scheduled for Q1 to complete our 12 months  And I think going forward  certainly our capital allocation will look at M A opportunities and other things relative to the use of capital  but I would think  at least  200 million a quarter of repurchases would seem to be kind of a base amount that we would then adjust relative to what our M A is George Hill    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  I appreciate that color  Thank you Marc Naughton    Chief Financial OfficerWhy don t we take one last question OperatorThank you  Our last question comes from Eric Percher from Nephron Research  Please go ahead Eric Percher    Nephron Research    AnalystThank you  Question on federal contracts and I know that early in the uptake  you ve had third party service that appears to be weighing on the margin  As we think about 2020 versus 2019  does that level of third party support remain about stable or is there any increase or decrease Marc Naughton    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  this is Marc  For 2020 it will be about the same  We continue to leverage our partners in that space  Clearly AbleVets was one example of us working to bring a larger workforce quickly inside Cerner that we can then move to focus on the VA as some of the    as we work through their existing projects which are relatively short term and get them on the VA that will allow us to bring that down  But that s probably more of a 2021 event at this point Eric Percher    Nephron Research    AnalystThat s helpful  And then last on the ex US 3  growth last year as you look to 2020  I don t think that was part of the items you ticked off on growth opportunity  But what is your perspective on growth ex US John Peterzalek    Chief Client OfficerThis is John  I will answer that  I think it will be consistent with previous years  There s still a lot of opportunity outside the US in the form of new business  new regions and countries and those type of things  which we will look at pursuing each one of those opportunities and make a decision  But similar to the US we are also doing portfolio analysis on non US as well  So we re going to look to be follow the same process and become much more focused and    outside the US as well  So we may see both ups and downs outside the US as well Eric Percher    Nephron Research    AnalystThanks Marc Naughton    Chief Financial OfficerHey  this is Marc  I want to thank everybody for participating  One last comment there is still might be a little confusion about our long term top line growth target  The 5  to 8  I mentioned is absolutely something  I think  we can  Phonetic  deliver  absolutely  And in fact  I think there is upside to that  So I think the number something closer to the 7  range is probably more reasonable  But once again my point is  we really want to take you through it in detail  show you what the building blocks are so you re not just blindly putting the number in  But 5  to 8  level is a level that I have a great deal of confidence in  So with that I want to thank you for attending this afternoon and look forward to getting together with you at HIMSS on March 10th  Until then have a good evening Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  68 minutesCall participants Brent Shafer    Chairman and Chief Executive

146394,367909,CERN,Here s Why Investors Liked Cerner s Q4 Earnings Results,news,"Cerner  NASDAQ CERN  wowed investors in 2019 by racking up a 40  gain in share price  So far this year  though  there hasn t been much excitement from the big health information technology provider 
But Cerner gave investors something to like when it announced its fourth quarter results after the market closed on Tuesday  Here are the highlights of the company s Q4 update 

By the numbers
Cerner announced Q4 revenue of  1 44 billion  a 6  increase from the  1 37 billion reported in the same quarter of the previous year  This matched the average analyst Q4 revenue estimate 
The company reported net income of  154 3 million  or  0 49 per share  based on generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP   This reflected a solid increase from GAAP earnings of  131 3 million  or  0 40 per share  recorded in the prior year period  
Cerner posted Q4 adjusted net income of  237 2 million  or  0 75 per share  up from adjusted net income of  208 1 million  or  0 63 per share  in the same quarter of 2018  The consensus Wall Street estimate was for Q4 adjusted earnings of  0 74 per share 
Behind the numbers
CEO Brent Shafer said   I am pleased with our strong finish to the year  with all of our key operating metrics at or above our expectations in the fourth quarter   Shafer had a good reason to like what he saw in Q4  since Cerner delivered solid revenue growth in nearly every category and topped Wall Street s earnings estimate for only the second time in the last five quarters 
Cerner makes 35  of its total revenue from professional services  That revenue jumped 9  year over year to  509 3 million  All other revenue sources for the company also delivered year over year growth except for support and maintenance and reimbursed travel 
The company s bottom line improvement in Q4 was largely through revenue growth  It also helped that Cerner s operating expenses rose by only 1 8  year over year  In addition  the company paid around  3 million less in taxes in the fourth quarter of 2019 than it did in the prior year period 
Cerner reported bookings in the fourth quarter of  1 665 billion  above its expectations  Its total backlog at the end of 2019 was  13 71 billion  
Looking ahead
The company expects revenue for full year 2020 between  1 415 billion and  1 465 billion  It anticipates adjusted non GAAP  adjusted  EPS between  3 09 and  3 19  First quarter 2020 new business bookings are forecast between  1 1 billion and  1 3 billion 
The 2020 presidential election could be pivotal for how healthcare stocks perform this year  Cerner s customers could be affected by various proposals from the candidates  and anything that impacts its customers would likely impact Cerner as well ",2020-02-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/prcyo,2076555

146452,367967,CERN,Cerner  CERN  Tops Q4 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Cerner  CERN  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 75 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 74 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 63 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1 35   A quarter ago  it was expected that this health care information technology company would post earnings of  0 65 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 66  delivering a surprise of 1 54  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Cerner  which belongs to the Zacks Medical Info Systems industry  posted revenues of  1 44 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 56   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 37 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Cerner shares have lost about 0 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 0 6  
What s Next for Cerner 
While Cerner has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Cerner was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

146554,368069,CERN,Cerner  CERN  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Cerner  CERN  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This health care information technology company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 64 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 2  
Revenues are expected to be  1 44 billion  up 5 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cerner 
For Cerner  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cerner will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cerner would post earnings of  0 61 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 61  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Cerner doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cerner-cern-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200440748,200440748

146557,368072,CERN,Cerner  CERN  Q2 Earnings Top Estimates,opinion,"Cerner  CERN  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 66 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 64 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 62 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3 13   A quarter ago  it was expected that this health care information technology company would post earnings of  0 61 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 61  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once 
Cerner  which belongs to the Zacks Medical Info Systems industry  posted revenues of  1 43 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 40   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 37 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Cerner shares have added about 37 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 9  
What s Next for Cerner 
While Cerner has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Cerner was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 69 on  1 44 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  2 67 on  5 74 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Medical Info Systems is currently in the top 34  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cerner-cern-q2-earnings-top-estimates-200444303,200444303
146558,368073,CERN,MDRX Or CERN  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Medical Info Systems sector have probably already heard of AllScripts Healthcare  MDRX  and Cerner  CERN   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
AllScripts Healthcare has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Cerner has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that MDRX is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
MDRX currently has a forward P E ratio of 15 81  while CERN has a forward P E of 27 01  We also note that MDRX has a PEG ratio of 1 54  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  CERN currently has a PEG ratio of 1 88 
Another notable valuation metric for MDRX is its P B ratio of 1 23  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  CERN has a P B of 4 58 
Based on these metrics and many more  MDRX holds a Value grade of A  while CERN has a Value grade of C 
MDRX sticks out from CERN in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that MDRX is the better option right now ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mdrx-or-cern-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200444702,200444702

AllScripts Healthcare and Cerner are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that MDRX is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
MDRX currently has a forward P E ratio of 17 07  while CERN has a forward P E of 27 91  We also note that MDRX has a PEG ratio of 1 66  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  CERN currently has a PEG ratio of 2 07 
Another notable valuation metric for MDRX is its P B ratio of 1 33  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  CERN has a P B of 4 73 
These metrics  and several others  help MDRX earn a Value grade of A  while CERN has been given a Value grade of C

146659,368174,CERN,Cern Continues To Make Gains With More To Come ,opinion,"Following up on another stock  namely CERN which I posted about 3rd of April when the stock was trading at  65 88 per share 

So where next for Cern  and here two things are key  First  we need to see the price continue to break away from the volume point of control  VPOC  on rising volume and clear the top of the volatility indicator in the  66 area but expect to see some consolidation first  Once through here the  67 57 level of August last year becomes the next objective  and finally  if this is taken out  a longer term return to the  74 area  The region from  66 to  74 is also key for another reason  as volumes on the VPOC indicator are falling away the higher we move  thereby presenting less resistance to the advance which is confirmed with the trend monitor below 

And this is precisely where we are following last week s solid price action for the stock which closed with a wide spread up candle and closing at  72 74 on Friday  The key now for the  longer term  is whether the highs of October and December 2018 will now be taken out in the  74 per share region  It was at these levels the stock reversed with volume confirming the weakness on each occasion 
However  there are some very positive signs which suggest we will not witness a triple top  First  volume on the volume point of control histogram is once again thin with low and falling volume immediately ahead  suggesting the price will move through here rapidly  Second  we have two minor price based resistance levels  which were both cleared last week and denoted with the red dashed line  Third and last  the trend monitor remains bright blue confirming the continued bullish momentum for this stock  And with US equity markets looking to make further gains driven by the broader fundamental landscape  along with an easing in the trade wars with Mexico  this week may see the stock climb through these and so on to the next level at  74 per share and beyond ",2019-06-10,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cern-continues-to-make-gains-with-more-to-come-200430067,200430067

146739,368255,CERN,CERN Vs  TRHC  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Medical Info Systems sector have probably already heard of Cerner  CERN  and Tabula Rasa Healthcare  TRHC   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Currently  Cerner has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Tabula Rasa Healthcare has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that CERN has an improving earnings outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
CERN currently has a forward P E ratio of 24 33  while TRHC has a forward P E of 67 68  We also note that CERN has a PEG ratio of 1 82  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  TRHC currently has a PEG ratio of 2 71 
Another notable valuation metric for CERN is its P B ratio of 4 22  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  TRHC has a P B of 7 69 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to CERN s Value grade of B and TRHC s Value grade of D 
CERN has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than TRHC  so it seems like value investors will conclude that CERN is the superior option right now ",2019-04-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cern-vs-trhc-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200410831,200410831
146740,368256,CERN,Cern Remains A Buy ,opinion,"It is always dangerous to blindly follow the herd  but the consensus among the analysts is that Cerner Corporation  NASDAQ CERN  remains a strong buy  and on this occassion  I agree with them  which is unusual  There are several reasons for my opinion 
First  the recovery in the stock price from the start of the year has seen some classic volume price analysis relationships at work with Wyckoff s third law in evidence  Here we see the effort and result in agreement with steadily rising prices supported by steadily rising volume as the price of the stock recovered off the lows of  48 78 to move to test resistance at the  58 price level  denoted with the red dashed line of the accumulation and distribution indicator  As this level was tested  note how the market makers stepped in on candles 1 and 2  buying into the weakness  Notice also how the selling pressure then diminishes  until we see the sharp move higher on extreme volume  which also triggers the volatility indicator  Since then further positive signals have followed  in particular  last week s price action supported with excellent volume as the stock breached resistance in the  65 50 area as denoted by the red dashed line immediately above the volume point of control in yellow 
So where next for Cern  and here two things are key  First  we need to see the price continue to break away from the volume point of control  VPOC  on rising volume and clear the top of the volatility indicator in the  66 area but expect to see some consolidation first  Once through here the  67 57 level of August last year becomes the next objective  and finally  if this is taken out  a longer term return to the  74 area  The region from  66 to  74 is also key for another reason  as volumes on the VPOC indicator are falling away the higher we move  thereby presenting less resistance to the advance which is confirmed with the trend monitor below ",2019-05-01,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cern-remains-a-buy-200413459,200413459
146762,368278,CERN,CPSI Vs  CERN  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Medical Info Systems stocks have likely encountered both Computer Programs and Systems  CPSI  and Cerner  CERN   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Computer Programs and Systems and Cerner are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  4  Sell   respectively  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that CPSI likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than CERN has recently  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
CPSI currently has a forward P E ratio of 11 82  while CERN has a forward P E of 20 93  We also note that CPSI has a PEG ratio of 1 14  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  CERN currently has a PEG ratio of 1 52 
Another notable valuation metric for CPSI is its P B ratio of 2 43  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  CERN has a P B of 3 76 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to CPSI s Value grade of A and CERN s Value grade of C

146784,368300,CERN,Cerner  CERN  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Cerner  CERN  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 5  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This health care information technology company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 63 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 6  
Revenues are expected to be  1 39 billion  up 6 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cerner 
For Cerner  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cerner will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cerner would post earnings of  0 63 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 63  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Cerner doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cerner-cern-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200380635,200380635

A quarter ago  it was expected that this health care information technology company would post earnings of  0 63 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 63  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once 
Cerner  which belongs to the Zacks Medical Info Systems industry  posted revenues of  1 37 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 99   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 31 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Cerner shares have added about 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 8 7  
What s Next for Cerner 
While Cerner has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Cerner was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 64 on  1 39 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  2 70 on  5 80 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

146867,368383,CERN,Why Cerner  CERN  Might Surprise This Earnings Season,opinion,Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Cerner Corporation   NASDAQ CERN   may be one such company  The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon  and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report That is because Cerner is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late  which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat  After all  analysts raising estimates right before earnings with the most up to date information possible is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CERN in this report In fact  the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 58 cents per share for CERN  compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents per share  This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CERN  giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of  1 75  heading into earnings season Cerner Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Why is this Important A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises  and outperforming the market  Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better show a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and have returned over 28  on average in annual returns  see more   Given that CERN has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and an ESP in positive territory  investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings  You can see  Clearly  recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Cerner  and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaries   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2017-07-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-cerner-(cern)-might-surprise-this-earnings-season-200203613,200203613
146885,368401,CERN,Cerner  CERN   Moving Average Crossover Alert,opinion,"Cerner Corporation   NASDAQ CERN   could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective  as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for CERN broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting short term bearishness 
This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved lower by 12 6  in the past four weeks  And with the recent moving average crossover  investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for CERN stock 
If that wasn t enough  Cerner isn t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either  It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately  which is usually not a good sign of things to come 
Consider that in the last 30 days  12 estimates have been reduced  while none have moved higher  Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate  and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here 
That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead  So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for CERN  You can see

146886,368402,CERN,Are S P 500 Sectors A Suitable Portfolio Range  Not Right Now,opinion,"The USA is the world s biggest free market economy  Over many years  the value of all stocks traded on US stock markets  as judged by market cap  have traditionally fluctuated between 33  and 43  of all publicly traded issues worldwide 
Not only that  in terms of the quality of the regulatory environment  the US is among the nations where we can most trust the reported revenues and various filings   Earnings  which are regrettably the most reported upon numbers released to the public  can however be manipulated in any number of ways  no matter where the company is domiciled   Taking the mid point of that range US markets look like this 

During bear markets  history shows that very few investors elect to stick with their index funds  But in bull markets  there is a preponderance of advice given that individual investors and active managers cannot keep pace with simply buying the lowest cost passive index fund that mimics one index  Many investors have short memories and forget the carnage of previous bear markets  like March 2000   March 2003 and October 2007   March 2009  
As a result  many of us are quick to jump on the index bandwagon  The index most often employed is  I believe  the most appropriate one if investors are inclined to hand responsibility to one index  the most popular index is the SPX  the S P 500 Index  It should be  The S P 500 Index consists of all the large cap stocks  some mid cap stocks and a few REITs  in the aggregate  it is a fine cross representation of America s biggest and best  or  since we are talking market capitalization rather than corporate assets  revenues  etc   it is comprised more accurately of the  most popular   companies 
So popular have US equities become  in fact  and so disrespected are equities in the rest of the world right now that  according to the latest numbers from S P  specifically  us  spindices com  US markets now comprise 52  of total global markets 

Some may read this chart and say   Go USA  We re  1   I look at it and wonder given that this is a position beyond what it has typically been if there might be a reversion to the mean  That doesn t mean US stocks will have to fall  It might be just as likely that foreign stocks will rise  In either case  it is the biggest reason why we are diversifying our holdings at this point to include more foreign based multinationals 
I certainly haven t given up on US securities  Indeed  the biggest single position in my family accounts and many client accounts  as well as in our sample portfolio for Investor s Edge   subscribers here  is the Gotham Index Plus Fund  GINDX   I wrote about it here 
It seems the current popular opinion makes discussions of mutual funds moot   Mutual funds bad  ETFs good  Active management bad  Passive good  Lowest expense ratio  even if total return is not as good  totally excellent  Higher expense  even if after expenses total return is better  bad  bad  very bad  
The interesting thing is that GINDX is an index fund  albeit one with a twist  Its foundation is a straight S P 500 index fund  It is also a 130 30 fund  or in this case  190 90  co managed by value investors Joel Greenblatt  author of The Little Book That Beats the Market  and his partner and Co Chief investment Officer  Robert Goldstein   A caveat  this fund has a  250 000 minimum investment  but many online brokerage firms have negotiated a much lower entry price  like  5000  
I own a number of US stocks  ETFs  mutual funds and CEFs and always will  But for me the mix is changing in two ways  Here s why I believe a straight S P 500 fund is simply not the way to create an all seasons  best performing portfolio  all markets revert to the mean  RTM    For those inclined to pillory me for trying to protect client and reader portfolios from a possible decline  please remember that RTM is classic Jack Bogle  If you have 20 or 30 years until you need to tap your portfolio then RTM  even if it leaves your mouth dry and your heart beating loudly as it traces its bottom  will ultimately trace higher above the mean as well  
However  I don t personally want to own only one asset class   US stocks   even if they are divided into the subsets of US large cap  some US midcap and a few US REITs  Here are the asset classes I consider investing in 

And below  highlighted in yellow  are the most popular S P 500 asset classes that are the most popular investment choice of the greatest number of American investors 

This may look complicated at first glance  but it isn t  Just because we have that full smorgasbord from which to choose doesn t mean we have to use every one of them  Sometimes I m quite satisfied to be in only one or two of them 
There are certainly times in the investing cycle when it would be a good thing to put all your eggs in the basket defined by all US large caps  a number of US mid caps and a few REITs  Heck  for most of the past eight years that would have been as good a choice as any and better than most 
But I am a value investor  So today I have selected the primary asset classes of US and international developed market securities  be they stocks  funds or ETFs   US REITs  specific income holdings and alternatives   five broad classes that provide growth  income and risk management 
Eight years ago  companies that were selling for 11 times earnings are now selling at 33 times earnings  companies selling at a price to book ratio of 1 1 are now at 2 5  And as for investor sentiment  too many people are whistling past the graveyard hoping nothing jumps out and grabs them  These people will stick with their narrow band of asset classes defined by the S P 500 
For the rest of us  might I suggest you at least consider doing what we are doing for clients and suggesting for readers  Right now and this will change if trailing stops execute or I decide to change the allocation parameters we are about 35  long US all cap  mid cap and value funds as well as US health care stocks like Cerner Corp  NASDAQ CERN   Enzo Biochem  NYSE ENZ   and Tekla Health Sciences  NYSE HQL  
We have also purchased natural gas firms like Range Resources  NYSE RRC   Southwestern Energy  NYSE SWN   and Chesapeake Energy  NYSE CHK  which I suggested for purchase recently  and tech companies like Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  and HP Inc  NYSE HPQ   We also have about 8  of the sample portfolio in US REITs like Physicians Realty  NYSE DOC  and Ladder Corp  NYSE LADR  
We own about 10   and will own more  in the international equities arena  Some examples are Roche Holdings  OTC RHHBY   Mexico Fund  NYSE MXE  and ETF Europe Hedged Equity  NYSE DBEU   At this stage of the market cycle  we also own another 13  or so in income holdings like ETF First Trust Preferred and Income  NYSE FPE  and T Rowe Price Floating Rate Fund  PRFRX  and another 14  in smart beta funds like AQR Long Short  QLEIX  and Vivaldi Merger Arbitrage  VARAX  
It really isn t that complicated to truly diversify to protect against market risk  I happen to love doing the reading  research and analysis of common stocks  so I have quite a mix  But you could do much the same  with hopefully similar results  using just 6 or 7 funds or 6 or 7 ETFs

Ironwood Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ IRWD 

Ironwood Pharmaceuticals  IRWD  had been moving sideways for months when it broke higher in November  That proved to be a failed break out and it dropped lower precipitously to a bottom in February  It was a quick bottom with a  V  shaped recovery to the SMA confluence before a move higher in May 
It pulled back slightly to the lower Bollinger Band  and started higher again  to short term resistance last week  The RSI held in the bullish zone and is rising while the MACD is about to cross up  Look for a break of resistance to participate to the upside   
Marathon Oil  NYSE MRO 

Marathon Oil  MRO  finally started its bottoming process in January  setting a double bottom in February  confirming it at the start of March  With the push higher in April it seemed ready to race higher  but met resistance as it moved over the 200 day SMA  It pulled back the 50 day SMA and bounced slowly rising back to resistance 
Another pullback and it turned back higher  As this was happening the 50 day SMA crossed above the 200 day SMA in a Golden Cross  Friday saw a move over resistance that has support for move upside from the rising and bullish RSI and MACD  Look for a hold over prior resistance and continuation to participate to the upside

146936,368452,CERN,This Cloud Stock s Bubble Could Be About To Pop,opinion,"Athenahealth Inc  NASDAQ ATHN   stylized as athenahealth  is a cloud based provider of software and services to the health care industry  Specifically  athenahealth is an electronic health record management company with cloud based practice management and patient communication services  Although the stock has fallen 39  from its highs in February 2014  we think it has much further to fall 
It s hard to short cloud stocks in this environment  and we ve been burned before  However  there are a few tailwinds that athenahealth has been benefitting from that have disappeared  making this stock s short prospects even better  Increased competition in the healthcare cloud services space has eroded athenahealth s profitability and the company s future looks much less profitable than it did several years ago 
What is athenahealth 
Athenahealth operates in a subset of the Technology sector that serves the health care industry through the provision of electronic health records  or EHRs  This market is further broken down into companies that serve primarily inpatient customers  think large hospitals and institutions  and ambulatory customers  physician practices and clinics   Athenahealth s customers are primarily in the ambulatory market 
Athenahealth has four main segments that collect payments from physicians  customers  manage EHRs  communicate with patients and manage referral cycles  All four of these together are referred to as  Business Services   and comprise a majority of the company s revenue  Athenahealth s revenue is generated by charging a service fee based on the percentage of a physician s bills collected 
Revenue Growth is Becoming Too Expensive
Athenahealth  like many cloud companies  has seen some impressive revenue growth over its lifetime  However  while athenahealth was once growing revenues by 39  annually  growth in 2014 slowed to 27  annually 
Not only is athenahealth s revenue growth slowing  but it s also becoming more expensive  Since 2011  athenahealth s after tax profit  NOPAT  has declined each year by 43  compounded annually  The company earned a NOPAT of just  4 million in 2014  well below the company s IPO NOPAT of  7 million in 2007  As a result  athenahealth s return on invested capital  ROIC  has fallen from 14  in 2011 to 0 5  in 2014 
What s been happening to athenahealth s profits  Two words  margin compression 
Athenahealth s NOPAT margins have fallen each year from 6  in 2011 to 0 5  in 2014  Revenue growth that once came cheap and easy is now expensive  The company has a cumulative   652 million in free cash flow since going public in 2007 
A classic lesson from Finance 101 is that a highly profitable business attracts new entrants  This is undoubtedly what s been happening at Athenahealth  as a multitude of EHR companies have entered the market  which has placed pricing pressure on athenahealth s offerings 
As shown in Figure 1 below  competition has destroyed athenahealth s economic profit 
Figure 1  Competition Erodes Growth

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
Where d Those Tailwinds Go 
Athenahealth s growth had benefitted from two tailwinds 
The first is government subsidies  EHR providers have been riding a wave thanks mostly to Uncle Sam as acts such as the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act  HITECH  resulted in  to upgrade EHRs  Athenahealth especially has been cashing in on the adoption of EHRs  However  this short term tailwind is set to disappear  as the bill s funding is running out  A few years ago when HITECH was enacted  doctors were paid  44 000 to implement and use an EHR  Late last year this dropped to  24 000  and in a few months the incentive will disappear altogether 
The second tailwind is positive publicity in the eyes of the health care industry  In 2005  EHR giant Cerner  CERN  and other companies paid for a report by the RAND Corporation that predicted substantial efficiencies resulting from the adoption of electronic health records  This report helped drive growth in the EHR business and the billions of dollars from the HITEC act  Cerner s revenue tripled from 2005 to 2013  while athenahealth s increased six fold from 2007 to 2013 
However  a 2013  by the RAND Corporation said that the conversion to EHRs had failed to produce savings and had mixed results in terms of efficiency and patient care  Accordingly  the revenue growth of many EHR companies   Cerner  athenahealth  and Allscripts  MDRX   for example   is slowing or has stopped altogether  In athenahealth s case  revenue growth has slowed for each of the past six quarters  from 30  in 1Q14 to 24  in 1Q15  The company is projecting around 20  revenue growth for all of 2015  far below its 30  target from 2012 
Weak Competitor
While athenahealth is focused on the smaller ambulatory market  companies like Cerner  NASDAQ CERN  and Epic Systems  a private company  have the larger inpatient customers  Allscripts  NASDAQ MDRX  is perhaps the most similar competitor to ATHN given that they both have large market shares in the ambulatory EHR space and not within large hospitals 
Figure 2 below compares athenahealth with Allscripts  and then the two with Cerner  which focuses on large inpatient clients 
Figure 2  No True Competitor
Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  
Note how low margins are in the ambulatory EHR space  Allscripts is seeing very similar margin compression to athenahealth with NOPAT margins having declined every year since 2010 
Now note Cerner s margins  This is the market athenahealth must break into if it is to achieve anywhere close to what its stock s valuation implies  Athenahealth will have a lot harder time attacking larger customers  which are already hooked by Cerner and Epic s complex systems that will be costly to change over 
Allscripts has more than 180 000 physician users and has solutions in 2 700 hospitals and 13 000 extended care organizations  while athenahealth has just over 62 000 users  As a comparison  nearly 190 million   more than half of the United States population  are already stored using Epic Software Solutions  Roughly 275 000 doctors are already using the software as well  which illustrates the uphill battle that athenahealth has to break into this market 
These Adjustments Impact Our Thesis on athenahealth
We made several adjustments to athenahealth s reported financials in 2014 to ensure that our picture of the company s fundamentals is as clear as possible  Our NOPAT calculation of  4 million is actually higher than athenahealth s reported loss of   3 million due to the removal of  5 million in non operating expenses and  5 million in implied interest expense from operating leases  In other words  even though our data shows that the company made money last year  we re still bearish 
In addition  athenahealth has  209 million in reported debt  but  110 million in off balance sheet debt from operating leases brings athenahealth s total debt to  319 million  or over 7  of the company s market value 
Valuation Ignores Current State of the Business
Despite athenahealth s evaporating profits  competitive struggles and fading tailwinds  the stock s valuation has continued to climb higher 
To justify its current price of  127 share  athenahealth  by 60  compounded annually for the next 12 years  Under this scenario  we assume that athenahealth will achieve 10  pretax margins going forward  equal to its all time high margins achieved in 2010 
If athenahealth can  instead  achieve pre tax margins of 5   still five times higher than its current margins  and grow NOPAT by 23  compounded annually for the next 20 years    an 88  downside from current levels  Remember that athenahealth is on track to achieve around 23  revenue growth this year after six consecutive quarters of revenue decline  23  extended profit growth looks optimistic when considering the competition in the space and the downward trend in athenahealth s revenue growth and profits 
Little Stupid Money Risk
Athenahealth currently has no dividend and no buyback  It s possible that a larger competitor will buy out the company  but that looks unlikely at these inflated valuations  An acquirer will likely wait until some of the investor optimism around the stock subsides  or until athenahealth acquires even more clients at a loss to make what is perhaps the company s largest asset   its client list   even more valuable 
These Catalysts Make ATHN Far Too Dangerous
We can identify a few forces that might cause athenahealth s bubble to pop  As we mentioned earlier  revenue growth slowed to 24  in the most recent quarter  If this continues to lag behind athenahealth s promised rate of 30   investors will jump ship  A catalyst for this event is the existing HITEC subsidies for EHR adoption running dry  Finally  athenahealth insiders could dump even more stock  see below  
Follow the Insiders  Lead
In the past six months  insiders have bought no shares and sold 161 000 shares  a net decrease of 26  of insiders  total holdings  Included in this group is the company s CEO Jonathan Bush  who has continuously dumped  4 million in stock since the beginning of 2014 
High Short Interest
Short interest stands at 9 7 million shares  or almost 26  of float
