22964,244479,CHDN,Penn National Banks On Acquisitions Amid Stiff Competition,opinion,"Penn National Gaming  Inc    NASDAQ PENN   is known for its consistent business strategies and strong brand recognition  Through various acquisitions and margin improvement initiatives  its presence has become largely widespread  Notably  shares of the company have gained 47 3  over the past six months compared with its i s 15 6  growth 

 
However  stiff competition and weather related woes continue to hurt the company 
Let s delve deeper into the factors that substantiate its Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Growth Drivers
Being a leading gaming company in the United States  Penn National is known for its consistent business strategies and strong brand recognition  To this end  it is continuing to expand and leverage its brand power 
Most of the gaming companies are now banking on sports betting  following the legalization outside Nevada  Notably  the Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act  PASPA  that banned sports betting outside Nevada  The company also stated that sports betting is gaining popularity in Ameristar Casino Council Bluffs  thanks to the opening of a retail sports book at Ameristar Casino Council Bluffs in Iowa and two retail sports books in Indiana during the third quarter  It also opened retail sports book at the Meadows Casino in Western Pennsylvania during the same period 
Additionally  Penn National is known for its acquisition strategies that help it expand presence as well as improve revenue yields  The company s notable buyouts include Margaritaville Resort Casino in Bossier City  LA  in January 2018 and Pinnacle Entertainment in October 2018  Meanwhile  in the first quarter of 2019  it acquired two category 4 licenses in the bidding process in Pennsylvania 
These aforementioned strategic efforts along with increased demand for leisure services and Penn National s enormous scale will further boost its top line  The company s top line in the first  second and third quarters of 2019 increased 36 4   28 8  and 71 5   respectively  on a year over year basis 
For the fourth quarter of 2019  the company expects net revenues of  1 350 7 million  indicating an improvement of 16 9  from the year ago quarter s reported figure  Full year revenues are anticipated to be  5 310 9 million  suggesting a rise of 48  year over year 
Concerns
The company is continuously facing intense competition from various casinos  video lottery  gaming at taverns and other internet wagering services  Not only gaming services  but any form of leisure and entertainment activities including shopping  athletic events  television and movies  concerts  and travel put the company under competitive pressure 
Going forward  since the company s operations are widespread  weather related downturns affect its revenues and profitability  Having most of its properties located by water bodies  the company is vulnerable to flood and other natural disasters 
Key Picks
Some better ranked stocks from the same space include The Stars Group Inc    NASDAQ TSG    Churchill Downs Inc    NASDAQ CHDN   and PlayAGS  Inc    NYSE AGS    While The Stars sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Churchill and PlayAGS carry Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see 
Shares of The Stars have gained 60 5  in the past six months 
Churchill and Play have impressive long term earnings growth rate of 20  and 12   respectively

23055,244570,CHDN,Churchill Downs  Monarch Casino And Resort  Shake Shack  McDonald s And Restaurant Brands International Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   June 20  2019    Shares of Churchill Downs Incorporated   NASDAQ CHDN   as the Bull of the Day  Monarch Casino and Resort   NASDAQ MCRI   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Shake Shack Inc    NYSE SHAK    McDonald s Corp    NYSE MCD   and Restaurant Brands International Inc    NYSE QSR   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks   People like to gamble Though the legal wagering industry in the US has been hindered by a host of moral and ethical concerns and an inconsistent patchwork of regulations  the tide is clearly turning  and there has been a significant expansion of legitimate options for placing wagers Almost everyone is familiar with the Churchill Downs Incorporated as the home of one of the most popular and profitable sporting events in the world   the Kentucky Derby Horse race  Tens of millions of people tune into the  Run for the Roses  each May  It s so famous that simply watching on TV   whether or not you choose to wear a fancy hat   is basically a rite of passage What s less recognized is that in addition to the most famous track in the world  the CHDN company owns and operates four other tracks  six casinos  numerous OTB facilities in which horse racing fans can bet on far away races  and   most importantly   TwinSpires com  the biggest online wagering business in the US Churchill Downs has been coy so far about their plans for expanding online wagering  and with good reason  it wouldn t make sense to advertise that you re the leader in activity that remains in a moral and legal grey area If the regulations regarding betting on sports become clearer  it s easy to envision Churchill Downs  revenues from technology and infrastructure they ve already developed   but can finally deploy on a serious scale   will explode SCOTUS DecisionIn May of 2018  the Supreme Court decided 6 3 that the regulation of sports gambling should be left up to individual states  significantly reducing the hurdles that an inconsistent patchwork of laws had placed in the way of legal sports wagering in most jurisdictions The case that the court decided was a challenge to a 1992 federal law that disallowed most states from permitting legal sports betting  The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act  PASPA  prohibited states from establishing or allowing betting on sporting events  but allowed for  grandfather  provisions that allowed four states to continue licensing and taxing sports gambling operations   most notably Nevada which has been allowing sports betting since the 1940s Though it s impossible to exactly quantify the amount Americans are betting illegally on sports  the most accurate estimates are that something in the area of  150 billion is wagered each year on professional sports and high level amateur competitions   like the NCAA tournament As tends to be the case when any  previously restricted  activity goes mainstream  there are a wide range of options for consumers  In keeping with the tradition of their iconic namesake facility  Churchill Downs has chosen to address the high end of the market Their state of the art Derby City casino  opened in the Fall of 2018  is Louisville s only legal gaming facility and features 900 gambling machines in 70 different themes as well as two locally inspired restaurants and a vast gaming bar and outdoor patio  all spread over 85 000 square feet Derby City is only one of Churchill Downs  physical facilities  but it s an important testament to the company s strategy  In an environment that is bound to include an increasing amount of options for gaming customers  CHDN has correctly surmised that those customers don t simply want to make bets  they also want an all inclusive entertainment experience that includes dining  music and other amenities Twin SpiresNamed after the distinctive architectural profile of the racetrack itself  TwinSpires com is Churchill Downs  online portal for wagering  Offering gamblers the opportunity to watch high resolution live video from five tracks  up to the minute odds  handicapping data and access to all sorts of wagers   from the traditional  win place show  tickets as well as a wide array of more exotic bets It s a quick and efficient interface that Churchill Downs describes as like  having your own OTB   Even more importantly  it s a foothold in what is likely to be the future of online gaming  There will probably always be some demand for physical racetracks or casinos for gamblers to visit in person  but the economies of scale afforded by internet gambling will someday massively eclipse the in person wagering business Churchill Downs is already positioned to expand as much as the  constantly evolving  laws allow The FinancialsThe beauty of Churchill Downs right now is that their existing businesses are popular and profitable  The potential for the expansion of sports betting to wider online audiences is basically a free call option   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 net earnings has risen from  3 88 to  4 40 share in the past 60 days  earning CHDN a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    Today s Bull of the day is the gaming giant that parlayed its reputation as the most famous horseracing venues in the world   and the home of the Kentucky Derby  In addition to having premium product offerings  that company is ideally positioned to take advantage of its presence in the online gaming market The gaming market continues to evolveIt s exactly that type of pressure that makes Monarch Casino and Resort our Bear of the Day  The company operates two more traditional casino properties in markets that not only aren t growing  they re losing market share to more innovative competitors With the Atlantis Casino in Reno Nevada and the Monarch Casino in Blackhawk  CO  40 miles west of Denver in a former mining town   Monarch Casino   Resorts is positioned at the low end of the spectrum of gambling options Nevada Gaming operations used to enjoy a built in competitive advantage because they were really the only state that widely allowed casinos and people from all over the country traveled to wager and stay at those properties The widespread proliferation of other options across the country   including Native American owned casinos as well as riverboat gaming operations means that most Americans have access to Casino gambling without the long trip to Nevada The high profile Las Vegas resorts reinvented themselves as eclectic entertainment centers that included gambling  but also offered other entertainment options like waterparks  live entertainment and spas  They ve kept up the number of tourist visits by offering more reasons to come The best gaming companies are also building and maintaining a strong internet presence   which will be especially valuable as regulations regarding sports wagering continue to relax Smaller gaming properties tend to be more economically sensitive  with results fluctuating with the financial situation of their local audiences  When people are feeling relatively wealthy  they tend to enjoy luxuries like gaming  When things are tighter  trips to the casino are an easy recreational option to jettison Monarch Casino   Resort has been showing anemic  single digit growth in revenues lately and declining net earnings  even in an economic climate that includes record low unemployment and interest rates and rising wages and GDP These should be the best possible times for a casino operator  and Monarch s unimpressive results show that the company could be in real trouble in an economic downturn Recent net earnings estimates have been falling  with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter dipping 10  in the last 90 days to  0 43 share  Full year estimates have fallen by a similar amount  from  2 08 share to  1 89 Those net earnings still leave MCRI at a forward P E valuation of 22 5X  well in excess of the industry average and the S P 500 Thanks largely to those reduced estimates  Monarch Casino   Resorts is currently a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell    Additional content Shake Shack  SHAK  Going Global  Food for Thought  In a classic example of following a rather unconventional path to fuel its growth engine  popular  roadside  burger brand Shake Shack Inc  has chalked a global strategy of international expansion to better connect with its consumers worldwide  The company recently decided to open a new store in Mexico City  Mexico  to take its international footprint tally to 16   a remarkable achievement for a relatively young establishment that turns 15 this summer  What makes this expansion strategy all the more unique is the fact that the company opened restaurants in London  Istanbul  Dubai and Moscow before it reached Los Angeles in 2016  Altogether  Shake Shack currently operates about 235 restaurants across the globe with annual revenues of  459 3 million in 2018  David vs  Goliath  Despite significant international presence  Shake Shack appears to be lagging way behind its rivals in terms of number of operating restaurants  By the end of 2018  McDonald s Corp  had nearly 38 000 restaurants worldwide  while Restaurant Brands International Inc  s iconic brand Burger King operated nearly 18 000 restaurants  In 2018  McDonald s and Burger King recorded annual revenues of  21 025 million and  1 651 million  respectively  However  in spite of the skewed up numbers  Shake Shack seems to be a force to reckon with  generating 27 3  year over year growth in estimated U S  system sales per 2019 Top 200 research  The company also remains poised to claim a position in the top 3 fast casual chain operators ranked by Latest Year growth in U S  systemwide sales    The Success Recipe   The penchant for international expansion appears to be the primary driving force that has helped Shake Shack to punch above its weight  Most U S  companies usually tend to strengthen their regional presence to gain key insights about customer behavior and consumption patterns before foraying into foreign shores with different culinary tastes and cultures  However  Shake Shack has chosen the offbeat path to success as a way of hedging   cashing in on the fact that if anything went wrong in foreign territories  it would hardly have any impact on local business  The company uses local licensing companies to run stores in foreign locations  Although the core menu remains broadly similar  it tries to add a local twist without compromising on its brand image  Shake Shack mostly prefers to use American ingredients in international locations to remain true to its distinct taste  In situations where it fails to procure the raw materials from U S  suppliers due to supply constraints or trade tariffs  the company sources the items from local vendors  thus offering it an opportunity to engage more with the community  When a particular menu item with a local flavor becomes a huge hit  Shake Shack tries to introduce it in the U S  market to replicate the success story  Being a relatively small firm  Shake Shack is quite nimble  and quickly adapts to the evolving market conditions and usually turns every possible disadvantage in its favor  Moreover  as the international operations are mostly licensed  it requires comparatively less capital than the bulk of the domestic business  The company also aims to tap the huge footfall in international airports to better connect with diverse customer base  This has further created significant customer interests and generated wide publicity through word of mouth and point of purchase display  Reaping Rewards The combination of all these factors seem to be working for Shake Shack as it braces for cut throat competition with respect to price  service  and healthier menu options  Total revenues for the company in the first quarter of 2019 improved 33 8  year over year to  132 6 million  The stock has recorded average return of 45 9  year to date compared with the industry s rally of 20 8   The company is betting big on extending its international footprint and plans to open 16 to 18 licensed stores this year with an emphasis on expanding in China  Singapore  the Philippines and Mexico  CEO Randy Garutti perfectly summed up   So much of this story has been our global story  What we learned early on is that people don t want us to be a local version of Shake Shack  They want us to be Shake Shack  So that s what we do   Food for thought for the rivals  This Could Be the Fastest Way to

23056,244571,CHDN,Gaming Stocks To Consider After Macau Revenues Rise ,opinion,"Global economic worries have circulated as the enthusiasm from the temporary tariff ceasefire between the U S and China fades  Even though trade deal talks are set to resume between the two countries  any agreement is likely further down the line

23057,244572,CHDN,Sports Betting   Esports  What s Next And How To Invest,opinion,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research where Associate Stock Strategist Ben Rains dives into the latest news from the world of legalized sports gambling and esports  The episode also breaks down the companies  industries  and stocks that stand to benefit from the expansion of these two growing markets 
New reports show that New Jersey overtook Las Vegas as the U S  sports betting capital well at least for the month of May  The rise of mobile betting from the likes of DraftKings and others has helped the Garden State s nascent sports gambling market take off  And it s not just New Jersey that is ready to profit from legal sports betting   
In fact  15 states and Washington D C  now have legalized sports betting or passed legislation to introduce it soon  All of this has happened in roughly a year since the U S  Supreme Court in May 2018 struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act 
The four major North American professional sports leagues all have gambling partnerships with either MGM Resorts   NYSE MGM   or Caesars Entertainment   NASDAQ CZR    Meanwhile  the likes of Paddy Power BetFair   William Hill   Madison Square  NYSE SQ  Garden   NYSE MSG    Penn National Gaming   NASDAQ PENN    Churchill Downs   NASDAQ CHDN    Boyd Gaming   NYSE BYD    and others all stand to benefit from the continued expansion of the sports betting market  On top of that  Disney s   NYSE DIS   ESPN and other media companies have rolled out betting focused entertainment 
Along with the booming potential of the legalized sports gambling market  is professional video gaming  A few weeks ago  we talked about how Google   NASDAQ GOOGL   and Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT   plan to square off in the cloud gaming market  Now  Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG    which is the largest American mall owner  has bet on the rising popularity of esports as malls suffer in the Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   age 
Overall  global esports revenues are projected to reach an  1 1 billion in 2019  up 27  from 2018  according to NewZoo  Esports have become very popular in South Korea  China  Europe  and the U S  The industry also has the potential to overtake the NFL in terms of viewership within the next few years  as it fights to become the next global sports  At the moment  more people reportedly  video games over Netflix   NASDAQ NFLX    HBO  ESPN  and Hulu combined 
Clearly  some of the gaming giants  such as Electronic Arts   NASDAQ EA    Activision Blizzard Inc   NASDAQ ATVI    and Take Two  NASDAQ TTWO  Interactive  stand to benefit from the growth of esports  But so do chipmakers like Nvidia  and major sponsors such as Coca Cola   NYSE KO

23059,244574,CHDN,Cyber insurance premiums rocket after high profile attacks ,news,"By Jim Finkle BOSTON  Reuters    A rash of hacking attacks on U S  companies over the past two years has prompted insurers to massively increase cyber premiums for some companies  leaving firms that are perceived to be a high risk scrambling for cover  On top of rate hikes  insurers are raising deductibles and in some cases limiting the amount of coverage to  100 million  leaving many potentially exposed to big losses from hacks that can cost more than twice that   Some companies are struggling to find the money to buy the coverage they want   said Tom Reagan  a cyber insurance executive with Marsh   McLennan Co s  N MMC  Marsh broker unit   The price of cyber coverage   which helps cover costs like forensic investigations  credit monitoring  legal fees and settlements   varies widely  depending on the strength of a company s security  But the overall trend is sharply up   Retailers and health insurers have been especially hard hit by the squeeze after high profile breaches at  Home Depot  Inc  N HD    Target  Corp  N TGT   Anthem Inc  N ANTM  and Premera Blue Cross  Health insurers who suffered hacks are facing the most extreme increases  with some premiums tripling at renewal time  said Bob Wice  a leader of Beazley Plc s  L BEZG  cyber insurance practice  Average rates for retailers surged 32 percent in the first half of this year  after staying flat in 2014  according to previously unreported figures from Marsh   Higher deductibles are also now common for retailers and health insurers  And even the biggest insurers will not write policies for more than  100 million for risky customers  That leave companies like Target  which says its big 2013 data breach has cost  264 million  paying out of pocket  No  2 U S  health insurer Anthem ran into difficulties renewing its coverage after an attack early this year that compromised some 79 million customer records  according to testimony from Anthem General Counsel Thomas Zielinski at an August hearing of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners  Renewal rates were  prohibitively expensive   according to minutes of that session seen by Reuters  The company managed to get  100 million in coverage  Zielinski said  but only after agreeing to pay the first  25 million in costs for any future attacks  The company would not say what that figure was before  but it was likely much smaller  OPPORTUNITY FOR INSURERS The spate of hacks is potentially good and bad for insurers  It means they have to pay out more in claims  but it also highlights the importance of buying insurance and gives them a reason to jack rates up   As more companies realize the importance of having coverage  and insurers move in to meet that demand  the cyber insurance market is set to triple to about  7 5 billion over the next five years  according to a recent study by consulting firm PwC   But insurers are wary of the hard to predict risks they are taking on   We have turned clients away   said Tracie Grella  the global head of professional liability at insurance giant American International Group Inc  N AIG    AIG offers cyber policies that cover up to  75 million for a cyber attack  but only for companies like top global banks that have are the most adept at securing networks and mitigating cyber risk   Another insurer  Ace Group  N ACE   recently started offering up to  100 million in coverage  but only after an intensive review of potential clients  cyber security policies and procedures   Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  N BRKa  this month also launched its first cyber policies through its specialty insurance division   We will be very selective   said Danielle Librizzi  an executive with the insurer   RETAIL HIKES Target and Home Depot declined to comment on whether insurers had hiked rates or reduced coverage after massive breaches that exposed tens of millions of credit cards   Target said in a filing that it expects insurance to cover just  90 million of the  264 million of costs related to its 2013 attack  Home Depot said it expects  100 million in payments toward  232 million in expenses from its 2014 breach   A lot of the carriers have gotten burned  They are coming back with harsher and more challenging penalties   said Bob Shaker  a manager at  Symantec Corp  s  O SYMC  breach response team  Insurance buyers may be able to get more than  100 million in coverage by using a syndicate of insurers organized by a broker  Even so  some have warned they may not have adequate cover  In the wake of last year s attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment  parent Sony Corp  T 6758  said its financial condition could suffer if it were attacked again  since current policies  might not cover all expenses and losses   Sony spokesman Mack Araki said the company expects to recover  a significant portion  of the film studio attack s costs from insurers  He declined to elaborate or say if insurers had raised pricing or reduced the limits on its cyber coverage  OFFERING ADVICE Retailers shopping for cyber insurance are coming under pressure to secure their payment systems  just as homeowners are encouraged to install locks on doors and windows   Insurers are promoting newer technologies for securing payment card transactions that exceed credit card companies  requirements  such as tokenization and end to end encryption  said Ben Beeson  a partner with broker Lockton Companies   Retailers that don t do that today are going to struggle to get insurance   Beeson said  But the stringent conditions on coverage could lead to the next chapter of the cyber drama  courtroom battles   
 The restrictions and terms that we are seeing in the underwriting process now will become the claim disputes we see in two or three years   said Lynda Bennett  partner with Lowenstein Sandler   We definitely expect more litigation  ",2015-10-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/insight:-cyber-insurance-premiums-rocket-after-high-profile-attacks-365608,365608

23065,244580,CHDN,Trump s Talks Tariffs  Powell Cuts Rates  And Stocks Sell Off By 3  ,opinion,"Last week  after Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell announced to the globe the decision to cut interest rates for the first time in a decade  25 basis points or a quarter of one percent  to 2 25   the equity market sold off hard   The day after  investors were reconsidering this reaction because under any circumstance  financial instruments not related to a floating interest rate  think variable rate loans or certificates of deposits  are going to more valuable   Stocks are worth more when interest rates go down  as are bonds   Ask the professors  ask the historians  ask the investment bankers  the hedge funds  the private equity guys   You will get the same answer   It is why the investors decided to start buying stocks on Thursday and the market was flying high  up about two hundred fifty points   Mid morning  about ten o clock Pacific Standard Time  the financial markets were faced with their version of someone who must be the center of attention  and you can guess who that might be   Yes  our headline craving leader  the Donald  was at it again  over trade  announcing a further 10  tariff on   300 billion of Chinese imported goods  starting September 1    Financial markets have generally been pleased with the regulatory policies of Mr  Trump  and he is well aware of what goes on in the financial markets   In fairness to the Donald  there is a legitimate issue regarding what China s restrictions are on the import and treatment of U S  products  which has long been the case   It will probably take a good while longer to see if some sort of agreement can be reached with China   Some believe he makes policy based on the stock market  and his ongoing criticisms of Federal Reserve Chairman support that theory   The double whammy of the Federal Reserve and the Donald took the starch out of the market to the tune of three percent for the week  depends on the specific index in terms of percentage losses    As there are some of us with plenty of memories and summer squalls for the market  let me offer a bit of perspective 
A few years ago  right at this time of the year  in August  there was volatility in the Chinese markets which spilled over to the United States   Our indexes fell about 10  in the short span of maybe two weeks or less   There have been other years where hot temperatures bring hot money  and equities swoon   August is a  month where many people are on vacation  which includes the investment world   Volumes are low   Liquidity for falling individual securities can dry up   After a near twenty percent run up in 2019  it seems like the opportune time to take profits  especially when Donald is on the warpath about China and tariffs   My own thought also revolves on the kinds of equities you own   If your portfolio is full of well run  highly profitable  and growing businesses  Donald s desire for attention and other investors fragile psychological state should not be a cause for concern   July s job report came in pretty much as expected at 164 thousand jobs created  with the unemployment rate staying at 3 7    My advice is to keep your eyes focused on one or two company stocks which you have long desired  and if the price is falling and in area where you feel it is attractive  well  just keep your mind open about it

23163,244678,CHDN,Gaming Industry To Sustain Stellar Show In 2018  4 Solid Buys,opinion,The casino gaming industry has been experiencing stellar growth since the second half of 2016  The bullish trend is expected to continue through 2018 and beyond  According to Research and Markets  the global casino gaming market is anticipated to witness CAGR of 10 16  in the 2017 2021 period  Technavio estimates that the U S  casino gaming market will witness CAGR of close to 5  from 2017 to 2021 Recent numbers published by The Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau are also encouraging  In February 2018  gross gaming revenues increased 5 7  year over year to roughly  3 billion or 24 3 billion patacas  This marked the 19th month of consecutive gains and the third highest in the past year Although Nevada s casino gaming win dropped by 2 1  in January  it crossed the  1 billion mark  Notably  it was the first time in the past 12 months that revenues were in excess of  1 billion Despite the fact that demand in the space is relatively inelastic and a fixed range of consumers will continue to demand services irrespective of market conditions  there are good reasons why growth should persist over the next few years Improving Tourism Dynamics Destinations like Las Vegas and Macau are gambling hotspots  The popularity of entertainment and gambling  in both hotels and casinos  has in fact aided these cities form a tourism economy unlike any other place on earth The Chinese government is considering measures to support all aspects of Macau s economy and introduce favorable policies  These are expected to improve visitation pattern and boost tourism and traffic in the region  One such move is the approval of Macau s maritime expansion plans that are expected to aid shipping and tourism and mainland Chinese cities to offer multi entry permits  Per the Macao Government Tourism Office  MGTO   total visitations to Macau in 2017 increased 5 4  from 2016 Though tourism in Las Vegas has not yet reached pre recession levels  it is on its way to recovery  Per the year end report from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority  total visitors were down 1 7  year over year in 2017  However  convention attendance increased Governments Reducing RestrictionsGiven the prospects of taxes  as high as 25   on earnings and the fact that the gaming industry employs a large number of people  governments across the world are moving to reduce restrictions on gambling In Nevada  the government has been lowering restrictions  Also  there is a new bill that could lower the legal gambling age limit from 21 to 18 years  In few states  for games such as bets on horse racing in Arkansas  Delaware  Florida  Indiana  Louisiana  Maine  New Mexico  Ohio  Pennsylvania and Washington  the legal age is already 18 years Gambling remains illegal in Brazil and Japan but governments in both these countries are growing more receptive to the idea  which is a positive development for the industry Tribal casinos in Alaska  Idaho  Minnesota and Wyoming are also legal for 18 year olds  Although the age group is not likely to have a lot of extra cash  this could expose them to gambling at an earlier age thereby increasing potential revenues for the industry in the future Having More Money to SpendPer numbers provided by the U S  Bureau of Economic Analysis  BEA   real disposable income rose through 2017  While it peaked in June and dropped thereafter owing to the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma  it has risen again and remains much higher than it was a

23166,244681,CHDN,Is Legal Sports Betting Boon Or Bane For Casino Gaming ETF ,opinion,"Things are looking up for Casino stocks and ETFs  VanEck Vectors Gaming ETF  has gained about 7 2  so far this year  as of May 14  2018   beating the S P 500  up 1 3   on a volley of favorable happenings in the space  On Monday  casino stocks jumped on the news of legalization of sports betting in several U S  states  The casino ETF BJK in fact added 2 2  on May 14  read    
The Supreme Court annulled a federal law that bans sports gambling in a breakthrough decision that allows states to legalize betting on sports  The court ruled 6 3 to invalidate the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act    Per the older law  a person could bet on the outcome of a single game only in Nevada 
Is the New Rule a Mid Term Harm to Renowned Casino Stocks 
The court s decision now potentially permits legal sports betting in several states like New Jersey  Delaware    West Virginia and possibly nationwide  The ruling will end Nevada s monopoly on the sports gambling practice  which earns billions of dollars annually  Some states expect sports betting as a good s  per CNBC 
But since Nevada based casino operators are likely to lose on the monopoly under the new rule  the likes of Wynn Resorts   NASDAQ WYNN   and Las Vegas Sands   NYSE LVS    Nevada heavy casino companies  saw shares sliding following the Court decision  per CNBC 
WYNN was down 2 1  on May 14 and LVS lost about 0 9   Instead  companies like Churchill Downs Inc    NASDAQ CHDN   and Penn National Gaming Inc    NASDAQ PENN   benefited more on the news and added about 4 6  each on Monday

Gambling revenues in Macau jumped 27 6  in April and beat analyst expectations of an  rise thanks to solid demand  April represented the 21st consecutive month of gaming revenue gains   However  revenues are still off the highs seen in 2014  per Reuters 
Overall  the earnings picture is also positive  MGM Resorts International s adjusted earnings of 34 cents for the first quarter of 2018 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents  Total revenues of  2 82 billion surpassed the consensus estimate of  2 80 billion by 0 7  and increased 3 9  year over year  MGM China s net revenues increased 25  while net revenues from the company s domestic resorts declined 1  
Las Vegas Sands  adjusted earnings per share of 88 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents by 14 3  and increased 41 9  year over year on higher revenues  Net revenues of  3 4 billion beat the consensus mark by 6 3  and increased 11 7  year over year  The solid performance can be attributed to services across Macao and Singapore operations 
Among the trio  Wynn Resorts seems to suffer more  The company beat on both lines in Q1 but Wynn Macau revenues climbed 11 9   which fell below our exclusive non financial metrics consensus estimate of

Over the past few quarters  robust sales of Sony s flagship gaming product  PlayStation  have boosted the top line  Moreover  the spectacular performance of the company s Semiconductor business is proving to be a solid profit churner  Further  the company s diligent restructuring efforts to streamline business structure are proving conducive to operating performance 
Moreover  a number of measures taken by the company including cost reduction initiatives  lower exposure in low profit geographic regions and reduction in advertising   promotion expenses  are expected to benefit this business in the long run  This apart  we believe the company s bolt on acquisitions and strategic investments will help it expand addressable markets

23320,244835,CHDN,What s In The Offing For Estee Lauder  EL  In Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"Est e Lauder Companies Inc    NYSE EL   is slated to report fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 results on Aug 18  before the opening bell  The question lingering in investors  minds is whether this leading manufacturer and marketer of skin care and hair care products will be able to maintain its positive earnings surprise streak in the to be reported quarter 
We note that the company has delivered a positive surprise in the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 10 9   In fact  its earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 11 straight quarters now 
Let s delve deeper how things are shaping up for this announcement 
What Does the Zacks Model Unveil  
Our proven model does not show that Est e Lauder is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Est e Lauder has an Earnings ESP of  2 38  as the Most Accurate estimate is at 41 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 42 cents  The company s Zacks Rank  2 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise 
Estimate Revisions 
Let s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter has been stable over the last 30 days at 42 cents while for fiscal 2017 it has increased by a cent to  3 40  Estimates for the quarter depict a year over year decline of 2 3  while the same for the fiscal year depicts a growth of 6 1  
Further  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  2 85 billion  up 7 7  from the prior year quarter  The same for fiscal 2017 are anticipated to be  11 78 billion  depicting a growth of 4 6  from the previous year 
Estee Lauder Companies  Inc   The  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   Factors at Play 
Est e Lauder s strategic acquisitions have aided the company to enhance its portfolio  The acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced  during the first quarter fiscal 2017  has strengthened its fastest growing prestige portfolio  It has contributed approximately half the reported sales growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2017  Lately  the company invested in DECIEM  a rapidly growing multi brand company  which will also aid beauty sales  In addition to acquisitions  the company also emphasizes on marketing  through digital media and social networking sites 
Under the Leading Beauty Forward initiative  the company continues to reallocate resources and reduce costs in order to drive beauty business  After its full implementation  the company expects Leading Beauty Forward to yield annual net benefits  primarily in selling  general and administrative expenses  of between  200 million and  300 million  before taxes 
Est e Lauder also has a strong e Commerce business and expects it to be a major growth engine for the upcoming years  Moreover  the company s strong presence in emerging markets insulates it from the macroeconomic headwinds in the matured markets  Such factors combined with a solid portfolio of brands  have aided Est e Lauder s stocks to march ahead of the industry in the past six months  Shares of the company have gained 19 7  compared with the  s growth of 7 7  

Although Est e Lauder expects continued growth opportunities in the global prestige beauty industry  currency volatility  economic challenges  terrorism and social and political issues are affecting consumer behavior in few countries  In this respect  slower retail growth in Hong Kong and decline in consumer spending in France  the Middle East and in the U S  have been posing concerns  For fiscal 2017  foreign currency is expected to negatively impact sales by 2   Nevertheless  the company s strategic policies are well on track to aid its performance and overcome industry related challenges

23355,244870,CHDN,Here s Why You Should Add Wynn Resorts To Your Portfolio Now,opinion,The mecca of casino gaming  Macau  has finally returned to life  In fact  gaming revenues in the region grew on an annual basis in September to register 14 consecutive months of gains  following the extended slump of over two years  Notably  new resorts continue to attract high rollers as well as leisure gamblers Meanwhile  notwithstanding the recent shooting massacre in Las Vegas  casino players  properties therein are expected to continue to cash in on the favorable trends of an improving employment rate and positive tourism numbers  In fact  the Las Vegas Strip has been recording high occupancy rates over the past few years Therefore  given the upbeat macro environment trends  this makes it the right time to add casino companies to your portfolio  Leading developer  owner and operator of casino resorts  Wynn Resorts  Limited   NASDAQ WYNN   is one such stock  which is worth considering Notably  shares of Wynn Resorts have soared 69 9  year to date compared with the  s growth of 28 1   Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Wynn Resorts  current year earnings has moved up nearly 1   reflecting three upward revisions versus two downward  over the last 60 days  Also  the next year s earnings estimates have climbed 2 3  on the back of six upward revisions versus no revision in the opposite direction In fact  all these positive earnings estimates revision testifies analysts  unwavering confidence on the company and also substantiates its Zacks Rank  2  Buy  This apart  Wynn Resorts continues to reflect strength in several areas and should thus make a value addition to your portfolio Earnings   Revenue Growth  Wynn Resorts  current year revenues are anticipated to increase 35 1  year over year  widely outpacing the industry s projected average growth of 1 4  Strong top line growth is expected to translate to an even more robust bottom line performance  Evidently  the company s projected EPS growth is a whopping 46 8  compared with the industry average of 18 7  Arguably  nothing is more important than earnings growth as surging profit levels is often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  ahead for the company in question Focus on Non Gaming Revenues  Apart from the gaming business in Macau  the company has been increasingly focusing on boosting non gaming revenues  Given the decent visitation pattern in Macau  infrastructure development and government s efforts to increase tourism in Macau  non gaming sources are anticipated to boost revenues  going forward Additionally  Wynn Resorts  full scale integrated resort   Wynn Palace   opened in August 2016 in Cotai  Macau  The resort is poised to witness increased visits from tourists and leisure gamblers over the long term  which should fortify the company s position in the Cotai strip  Notably  such projects are expected to draw business and leisure travelers  and provide a solid platform for growth  In fact  building resorts in Asia is expected to help the company capitalize on the strong consumer spending trend in the region Expansion in Domestic Market  In order to boost performance in Las Vegas  the company has remodeled rooms at its properties and the baccarat pit  Also  Wynn Resorts  casino resort that is anticipated to open in Massachusetts in 2019 is likely to strengthen its presence in the U S  market  Further  it plans to start building Wynn Paradise Park by year end or early 2018  taking over a footprint that includes the Wynn Golf Club comprising restaurants  hotels and other entertainment options  Backed by the optimism surrounding tourism in Las Vegas and increasing visitation pattern  the company s revenues are likely to grow as well Favorable ROE  Wynn Resorts delivered return on equity  ROE  of a whopping 165 8  in the trailing 12 months compared with the industry s gain of 7 5   This supports its growth potential and indicates that the company reinvests more efficiently compared with its peers Bottom LineWynn Palace is likely to face extreme peer pressure from several local Chinese casino operators as well as the The Parisian Macao  opened in September 2016  and the Sands Cotai Central project of Las Vegas Sands Corp    NYSE LVS    Another US based company  MGM Resorts International s   NYSE MGM    2 9 billion casino hotel is also set to open in Cotai in the fourth quarter of 2017  We believe these openings might pose a huge threat to the company s business in the region in the future Nevertheless  given the company s solid fundamentals  strong brand recognition  increasing market share  focus on non gaming revenues and a fairly favorable macro environment  the stock should keep performing well in the quarters ahead  thus making it a top investment choice Another stock worth considering in this sector is Churchill Downs Incorporated   NASDAQ CHDN   holding the same bullish rank as Wynn Resorts  You can see  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Churchill Downs  current year earnings climbed nearly 1  over the last 60 days  Further  for 2017  EPS is expected to increase 22 6  4 Stocks to Watch after

23356,244871,CHDN,Time To Take A Gamble On These 5 Gaming Stocks,opinion,"The casino gaming market has seen steady growth since the June 2016 quarter and there s nothing to suggest that there will be a reversal in this growth trend  On the other hand  there are good reasons why growth should continue over the next few years 
A Little Government Support
The most important if unlikely of these is government support  Gambling is of course illegal  yet the prospect of taxes  as high as 25   on earnings is attractive and can be used by any welfare state to build schools  infrastructure and so forth  Besides  the industry employs a large number of people and therefore has an impact on the jobs market  So governments cross the world are moving to reduce restrictions on gambling 
The Chinese government crackdown on illegal fund transfers from mainland China to Macao was a big blow for the gambling business there  But new resorts with a focus on leisure rather than pure gambling are helping players return to the black  Gambling remains illegal in Brazil and Japan  but governments in both these countries are growing more receptive to the idea  which is a positive development for the industry 
Back home in Nevada  the government has been lowering restrictions and there s a new bill that could lower the legal gambling age limit from 21 to 18 years  In some states and for some types of games such as bets on horse racing in Arkansas  Delaware  Florida  Indiana  Louisiana  Maine  New Mexico  Ohio  Pennsylvania and Washington  the legal age is already 18 years 
Tribal casinos in Alaska  Idaho  Minnesota and Wyoming are also legal for 18 year olds  While the age group isn t likely to have a lot of extra cash  this could expose them to the thing at an earlier age  potentially increasing revenue for the industry 
There s also another aspect to legalization  which is the reduction of unaccounted for transactions resulting in black money  For instance  sports betting is illegal in most countries  although people spend and make millions from it  So this money often leaves the concerned country to safe havens 
A Little Extra Cash
According to numbers provided by the U S  Bureau of Economic Analysis  BEA   the real disposable income has been rising through 2017  While it peaked in June and dropped off thereafter because of the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma  it has been growing again since then and remains much higher than it was a year ago  While personal consumption has also been rising  most of the increase is in food and energy   the trend is positive for the gaming market overall because it indicates that people have more money to spend on leisure 
A Little Convenience
Millennials are a digital race  so they re used to getting most of what they need on their electronic gadgets  usually mobile devices  As a result  there is an increased focus on online gaming  including DFS  lottery  poker and casino games  Technavio says that traditional channels still account for 93  of all gaming revenue in the U S   but since the younger crowd is moving to online channels  that scenario could change quickly  So regulators are also taking stock  It s likely that online channels will be increasingly legalized going forward 
A Lot More Variety
The prospect of betting on online sports immediately opens up a new category in eSports that has become hugely popular through titles like League of Legends  Call of Duty  Street Fighter  Dota 2  etc  The participation and viewership on these games is huge and the category is likely to explode over the next few years  it s already giving away millions of dollars in prize money  given Amazon s purchase of Twitch  YouTube s launching of YouTube Gaming and even media shops like ESPN jumping into the scene to broadcast the games 
Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  via BI Insights estimates that the market will grow at a CAGR of 22  over the next three years from  500 million in 2016 to  1 billion in 2019  The firm estimates that 300 million people view eSports today and by 2020  that number will be as high as 500 million  Newzoo estimates that the market will grow from  493 million in 2016 to  1 1 billion in 2019  Market research firm Eilers   Krejcik Gaming estimates that eSports betting turnover is likely to reach  23 billion by 2020 with operators generating more than  1 8 billion in related revenue 
The increase in the popularity of gambling apps and social gambling will also be major drivers 
Another thing that can excite interest younger gamers is a skill based return to player  such as GameCo s Danger Arena  a patent pending video game gambling machine  The slot machine is designed to generate higher returns to more skilled players while also ensuring some returns to low skill players  An element of chance is also built in   
Growth Rates
The global casino gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10 16  during the period 2017 2021  according to Research and Markets  Technavio estimates that the U S  casino gaming market will grow at a CAGR of close to 5  from 2017 to 2021 
The Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau has published encouraging numbers  gross gaming revenues for October increased 22 1  year over year to roughly  3 3 billion or 26 6 billion patacas  the highest since 2014  indicating that the impact of Chinese regulatory actions have blown over  
The Nevada Gaming Control Board estimates that gambling revenues in the state increased nearly 3 3  in September 2017 from a year ago to  979 9 million with particular strength in casino revenues from the Las Vegas Strip  which grew 4 7   Reno revenues were up 9 2  
The Zacks categorized gaming market has grown revenue steadily from the June quarter of 2016 with the gross margin growing from the March quarter of 2016 and net income before non recurring items growing from the September quarter

23357,244872,CHDN,3 Stocks To Buy Ahead Of Supreme Court Sports Gambling Case ,opinion,"On Monday  the United States Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Christie v  NCAA a case that could eventually lead to legalized sports gambling throughout the U S 
Outgoing New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has pushed to overturn the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act  PASPA   This 1992 statute prohibits states  aside from Nevada and a few others  from implementing sports gambling  Now  the high court is finally set to hand down a decision that could possibly change the entire U S  gambling landscape

The decision  which is not expected to be announced   has the NCAA  NFL  NBA  MLB  NHL and casino companies on edge as the slow process begins next week 
With that said  let s take a look at three casino and gaming stocks that are thriving now  as the betting world readies for a possible industry shakeup down the line 
Wynn Resorts  Limited   NASDAQ WYNN  
Wynn is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and sports an  A  grade for Growth in our Style Scores System  Within the last 60 days  the company has received four upward earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter against no downgrades  Within this same time frame  Wynn earned the same four to zero upgrade ratio for its full year earnings 
Last quarter  this casino and resort giant s revenues soared 45 3  to hit  1 61 billion  Wynn Resorts  third quarter sales were spurred in part by a 15 3  year over year jump in Wynn Macau revenues  which hit  597 4 million 
Wynn s fourth quarter EPS is projected to skyrocket 163 34   based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  For the full year  our estimates are calling for the company s earnings to climb 57 37  
In terms of top line growth  Wynn s Q4 sales are projected to jump 17 78   On top of that  full year revenues are expected to hit  6 16 billion  which would mark a 37 9  year over year jump  What s more  Wynn s cash flow growth of 11 91  destroys the  Gaming  industry s 2 97  decline and helps demonstrate the company s growing cash position 
Shares of Wynn have surged 80 41  this year  blowing away the S P 500 s 15 51  gain  With this climb  the company s stock price currently sits right near its 52 week high of  160 00 per share  But if the company can match or top the massive Q4 growth estimates  Wynn should have no problem keeping its hot streak alive 
William Hill plc   OTC WIMHY  
This U K  headquartered sports betting and gaming company is currently Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and also scores an overall  A  VGM score  Shares of William Hill have skyrocketed almost 22  since the end of October  and the company s stock price currently sits near its 52 week high of  15 75 per share 
William Hill rocks an  A  grade for Value in our Style Scores system  with the sports gaming company currently trading at 12 28x earnings  This solid P E ratio marks a massive discount compared to the Gaming industry s 29 25 average  On top of that  William Hill s P B ratio of 2 11 matches its industry s average 
The company rocks an  A  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system  which its 5 83  full year EPS growth projection helps to demonstrate  Along with bottom line growth  the company s sales are projected to grow by 2 71   based on our consensus estimates  William Hill also offers a solid 3 71  dividend 
This gaming company also stands to gain if sports betting is legalized outside of Vegas  as it currently operates in the U S and could expand into a number of new states 
Churchill Downs Incorporated   NASDAQ CHDN  
Churchill Downs is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The company s stock price has skyrocketed 47 39  since the start of the year  which nearly doubles its industry s average  Shares of this company known for its legendary horse race gained over 6 20  on Thursday and hit a new 52 week high of  235 65 per share 
This big jump came after Churchill Downs  which owns five racetracks and six casinos  announced on Wednesday that it sold its mobile gaming subsidiary  Big Fish Games  for  990 million in an all cash deal 
Last quarter  Churchill Downs  Q3 revenues grew 4  year over year to hit  314 8 million  On top of that  the company s net income soared 92  to reach  16 7 million  The company s Q4 sales are expected to climb 7 87   based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates  For the full year  revenues are projected to hit  1 34 billion  which would mark a 2 72  gain

    Factors Likely to Affect Q2 ResultsStringent capital controls by the Chinese government and increased audits of the junket industry by Macao s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau  DICJ  in order to stop money laundering has somewhat restricted gaming revenues in Macao  Nevertheless  per the DICJ  gross gaming revenues  GGR  rose in all the three months of the quarter  thereby indicating that the casino hub is firmly on its path to recovery The company s Macao operation is thus experiencing strong growth in both its mass gaming and non gaming segments of late  given the improved operating environment there  This should propel second quarter results Also  its industry leading Cotai Strip property portfolio in Macao is witnessing strong visitation and higher hotel occupancy rates buoyed by the addition of The Parisian Macao  In fact  the resort is expected to continue attracting tourists and leisure gamblers  thereby boosting up revenues in the to be reported quarter However  the results may be somewhat hampered as concerns related to the sustainability of revenues from the VIP market linger  Also  excess supply  especially in the Macao market  is likely to reduce the company s market share and weigh on results Meanwhile  the company s focus on renovation and promotion of its Las Vegas properties are likely to result in high occupancy rates and continue driving segmental performance Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Las Vegas Sands this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here as elaborated below Zacks ESP  Las Vegas Sands has an Earnings ESP of  3 28   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 59 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 61 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Las Vegas Sands carries a Zacks Rank  2  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult Notably  we caution you against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Penn National Gaming  Inc    NASDAQ PENN   has an Earnings ESP of  8 33  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  Time Warner Inc    NYSE TWX   has an Earnings ESP of  3 39  and a Zacks Rank  2 Churchill Downs Incorporated   NASDAQ CHDN   has an Earnings ESP of  3 56  and a Zacks Rank  3 More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020 ",2017-07-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/las-vegas-sands'-(lvs)-q2-earnings:-what's-in-the-cards-200202941,200202941
23460,244975,CHDN,Can Iconix  ICON  Pull A Surprise This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Iconix Brand Group  Inc    NASDAQ ICON   is set to report second quarter 2017 results on Aug 9  The question lingering in investors  minds is  whether the company will be able to maintain its positive earnings surprise streak in the to be reported quarter  We note that the company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 45 2  
Let s delve deeper how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Which Way are Estimates Treading 
Let s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has remained unchanged over the last 30 days and is currently pegged at 19 cents  down 29 6  from 27 cents delivered in the year ago quarter  Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  61 4 million  down 35 9  from the prior year period Iconix Brand Group  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    What the Zacks Model Unveils 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Iconix is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Iconix currently has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 19 cents  Although the company s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  we need a positive Earnings ESP in order to be confident about an earnings surprise 
Factors Influencing the Quarter
Iconix has been battling multiple headwinds such as high debt  sluggish segments  performance  soft international business and a tough retail landscape  These have been weighing on the stock s performance which has plunged over 32  in the last six months  On the other hand  the  advanced 13 6  while the broader  sector grew 9 3  over the said time frame  While the industry is part of the top 25  of the Zacks Classified industries  67 out of the 265   the broader sector is also placed at top 38  of the Zacks Classified sectors  6 out of 16  

Iconix has a huge debt burden and is taking various means to reduce the same  To this end  the company has already divested non core brands like Sharper Image  Badgley Mischka  Peanuts Worldwide LLC and Strawberry Shortcake brand  which is in line with the company s focus to reduce its debt and reshuffle its portfolio  We have also noticed that Iconix has been witnessing sluggishness in the women s and men s segments in the last nine quarters 
Iconix s international business has also been reporting softer than expected results for the last few months reflecting economic uncertainty across some of its regions  In first quarter 2017  international revenues were down 8  despite double digit revenue growth in the key regions of China  Brazil  Europe and India  The weakness was due to the joint venture businesses in Canada and Southeast Asia  Though the company expects international revenue to be flat for the year  we believe the recent purchase of the remaining 50  interest in Iconix Canada will expand international business  which is a vital aspect in Iconix s growth strategy  Iconix is quite underpenetrated in Canada  Therefore  acquiring the remaining stakes in Iconix Canada will enable the company to strengthen its business in the region 
Though we believe Iconix s strategic partnerships and consistent efforts for international expansion would improve its performance in the long run  we also note that the company is currently not in good shape due to near term headwinds and might hurt results of the upcoming quarter 
Stocks With Favorable Combination
Here are some companies in the consumer discretionary sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat 
Churchill Downs  Incorporated   NASDAQ CHDN   has an Earnings ESP of  3 23  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see

23474,244989,CHDN,Markets Open Lower Despite Strong US Non Farm Payrolls  Nikkei 225 Approaches Long Term Resistance,opinion,The main event to close trading last Friday was the release of the US Non Farm Payrolls figures  with the headline payrolls figures coming in at 227 000 for the month of February   The strong numbers not only managed to surpass relatively lofty expectations  the consensus was looking for a rise of 210 000 jobs  but the numbers for December were also upwardly revised by 61 000 jobs   The unemployment rate held steady at 8 3   matching the market expectation  even with a larger labor pool for the month  Equity markets are opening lower  though  as the rally this year looks to be reaching its exhaustion point and some of the positive data was expected given the improved macro data that was seen earlier in the week Last week saw a slew of central bank meeting and this will continue this week  with four other policy meetings on schedule   The Federal Reserve  the Bank of Japan  the Norges Bank in Norway and the Swiss National Bank are all on tap but no change in interest rates is expected at any of the meetings  The policy statements will receive most of the attention but this doesn t mean that the situation in the Eurozone is out of the picture as regional finance ministers and the IMF are expected to complete its final agreement on the second bailout package for Greece and any stalling here should send the Euro back through the 1 30 level against the US Dollar Macro data today will start with the wholesale price index out of Germany and Italian GDP  and we will need to see a positive surprise in order to reverse some of the negative sentiment generated by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association  ISDA   which released a statement saying that the current debt situation in Greece should be classified as a  credit event    This was exacerbated by the latest move from Fitch  which lowered the credit rating in Greece from  C  to Restricted Default  Asian markets are following the trends seen in other areas  after Chinese macro data showed the largest trade deficit in over 20 years for the month of February  The numbers are slightly skewed because of the slowdown in business activity during the Chinese New Year holiday but the report does show that emerging Asia is not immune to the contagion effects of the global debt problems  In the US  there is no significant macro data but we will see earnings reports from Urban Outfitters  Cumulus Media  Churchill Downs  and Coleman   title  EUR USD  width  769  height  421    The EUR USD is now showing a confirmed head and shoulders pattern  as we discussed last week with prices now showing a modest bounce after breaking support at 1 31  These bounces are now viewed as selling opportunities are the next downside target comes in at 1 2970  This bearish bias is only reversed if we see an upside break of 1 3290 but the MACD shows negative momentum and this is looking unlikely The Nikkei 225 is showing a nice rally this year but we are now coming into some very significant long term resistance levels that are likely to contain prices in the coming months   The major area to watch comes in at 10130  as this is both a historical level and the downtrend line seen on the weekly charts  A break here would be very bullish but there is clearly more downside risk at this point and so short positions are preferred ,2012-03-12,Spread Betting,https://www.investing.com/analysis/markets-open-lower-despite-strong-us-non-farm-payrolls;-nikkei-225-approaches-long-term-resistance-116722,116722

Increasing attendance at the Consumer Electronics Show and strong footfall on New Year s Eve led to the growth in January numbers  particularly in baccarat revenues  Baccarat is a lucrative but volatile card game which is often a big reason behind swinging casino fortunes  Also  improving housing trends  falling unemployment and a fall in gas prices drove the upside Unfortunately  the top line growth was not uniform across Nevada  Total volume was also still down for the fifth consecutive month 2  Moving to another hot gambling destination  Macau  its Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture  Alexis Tam  has reportedly stated that the tourist capacity of the city is a  serious problem   Visitors from mainland China account for the majority of Macau tourists

106771,328286,CHDN,Capitol Report  Bill creating new horse racing authority after track deaths draws opposition from Kentucky Derby owner,news,"A Hall of Fame jockey and animal welfare advocates were among those pushing this week for a bill that would establish a new authority overseeing U S  horse racing  but the bipartisan Horseracing Integrity Act also is drawing flak from Kentucky Derby owner Churchill Downs Inc  and other industry players   Right now  there are almost no controls on what therapeutics horses are given while in training   retired jockey Chris McCarron said at a House subcommittee s hearing    The status quo   with 38 different states governing one industry with 38 different sets of rules and penalties and numerous different laboratories doing the testing using different standards   is just not working   added McCarron  who rode the winner at two Kentucky Derbies  as he backed the legislation  The bill aims to create a new anti doping authority  and it has found support amid a rash of horse deaths at racetracks last year  For example  38 horses died in 2019 at Southern California s Santa Anita Park  which has instituted drug use reforms  The legislation looks likely to pass in the House  given that more than half of the Democratic led chamber s members have signed on as co sponsors of it  But top officials from New Jersey s Monmouth Park Racetrack and the Association of Racing Commissioners International spoke out against the Horseracing Integrity Act at Tuesday s hearing  and Churchill Downs Inc
