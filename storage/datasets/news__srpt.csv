124951,346466,SRPT,Sarepta shares surge after surprise approval of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy drug,news,"By Tamara Mathias
 Reuters    Shares of  Sarepta  Therapeutics Inc  O SRPT  soared 36  on Friday after U S  regulators shocked Wall Street by approving the company s treatment for a muscle wasting disorder less than four months after rejecting the drug over safety concerns 
The Food and Drug Administration in August declined to approve the Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy  DMD  treatment  Vyondys 53  citing a risk of infection and kidney toxicity 
Sarepta in a statement said it had appealed the FDA rejection through a formal dispute resolution request 
Sarepta said it addressed the kidney toxicity issue in the drug s label  which recommends monthly monitoring of patients 
In making its decision  the FDA said late on Thursday it  considered the potential risks associated with the drug  the life threatening and debilitating nature of the disease and the lack of available therapy  
Data from trials showed Vyondys 53 was  reasonably likely  to predict clinical benefit in patients with DMD although such benefit  including improved motor function  had not been established  the FDA said 
The approval is contingent on results of a post approval trial expected to conclude by 2024  the FDA said 
HC Wainwright analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay found the FDA reversal to be confounding 
If the drug  was not approvable four months ago  it cannot suddenly become approvable without significant new data  and potentially reflects some contrived decision making within the agency   Chattopadhyay said 
Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said the change of heart could have implications for Biogen Inc s  O BIIB  Alzheimer s drug  aducanumab 
Biogen scrapped development of aducanumab in March  but seven months later surprised investors by saying it would pursue approval after analyzing additional data that showed it had some benefit  Wall Street has forecast annual aducanumab sales of nearly  4 billion by 2024 
The surprise approval was not the first for Sarepta 
In 2016  the FDA approved the company s first DMD treatment  Exondys 51  bowing to intense pressure from patient advocates even as an outside panel of experts and the agency s own reviewers questioned the drug s effectiveness 
Sarepta must still submit additional data on the efficacy of Exondys to the FDA  The company s chief executive in November said it expects to provide additional updates to regulators by the end of next year 
Citi Group analyst Joel Beatty said it was now more likely Sarepta will be able to win approval for Duchenne treatment casimersen and gene therapies it is developing 
Company shares  which were cut by half after the August rejection  jumped to  136 on Friday from a Thursday close of  100 46 ",2019-12-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/sarepta-shares-surge-after-surprise-approval-of-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy-drug-2041215,2041215

The drug originally was rejected by the FDA last year before the agency reversed the decision in December and approved it 
The newly released FDA documents outlined concerns ranging from kidney toxicity to infections to low levels of effectiveness as reasons for the agency s original rejection  some of the concerns were cited at the time of the original rejection but the documents offer more details ",2020-01-22,Seeking Alpha,https://invst.ly/plkgh,2065519
124956,346471,SRPT,FDA Documents Show Safety Concerns Over a Sarepta Drug,news,"The Food and Drug Administration released a set of documents on Wednesday that questioned the safety of a newly approved drug from Sarepta Therapeutics  NASDAQ SRPT   The drug  Vyondys 53  golodirsen   is a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy  DMD   a rare condition that causes muscle weakness and muscle loss  
Although the FDA initially rejected the drug candidate last year  the agency ended up reversing its decision in December after Sarepta successfully appealed the decision  Despite this approval  it seems that the FDA is still quite reticent about the drug and potential complications  including kidney toxicity and infections 

While many of these concerns were cited when Vyondys 53 was initially rejected last year  these new documents go into much more detail surrounding the reasoning of the agency 
What does this mean 
Although Sarepta managed to successfully contest the FDA s earlier rejection  the approval of Vyondys 53 remains contingent on the company performing post marketing studies to verify the safety of the drug  The company has also addressed the possible kidney toxicity issue by recommending monthly monitoring for patients  
This isn t the first time that Sarepta has had to deal with a controversial drug approval  Back in 2016  an earlier DMD drug that the drugmaker was developing  Exondys 51  ended up receiving approval despite some skepticism from the FDA regarding its effectiveness  Many of the issues mentioned in the recently released documents  including kidney toxicity and possible infections  were also issues that Exondys 51 faced before receiving approval ",2020-01-22,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plm86,2065602

124990,346505,SRPT,Sarepta says adverse event report for DMD gene therapy erroneously submitted,news," Reuters     Sarepta  Therapeutics Inc  O SRPT  said on Thursday it was informed that an adverse event report was erroneously submitted to the U S  health regulator regarding an ongoing study of the company s gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy  DMD  
Shares of the company plunged as much as 19  earlier after a notice from the Food and Drug Administration showed a patient in the study was reported to have developed a serious illness  The stock pared losses to close down about 7  after the company s statement 
Sarepta said its investigation indicated the report was not submitted by its employee or the study s principal investigator 
The drug safety monitoring board has recommended the study to continue after a review  the company said in a statement 
The incident  which occurred in February  involved a 7 year old boy who developed rhabdomyolysis  a serious condition that can lead to complications such as kidney failure  The patient was hospitalized for observation and discharged the following day  with test results returning to baseline  the company said 
The illness was reported in the FDA adverse events database  which on its own cannot determine whether a drug is the cause of a problem  but can signal potential risks that warrant investigation 
The FDA told Reuters that it was looking into the matter and said it does not have additional information on it 
Sarepta said the study involves two arms with one receiving the drug and the other placebo  and the patient could have been on either 
The event is unlikely to be a major concern as there is a possibility that it could have occurred in a patient on placebo  RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said 
Analysts also pointed out that rhabdomyolysis is a commonly associated risk with DMD 
In June   Pfizer  Inc  N PFE   which is racing Sarepta to be first to market with a gene therapy for DMD  reported results from a tiny early study of its experimental treatment

Sarepta already has a drug to treat some types of DMD on the market 
DMD is a rare  genetic disorder that hampers muscle movement mainly in men  affecting one in every 3 500 to 5 000 males  A lack of dystrophin can cause life threatening damage to the heart  and over time  death  often at a young age ",2019-08-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/sarepta-says-adverse-event-report-for-dmd-gene-therapy-erroneously-submitted-1950584,1950584
124991,346506,SRPT,Sarepta shares sink 17  after shock FDA rejection,news,"By Manas Mishra
 Reuters    Shares of  Sarepta  Therapeutics Inc  O SRPT  plummeted 17  on Tuesday after the U S  health regulator  in a surprise move  declined to approve the drugmaker s newest treatment for a muscle wasting disorder that mainly affects young boys 
Wall Street analysts expressed disbelief at the decision and at least five cut their price targets for the company s shares while stressing they still expected the company s second drug for Duchenne muscular dystophy  DMD  to eventually be approved 
The U S  Food and Drug Administration s so called complete response letter  CRL  on Sarepta s new treatment  called Vyondys 53  cited risks of infection and kidney toxicity and is a blow to the company as it looks to solidify its leadership in treating DMD 
 We believe the setback can only be described as odd and we cannot help but feel there is more to the CRL than the issues cited   William Blair analyst Tim Lugo wrote in a client note 
By Share of the company were trading down nearly 18  at  98 80 in trading before the bell  Wall Street brokerages  median price target for the stock  however  is still  193  a 60 4  upside to current levels 
Exondys 51  the company s first DMD treatment  was approved in 2016 against the advice of the FDA s outside panel of experts and its own reviewers  who had questioned the drug s effectiveness 
The FDA s decision cited risks of infections and kidney toxicity seen in pre clinical studies of Vyondys 53  which is also known as golodirsen 
The company said the doses used in those studies had been ten fold higher than those used in clinical studies 
 Sarepta is being slapped on the wrist for the prior questionable accelerated approval of Exondys 51   said SVB Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz 
 The FDA may be holding Sarepta to a higher standard now  but we are optimistic that golodirsen can overcome this speedbump on its way to an eventual approval   Schwartz added 
The past few weeks have been eventful for Sarepta 
The company s shares plunged earlier this month after a notice from the FDA showed that a patient on its gene therapy for DMD had developed a serious illness in an ongoing trial 
Sarepta said it was not known whether the patient had received its experimental therapy or a placebo in the trial  and that independent safety monitors decided the study should continue 
 While none of these single events are catastrophic  the cumulative effect is wearing on investor patience   Baird analyst Brian Skorney said 
The Exondys 51 drug targets 13  of DMD patients  while the newest treatment would have treated about 8  of DMD patients  Analysts have forecast annual sales of golodirsen to reach a peak of nearly  400 million in five years 
The company is also developing another similar treatment that would target a further 8  of the population ",2019-08-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/sarepta-shares-sink-17-after-shock-fda-rejection-1959094,1959094
124992,346507,SRPT,Pfizer  Novartis lead  2 billion spending spree on gene therapy production,news,"By Carl O Donnell and Tamara Mathias  Reuters    Eleven drugmakers led by  Pfizer  and  Novartis  have set aside a combined  2 billion to invest in gene therapy manufacturing since 2018  according to a Reuters analysis  in a drive to better control production of the world s priciest medicines   The full scope of Novartis   S NOVN   500 million plan  revealed to Reuters in an interview with the company s gene therapy chief  has not been previously disclosed  It is second only to Pfizer  N PFE   which has allocated  600 million to build its own gene therapy manufacturing plants  according to filings and interviews with industry executives  Gene therapies aim to correct certain diseases by replacing the missing or mutated version of a gene found in a patient s cells with healthy copies  With the potential to cure devastating illnesses in a single dose  drugmakers say they justify prices well above  1 million per patient   But the treatments are also extremely complex to make  involving the cultivation of living material  and still pose a risk of serious side effects  Drugmakers say building their own manufacturing plants is a response to rising costs and delays associated with relying on third party contract manufacturers  which are also expanding to capitalize on demand   They say owning their own facilities helps safeguard proprietary production methods and more effectively address any concerns raised by the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA   which is keeping a close eye on manufacturing standards   There s so little capacity and capability at contract manufacturers for the novel gene therapy processes being developed by companies   said David Lennon  president of AveXis  Novartis s gene therapy division   We need internal manufacturing capabilities in the long term    The approach is not without risks  Bob Smith  senior vice president of Pfizer s global gene therapy business  acknowledged drugmakers take a  leap of faith  when they make big capital investment outlays for treatments before they have been approved or  in some cases  even produced data demonstrating a benefit  PUSHING THE LIMITS The rewards are potentially great  however   Gene therapy is one of the hottest areas of drug research and  given the life changing possibilities  the FDA is helping to speed treatments to market   It has approved two so far  including Novartis s Zolgensma treatment for a rare muscular disorder priced at  2 million  and expects 40 new gene therapies to reach the U S  market by 2022   There are currently several hundred under development by around 30 drugmakers for conditions from hemophilia to Duchenne muscular dystrophy and sickle cell anemia  The proliferation of these treatments is pushing the limits of the industry s existing manufacturing capacity  Developers of gene therapies that need to outsource manufacturing face wait times of about 18 months to get a production slot  company executives told Reuters   They are also charged fees to reserve space that run into millions of dollars  more than double the cost of a few years ago  according to gene therapy developer RegenxBio   As a result  companies including bluebird bio  O BLUE   PTC Therapeutics  O PTCT  and  Krystal Biotech   O KRYS  are also investing in gene therapy manufacturing  according to a Reuters analysis of public filings and executive interviews   They follow Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc  O BMRN   developer of a gene therapy for hemophilia  which constructed one of the industry s largest manufacturing facilities in 2017  REGULATORY SCRUTINY The FDA is keeping a close eye on standards   This comes amid the agency s disclosure in August that it is investigating alleged data manipulation by former executives at Novartis  AveXis unit  AveXis had switched its method for measuring Zolgensma s potency in animal studies  When results using the new method didn t meet expectations  the executives allegedly altered the data to cover it up  the FDA and Novartis have said  One of the former executives  Brian Kaspar  denied wrongdoing in a statement to Reuters  Another  his brother Allan Kaspar  could not be reached for comment  Novartis and the FDA say human clinical trials  which found Zolgensma effective in treating the most severe form of spinal muscular atrophy in infants  were not affected  Novartis also says its investments in gene therapy production started long before it became aware of the data manipulation allegations   But the scandal has highlighted the importance of having a consistent manufacturing process for gene therapies  industry executives say   According to four of them  the FDA has stressed in recent meetings the need for continuity in production processes all the way from the development of a drug to its commercialization  By bringing production in house  drugmakers may avoid pitfalls such as the need to switch to a larger facility if contract manufacturers  capacity proves limited  executives say  The FDA is finalizing new guidelines for gene therapy manufacturing  expected at the end of the year    Manufacturing consistency is always a major concern for the agency   FDA spokeswoman Stephanie Caccomo told Reuters  Highlighting the pressures on the industry   Sarepta  Therapeutics  O SRPT   which largely outsources manufacturing  delayed a clinical trial of its Duchenne treatment in August  telling investors it wanted to avoid any questions from regulators about consistency in producing its therapy at commercial scale  ENOUGH GROWTH FOR ALL    Between the trade secrets  the cost schedules and the time lag  it makes a whole lot of sense  if you can do it  to build out your own facilities and more and more gene therapy companies have started to do that   said Krish Krishnan  chief executive of Krystal Biotech Inc   Krystal  which is developing therapies for rare skin diseases  has built one manufacturing facility and plans to invest more than  50 million in a new one it will start constructing in December  MeiraGTx  O MGTX   which focuses on gene therapies for eye conditions  estimates it is currently spending roughly  25 million a year on manufacturing  including process development  Despite such moves  however  contract manufacturers like Lonza  S LONN  and Thermo Fisher  N TMO  are confident their businesses will continue to grow due to the strength of demand   Thermo Fisher has told investors its Brammer gene therapy manufacturing division  acquired in May  could soon earn  500 million in revenue a year  double its projected 2019 earnings  Lonza CEO Marc Funk is also optimistic

125088,346603,SRPT,Trump nominates FDA head with deep ties to drug companies,news,By Toni Clarke WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump has chosen Dr  Scott Gottlieb  a conservative health policy expert with deep ties to the pharmaceutical industry  to lead the U S  Food and Drug Administration  a White House official said on Friday  If confirmed by the Senate  Gottlieb would be in charge of implementing Trump s plan to dramatically cut regulations governing food  drugs  cosmetics  dietary supplements and tobacco  Gottlieb is well known on Capitol Hill  where he has testified multiple times on hot button health issues  including complex drug pricing matters  and is viewed favorably by drug companies and pharmaceutical investors  A former FDA official  Gottlieb also sits on the board of pharmaceutical companies   Thank God it s Gottlieb   Brian Skorney  an investment analyst at Robert W  Baird  wrote in a research note   We view this as a favorable development for the sector   Gottlieb  44  is a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank and a partner at a large venture capital fund  He is a former FDA deputy commissioner who has frequently advocated a loosening of requirements needed for approval of new medical products   Scott knows how the agency works and he will move it forwards  though maybe not always in ways the agency is comfortable with   said John Taylor  a lawyer and president of compliance and regulatory affairs with the consulting firm Greenleaf Health and a former acting FDA deputy commissioner  Gottlieb was chosen over Jim O Neill  a libertarian investor close to Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel  a PayPal co founder who now advises Trump on technology and science matters  O Neill s stated view that drugs should be approved before being proven effective generated widespread alarm  Gottlieb  who declined to comment on the nomination  is unlikely to up end the FDA in the way O Neill might have  but he is nonetheless expected to bring significant change  including moving the agency to increase flexibility in the clinical trial development process  In this he will be supported by the recently passed 21st Century Cures Act which instructs the FDA among other things to consider the use of  real world evidence  to support new drug applications  This could include anecdotal data  observational studies and patient reports   People don t want to take chances with safety  but there s increasingly some clamor to be more flexible on the efficacy side   said Kathleen Sanzo  who leads the FDA practice at the law firm Morgan  Lewis   Bockius   You need to have some signal of efficacy  The question is  how much   One of Gottlieb s priorities will likely be to streamline the process for approving generic versions of complex  difficult to copy therapeutics  He has stated publicly that he does not believe the FDA has good tools or policies to move such products and has advocated the creation of different approval standards   A survey conducted by Mizuho Securities USA Inc of 53 pharmaceutical executives found that 72 percent favored Gottlieb over other potential candidates  Many described him as knowledgeable  experienced and balanced   He will be a pragmatic leader with an eye toward both expedited approvals and safety   one executive wrote  Others were less sanguine  citing his deep ties to industry  including his seat on multiple pharmaceutical company boards  as potential conflicts of interest  Dr  Michael Carome  director of Public Citizen s Health Research Group  said Gottlieb  has spent most of his career dedicated to promoting the financial interests of the pharmaceutical industry   If confirmed  he added   he will have to be recused from key decisions time and time again    CLINICAL TRIAL FLEXIBILITY The FDA has attempted to push back against moves to sideline randomized clinical trials  long considered the gold standard  In January it issued a report documenting 22 cases in which drugs that appeared to show promise in early trials turned out to be either ineffective or unsafe or both in larger trials  But it has already moved to decrease the requirements for proving that a drug works  Last year  Dr  Janet Woodcock  the agency s powerful head of pharmaceuticals  ordered the approval of  Sarepta  Therapeutics Inc s  O SRPT  drug to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy based on little more than a hint of efficacy  In doing so she overrode the recommendation of a panel of outside advisors and top scientists at the agency and set what some say is a precedent for approving drugs based on minimal data   How can you say it s OK for this company but not that company   Mark Mansour  a partner with the law firm Mayer Brown LLP said   The administration is going to be pushing for quicker approval of drugs for all sorts of diseases with similar  vociferous patient populations who are crying out for a solution   Other companies that may benefit from Gottlieb s presence are manufacturers of electronic nicotine delivery systems such as e cigarettes  The American Enterprise Institute has consistently argued that there is no evidence to show that the risk of vaping comes near to the risk of smoking   Between 2005 and 2007 he was FDA deputy commissioner for medical and scientific affairs  Previously he was a senior advisor to the commissioner and acted as the agency s director of medical policy development

125140,346655,SRPT,U S  forecasts more than 500 000 Ebola cases in West Africa,news,"By Sharon Begley and Tom Miles
NEW YORK GENEVA  Reuters    Global experts issued stark new warnings of the scale of West Africa s Ebola outbreak on Tuesday  with the U S  government estimating between 550 000 and 1 4 million people might be infected in the region by January 
The U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  said its projection was based on data from late August and did not take into account a planned U S  mission to fight the disease  so the upper end of the forecast was unlikely 
However  it followed research by experts from the World Health Organization  WHO  and Imperial College  which estimated that 20 000 people risked infection within six weeks    months earlier than previous forecasts  It warned that the disease might become a permanent feature of life in West Africa 
The worst Ebola outbreak on record has already killed over 2 800 people   more than the combined total of all previous outbreaks  The disease has marched across much of Guinea  Liberia and Sierra Leone  killing dozens of health workers and crippling economies recovering from years of conflict 
Outbreaks in Nigeria and Senegal appear for now to have been contained  But nations across the region fear contagion and  against expert advise  have shuttered borders and restricted travel  complicating international efforts to fight the disease 
 I am confident the most dire projections will not come to pass   CDC director Dr  Thomas Frieden told reporters 
The worst case scenario assumes that there are 2 5 times the number of recorded cases  currently at 5 864 
 A surge now can break the back of the epidemic   Frieden said   If you get enough people effectively isolated  the epidemic can be stopped  
Amid complaints from aid workers and regional leaders that the world was doing too little  U S  President Barack Obama last week announced plans to send 3 000 troops to build 17 treatment centers and train thousands of healthcare workers 
The U S  move has been welcomed  but it was accompanied by calls for other nations to follow suit  since the disease was still spreading faster than the moves being made to contain it 
Underscoring this gap  a senior U N  official in Liberia  the worst hit nation  said on Tuesday that 150 foreign experts were in the country but another 600 to 700 were needed 
Antonio Vigilante  head of the U N  Development Programme in Liberia  said Liberia now had 350 to 400 beds for Ebola patients  but that fell far short of the 2 000 needed 
 Even if we are at 2 000 beds two or three weeks from now  the cases we ll have in any single day may be more than that   he said 
HORRENDOUS  SCARY
Much of the international medical assistance has been provided by French medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres  MSF   However  the group says it is overwhelmed and has called for states to send their medics to the region  The response so far has been muted 
 We have announcements that more will come but very small numbers   Vigilante added   The American military are bringing in a camp hospital  but it is for 25 beds with medical staff  And so there are still very few  
In a bid to fill the void  Liberia is now planning to train some 40 000 community workers 
Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf called the CDC predictions  horrendous  and  scary   But now that structures had been put in place  he said  the U S  effort would help ensure the outbreak would decline as fast as it spread 
 I believe that  given another couple of weeks  we shall see that this major effort begins to show results   she said  via Skype to an audience at Georgetown University in Washington  DC 
Experts from the WHO and Imperial College were less optimistic  In an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine  they warned that infections could reach 20 000 by November if strict controls were not put in place 
 With exponential growth  you ll see that the case numbers per week go up  so that by the second of November  over these three countries our best estimate is over 20 000 cases  confirmed and suspected cases   said Dr  Christopher Dye  WHO director of strategy and co author of the article 
The WHO forecast last month it would take nine months to reach this level of infections  Dye said nearly 10 000 of those would be in Liberia  5 000 in Sierra Leone and nearly 6 000 in Guinea 
EBOLA PERMANENT
A spokesman for Sierra Leone s army said it had sealed off its borders with Liberia and Guinea  joining similar actions by countries in the region  The move went against a pledge by Africa s leaders at the African Union to lift restrictions 
 Our troops are on the borders to stop the movement  especially of vehicles   said army spokesman Col  Michael Samura  Witnesses in Kambia  a town bordering Guinea  said dozens of vehicles were turned back on both sides of the frontier 
With the United States taking the lead in Liberia  a nation established by freed American slaves  the British government said on Tuesday it was stepping up its military and humanitarian mission in Sierra Leone  a former colony whose civil war it helped end just over a decade ago 
About 40 military personnel are on the ground helping install a planned 700 new beds  and 164 staff from Britain s National Health Service have volunteered to work in West Africa  They join nations like Cuba  China  Uganda and France who have already promised or sent medics to the region 
Underscoring the economic impact of the crisis  Malaysian palm oil firm Sime Darby  KL SIME  has delayed construction of a mill for its Liberia plantation and has frozen talks to expand its planted acreage there because of the outbreak 
Meanwhile  the Wellcome Trust said experimental drugs  including compounds from Mapp Biopharmaceutical  Sarepta  O SRPT  and Tekmira  TO TKM   will be tested in affected states for the first time in a bid to fast track trials 
Dye  the WHO expert  said that if current efforts are fully successful  Ebola will disappear from the human population and return to its animal reservoir  as it has done in other outbreaks in Central Africa where it is relatively common 
But he warned that if control efforts are only partly successful  Ebola viral disease in the human population could become  a permanent feature of life in West Africa  

 Quite honestly if you ask  can we stamp Ebola out of Liberia   I m not sure  In principle we know how to do it  but can we do it on the ground  It remains to be seen

125157,346672,SRPT,BTIG  New Data Could Propel These 3 Biotech Stocks Higher in 2020,opinion,For those who like patterns  biotech names  growth stories tend to look remarkably similar  These stocks are less reliant on earnings reports and more on a few select markers which can decide what direction they will take in the near term  A favorable outcome from a regulatory committee or promising data from a clinical trial can send the stock soaring  Conversely  rejection or disappointing readouts can send the company s share price tumbling down  While they present possible mercurial upside  these tickers aren t for the faint of heart because although the patterns usually play out  the direction they might take is very hard to predict So  how should investors choose which biotechs to invest in  There are different strategies  of course  but one trusted way is to listen to the experts  Investment bank BTIG is a well known name on the Street  housing several top analysts  The company has

the dreaded CRL  complete response letter  from the FDA following its original submission  As is de rigueur in the sector  Sarepta stock responded to the announcement by soaring over 30  in a day In addition to the recently approved drug  the genetic disorder focused biotech has a robust pipeline  with gene therapy programs in DMD and LGMD  Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy   BTIG s Tim Chiang believes the company is steadily progressing with these key programs The analyst said   We believe SRPT is making progress on the gene therapy manufacturing front  and has achieved yields sufficient to begin study 301  which we think could enroll up to a hundred or more patients   We believe SRPT plans to provide an interim look at data from this study in  15 patients dosed  evaluating expression levels at  3 months post dosing   In LGMD2E  SRPT has dosed two patients in the higher dose cohort  with a third patient to be dosed shortly  We expect a data read out from this high dose arm in early 2Q  Chiang expects that US gene therapy sales in the DMD market will reach a peak in 2024  with the figure landing at roughly  2 billion  There are three companies currently in the race to develop gene therapies for the treatment of DMD  Sarepta  according to the analyst  is leading the way and could be the first to enter the US market with its gene therapy for DMD in the second half of 2021 Chiang added   We think one of the key differences among the 3 micro dystrophin gene therapy programs in the clinic are that both Solid Biosciences  SLDB  Neutral  and Pfizer have studies where ascending dose cohorts are being utilized  In contrast  Sarepta s study incorporates just one dose  2E14 vg kg   So  what does this mean  It means Chiang kept his Buy rating on Sarepta  along with a price target of  190  Should the target be met  investors stand to see a handsome 64  gain over the next year   To watch Chiang s track record  click here The Street  too  is bullish on the DMD fighter  A Strong Buy consensus rating breaks down into 18 Buys and a single Hold  The average price target comes in at  204 33 and indicates potential upside of 76    See Sarepta stock analysis on TipRanks IMV Inc   IMV IMV s market performance in 2019 was a disappointing affair  The stock lost 39  of its value along the way  By contrast  2020 s performance so far has been the exact opposite   and some  The stock is up by 58  year to date  According to BTIG s Thomas Shrader  there is more to come  too The cancer fighter s lead candidate is DPX Survivac  which targets the surviving TAA  tumor associated antigen  that is overexpressed in more than 20 different types of cancers  Clinical data so far has been promising  with long disease free intervals in the ovarian cancer  OC  adjuvant setting and compelling treatment response rates in both OC and DLBCL  diffuse large B cell lymphoma   Important DPX Survivac data is expected this quarter which Shrader notes  could greatly de risk the current programs and potentially demonstrate the utility of the low COGS DPX platform to deliver many other TAAs and neoantigens  The 5 star analyst added   The drug has shown robust and prolonged CD8 TCell responses in the adjuvant setting and a Phase 1b 2 trial has shown a 100  DCR and 60  ORR in the subgroup of patients with non bulky disease  tumor burden   5 cm  most of which are platinum resistant  few treatment options   The company expects to provide topline Phase 2 monotherapy data in mid February 2020 that we expect to be an important catalyst for the story  Ahead of this upcoming data readout  Shrader is siding with the bulls  The analyst initiated coverage of IMV with a Buy rating along with an  8 price target  The implication  Further gains in the shape of 75  over the next 12 months   To watch Shrader s track record  click here The Street agrees  A total of 6 Buys add up to a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating  With an average price target of  9 31  the analysts see potential upside of 104  for IMV over the coming 12 months   See IMV stock analysis on TipRanks Cue Biopharma Inc   CUE A fellow company taking the fight to cancer is Cue Biopharma  In 2019  Cue s exceptional performance beat the market considerably  The stock added an astounding 238  to its share price throughout the year  Following such a surge  though  is this the right time to get in on this high flying biotech Yes  it is  according to BTIG s Thomas Shrader  In fact  the 5 star analyst just recently initiated coverage of Cue with an emphatic Buy rating  The thumbs up comes with a price target of  26  indicating Shrader believes an additional 71  will be added to Cue s share price over the next 12 months So  what s all the fuss about  then  A cure for cancer is one of modern medicine s most coveted prizes  Cue is working on an immunotherapy platform which will assist immune systems by recognizing solid tumor cells and repeatedly attacking them until they stop working The company s lead candidate is CUE 101  which was developed for patients with head and neck cancer driven by human papillomavirus  HPV   Topline results from a Phase 1 trial are expected later this year  and so far  results have been promising Shrader said   Data to date is preclinical but the lead programs termed CUE 101 has exploited well defined subunits and demonstrated tumor antigen specific T cells responses without the accompanying systemic immune toxicities that characterize many competing approaches  Preclinical data confirm both robust T Cell responses and an attractive safety profile setting the stage for clinical studies  These studies have stated  first dosing September 2019  and  based on the preclinical safety profile  will begin with doses that could be efficacious   Clinical data validating the overall approach are expected around 3Q20 and  if promising  a significant pipeline in additional applications should be de risked  Currently  the rest of the Street remains rather quiet on Cue  with only one other analyst chipping in with a take on the biotech s prospects  The additional Buy recommendation means Cue receives a Moderate Buy consensus rating  The average price target comes in at  24 and implies upside potential of 58    See Cue Biopharma stock analysis on TipRanks ,2020-02-03,TipRanks,https://invst.ly/pqa3l,200503861

125219,346734,SRPT,4 Biotechs That Are Potential Buyouts Post Celgene Deal  ,opinion,"The new year began with a bang for the pharmaceuticals biotech industry  Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY    one of the largest pharma giants  announced that it will acquire the leading biotech company Celgene   NASDAQ CELG   for a whopping  74 billion in what could be one of the largest acquisitions in recent times   Following suit  another large cap pharma company Eli Lilly   NYSE LLY   is all set to acquire Loxo Oncology for  8 0 billion to broaden its oncology portfolio   Meanwhile  Japan based Takeda Pharmaceutical completed its buyout of Irish company Shire plc The biotech sector took a beating in 2018 which makes the valuations more attractive  Evidently  the spotlight is back on mergers   acquisitions in the healthcare space  While it is true that last year too started on a cheerful note with expectations of a ramp up in M A activity  propelled by the implementation of the new tax law  thereby leaving more cash in the hands of companies  the deals however  dried up after the initial euphoria Key acquisitions in 2018 included Bayer s takeover of Monsanto  NYSE MON  for  63 billion  Novartis snapping up AveXis  Inc  and Endocyte plus Sanofi  PA SASY  grabbing Ablynx and Bioverativ  Celgene s buyout of Juno Therapeutics  Alexion s acquisition of Sweden based Wilson Therapeutics and Syntimmune et al  GlaxoSmithKline plc has also announced an agreement to acquire commercial stage biopharmaceutical company Tesaro  Inc with a focus on oncology The landscape in the drug biotech sector is rapidly changing  A slowdown in mature products due to increasing competition and rise of biosimilars has forced most pharma bigwigs to eye lucrative acquisitions to bolster their pipeline  Small tuck in acquisitions are quite frequent too  While amalgamation of complementary product portfolios and overlapping pipelines are a key reason for mega deals  smaller biotechs are generally bought owing to innovative pipelines Cost synergies in research and development  R D  plus sales and marketing are also added benefits  The larger players with huge wads of cash are under a lot of pressure to make strategic acquisitions and diversify their revenue base  Moreover  it makes sense for these companies to buy innovative small mid cap biotech companies and boost their pipeline rather than developing a drug from scratch and invest both several years and millions in it However  these acquisitions do not always shape up as planned and come with their respective set of risks  Companies like Bausch Health among others kept acquiring smaller and mid size players irrespective of the burden it imposed on the balance sheet  which eventually resulted in shambles  While the Celgene acquisition does look positive prima facie for Bristol Myers  it will induce a huge debt load as well for the latter  In addition  any acquisition of this magnitude comes with its own set of integration perils  Moreover  some of Celgene s shareholders also believe that the company has better prospects on a standalone basis and might not give a nod to the acquisition 
Nevertheless  walking the lines of Bristol Myers and Eli Lilly  we expect a surge in M A activity during 2019 in the overall drug biotech sector as the companies look to use huge cash trunks and combat rivalry woes  Oncology and Immuno oncology are a key area of focus  Quite a few biotechs with promising oncology treatments are on the radar as companies like Pfizer  NYSE PFE  and Roche gear up to strengthen their portfolio Here  we discuss a few large mid cap biotech companies  which are likely acquisition targets with rewarding product portfolios and a deep pipeline of candidates with innovative treatments for diseases like NASH with an unmet need promising huge potential Alexion Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALXN  Alexion primarily focuses on developing and commercializing drugs for the treatment of patients with ultra rare disorders  The market potential of such drugs is significant with less competitive pressure  Alexion s blockbuster drug  Soliris  approved for the treatment of two severe and ultra rare disorders resulting from chronic uncontrolled activation of the complement component of the immune system   paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria  PNH    and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome  aHUS    continues to perform well  The FDA approval of the generalized myasthenia gravis indication has boosted the drug prospects further Alexion received a substantial boost from the recent FDA approval of its long acting C5 complement inhibitor  Ultomiris  for treating adult patients with PNH  to be administered every eight weeks  The FDA approval comes well ahead of its action date set for Feb 18  2019  The nod will strengthen Alexion s PNH franchise With a market capitalization of  24 1 billion  this company is a hot target for the big shots looking to build up a place in the rare diseases market Incyte Corporation   NASDAQ INCY  Wilmington  DE based Incyte Corporation is another company on the horizon with a first in class JAK1 JAK2 inhibitor  Jakafi  approved for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera  PV   Its label has been updated several times since the approval and the prospects look good  The company is keen to expand the drug s label further  which should boost sales  Its second JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor  Olumiant  baricitinib  JAK1 JAK2 inhibitor   was developed in collaboration with Eli Lilly  The drug is approved for rheumatoid arthritis  RA  both in the United States and Europe  Moreover  the company has several candidates in early to mid stage development in its pipeline including both targeted and immune therapies that are currently developed in oncology and outside it With a market capitalization of  15 8 billion  Incyte has high chances of being acquired by one of its co developers like Novartis or Eli Lilly or another behemoth from the same space like Gilead  NASDAQ GILD  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ REGN  Tarrytown  NY based Regeneron is one of the leading biotech companies with a very strong and varied portfolio  Its pipeline boasts marketed drugs like Eylea  for several eye diseases   Dupixent  atopic dermatitis  and Praluent  heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia  among others  Regeneron s key growth driver  Eylea  consistently performs well and its label expansion into additional indications has further boosted growth for the company  Dupixent too has driven overall performance  The company is working to expand Dupixent s label further for several other indications  This should widen the company s revenue stream and reduce dependence on Eylea  Last September  the FDA approved its immuno oncology therapy  Libtayo  for treating patients with metastatic or locally advanced CSCC  The company has a deep and diverse pipeline With a market cap of  42 9 billion  this top biotech has surely grabbed eyeballs and a bidding war can be expected in the near term Sarepta Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ SRPT  A relatively smaller biotech company as compared to the ones mentioned above with a market cap of  7 7 billion  Sarepta Therapeutics has arrested attention  mainly because of the prospects of it sole marketed drug Exondys 51  which has witnessed impressive growth  Exondys 51 is the first approved disease modifying therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy  DMD  in the United States  The company primarily focuses on the discovery and development of RNA based therapeutics targeting rare and infectious diseases  Sarepta is looking to build its DMD pipeline beyond Exondys 51 by developing other exon skipping treatments and the company has about eight exon skipping candidates in its pipeline A few setbacks notwithstanding  the company s follow on exon skipping and gene therapy pipeline candidates represent the most comprehensive approach to treat DMD ConclusionGiven the money spinning valuations  we expect a lot of M A activity in the biotech space in 2019 Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin

125224,346739,SRPT,Sarepta  SRPT  Q4 Earnings Lag Estimates  Exondys 51 Sales Up,opinion,Sarepta Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ SRPT   incurred an adjusted loss of 85 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2018  wider than the year ago loss of 21 cents per share as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 66 cents  The widening year over year loss can be primarily attributed to a significant rise in operating expenses Notably  the adjusted figure excluded one time items  depreciation   amortization expenses  interest expenses  and income tax benefit  Including all these items  the company incurred a loss of  2 05 per share compared with a loss of 37 cents in the year ago quarter Meanwhile  Sarepta s Exondys 51   the first Duchenne muscular dystrophy   DMD   treatment to gain approval in the United States   continued with its strong performance  Sarepta recorded total revenues of  84 4 million  up 7 5  sequentially  entirely from the sale of Exondys 51  The demand for the drug has increased during the quarter  However  the top line marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  84 91 million  In the prior year quarter  Sarepta had earned revenues of  57 3

disease that mostly affects boys and can be fatal before patients turn 30 Operating ExpensesAdjusted research and development  R D  expenses totaled  77 million in the fourth quarter  up 87 8  year over year  The upside was driven by increased patient enrollment in late stage golodirsen study and ramp up of manufacturing activities for pipeline candidates  including gene therapies  and higher costs due to pipeline expansion  The metric was partially offset by lower cost related to clinical studies evaluating Exondus 52 Selling  general   administrative  SG A  expenses were  52 9 million  up 101 9  year over year  Higher costs related to the global commercial expansion of its products and increased personnel expenses led to the uptick Cost of sales was also higher  reflecting higher inventory costs due to rising demand for Exondys 51 and royalty payments to BioMarin   NASDAQ BMRN    per the terms of the 2017 settlement and license agreements related to the latter s exon skipping technology used in DMD therapies Full Year ResultsSarepta recorded 2018 sales of  30 1 million  up 94 7  year over year  solely from the sale of Exondys 51  The company incurred adjusted loss of  2 14 per share  wider than the year ago loss of  1 34 per share  The year over year loss despite solid sales growth was due to rising costs to support global expansion for Exondys 51 and development of golodirsen  and gene therapies as well as higher royalty payments to BioMarin Exon Skipping Pipeline UpdateSarepta is building its DMD pipeline  which will enhance its approved drug portfolio  The pipeline candidates  on approval  will be eligible to treat a larger patient population than Exondys 51  Currently  the company has about eight exon skipping pipeline candidates  which can treat 75 80  of DMD patients  Sarepta is also developing gene therapies for treating DMD Earlier this month  the FDA granted priority review to the new drug application   NDA   seeking accelerated approval for golodirsen  A decision is expected by mid August  This apart  Sarepta is planning to submit a new drug application for its second DMD candidate  casimersen  by mid 2019  if study data confirms preclinical dystrophin expression An approval to golodirsen NDA is likely to boost Sarepta s top line as the drug will increase the eligible patient population by 8   The company is planning to have three approved exon skipping drugs   including Exondys 51  golodirsen and casimersen   in its portfolio by the first quarter of 2020  following which it expects the eligible patient population to

125257,346772,SRPT,Solid  SLDB  Surges As FDA Lifts Clinical Hold On DMD Drug ,opinion,"Shares of Solid Biosciences Inc    NASDAQ SLDB   surged 10 9  after the company announced that the FDA has lifted the clinical hold on its phase I II trial  IGNITE DMD  for its experimental candidate  SGT 001 
SGT 001  Solid Biosciences  lead candidate  is a microdystrophin gene transfer  which is being evaluated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy  DMD  
The clinical hold was lifted as the FDA acknowledged that Solid Biosciences satisfactorily addressed all the issues raised 
The news gave investors much to cheer as SGT 001 is Solid Biosciences  lead candidate  Solid Biosciences  stock has gained 29 9  in the year so far  compared to the  s loss of 6 8  

 
It has been a bumpy ride for Solid Biosciences so far  with the development of SGT 001 
We remind investors that the FDA had placed a clinical hold on IGNITE DMD  following the report of a serious adverse event  SAE  in the first patient dosed with SGT 001  The first patient dosed in the trial was a non ambulatory adolescent  who received 5E13 vg kg of SGT 001 on Feb 14  2018 
However  the patient was hospitalized due to laboratory findings  which included a decrease in platelet count  followed by a reduction in red blood cell count and evidence of complement activation  The event was classified as a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  SUSAR  
Earlier  Solid Biosciences filed an Investigational New Drug application  IND  for SGT 001 in September 2017 and initiated a phase I II trial during the fourth quarter of 2017  In November 2017  the FDA notified Solid Biosciences that the company was not permitted to dose patients in the higher dose group of IGNITE DMD  due to a partial clinical hold primarily related to the number of vials and manufacturing lots utilized per patient as well as manufacturing processes to support the higher dose group  The issue was subsequently resolved 
Nevertheless  since the hold has been lifted  Solid Biosciences plans to resume the trial and reinitiate enrollment as quickly as possible after making the required changes 
We note that SGT 001 has been granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation  or RPDD  in the United States  and Orphan Drug Designations in both the United States and the European Union 
Solid Biosciences plans to enroll and dose several children  prior to dosing additional adolescents  Moreover  Solid Biosciences can now also obtain the intermediate muscle biopsy at 45 days  post administration of SGT 001  to collect additional information about the time course of microdystrophin expression  Initial data from a pre specified interim analysis of IGNITE DMD is expected in the second half of 2019 
Another company with a presence in the DMD market is Sarpeta Therapeutics   NASDAQ SRPT   with Exondys 51  which is the first approved disease modifying therapy for DMD in the United States 
Gene therapy has gained a lot of attention  of late  as quite a few companies are investing a lot of their R D spend for developing candidates using gene therapy  Axovant Sciences   NASDAQ AXON   recently licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize AXO LentiPD from Oxford BioMedica for Parkinsons  disease 
uniQure   NASDAQ QURE   is another gene therapy company  which is advancing a pipeline of proprietary and partnered gene therapies to treat patients with liver metabolic  central nervous system and cardiovascular diseases

Calithera Biosciences  Inc    NASDAQ CALA   and GlycoMimetics  Inc    NASDAQ GLYC   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  5 Top Ranked Drug Stocks That Are Broker FavoritesThe pharma and biotech sectors have made a nice comeback this year with the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gaining 11 7   while the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index is up 17 7  year to date  This is in sharp contrast to 2016  which saw pharma and biotech stocks under a lot of pressure with the sector facing intense criticism for rising drug prices Drug pricing was not the only reason for the sector s underperformance last year  A fewer number of drug approvals  high profile pipeline failures  slower than expected new product launches and increasing competition were some of the other factors that weighed on the sector However  factors like ramp up in new product sales  R D success and innovation  strong results  a higher number of FDA approvals and continued strong performance from key products have contributed to a sustained recovery in the sector in 2017 Importantly  investors now seem more comfortable with the drug pricing scenario and are focusing more on the fundamentals of the sector  So what are the factors that could drive the sector s performance  First and foremost  this is an industry that will continue to witness demand for its products given an aging population and the increasing prevalence of a wide variety of diseases  Strong pipelines  innovative treatments  impressive results  and increased health care spending should support growth  A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow down innovation should also provide benefits  The sector will receive an additional boost if more mergers   acquisitions  M As  are announced in the coming quarters But drug pricing will remain a headline risk until there is more clarity on the situation  Other challenges for the sector include the growing presence of biosimilars  generic competition  a slowdown in the growth of legacy products and major pipeline setbacks How to Pick WinnersAnyone interested in biotech and pharma stocks will know that it could be challenging to pick winners in this  high risk   high returns  industry which is constantly growing and changing  Companies which hit the bull s eye become overnight success stories with shares doubling or even tripling on positive news  However  negative outcomes have an equally strong effect on the shares and failure may very well spell doom for these companies In such a scenario  let s take a look at stocks preferred by analysts who have a deep knowledge and understanding of the industry and its companies  We have zeroed in on five stocks with the help of our    these stocks

125294,346809,SRPT,7 Stocks Ready To Climb 30  In 2018,opinion,"Stock Market Momentum Continues
Here are seven momentum stocks that increased by at least 30  this year and still have another 30  upside going into 2018 
For the 86th time since the 2016 presidential election  the Dow Jones industrial average closed at a record high on Monday  December 18  This means that 34  of all trading sessions in 2017 closed at new highs and there are still eight trading days left in the year  251 total trading days in 2017  
The S P 500 also increased on Monday by roughly 0 5   to finish at its own record high of 2 690  The market continues to gain momentum heading into 2018 as the long awaited tax bill inches closer to passing  Many expect a deal to be achieved before the end of the year 
As a result  the S P 500 has climbed 20 1  in 2017 while the Dow Jones has moved 25 4  higher  Many academics are calling this bull market a  momentum effect  which is simply the tendency of winning stocks to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing due to investor behavioral biases  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift even if the stock s valuation becomes unreasonable 
With no signs of this  momentum market  cooling down anytime soon  I decided to search for momentum stocks that have  1  increased by at least 30  in 2017 and  2  still have another 30  upside potential going into 2018 
I determined which stocks still have upside potential by using the finbox io Fair Value estimate  This estimate is derived by applying a combination of valuation and risk models like discounted cash flow analysis  dividend discount model  comparable companies multiples  earnings power value and more 
To find these momentum stocks  I applied the following filters in finbox io s stock screener 
YTD Stock Price Change   30 0 
finbox io Upside   30 0 
Fair Value Uncertainty is not very high
Market Capitalization    500 million

This momentum investing strategy is not for the faint hearted as it typically calls for investors to  buy high   Many value investors dislike the strategy because it can often result in purchasing shares at a premium valuation 
However  this is why I added finbox io s fair estimates to the stock screen to make sure each stock is still trading at a reasonable level  Therefore  investors looking to ride the current bull market into 2018 may want to consider the companies listed above

125295,346810,SRPT,Bioscience IPOs Takes Advantage Of Biotech Bull Market,opinion,"The biotech market has recovered from its doldrums of the past two years while not reaching the excessive heights of 2015  and we have already witnessed a few biotech companies go public with good results such as Menlo Therapeutics  NASDAQ MNLO   And on Friday  Solid Biosciences  NASDAQ SLDB  debuted with a strong start  with the stock reaching a high of  29 25 before falling down to  23 at the close of trading  The company set an initial price of  16 and raised  125 million 
However   16 was not Solid s original price  as it was forced to lower the price from  18 to  19 after a disclosure which should spark some concerns  In fact  while there is no doubt that Solid s treatment is useful  there are warning signs about this company s drug pipeline and the degree of its losses  Investing in biotech always carries risks  but Solid Biosciences  especially at its current elevated price  has too much for the moment 
Viable Gene Therapy 
Solid Biosciences is a gene therapy company that is working on developing a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy  DMD   Solid Biosciences states in its SEC report that  DMD is a progressive  irreversible and ultimately fatal disease that affects approximately one in every 3 500 to 5 000 live male births and has an estimated prevalence of 10 000 to 15 000 cases in the United States alone  
There is only one FDA approved treatment for DMD called Exondys 51  which is held by Sarepta Therapeutics  NASDAQ SRPT   Exondys 51 only works on 13 percent of DMD patients and yet Sarepta s stock has more than doubled over the past year 
Sarepta s example shows that if Solid Biosciences can develop a successful DMD treatment  the sky is the limit  Solid Biosciences intends to use a gene therapy treatment called SGT 001  and a Phase I II clinical study began in the fourth quarter 
But there are serious questions about SGT 001 s viability  James Wilson  a scientist who has been working on gene therapy s abilities to cure hereditary diseases like DMD for decades  recently resigned from Solid s Scientific Advisory Board due to concerns of the possible risks of some of its methods 
And on Thursday  one day before its IPO  Solid announced that SGT 001 had been placed on a late clinical hold by the FDA in November  The company can still do the clinical study with a low dose group of patients  but cannot evaluate SGT 001 s effects at a high dosage  Solid was forced to lower its IPO price as noted above 
Solid states of the hold that they do  not expect that the overall timing for clinical development of SGT 001 will be affected  by the hold  However  they do state that if the hold is not lifted  it would negatively affect overall development  And there is also the ethical problem of that Solid knew about this hold back in November  but sat on this information during the roadshow until the very last moment and has not provided a satisfactory explanation why they concealed it  Many companies would have cancelled the IPO completely in response to news like this  but Solid just made a slight revision to its initial price 
Getting More Cash
Like most emerging biotech companies  Solid has no revenue worth mentioning and will not see its treatment successfully developed for years  Furthermore  its current losses will continue to increase as development becomes more complicated  Solid Biosciences had a net loss of  6 6 million in 2015  which increased to  38 6 million in the first nine months of 2017  By comparison  Solid s total assets are at just  35 million  Solid states in its SEC report that the amount raised in this IPO will let the company operate for another 12 months  like the time it takes to buy engagement rings  which is less than other biotech companies such as Menlo  Solid clearly needs money as soon as possible  which may have factored into why its response to the clinical hold has been so inadequate 
In addition to the concerns of the hold and Solid s needs of cash  there are other problems as well  The company is betting everything on SGT 001 s success  as it only has one other therapy named SB 001 which is not even in preclinical trials  It does not have sufficient manufacturing capabilities of its own  And while its IPO is a success  this initial uptick in value shows that this company could have raised more cash it clearly needs as soon as possible 
Too Much Risk
If Solid Biosciences and SGT 001 succeed in treating DMD  this company s stock will skyrocket  But right now  that looks like a large if for all the reasons described above  Solid needs to show that its next clinical trial for SGT 001 is a success without concealing information and move further along in the development process given the complexities of gene therapy  There are other good biotech IPOs which have either just come out or will go public soon  Investors should not feel pressured to invest in any biotech firm right away  and Solid Biosciences is currently not worth the risk ",2018-01-30,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/solid-biosciences-ipo-taking-advantage-of-biotech-bull-market-200285021,200285021

feature highlights Features  Sangamo Therapeutics   NASDAQ SGMO    bluebird bio   NASDAQ BLUE    Editas Medicine   NASDAQ EDIT    Sarepta Therapeutics   NASDAQ SRPT   and Juno Therapeutics  Healthcare Heroes that Aren t Done YetI ve been investing and trading in healthcare stocks successfully for a decade  During the depths of the financial crisis in the first week of March 2009  I went on national TV for the first time and was asked to pick some stocks And I was nervous about potentially giving bad advice to millions of people I didn t know the market would bottom that week  so I asked myself    What are 2 sure things I would tell retail investors they could buy right now that would put their money to work at incredible levels  let them sleep at night during the volatility  and make them very happy 5 years from now  The Technology play was probably obvious to anyone who had just bought a smartphone or new car full of semiconductors  But the Biotech one might still seem risky to some How could I be so confident it was a  sure thing   Because I started identifying the key  megatrends  that made the frontiers of the life sciences and medical R D so promising for decades to come You can read my latest description of those growth drivers in this report   In 2013  I ran a trading portfolio at Zacks that racked up a 66  return primarily on the back of Biotech stocks in that strong bull run they had  2014 and 2015 proved much more difficult with big corrections and then a peak But my  megatrends  proved profoundly resilient  And they inspired us to start a new long term portfolio at Zacks focused directly on them We called it  and launched in April of 2017 Since then  some of the gains have been fantastic   Sangamo Therapeutics 155 61   closed trade bluebird bio  138 17   still holding after JUNO buyout Editas Medicine  115 33   still holding on gene editing innovation Sarepta Therapeutics  106 84   still holding as leading company in Duchenne muscular dystrophy Juno Therapeutics  98 06   sold after Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  acquisition Note  BLUE  EDIT  and SRPT are still open trades showing these gains as of Thursday morning on 3 8 2018 That JUNO closed trade was following the buyout by Celgene in January  And we had already executed and closed a big swing trade in JUNO for 70  gains in 2017 And for a wonderful and profitable  fat tail  event  the same day JUNO was acquired  our Bioverativ was purchased by the French pharma giant Sanofi  PA SASY  for a big premium which handed us a 75  winner A Robust Research ProcessTo be clear  not every investment is a winner  We take a lot of shots    about 25 open positions on average in any given month    and one big loser was NewLink Genetics which cost us 53   This is proof I m not infallible and that Biotech investing remains very risky  with large and binary asymmetric payoffs due to the gauntlet of human clinical trials and FDA rulings But I employ a clear and definable research process that has 5 key steps and it allows me to find at least 3 winners for every wipe out in the treacherous Biotech landscape We took a chance on gene editing company Editas at  25 and watching the trends in BioPharma M A  I decided we could do the same with peer Intellia Therapeutics Notably  Intellia saw a price target boost yesterday by Barclays  LON BARC  from  33 to  46 and today coverage was initiated by JMP Securities with a  76 price target  projecting over 150  upside Plus  it helped my conviction in these CRISPR gene editing companies that I read as much as I could about the science and its founders  Dr  Jennifer Doudna and Dr  Emmanuelle Charpentier Beyond BiotechBut my Healthcare Innovators portfolio is not solely focused on Biotech  We have enjoyed sizable gains with large pharma companies like AbbVie  surgical device companies like Edwards Lifesciences  NYSE EW   and HMO s like Centene  all of which I believe have more room to run And one of my proudest runners making our members smile is Align Technology  maker of the Invisalign  teeth straighteners   a great alternative to traditional braces  The company is posting consistent 30  growth quarter after quarter as both American teens and their dentists realize the beautiful fit of their digitally mastered dental solutions Plus  the international growth opportunity is what has kept us in the stock for the long term since  133  even during big pullbacks from all time highs above  260 I hope I have convinced you that the Healthcare Megatrends are in full force and will be for many more years Besides making profitable investments  there is also one other fantastic benefit I didn t describe  studying the lifesciences companies is a never ending journey of discovery that can expand your knowledge of human physiology  wellness  disease  nutrition and the future of medicine Once you re hooked on so much to learn and wonder about  you ll never be bored again in your life Disclosure  I own shares of BLUE  EDIT  SRPT  NTLA  and

125348,346863,SRPT,Sarepta   BioMarin Settle Patent Litigation On Exon Skipping ,opinion,"Sarepta Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ SRPT   and BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc    NASDAQ BMRN    have settled their ongoing global patent litigation regarding the exclusive license on a patent pertaining to exon skipping technology used in Duchenne muscular dystrophy  DMD  therapies  BioMarin has licensed the global exclusive rights to its DMD patent estate for Exondys 51 and all future exon skipping products to Sarepta Therapeutics 
Exondys 51 is a key drug for Sarepta and is marketed for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping A look at the company s share price movement shows that  Sarepta has outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry so far this year  While the stock has rallied 23 5   the broader industry witnessed a gain of 8 8  
Per the agreement  Sarepta will make a one time payment of  35 million to Biomarin plus unspecified regulatory and commercial milestone payments for exons 51  45  53  and on future exon skipping products  Additionally  the company will pay BioMarin royalties for compounds skipping exons 51  45  and 53  and possibly on future exon skipping products 
BioMarin is entitled to receive 5  royalty on U S  sales  through 2023  of Exondys 51 and both exons 45 and 53 skipping compounds  which use the exon skipping technology  and 8  royalty on European sales of the products  through Sep 2024  
BioMarin  however  has held back the right to convert the license to a co exclusive right in case it decides to proceed with an exon skipping therapy for DMD 
If Sarepta had not made the settlement with BioMarin  the latter could preclude Sarepta from commercializing Exondys 51 in several jurisdictions  Thus the settlement of patent litigation and the global license from Biomarin removes a major overhang for Sarepta Sarepta Therapeutics  Inc  Price and Consensus
 

   Zacks Rank   Stocks to Consider
Sarepta currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Better ranked health care stocks in the same space include Enzo Biochem  Inc    NYSE ENZ   and Sanofi   NYSE SNY    While Enzo Biochem sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Sanofi holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Enzo Biochem s loss per share estimates narrowed from 12 cents to 7 cents for 2017 and from 11 cents to 3 cents for 2018  over the last 60 days  The company delivered positive earnings surprises in all the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 55 83   The share price of the company has increased 64 8  year to date 
Sanofi s earnings per share estimates increased from  3 08 to  3 18 for 2017 and from  3 26 to  3 30 for 2018  over last 60 days  The company pulled off positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 5 10   The share price of the company has increased 18  year to date

125352,346867,SRPT,Sarepta Therapeutics  SRPT  Stock Surged 24  Today  Here s Why,opinion,"On Thursday  shares of Sarepta Therapeutics   NASDAQ SRPT   are surging  up almost 24  to  42 14 per share in morning trading after the biotech company reported second quarter revenues that blew past expectations in its earnings report yesterday after the bell 
Sarepta reported quarterly revenue of  35 million  which was  13 million above what analysts at Thomson Reuters expected and reflected sequential growth of 115   This outperformance was mainly due to strong sales from Sarepta s Duchenne muscular dystrophy  DMD  drug  Exondys 51 
The company also incurred a narrower than expected loss in Q2  reporting earnings of a loss of 65 cents per share and beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 92 cents per share  Investors should note that loss per share excludes restructuring costs and gain from asset sale but includes the impact of share based compensation expenses 
Sarepta ended the second quarter with a strong balance sheet  boasting  301 7 million in total cash  And earlier this week  the company announced it has settled a global patent litigation with BioMarin Pharmaceutical   NASDAQ BMRN   regarding the exclusive license on a patent pertaining to exon skipping technology used in DMD therapies  If Sarepta hadn t settled with BioMarin  the latter could have prevented Sarepta from commercializing Exondys 51 in several new areas 
Looking ahead  Sarepta updated its guidance for Exondys 51  and now expects sales for the therapy to range from  125 million to  130 million in 2017  higher than its previous forecast of  95 million  The company raised its outlook primarily because of increasing market penetration  start forms from physicians  and additional new patients in the second quarter  Exondys 51 is also close to breaking into the European Union market  a positive next step for a controversial drug that costs  300 000 a year 
SRPT is currently a  5  Strong Sell  on the Zacks Rank  Shares of Sarepta have gained over 22  year to date  and are up almost 52  over the past 12 months

125388,346903,SRPT,Here Are 3 Of Perceptive s Latest Filings And The Catalysts To Watch,opinion,"Biotechnology investors will often look to piggyback the positions of hedge funds in an attempt to take advantage of the latter s due diligence resources  A hedge fund doesn t take a position in a company without instigating a large and resource intensive due diligence program   a program that the vast majority of retail investors couldn t hope to replicate in their own time 
One of the most widely piggybacked fund in the sector is Perceptive Advisors  Perceptive has grown from launch back in 1999 to manage more than  1 billion in assets today  and along the way  it s founder and long time manager  Joseph Edelmen  has developed into something of a household name among retail biotechnology traders and investors 
Edelmen has taken positions in some of biotech s biggest names   Perceptive s three lead holdings by dollar amount are Neurocrine Biosciences Inc  NASDAQ NBIX   Sarepta Therapeutics Inc  NASDAQ SRPT  and TESARO Inc  NASDAQ TSRO   but he s not afraid to pick up an exposure to a smaller  development stage company in anticipation of it reaching commercialization with one or more of its development assets 
In fact  this approach is at the core of his allocation strategy 
With this in mind  here are three companies in which Edelmen has increased or taken a stake in the last few months  with a look at what we think he sees in each    VBI Vaccines Inc  NASDAQ VBIV  Ordinary Shares        Shares held at March 31  2017  8 602 824 Value at last close  May 9   28 85    35 35 million Portion of company represented by shares  20 50 
First up  VBI Vaccines  This company has developed a technology that allows it to create vaccines that are both able to target infectious diseases for which preventative and combative vaccinations are not yet available and to improve on the current standard of care vaccinations in the sector  The technology is called the Envelope Virus Like Particle  eVLP  platform  and it harnesses mammalian cells  as opposed to the plant cells used in the vast majority of available vaccines  and specifically  the ability of these cells to closely mimic the viruses they are targeting  to introduce rapid and strong immunogenicity 
The technology has spawned a number of assets  which are currently under investigation across a range of target indications  cytomegalovirus  CMV   glioblastoma multiforme  GBM  and Zika  to name just three 
The real value driver right now  however  and the one we think Edelmen had his eye on when he first picked up an exposure to VBI  is called Sci B Vac  It s a hepatitis B vaccine that differentiates itself from the current standard of care vaccine in the space  Engerix  through its expressing of a range of hepatitis B antigens  Antigens are the part of a virus  or in this instance  the vaccine that s trying to mimic a virus  that the immune system is trained to recognize  Once this recognition takes place  the signal goes out instructing the body to attack the virus in question 
The higher the degree of recognition  the quicker and stronger the response  By incorporating three separate hepatitis B associated antigens into its Sci B Vac asset  VBI seeks to take advantage of this improved response concept 
The drug is already approved in fifteen countries globally  but the real return for shareholders will come when it picks up approval in Europe  the US and Canada  VBI needs to conduct a phase III study  the data from which it can use to underpin registration applications in these three markets  and recent management communication has detailed a pretty clear path forward in both Europe and Canada  We expect similar progress in the US near term  before the end of the year  and  subsequently  for the phase III study to get underway 
Once the phase III study up and running  milestones and catalyst should stack up  contributing to value appreciation as and when they are hit    Global Blood Therapeutics Inc  NASDAQ GBT         Shares held at March 31  2017  3 128 978 Value at last close  May 9   28 85    90 20 million Portion of company represented by shares  8 38 
Next  Global Blood Therapeutics  This one is a California based biotechnology company that is working to develop treatments within two specific target indications   sickle cell disease  SCD  and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  IPF   The drug under investigation  in both instances  is an asset called GBT440   a so called anti sickling hemoglobin modifier 
The SCD indication is the lead right now  and Global Blood Therapeutics is currently putting the drug through its paces as part of a phase 3 program designed to investigate safety and efficacy of GBT440 in the SCD population  Data to date has been strong  and  as Edelemen will be well aware  this is a patient population that very much needs a fresh treatment option 
The current standard of care therapies in the space are symptom targeted and  in a large portion of the population  don t work particularly well  if at all  If Global Blood Therapeutics can get its asset through phase 3 with a successful topline readout  and beyond that  if it can pick up a green light for commercialization from the FDA  there s a peak sales target for the drug of  2 7 billion 
When taken against the company s current market capitalization of  1 3 billion  there s clear potential for upside revaluation on a GBT440 approval in SCD  even if the IPF program falls flat 
Buyout rumors have fueled speculative attention recently  with a  3 billion price tag the most widely acknowledged as representative of the company s value ahead of its phase III completion    Amicus Therapeutics Inc  NASDAQ FOLD         Shares held at March 31  2017  17 296 672 Value at last close  May 9   28 85    115 02 million Portion of company represented by shares  12 10 
This one is a biotechnology company that focuses on the development of rare diseases in the US  It is based out of New Jersey and its principal product is what s called migalastat HCl  or Galafold  The drug is an orally administered small molecule pharmacological chaperone for the treatment of Fabry disease and it is currently the center of a commercialization effort in Europe  The European Medicines Agency  EMA  approved the asset last year and the majority of the last 12 months have been spent preparing for  and more recently executing on  a sales push across major regions in Europe 
The UK  Italy and France just converted to full reimbursement  which is the target aim for a launch in the most of the various regions that comprise the European Union  and Germany looks set to follow suit near term  With these four regions in place  the lion s share of the European market will be accessible  and realistic from a revenues generation perspective  
Japanese approval should come next  with the company targeting the second quarter of this year  so  at some point within the next month or two at the outside  for New Drug Application  NDA  submission in the region  There s a big market for the drug in Japan and any feedback on the submission has the potential to inject some upside momentum into the company s market capitalization as and when it hits press  assuming it s positive 
Beyond Europe and Japan  Amicus is trying to push for approval in the US  although this is likely more of a long term catalyst  The drug is available as part of some expanded access programs right now  but the path to FDA approval is not yet 100  clear and near term value for Amicus is going to derive from the above mentioned regions primarily 
The company just put out some numbers  and has reported that over 300 patients are taking the drug right now  this is a relatively strong number given population size  based on sales of the drug during the first quarter of this year came in at  4 2 million   a sequential increase of close to 50  on the  2 8 million recorded during the final quarter of 2016 ",2017-05-11,Samuel Rae,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here-are-three-of-perceptive's-latest-filings-and-the-catalysts-to-watch-200188500,200188500

125412,346927,SRPT,2 Biotech Beauties Poised To Breakout,opinion,"can be made not from investing in Big Pharma companies  but from smaller cap stocks in the biotech sector  We ve pinpointed two small biotech companies poised to break out  VBI Vaccines Inc  NASDAQ VBIV  and InMed Pharmaceuticals Inc  SNX IN  
VBI s vaccines are unique because they harness a proprietary technology created by the company  called an enveloped virus like particle  VLP   This allows efficient and effective delivery of the vaccine by mimicking the ways the viruses travel through the body s systems 
VBI is currently developing two vaccines for diseases that have high demand for prevention  hepatitis B and the cytomegalovirus  similar to Zika  
But VBI isn t just a shot in the dark  floating alone in the scary biotech space  There are some big names standing behind the small cap   111 million  company  Perceptive Advisors  biotech focused fun  the Perceptive Life Sciences Fund  which is led by CEO Joseph Edelman  has bought a sizeable stake  as has Arch Ventures  helmed by Robert Nelsen  and Opko Health Inc  NASDAQ OPK   with CEO Dr  Phillip Frost 
These are biotech investors with impressive track records   from Edelman s stunning 5 000  play on Sarepta Therapeutics Inc  NASDAQ SRPT  to Nelson s early bid on Juno Therapeutic  NASDAQ JUNO   to Frost s own IVAX  a vaccination company that he sold to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  NYSE TEVA  for more than  7 billion 
VBI s CEO  Jeff Baxter  is also in a good place to lead his company to success  He has a long and impressive resume that includes stints at Glaxo  as well as at Unilever  LON ULVR  and British American Tobacco  LON BATS   
With its impressive roster of financial backers  as well as a seasoned exec  VBI is the best small cap play for investors  from the growing vaccine market 
InMed is a mere penny stock   currently priced around 15 cents per share   but it packs a wallop  The company has created its own proprietary biosynthesis drug development platform that derives cannabinoids from plants in an unprecedentedly cost effective and efficient manner  This process can help the company develop treatments at a faster pace than any other medical marijuana treatment maker 
InMed s chief medical officer  Dr  Ado Muhammed  formerly served as associate medical director at mid cap marijuana biotech GW Pharmaceuticals Plc  NASDAQ GWPH  and is one of the few scientists who has had clinical experience with a cannabinoid based drug that has already been approved by the FDA  Sativex  GM s blockbuster MS treatment  
InMed is developing therapies for conditions such as epidermolysis bullosa  EB  a serious pediatric skin disease   as well as glaucoma  There s the potential for as much as  1 billion for a successful EB drug   currently  there s no therapy on the market 
That would give InMed and its investors some incredible profits  as well as making the stock ripe for the picking by any Big Pharma player

For many years  rare diseases got little to no medical attention   with few sufferers  these diseases simply didn t have the political or financial pull to push drug development forward  so companies often abandoned them  Such illnesses and their associated drugs even came to be known as  orphans  for this reason  Now  however  social media has helped sufferers band together  pushing companies to develop treatment regimens for rare conditions  which is how Sarepta Therapeutics gained the public eye 
Sarepta Therapeutics Inc  NASDAQ SRPT  recently received the first FDA approval in history for a Duchenne muscular dystrophy  DRD  drug  About 13 percent of DRD patients have the particular mutation this drug is meant to address  but although the market is narrow  investors are responding  Immediately following the FDA approval  Sarepta s stock price rose more than 80 percent  It s not too late to get in on this groundbreaking company s stock  either 
Biopharmaceuticals Go Big
Biologics and biopharmaceuticals are big business today  as the medical industry realizes that the best way to treat many diseases is by drawing on our own biological systems  In this category are blood products  proteins engineered from the human genome  and other similar products  One of the most powerful developments in the biopharmaceutical industry is immunotherapy  which can be used to treat cancers  as well as autoimmune diseases 
Kite Pharma  NASDAQ KITE  has been working on developing and launching a form of   but as their current products are still in phases 1 and 2 of clinical trials  the stock is trading fairly low  Keep an eye on this company as they approach an FDA approval  however  as this could lead to significant price jump  as seen with Sarepta 
Equipment Evolution
Finally  if you re looking for a highly diverse  innovative medical sector  consider investing in medical device development  Medical device companies include those developing traditional hospital monitors and surgical tools as well as those engineering nearly invisible data collection tools 
Among the former  NxStage Medical Inc  NASDAQ NXTM  is a standout stock  The company designs hemodialysis machines that can be used to prolong the lives of patients with renal disease  After beating third quarter expectations this year  investors are feeling confident about the company s 2017 potential  Invest now for strong payout potential 
On the other end of the med tech spectrum are companies like G Tech Medical that make tools for managing gastrointestinal diseases like Crohn s and ulcerative colitis  Though this company is not yet being traded publically  they recently raised  1 5 million in growth capital through the Propel x  platform  Keep an eye on this company  whether a larger biotech brand acquires them or they go public  they ve already built a powerful business

125415,346930,SRPT,Short Term Trades With High Returns  Evaluating A Real Life Example,opinion,"Covered call writing is a conservative strategy for cautious investors  We want the higher than risk free returns with the least amount of risk  One question that does come up in this regard is why not enter a short term trade that offers impressive returns  To get an understanding if this is a beneficial approach there is nothing like a real life example to dissect every aspect of such a trade  I will be using Sarepta Therapeutics Inc  NASDAQ SRPT  to highlight the key aspects of this article 
SRPT  3 day trade from June 6  2016   June 9  2016
6 6 2016  Buy SRPT at  15 40
6 6 2016  Sell  16 00 call at  1 90
6 9 2016  Plan to close trade prior to expiration
Ellman Calculator

The multiple tab of the Ellman Calculator shows a 3 day initial return of 12 3  with the possibility of an additional 3 9  if share price moves up to the  16 00 strike by expiration  This annualizes to between 1000    2000   I don t know about you but I m beginning to get nervous 
Here s what we know without even 1 second of research
1  We know that options returns of this magnitude and time frame are based on an underlying security with massive   This means that the market is anticipating huge price movement in either direction  Frequently  this will results in  ups or gap downs sudden and dramatic price movement  Is this what we want as conservative investors where capital preservation is a top priority   hint no   To confirm this  let s have a look at a 1 year price chart for SRPT showing two gap downs of over 50  each time 

Neither gap down was related to an earnings report but rather the nature of the underlying security 
2  We know that there is a likelihood of some event expected that could rock the share price in either direction  We have eliminated earnings reports as that event due to our standard screening process 

So what happened 

Clearly the trade had a happy ending with a 3 day return of 16 2   12 3    3 9   as share price moved from near 16 00 to near  21 00  brown field   Is our conclusion then that short term volatile trades should be a recurring aspect of our trading strategies  hint well you know  
For Whom and when should such trades be considered 
Trades which offer huge short term potential profits are highly risky trades which make a lot of money or result in extensive losses  They are for traders with high risk tolerance looking to hit it big  Covered call writing is on the other end of the spectrum  most appropriate for conservative investors who stress capital preservation  Should such a high risk reward trade be entered  a covered call will limit the upside but not the downside  In the highlighted trade   2 50   1 90    0 60  was generated but it could have been more than  5 00 per share had the call not been written  The major reason for not entering such a trade is the downside risk had the news been disappointing 
Discussion
Short term trades offering high returns are most appropriate for investors looking to hit a grand slam homerun with the understanding that substantial losses are possible  With that in mind  each investor must decide which strategy is most beneficial based on personal trading style

125443,346958,SRPT,Sarepta Shares Soar On News Of Key Drug Critic FDA Exit,opinion,"Shares of Sarepta Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ SRPT   rose around 27  on Wed  Sep 14 on news that a key critic  Farkas  of its lead pipeline candidate  eteplirsen  has left his job at the FDA  raising hopes of approval of the drug 
The biopharmaceutical company is looking to get eteplirsen approved for the treatment of patients suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy amenable to exon 51 skipping 
We remind investors that in Apr 2016  an FDA advisory committee voted against approving eteplirsen for the treatment of DMD  Dr  Ronald Farkas had led the panel and has reportedly been critical of the drug SAREPTA THERAP Price and Consensus
 

   One of the most common fatal genetic disorders affecting children around the world  DMD is a devastating and incurable muscle wasting disease and there is significant unmet need for its treatments 
Following the committee s decision  the FDA failed to provide a decision on the candidate by the extended Prescription Drug User Fee Act  PDUFA  date of May 26  2016  The agency informed the company that it was still reviewing the latter s New Drug Application  NDA  and will try to reach a decision as early as possible However  in June  the FDA requested the company to provide dystrophin data from biopsies obtained from the ongoing confirmatory study on eteplirsen  as part of the agency s ongoing evaluation of the NDA 
Given that Sarepta has no approved product in its portfolio at the moment and that eteplirsen is its lead pipeline candidate  the departure of Farkas definitely improves chances of approval of the drug  However  we cannot rule out the fact that Farkas was not the only member of the advisory committee who had concerns about eteplirsen

125466,346981,SRPT,Biotech Stock To Watch  Sarepta  Biomarin  Acadia,opinion,"Sarepta Therapeutics
On Monday April 25  2016 Sarepta Therapeutics  NASDAQ SRPT  had a FDA advisory panel shoot down its drug Eteplirsen  used to treat patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy    DMD  The panel voted against Eteplirsen on all questions  Even the last question which asked if Eteplirsen should be approved for DMD patients was also voted down on  The panel vote was  3  yes  for approval  7  no  against approval  and 3 panelists abstained from even answering the question 
The main concern with Sarepta s drug was that it had only ran a clinical trial with a total of 12 patients  The panel noted many times during the hearing that proper efficacy can t be concluded from just a small patient population  That would have been enough to typically reject a drug compound  except for the fact that the way Sarepta designed its trial it gets much worse  The company ran the trial with no placebo arm  A placebo arm is important in a clinical trial  because it proves whether the new drug is better than the current standard  By not applying a placebo compound  Sarepta left the FDA panel to guess what the placebo would have been 
In addition  Sarepta tacked into their data historical controls  Historical controls  means that the company used placebo data from old trials done many years ago  It does make you wonder though  maybe the company didn t do placebo trials because they knew that the drug wouldn t perform any better than placebo  The FDA is set to decide upon whether it should approve Eteplirsen or not by May 27 of this year  If the FDA decides to accept the panel advisors  decision then it is likely that the drug will not be approved for DMD patients 
Putting aside the no use of placebo in the trial and running a small 12 patient trial something else can be pointed as solid evidence on why Eteplirsen won t be approved  That is the fact that Biomarin Pharmaceutical  NASDAQ BMRN   which ran a 290 patient trial and ran the trial with a placebo failed to receive approval of its drug Kyndrisa  The FDA panel was not happy with the efficacy of this drug either thus the rejection  Which brings me to the main point that if the FDA didn t approve Kyndrisa with such a large trial and good efficacy  why on earth would it approve Eteplirsen  After all  it only recruited 12 patients in a trial and no placebo arm  I don t expect the FDA to play favorites  and I predict that Sarepta will receive a Complete Response Letter    CRL 
Investors have to keep in mind that yes people tend to live off of emotions  but keep this one thing in mind  The FDA doesn t work based off of emotions  They approve or disapprove drugs based on clinical facts and findings  Therefore with the weak data  I don t expect the FDA to approve Eteplirsen for patients with DMD 
Acadia Pharmaceuticals
On Friday April 29  2016 ACADIA Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ACAD  announced that it had received FDA approval for its drug Nuplazid  It had received approval to treat a disease known as Parkinson s Disease Psychosis  Patients with Parkinson s Disease Psychosis    PDP    experience hallucinations and delusions  This is an extraordinary feat for Acadia  because it will be the first drug ever to be approved for PDP 
According to data from the National Parkinson Foundation there are approximately five million people globally that suffer from Parkinson s Disease  Out of all those people  around 40  have the psychosis component of the disease  The problem has been that there has been no FDA approved drugs to treat this portion of the disease until now  Acadia had received breakthrough designation back in 2014  The good part about Breakthrough therapy designation is that the company receives a faster review time 
Instead of the company having to wait 7 to 9 months for review they only need to wait typically 2 to 3 months  It saves a lot of time this way  and this is especially good if the drug treats a population that have no other treatment options  With this approval patients won t even have to wait that long of a time period  because Acadia expects to launch the drug in June  In just a few months patients will be able to relieve their symptoms of psychosis 
Acadia stands to make a lot of money with the drug  because analysts expect that Nuplazid could potentially produce  1 billion in sales  Such a huge amount of revenue with no competition  could be an attractive takeover target for big pharmaceutical companies  with a large pocket book  Big pharmaceutical companies are struggling with weak R D and they need to buy small cap biotechnology companies to keep their revenue stream flowing  Well  Acadia with a recently approved drug with limited competition should stir a bidding war battle among the big pharma players ",2016-05-03,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/biotech-stock-news-(srpt)-(bmrn)-(acad)-200127599,200127599
125467,346982,SRPT,Why Is Sarepta Therapeutics  SRPT  Stock Soaring 20  Today ,opinion,"On Wednesday  shares of Sarepta Therapeutics   NASDAQ SRPT   are soaring  up almost 20  in afternoon trading on news that the company announced that the Food   Drug Administration  FDA  has delayed ruling in its drug eteplirsen  which treats Duchenne muscular dystrophy  DMD  
The delay has raised hopes that eterplirsen may be approved 
The FDA let Sarpeta know that it would be unable to complete the review of its New Drug Application  NDA  by the scheduled Prescription Drug Uder Fee Act  PDUFA  deadline of May 26  the FDA added it will work past the deadline to complete the review as soon as possible 
DMD is a rare disease that usually emerges in young boys  causing weakness in the arms and legs and eventually the lungs and heart  There is currently no other treatment available  If the FDA rejects eterplirsen  it will be the third time it has turned down a DMD drug this year 
The FDA s decision is the deciding factor for Sarepta as a company  and it may be the last chance for it to debut a product to the market after 36 years

125468,346983,SRPT,Why Is Sarepta Therapeutics  SPRT  Stock Down 20  Today  ,opinion,"Shares of Sarepta Therapeutics   NASDAQ SRPT   fell nearly 20  in early morning trading Thursday after new reports suggested that the Food and Drug Administration may force the company to offer its Duchenne muscular dystrophy  DMD  drug to patients at cost 
The rumors are swirling based on an FDA  that detailed plans for the regulatory body to streamline its expanded access program  This process  often called  compassionate use   allows doctors to individually request access to investigational drugs for their patients 
 The FDA has a long history of supporting patient access to investigational treatments and we hope the information released today will help health care professionals  patients  and industry to more easily navigate the expanded access process and help patients who qualify to gain access to potentially life saving investigational treatments   the agency said 
While the new process could allow Sarepta to offer its eteplirsen drug to patients with DMD without first receiving FDA approval  another caveat of the compassionate use program is that drug makers must only charge patients enough to recoup manufacturing costs 
It is important to note that Sarepta and eteplirsen were not mentioned specifically in the FDA s statement  However  it appears that investors are connecting the dots between today s announcement and the agency s decision to  on eteplirsen last week 
Sarepta has been fighting an uphill battle against the FDA to get eteplirsen approved  The agency has already turned down the drug twice this year  but last week s delay caused some to regain hope that the FDA might still approve the DMD drug

125470,346985,SRPT,Sarepta Therapeutics Skyrockets After FDA News,opinion,"Sarepta Therapeutics Inc  NASDAQ SRPT  shares have been  of late  and they soared by more than 23  to as high as  19 75 on Tuesday  The drug maker said it has reached an agreement with the Food and Drug Administration regarding dystrophin data from trials of its drug Promovi  Wedbush analysts upgraded Sarepta after the news  although analyst calls on the company are simply all over the place 
Wedbush upgrades Sarepta Therapeutics  SRPT 
Analyst Heather Behanna said in a report dated June 6 that she upgraded Sarepta Therapeutics Inc  NASDAQ SRPT  from Neutral to Outperform and more than doubled her price target from  14 to  36 per share  She believes the agreement between the company and the FDA will enable it to get onto the fast track to getting Promovi  a k a  eteplirsen  approved  The agency has agreed to review the dystrophin data that Sarepta already has on hand  This is good news because it means that the company won t have to spend more time and money collecting new biopsies because it can use those it already collected 
She believes the data will show that dystrophin production is within an acceptable range  so she thinks the drug maker s stock is a buy before the regulatory approval  However  she also noted that there is still a risk that dystrophin will be a problem in terms of getting Promovi approved because there are no clear guidelines of how much of an increase in dystrophin production is needed  She believes that an increase of two to three times may be all that s needed in order for approval  however 
Rough waters for Sarepta Therapeutics  SRPT 
Analysts are all over the map in terms of ratings on Sarepta Therapeutics Inc  NASDAQ SRPT   For example  Janney analysts have a Neutral rating but raised their price target from  18 to  25 per share following the FDA news  On the other hand  Jefferies analysts have an Underperform rating and  7 per share price target  as they don t see much chance of Promovi receiving FDA approval  Their take on the deal announced this week is that the agency is granting one more chance to Sarepta to demonstrate that its drug works 
JPMorgan has an Underperform rating and  10 price target  while Leerink has an Underperform rating and  5 price target  On the extreme bullish side  we have Oppenheimer with an Outperform rating and  60 per share price target  as the firm s analysts believe the FDA is already fairly certain that accelerated approval is warranted for Sarepta Therapeutics  drug 
Volatility in the stock has been exceptionally high of late  and  posits that the reason analyst ratings and price targets vary so much is become of this volatility as the stock has punished longs and shorts alike  Short interest in the company has skyrocketed over the last few months as about 22 6 million shares were out on loan as of May 13  compared to only 10 million shares at the beginning of the year

125492,347007,SRPT,Sarepta Therapeutics  SRPT  Stock Is About To Soar,opinion,"Sarepta Therapeutics  NASDAQ SRPT  is an incredibly strong stock in the biotechnology space  However  it seems as though the stock is going to get stronger  and it s going to happen soon  I m not quite sure what s up their sleeve  but insider trading shows that something big is likely to happen as SRPT  Today  we ll talk about why it s important to watch insider trading  what we re seeing from SRPT  and what we can expect to see moving forward  So  let s get right to it   
Why It s Important To Watch Insider Trading
As investors  we really don t have very much information available to us  Sure  we can watch technical data and focus on the fundamental data we know  but the truth is  most fundamentals are outdated by the time we get to them  Nonetheless  there is one clue that often leads to big gains  or big declines  That clue is insider trading  The bottom line is that no one knows more about a publicly traded company than those on the inside  When they start to sell shares in the company for which they are insiders  we can expect to see declines  However  when they start to buy shares  we can expect that something big is just around the corner  and SRPT insiders are buying shares 
We re Seeing Quite A Bit Of Insider Activity In Sarepta Therapeutics
Over the past week or so  we ve seen quite a bit of positive insider activity at SRPT  In fact  over this short period of time  three directors at the company have made the decision to purchase shares  Between the three insiders  a total of 154 500 shares were purchased  The prices on these shares ranged from  14 54 per share to  16 54 per share  bringing the total cost to the insiders to approximately  2 5 million  When one insider purchases shares  we expect to see something good happen  However  in the case of SRPT  three insiders started loading up on shares at the same time  While I m not sure what they re seeing coming around the corner  there s got to be a reason these three insiders jumped in on  2 5 million in shares of the company 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
As mentioned above  I m in the dark just like you when it comes to what s coming  The truth is that I have no crystal ball  nor do I have any other way to look into the future  However  I do know that when we start to see big insider buys  those insiders are buying for a reason  In the case of SRPT  I don t see this any different  The insiders made educated decisions to purchase shares  Why  I have no idea  but they did 
With that said  I m expecting to see something big from the company relatively soon  Maybe they ve reached a big time medical breakthrough  maybe they are expecting to move forward with a new clinical study  maybe they just have great financial data to report  Nonteheless  something is coming  so  we need to be watching closely  This could open the door to incredible trading opportunities ",2016-03-21,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sarepta-therapeutics-(srpt)-stock-is-about-to-soar-200122363,200122363

125496,347011,SRPT,Sarepta Therapeutics Stock  Here s Why It s Sinking,opinion,"Sarepta Therapeutics Inc  NASDAQ SRPT 
Sarepta Therapeutics is having an overwhelmingly rough day in the market today  and for good reason  The company recently received bad news from the FDA with regard to a treatment that it is working on getting approved  Today  we ll talk about the news  how the market is reacting  and what we can expect to see from SRPT moving forward  So  let s get right to it   
SRPT Receives Negative News From The FDA
Sarepta Therapeutics has been working hard to get eteplirsen approved by the FDA as a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy  Unfortunately however  the FDA still seems to be looking at the treatment in a negative light  SRPT announced that the FDA is expected to conduct an outside advisory panel on April 25th to review eteplirsen data  Nonetheless  an internal assessment by the FDA s review team appears to cast doubt with regard to the drug s chances of becoming an approved treatment 
The New Drug application was postponed on January 21st by the panel as they pointed out what it believed was errors in the original FDA review of the treatment from SRPT  Unfortunately  it seems though this opinion has not yet changed  In a statement  the FDA had the following to offer   
  W e do not agree with the applicant s characterization of inaccuracies in the initial FDA briefing document    Although FDA is prepared to be flexible with respect to a devastating illness with no treatment options  we cannot approve drugs for which substantial evidence of effectiveness has not been established  
How The Market Reacted To The News
As investors  we know that the news moves the market  Any time there is positive news released with regard to a publicly traded company  we can expect to see gains in the value of the stock associated with that company  Adversely  negative news will generally lead to declines  Given the fact that the FDA is still doubtful with regard to the treatment from SRPT  the news that was released today was overwhelmingly negative  As a result  we re seeing big declines surrounding the stock at the moment  Currently  9 59   SRPT is trading at  11 95 per share after a loss of  7 76 per share or 39 37  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See From SRPT Moving Forward
While I would love to see the stock gain  I have to say that my opinion of Sarepta Therapeutics is incredibly bearish at the moment  The reality is that the company has been working to get eteplirson approved for quite some time  However  the FDA seems to continue finding problems with regard to the drug that will likely stop it from being approved  With that said  short term sentiment following the negative news is likely to drag the stock quite a bit further down  On top of that  when it is announced that the drug is not being approved  as there is a high likelihood of this happening  chances are that SRPT is going to sink much  much further  In the long run  I m sure that the company will make it over this hurdle  However  as it is at the moment  there seems to be no end in sight for the declines we re seeing at the moment ",2016-04-21,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sarepta-therapeutics-(srpt)-stock:-here’s-why-it’s-sinking-200125910,200125910

The chart below shows that long tight consolidation  But then after coming to an agreement with the FDA on submitting rolling NDA it jumped  I have no idea what rolling NDA is but I do know what the price action is saying  BUY 

The stock rose  10 on that news  Over 60   And since then it has consolidated  You might think that 60  move was enough  but the chart suggests you could see another  10 move very soon  The consolidation since the move up has put the stock back into the Bollinger Bands  and has been tightening against resistance at 26 85  The RSI has remained bullish and strong through this and then MACD pulled back only in a minor way  With the consolidation in a bull flag a break to the upside would look for a move up to 36  And with 45  short interest this is not a pipe dream  Are you ready for this

125531,347046,SRPT,Opexa Therapeutics A Significant Growth Opportunity For Both Short Term,opinion,As regenerative medicine continues to slowly bridge the gap between its future promise and the scientific reality of today  companies in the space are positioning themselves to benefit from the world s technological advances  Today  regenerative medicine is becoming a reality while companies  researchers  patients  and investors alike also face ethical and religious questions to be answered  Important steps along those lines figure to be taken next month  as the Vatican prepares for its Second International Vatican Adult Stem Cell Conference  Regenerative Medicine   A Fundamental Shift in Science   Culture  taking place from within The Vatican  April 11 13   is part of a five year collaboration between The Stem for Life Foundation  NeoStem  NBS   and The Vatican s Pontifical Council for Culture  The goals of conference are to  Foster an open dialogue amongst researchers  physicians  philanthropists  faith leaders and policy makers in order to help identify clear  unmet medical needs throughout the world that can be addressed through the development of cellular therapies that will reduce human suffering Expand global awareness of the here and now opportunities of adult stem cell therapies  reducing misperceptions surrounding the field of cellular research Lay the groundwork for a collaborative network of scientists  educators and patrons Companies present for the conference include a number of well known names in regenerative treatment  such as Celgene  CELG   Osiris  OSIR   NeoStem   and Athersys  ATHX   Also to be featured at the conference is Opexa Therapeutics  OPXA   and their T cell immunotherapy  Tcelna  which is in development for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis  SPMS   Shares of Opexa look poised to breakout higher for several reasons including a new partnership agreement with Merck Serono  a recent large institutional share purchase  and other new developments  Let s delve into Opexa s short and long term prospects  Opexa is focused on the development of patient specific cellular therapies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases  Currently  the company s leading product candidate  Tcelna  is in phase 2b of a clinical trial focused on addressing the large multiple sclerosis  MS  patient population  According to the Tcelna is a personalized therapy that is specifically tailored to each patient s disease profile  Tcelna is manufactured using ImmPath  Opexa s proprietary method for the production of a patient specific T cell immunotherapy  which encompasses the collection of blood from the MS patient  isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells  generation of an autologous pool of myelin reactive T cells  MRTCs  raised against selected peptides from myelin basic protein  MBP   myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein  MOG  and proteolipid protein  PLP   and the return of these expanded  irradiated T cells back to the patient  Opexa believes the potential combination of efficacy  superior safety  excellent tolerability and administration may position Tcelna as the MS treatment of choice as compared to existing therapeutics  In MS patients  the faulty immune system is not able to prevent the attack of a small sub population of myelin reactive T cells  MRTCs    is to identify which specific antigens within each individual patient may be targeted by the immune response  and to inject a large therapeutic bolus of attenuated MRTCs back into the patient  The Tcelna consists of attenuated antigen specific Myelin Reactive T cells  and the injection is meant to educate the body s immune system to recognize the similar MRTCs as  foreign  and destroy them  T cell therapy is certainly getting a lot of attention lately  The potential impact is not lost on big pharma  In February   the execution of an agreement with Merck Serono  a division of Merck  for the development and commercialization of Tcelna    Opexa will receive an upfront payment of  5 million for granting an option to Merck Serono for the exclusive license of the Tcelna  imilecleucel T  program for the treatment of MS  The option may be exercised prior to or upon completion of Opexa s ongoing Phase IIb clinical trial in patients with SPMS  Upon exercising this licensing option  Merck Serono would pay an upfront license fee of either  25 million or  15 million  depending upon whether certain conditions are met   and in return receive worldwide development and commercial rights to Tcelna  imilecleucel T  in MS  excluding Japan  After exercising the option Merck Serono would be wholly responsible for funding clinical development  subject to Opexa s co funding option  as well as regulatory and commercialization activities for the MS program  Additional financial considerations of the agreement include development and commercial milestone payments to Opexa of up to  195 million and a tiered royalty rate from the high single digits to the mid teens based on net sales payable to Opexa  The potential payments to Opexa could  therefore  total  225 million excluding royalty payments  The terms of the agreement are encouraging to investors on a number of fronts  Of particular note is that Merck Serono would not only pay Opexa a licensing fee of  15m  25m along with potentially  225 million plus royalties  but would also fund all additional clinical development  regulatory  and commercialization costs  I also find it interesting that the rights to Japan were withheld from the terms of the otherwise worldwide agreement  It is possible that a separate agreement for Japan will be announced in the near future and act as a catalyst  Cash Position and Institutional OwnershipA Feb 11  2011 filing reveals a very interesting new 9 6  stake in Opexa taken by  LLC  Sabby is a very savvy healthcare related investment group  Their position combined with the Merck Serono agreement  represents a couple of confidently placed large investments in a company with Opexa s small market capitalization of only 17M  Cash on hand is always a concern with small developmental biotech companies  but the recent  private placement and the upfront fee of  5 0M received from Merck Serono has helped temper that concern for Opexa  With a current monthly burn rate of only  885K  the cash position has been shored up considerably  The potential of a  15M to  25M fee from Merck Serono coming at the conclusion of the current phase 2b trial along with Merck Serono shouldering the burden of additional clinical development of Tcelna for MS  goes a long way in clearing up the cash worry for current Opexa shareholders  Conclusion Trading shares of small float biotech companies is certainly not a risk averse endeavor  and the proper risk reward allocation is a crucial component to any successful portfolio  Having said that  the developmental biotech space is where investors can find returns similar to Sarepta Therapeutics  SRPT   Sarepta traded under  3 00 a year ago as it worked through a phase II trial for eteplirsen  indicated for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy  DMD   It now trades now at over  32 a share while the company expects to hear from the FDA on accelerated approval for eteplirsen soon  It is my opinion that Opexa Therapeutics presents both a high probability swing trade as well as considerable upside potential for the long term investor  The company is due to release its quarterly 10K Wednesday morning at 7 30  With only 8 5M shares outstanding  and an undervalued market cap of only 17 3M  a positive news announcement could send shares of Opexa surging quite a bit higher ,2013-03-27,Scott

125533,347048,SRPT,Muscular Dystrophy Drug Succeeds  Sarepta Buyers Flood In,opinion,Yesterday we saw erratic  bullish action in shares of Sarepta Therapeutics  SRPT  after key data was released early on  from a study on GlaxoSmithKline  GSK  and Prosena s drug known as drisapersen  which is also being developed for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy  DMD   Although this is a drug that could compete with Sarepta s DMD drug eteplirsen later on  buyers pushed SRPT over 11  higher on the notion that the drisapersen trial provided more data establishing the efficacy of DMD treatments that induce skipping of exon 51 during transcription of the dystrophin gene  The Disease   Mechanism of Action DMD is the most common form of muscular dystrophy in children  and affects roughly one out of every 3 500 boys worldwide according to Sarepta s own estimates  which equates to roughly 600 male births per year   Because the gene that causes muscular dystrophy is located on the X chromosome it s virtually impossible for a female to be affected due to the existence of a functional copy on their second X chromosome  although they have a 50  chance to pass the disease onto their offspring  Muscular dystrophy  which gradually kills muscle cells throughout patients  lifespans  is caused by mutations of the gene that code for the production of a vital protein known as dystrophin  The dystrophin protein itself is absolutely vital for connecting the structural components of individual muscle cells to one another through the extracelluar matrix  Scientists will not be able to develop a true cure for muscular dystrophy in the near future  but there are many angles through which we can slow the overall progression of the disease  Some have proven more successful than others  but nothing compares to the likes of eteplirsen and drisapersen  After research performed in previous decades  scientists have mapped out and located the exact mutations of the dystrophin gene that cause the various types of muscular dystrophy  Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy has been linked to exon 51  Successful Manipulation of RNA   Dystrophin Using cutting edge technology  Sarepta and Prosena designed compounds that induce skipping of exon 51 during the transcription process  when DNA is written into RNA   This allows muscular dystrophy patients to produce functional dystrophin proteins that don t contain the exact amino acids coded for in exon 51 without replacing their actual DNA  a very difficult task   This mechanism of action is proving to be quite viable  as more and more data suggests that these altered dystrophin proteins seem to be highly functional  Drisapersen s Phase III efficacy data was based on something known as the 6MWD  6 minute walk distance   which is a crude but simple to understand method of measuring slowdown in muscular dystrophy progression  Statistically significant improvements in the  continuous  drisapersen arm versus placebo were seen after 24 and 48 weeks  although the  intermittent  arm was only able to outperform placebo at the 48 week mark  This suggests that exon 51 skipping drugs need to be taken quite consistently to produce optimal therapeutic results  In agreement with Feuerstein  who provided the results yesterday  I m interested to see whether these top line results were stellar because of the outperformance of patients that took drisapersen or because of more rapid deterioration in the placebo arms  We d also be able to say that exon 51 skipping works with much more conviction had they included dystrophin protein levels as a secondary endpoint  although Sarepta investors should realize that this data takes care of an issue that many had with the Phase II results that they first announced in early October 2012   the tiny patient population  The Takeaway Sarepta s Phase II trial enrolled only 12 children  while GSK s trial enrolled 53  Although this is still small for a Phase III trial  duchenne muscular dystrophy is an extremely rare genetic disorder that has a very limited patient population  Given the situation  the FDA would be hard pressed to reject these drugs based on the small number of patients that they were tested on  Sarepta recently held a meeting with the FDA to discuss the potential approval of eteplirsen based on existing clinical trial data  although the results of this meeting are not yet public and will be released  some time before the end of April   The top line drisapersen Phase III results were not available at the time  although it would make the most sense if the FDA linked the success of the drisapersen trial to the early approval of eteplirsen  Depending on the actual results of that meeting  we should see significant movement in SRPT in either direction before the end of April  A fresh  buy  rating on SRPT from Ritu Baral of Canaccord Genuity put out in reaction the drisapersen data suggests that the efficacy link between drisapersen and eteplirsen is also established by Wall Street analysts  Another positive brought about by the drisapersen Phase III trial is its potential impact on RNA based therapeutics as a whole  As mentioned in my note from early March 2013  I have a lot of confidence in the RNA sector due to the flexibility and power of RNA manipulation in the treatment of various diseases  Muscular dystrophy seems to be one of the first indications that RNA will thrive in  but more indications will come as technology improves  Sarepta is now one of the major players in the field  which is one of the reasons it has received so much attention this year  Although valuable by itself  eteplirsen is also a financial stepping stone that Sarepta will use to leverage its RNA technology in other indications ,2013-04-11,Myriad

125542,347057,SRPT,Sarepta Investors See GSK s Drisapersen Receiving Breakthrough Status,opinion,Sarepta Therapeutics  SRPT  is a company that focuses on RNA therapeutics  and is currently focusing on the use of their platform to develop drugs that induce exon skipping  which alters the RNA transcription in muscular dystrophy patients and produces functional versions of a protein known as dystrophin   SRPT continues to see elevated levels of bearish speculation ahead of another post Phase II meeting with the FDA  which will determine whether or not the company s Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy  DMD  drug eteplirsen will be eligible for accelerated approval based on the data that was produced from the 12 patient Phase II trial that initially sent Sarepta stock soaring to new highs in October 2012   If eteplirsen receives accelerated approval  eteplirsen could realistically be on the market in Q4 2014 with incomplete data from Phase III trials  Without it  investors generally expect a 1 1 5 year delay that could discourage investment in the company until Phase III data  The accelerated approval application would probably be submitted in early 2014   Although the stock itself is on a steady uptrend  total short interest has remained close to 10 M shares  or about 33  of float  Options activity also implies heavy speculation  especially on the bearish  or put side  ahead of the next meeting with the FDA  Note that this meeting is scheduled to occur near the end of July 2013   This bearish sentiment grew yesterday after the only other competing DMD drug  GSK s Prosensa  drisapersen  received breakthrough drug status from the FDA  Investors seemed nervous that Prosensa might take market share away from eteplirsen due to a virtually identical mechanism of action  although these fears are overblown  Note that both drugs induce exon 51 skipping to create semi functional dystrophin proteins  although drisapersen s toxicity profile is far less favorable   The initial bearish reaction in SRPT stock to the drisapersen update has been reversed  as Sarepta investors make the argument that this may actually bode well for eteplirsen s chances at being eligible for accelerated approval   Although Sarepta has become expensive at this point  the short interest  as mentioned  is extremely high and presents some downside protection in the event that eteplirsen cannot receive accelerated approval ,2013-06-30,Frank Kollar,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sarepta-investors-see-gsk’s-drisapersen-receiving-breakthrough-status-173378,173378

125562,347077,SRPT,Stock Up 300  In Six Weeks    But There s More    Right  ,opinion,Sarepta Therapeutics Inc    SRPT  formerly AVI BioPharma  Inc   is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of ribonucleic acid based  RNA  therapeutics for the treatment of both rare and infectious diseases  This is a vol and stock note on a bio tech with some very interesting news  I ll summarize what s the happs below  then we ll move onto the options and vol  I ll be taking a chunk of this content from a Seeking Alpha article  cited below Sarepta Therapeutics  SRPT   formerly known as AVI BioPharma  is closing in on a significant medical breakthrough for the largest segment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy sufferers  Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is an affliction that results in muscle degeneration and certain early death  It affects mostly boys with most sufferers wheelchair dependent by age 12 and a life expectancy of 25 years  There is no known cure for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy  Sarepta s stock has been on a tear the last five weeks going from around  4 per share on July 23rd and closing at  15 82 August 31  The catalyst for this move was Sarepta s release of 36 week data of their current phase IIb extension study that  according to Sarepta s CEO Chris Garabedian  showed  statistically significant clinical benefit  in the 6 minute walk test   which is a  clinical meaningful outcome measure  for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy        that the lead investigator for the trial is Dr  Jerry Mendell  who is the director of the Centers for Gene Therapy and Muscular Dystrophy at Nationwide Children s Hospital in Columbus  OH  Dr  Mendell stated Sarepta s drug had  an unprecedented treatment effect  on participants in its latest trial  Sarepta plans to release the full 48 week trial results for the above referenced study in October  If the results are positive as expected  Sarepta will go for accelerated FDA approval      Source  Seeking Alpha via Yahoo  Finance    written by R S  Analytics  So that was a pretty awesome article  though I haven t verified essentially any of it  Buyer beware  Let s start with the Charts Tab  six months   below  The top portion is the stock price  the bottom is the vol  IV30    red vs HV20    blue vs HV180    pink  We can see the incredible run of late    SRPT was trading at  3 46 on 7 23 2012 and is now nearly  15 in less than two months  The first gap up came on 7 24 2012  when the stock moved from  3 46 to  8 52  close to close   Here s the news from that day CAMBRIDGE  Mass   AP     Sarepta Therapeutics Inc  said Tuesday that its experimental muscular dystrophy drug eteplirsen met its goal in an extension study  and shares of the company more than doubled in value     Source  AP via Yahoo  Finance    The stock found a bit of a quiet period following the gap up  but has recently risen again  The stock closed at  10 78 on 8 24 2012 and is now nearly 40  higher in about two weeks  On the vol side we have a bit murkier of a picture since the stock changed symbols recently  Having said that  we can see that the implied is now at an annual high pushing over 140   But the news is due out in Oct  probably   and the Skew Tab shows us that  Let s turn to the Skew Tab to examine the line by line and month to month vols  We can see high the vol in the Oct options is well above the vol in Sep and Nov  This reflects the likelihood of an event  announcement  in Oct  I do note that the skew is flat to the upside  which is not necessarily what I would have expected given the interim good news  Having said that  with the stock up 400   or whatever  in the last 6 weeks  the option market may be reflecting lower risk  potential  from the current levels than when this was a single digit stock price Finally  let s turn to the Options Tab  for completeness Across the top we can see the monthly vols are priced to 113 66   176 40  and 154 32   respectively for Sep  Oct and Nov  I do note a few things  1  Sep is still elevated which reflects the risk that  something  comes out before the expected Oct date  That something may just be more anecdotal results from extremely happy parents  that s been happening apparently   2  Oct vol will likely rise if no new news slips out  As the event date approaches  the weighted average of vols in Oct will lead to a rise in the overall level  200   vol is not impossible here and may be too low  But  of course  surprise news can change all of that  3  Nov is quite elevated  While that expiry does include all of the days in Oct  it feels like there is risk of the news coming out after Oct expo  maybe    In any case  all options and stock prices aside  I hope this drug is an absolute revelation as it seems to be in early stages  I can honestly say  I am rooting for this company  Disclosure  This is trade analysis  not a recommendation ,2012-09-05,Ophir
