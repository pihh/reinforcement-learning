Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood day and welcome to the Dow Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call   Operator Instructions I would now like to turn the call over to Mr  Neal Sheorey  Please go ahead  sir Neal Sheorey    Vice President of Investor RelationsGood morning  everyone  Thank you for joining us to discuss the fourth quarter financial results for Dow  We re making this call available via webcast and we have prepared slides to supplement our comments during this conference call  They are posted on the Investor Relations section of Dow s website and through the link to our webcast Speaking on the call today are Jim Fitterling  Dow s Chief Executive Officer  and Howard Ungerleider  President and Chief Financial Officer  Please read the forward looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides  During our call  we will make forward looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future  Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties  our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward looking statements  Dow s forms 10 Q and 10 K include detailed discussions of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences Unless otherwise specified  all historical financial measures presented today are on a pro forma basis and all financials where applicable exclude significant items  We ll also refer to non GAAP measures  A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures is contained in the Dow earnings release  in the slides that supplement our comments today and on the Dow website On slide 2 you ll see our agenda for the call  Jim will start with an overview of Dow s fourth quarter and operating segment performance as well as an update on Sadara  Howard will then move into a financial overview of the quarter  including details on our principal joint ventures and will also provide some comments on modeling guidance for the first quarter and full year  And finally  Jim will provide a review of Dow s performance against our 2019 target and then close with our priorities for 2020  Following that  we will take your questions With that  I ll turn the call over to Jim Jim Fitterling    Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Neal and thanks  everyone for joining us this morning  Starting on slide 3  the Dow team once again executed against our operational and financial playbook that closed a pivotal year in the Company s history  We captured growth achieved another year over year improvement in cash from operations and delivered leading returns to shareholders  Our results showcase the resilience of our portfolio and our ability to leverage our core strengths and our focus on delivering value to our customers and owners  Here are some notable highlights from the quarter First  we continued to capture demand in key end markets  particularly those closer to the consumer  The trends in the fourth quarter mirrored what we ve seen all year  Solid demand in consumer driven staples offset by lagging or contracting demand in industrial segments and in applications related to big ticket items such as automobiles  Overall  excluding the Hydrocarbons   Energy business  we achieved volume growth of 2  in the quarter  Second  we continue to drive a lean cost structure  We removed more than  35 million of stranded costs in the quarter  And third  we remain focused on generating strong cash flow and utilizing our free cash flow in a balanced way aligned with our capital allocation priorities We generated  1 9 billion of cash flow from operations  up more than  500 million year over year  Our EBITDA to cash from operations conversion rose significantly to 110  supported by the inflow of cash from the legal judgment with Nova as well as the release of cash from working capital  These factors enabled us to execute more than  1 billion in deleveraging as well as return  600 million to our shareholders  I m proud of the Dow team s performance in the face of challenging industrial market and trade dynamics  Once again  we demonstrated our ability to control the things that we can control while pursuing growth opportunities in our targeted end markets  And equally importantly  these results represent solid progress against the priorities we laid out a year ago  which I will review later in the call Moving on to our segment results in the quarter on slide 4  Packaging   Specialty Plastics operating EBIT was  648 million  The benefits of stranded cost savings and volume gains in the Packaging   Specialty Plastics business were more than offset by lower polyethylene prices and reduced equity earnings  The Packaging   Specialty Plastics business delivered 4  volume growth led by double digit growth in Asia Pacific  We continue to see solid demand growth in our key packaging end markets including Flexible Food   Specialty Packaging  Industrial   Consumer Packaging  and health and hygiene applications  Hydrocarbons   Energy reported both lower volume and price  Volume declines were primarily due to planned turnaround activity in Europe  which led to reduced hydrocarbon co product sales On slide 5  Industrial Intermediates   Infrastructure operating EBIT was  221 million  primarily reflecting margin compression in polyurethane components as well as lower equity earnings largely driven by margin compression in MEG at the Kuwait joint ventures and in glycol ethers at Sadara  Industrial Solutions reported lower net sales primarily driven by lower prices for chemical intermediate  Volumes also declined modestly  primarily in ethylene glycols which was partly offset by growth in heat transfer fluids and pharmaceutical applications  The Polyurethanes   Construction Chemicals business reported modest volume growth driven by gains in construction chemicals applications  And this was more than offset by local price declines for polyurethane intermediates And finally on slide 6  Performance Materials   Coatings operating EBIT was  233 million  EBIT rose year over year in part due to lower cost in the Coatings   Performance Monomers business which was impacted by an extended turnaround in the fourth quarter of 2018  Sales declined as a result of weaker local prices in all regions primarily due to lower siloxanes prices  Consumer Solutions delivered flat volume versus the year ago period  Growth in high performance infrastructure applications globally as well as improved demand for siloxanes in Asia Pacific and the US and Canada was offset by demand contraction in automotive and consumer electronics end markets Coatings   Performance Monomers sales declined due to lower local prices and volumes  On a regional basis  coatings volume was primarily impacted by lower demand in the US and Canada and Europe  Before I turn it over to Howard  I want to give an update on our progress at Sadara  As we mentioned last year we had one remaining logistics service agreement to get signed by parties in the kingdom in order to start the process of achieving project completion  I m pleased to report that the parties have reached agreement in principle and the official signing is imminent  And as a result  the remaining steps to achieve project completion are under way As we ve discussed before  achieving project completion is an important milestone for several reasons  First  it formalizes Sadara as a fully operational venture  Second  it enables the parent guarantees that Dow has on Sadara s debt to be released  And third  Sadara will then move forward to reprofile its debt  The debt reprofiling is a critical next step for Sadara  and providing the JV with enhanced financial flexibility  The JV expects these discussions to take place over the course of this year and we will provide another update once they have more to share Sadara offers an impressive suite of world class assets  technologies and products  both Dow and Saudi Aramco remain aligned to shareholders in getting Sadara to a self sustaining financial position as soon as possible  Finally  as we look through our fourth quarter results  you will see that we recorded a write down of our equity investment in Sadara  I want to emphasize that this action does not detract from our belief in the JV s ability to enhance its financial strength and achieve independence  rather  it is a reflection of our view of the latest financial projections for the JV relative to the book value of our investment I ll now turn it over to Howard to discuss our financial performance in the quarter and modeling guidance Howard Ungerleider    President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Jim and good morning  everyone  Turning to slide 8  net sales were  10 2 billion at the high end of our guidance range  Local price declined 12  year over year  driven primarily by declines in polyethylene  isocyanates and hydrocarbon co products  Currency decreased sales by 1   Volume declined 2  year over year  largely driven by lower hydrocarbon co product sales  Excluding the Hydrocarbons   Energy business  volume was up 2  led by demand growth in packaging and construction chemical applications  Equity losses were  21 million  Operating EBIT was  1 billion Tailwinds during the quarter included savings from stranded cost removal  contributions from new capacity on the US Gulf Coast and improved earnings in the Performance Materials   Coatings segment  These gains were more than offset by year over year margin compression in our core value chains  lower equity earnings and higher planned turnaround costs  Operating EBITDA margin improved by 33 basis points year over year  and excluding equity earnings  it expanded 75 basis points  Our fourth quarter operating EBIT results also benefited by approximately  50 million from a few discrete project related items These included two items in our Industrial Solutions business  catalyst sales and a large concentrated solar power project  Below the EBIT line  we reported an unfavorable tax rate year over year and versus our guidance resulting from a change in our mix of geographic earnings  Notably  we experienced a drop in earnings in Europe  due in part to a reduction in integrated polyethylene margins as well as turnaround costs related to the planned maintenance outage at our cracker in the Netherlands  This was offset by favorable interest expense  D A and share count Operating EPS was  0 78  On a GAAP basis  we reported a loss per share due to significant items that totaled  3 92 per share  This was driven by several items in the quarter  We recorded a non cash impairment charge of  2 85 billion  which included a  1 75 billion write down related to Sadara that Jim mentioned  as well as a  1 billion impairment of goodwill associated with the Coatings   Performance Monomers reporting unit  These writedowns were conducted following our annual financial projection reviews which determined that the carrying values were higher than the fair values Moving to cash flow  As we laid out at our Investor Day in 2018  we ve been applying a much greater focus on enhancing cash flow  And once again  the Dow team delivered a strong quarter on our cash metrics  We generated  1 9 billion of cash from continuing operations  which was driven by improvements in earnings to cash conversion supported by a more than  400 million release of cash from net working capital  Finally  we allocated our free cash flow in a balanced way in line with our capital allocation priorities  We paid down more than  1 billion of debt in the quarter and returned  611 million to our owners  including the remaining  100 million of share repurchases left to achieve our  500 million share repurchase target for 2019 Turning to our principal joint ventures on slide 9  Equity losses for the quarter were  21 million  This was primarily driven by lower results at our Kuwait joint ventures as a result of margin compression in MEG and polyethylene as well as reduced cracker and polyethylene margins at our Thailand JVs  Sadara reported a modest improvement in earnings as the benefits of volume gains and cost control more than offset price declines Moving to slide 10  We continue to provide modeling guidance on a sequential basis  As we believe this is the most relevant way to explain the dynamics  given the current market conditions  We see first quarter being stable with where we ended the fourth quarter  As I mentioned before  we had some project based items in the fourth quarter that benefited our results  After adjusting for those items  the key drivers are tailwinds from lower turnaround costs and normal seasonal recovery from the fourth quarter  headwinds from an ongoing third party supplier outage near our Tarragona  Spain site  lower results in our JVs primarily due to compressed spreads in Asia  and a non operational headwind from higher pension expense as a result of lower discount rates at the end of 2019 In the Packaging   Specialty Plastics segment  we entered the year expecting overall stabilization with some regional recovery  With negative integrated polyethylene margins in Asia and European margins low as well  we expect price increases to gain traction from the low point at the end of 2019  If they don t  we expect high cost producers to come under pressure  And in fact  we ve already seen some competitors trim back rates in the fourth quarter for that very reason  The Industrial Intermediates   Infrastructure segment will benefit from the lower turnaround costs compared to the prior quarter  However  as I mentioned  we re currently impacted by a third party supplier outage near our Tarragona  Spain site  which has forced us to take some yield derivative capacity offline And finally  in Performance Materials   Coatings  we expect siloxanes pricing to remain relatively flat with the fourth quarter  In Coatings   Performance Monomers  we re expecting normal seasonal uplift in profitability  The core business performance  however  will be offset by higher planned turnaround activity at our Performance Monomers site in Texas Turning to full year 2020 on slide 11  there are several items for consideration as you update your models  We provided the income statement and cash flow items that we can forecast at this time  We expect our 2020 JV equity earnings to be lower than 2019  largely due to the averaging impact as key spreads did not bottom until the second quarter of 2019  We also anticipate planned turnaround spending to be flat year over year  And as I mentioned before  we expect higher pension expense of  125 million year over year  And we provided the estimated split of that headwind by segment Below the EBIT line  we once again anticipate lower interest expense  as a result of our lower debt level  We see our tax rate range moving higher this year as we re forecasting a change in our geographic mix of earnings  particularly due to lower earnings in Europe  And finally  our share count estimate includes base case share repurchases to offset dilution  Some selected guidance for cash items is included on the right  and on the next slide  we have provided a review of our know cash upsides and downsides to give some context for our free cash flow optionality this year So with that  let s turn to slide 12  There is no change in our cash priorities for 2020  We remain focused on generating solid cash flow from operations and improving our cash flow conversion  And we will continue to prioritize our use of free cash flow between deleveraging  incremental capex  targeting lower risk growth opportunities and returns to shareholders  Our base case operating cash flow upsides and downsides are shown here  Cash upsides include reduced integration  separation and restructuring spending  slightly lower required cash contributions to our pension plans  interest expense savings and an inflow of cash from a fence line customer for an ethylene capacity reservation fee  which we expect at the end of 2020 Regarding capex  we see our spending in a range of  1 5 billion to  1 75 billion this year  which gives us an additional  250 million to  500 million of flexibility to either apply toward our free cash flow priorities or pursue incremental growth investments  And given that there is still work ahead for Sadara  we re conservatively assuming that our contributions will remain flat with 2019  Downsides include a decrease in JV dividends as the JVs pay the dividend based on the previous year s earnings  Our base case does not assume any non operational cash inflows related to our remaining legal proceedings with Nova  And therefore we show a year over year decline With that said  we continue to actively pursue resolutions in our favor on two items  reclaiming the tax withheld on last year s pre 2012 judgment and obtaining a judgment on the post 2012 case  The most important takeaway here is that we expect our cash generation in 2020 to leave us with free cash flow optionality  We have a few key priorities that will dictate how we deploy this cash  The dividend remains our number 1 priority  We are currently on the high side of our capital structure target and so deleveraging continues to also be a key priority as well as putting more investments  indoor businesses where we see lower risk  quicker payback opportunities  Should market condition show improvement  we could also lean more toward returning additional capital to shareholders Other cash optionality could also come from non operational items  The items listed on this slide hold additional free cash flow potential of approximately  1 billion  All of these items are in motion and we will continue to provide updates on them as we make progress  In some  we re confident of about our ability to deliver against our disciplined financial playback this year and we will continue to deploy free cash flow in a responsible manner that balances our actions to improve our debt profile  strengthen our financial flexibility and reward our owners With that  I ll turn it back to Jim Jim Fitterling    Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Howard  Turning to slide 13  just over a year ago  we laid out to investors  a clear set of near term priorities for Dow that reflected our more focused  disciplined and market oriented company  and in 2019  we delivered on these priorities  We controlled the factors in our control and we showcased our resilience  I ll spend the next few minutes highlighting the key progress we made in 2019 against our objectives  starting with slide 14 Our focus on profitable growth helped us navigate the headwinds that we faced throughout 2019  Our US Gulf Coast investments enabled top line volume growth in the Packaging   Specialty Plastics segment as well as bottom line contributions  Thanks to the US Gulf Coast s global cost competitiveness  Even in the midst of a year of market challenges  our packaging business grew volume year over year every quarter in 2019  which ultimately reflects our businesses  global competitiveness Our silicones franchise completed 16 incremental growth projects  unlocking additional downstream capabilities and driving higher captive siloxane s consumption  This will continue to be our focus going forward as downstream silicones applications can deliver up to 1 000 basis points of margin uplift over commodity siloxanes  We reached final investment decision on our flexible alkoxylation capacity expansions and signed a 10 year supply agreement with a key customer  And we announced plans to retrofit an ethylene facility in Louisiana with our new proprietary fluidized catalytic dehydrogenation technology to produce on purpose propylene  Our digitalization efforts helped us improve our customers  experience In 2019  we launched an expanded e commerce portal on Dow com  We achieved nearly  3 billion of revenue on the portal in 2019  And we have plans to continue growing sales through this channel  Turning to slide 15  We demonstrated a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation  First and foremost we redoubled our focus on cash and improved our cash flow conversion to 78   which was 37 percentage point above the conversion rate we had in 2018 In the fourth quarter alone  we achieved a conversion rate of 110  as we benefited from a combination of operational and non operational cash improvements  We also prudently managed capital spending  responding to the softer market conditions by proactively cutting capex spending to  2 billion or  500 million below the target set at the beginning of the year  More importantly  we tilted our growth cap  Phonetic  toward the highest return businesses pushing forward our WAVE 2 investments in our packaging  silicones and Industrial Solutions businesses These actions enabled us to deliver  3 8 billion of free cash flow in 2019 which we deployed to drive toward our capital structure target and to reward our shareholders  We strengthened our debt maturity profile by paying down more than  3 billion of debt and we conducted opportunistic liability management such that our next material debt maturity is not until the second half of 2022  We did all this while also delivering  2 6 billion to our shareholders through our strong dividend and share repurchases Turning to slide 16  we continue to reduce our cost structure  We achieved more than  600 million in cost synergy and stranded cost savings in 2019  This included more than  160 million of stranded cost removal and the completion of our  1 365 billion cost synergy program  As a result of streamlining and optimizing our organizational and management structure over the past few years  we closed 2019 at the headcount that we targeted at our Investor Day a little more than a year ago  These actions were also shaped by our enhanced focus on benchmarking  which brings me to our final pillar  best owner mindset on slide 17 We follow through in our commitments to increase transparency and disclosure  We moved to ethylene market based transfer pricing  shifted our primary profit metric from EBITDA to EBIT and disclosed our key product capacity  We enhanced our focus on benchmarking to develop a clear picture of our competitive position in the market and share that output with shareholders on a periodic basis  These were critical steps to drive toward best in class performance On the portfolio management front  we completed a number of incremental transactions aligned with actions to clean up and simplify our footprint  During the fourth quarter alone  we shut down a polyurethanes facility in Australia as well as the Coatings manufacturing facility in the US  We transfered ownership of a coatings emulsion plant in Germany to Trinseo  We sold our assets on derivatives business and associated assets  site infrastructure  land and utilities in West Virginia to ALTIVIA  and finally we sold our La Porte  Texas site In summary  we did what we said we would do  And the framework we used in 2019 applies once again to our priorities in 2020 which we outlined on slide 18  In terms of growth  even though we plan to keep our capital spending restrained  We will still progress our suite of higher return  lower risk growth investments  On the immediate horizon  we expect the two new furnaces at our Texas 9 cracker to come online by the middle of second quarter 2020 with commissioning projected to start for the end of first quarter  This will bring the crackers capacity to 2 million metric tons making it the world s largest ethylene facility  And today  we are announcing plans to incrementally expand capacity at our ethylene facility in Western Canada by approximately 130 000 metric tons with the addition of another furnace  Dow will co invest in the expansion with a regional customer  evenly sharing the project costs and ethylene output This expansion leverages our unique cost advantage feedstock position in Western Canada  The additional ethylene will be consumed by existing polyethylene assets in the region  making the investment immediately accretive once it comes online in the first half of 2021  Dow will fund this project within our stated capex spending target  We also have more incremental silicones investments on back in 2020  As we are targeting another 12 debottlenecks this year  We expect to complete branded cost removal by capturing the remaining  140 million of savings and we will also focus on continuous productivity not only in terms of cost  but also manufacturing efficiencies As Howard mentioned earlier  we have plenty of operational and non operational cash flow actions that we are pursuing  Finally  we will continue to apply a best owner mindset to all we do  The Dow team continues to evaluate additional incremental footprint cleanup options  much like the ones we completed in the fourth quarter of 2019  We will provide updates through the year as we have information to share  Before I wrap up my comments  I will provide our current outlook  which is on slide 19 Many of our key product lines were challenged throughout 2019  However  our advantaged positions on the cost curve  global diversification and differentiated products have allowed us to continue capturing volume growth around the globe  So far in 2020  we have seen similar conditions to those at the end of 2019  But the dynamic is now beginning to shift  As macro conditions weakened into the end of 2019  third party industry reports indicated that high cost producers in mini chains were struggling with breakeven or negative cash margins  For example  in polyethylene  capacity in Europe and Asia that utilizes naphtha feedstock  which represents a significant amount of global capacity was at 0 or negative margins for much of the fourth quarter MDI spreads around the world have continued to bounce around  what we believe are breakeven levels  and siloxanes prices in China have also hovered at breakeven levels or at least the last six months  For these reasons  third party industry reports have suggested that producers with fourth quartile cost positions are considering or implementing rate cuts or extending planned turnaround  And in the past few months  we have been public announcements by some producers delaying new capacity additions  And with inventory levels normalizing in some of our chains  we see a good environment for an inflection to gain traction In our view  it is still too early to claim sustainable improvement  And in fact  it could take some time for the dynamics to play out  But that said  we are seeing early signs that support gradual improvement in the near term from the lows that we reached at the end of 2019  So to close on slide 20  as we enter 2020  we are taking a conservative view given the macro and micro trends that we re seeing  Recent trade resolutions should be a positive for sentiment  but it may take some time before we see this translate into improved fundamentals  Even after the Phase 1 US China agreement  a majority of the original tariffs is still in place  which will continue to weigh on supply chains as well as consumer and investor sentiment  As such  the same discipline that we showed in 2019 will guide our actions in 2020 We re not counting on end market conditions to determine our success  rather  we have a suite of actions and advantages within our control  We will continue to be financially disciplined  Our portfolio will remain competitive  Thanks to our operational and footprint advantages  We will continue to generate strong free cash flow and responsibly allocate that capital along the lines of our priorities  and we will continue to institute self help measures  These factors will serve us well as our end market stabilize and reset  And just as important  they put us in the best position to continue serving our customers and rewarding our shareholders Now  I ll turn it back to Neal to open the Q A Neal Sheorey    Vice President of Investor RelationsThank you  Jim  With that  let s move on to your questions  I would like to remind you that our forward looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q A  Operator please provide the Q A instructions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  And our first question  we ll hear from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets Arun Viswanathan    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystThanks  Good morning  I m just curious  it sounds like  basically you re seeing a potentially supply driven inflection point  there is    maybe return rate cuts by competitors on the motivation of weak margins  I guess I m just worried that if demand does improve  and we see some slight improvement  industrially speaking  would that prevent some of these supply shutdowns going forward and kind of current path to recovery that you re potentially seeing  Maybe you can just offer some thoughts on how that materializes over the next couple of quarters Jim Fitterling    Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Arun  This is Jim  Thanks for the question  I think what we saw and what we ve seen out of the third party reports is that  you had some fairly significant deltas on cash margins for some of the  especially naphtha producers in Asia and a little bit in Europe too  In fact  we got to a couple of periods in the last several weeks where it was a negative to as much as  0 10 to  0 12  So that s a lot to absorb if you re at the bottom of the cycle So I m not sure that we would see it all come back on  But you can always bump around here a little bit  I would also point back to  we had very strong demand in plastics  So plastics was up 4  in the quarter  four consecutive quarters of volume growth in plastics  So I think demand is out there and I think our cost positions are good  And that s really what s helped us out  All the investments we made over the last five to seven years really brought us down on the cost position  feedstock flexibility as well as just the lower cost of the crackers  and that s what s going to help us navigate through here OperatorAnd next we ll move to Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global Hassan Ahmed    Alembic Global Advisors    AnalystGood morning  Jim  You know two part question on China  First  obviously relatively new news about this plastic ban  How should we be thinking about that  And again  early days  but  what are your thoughts about the demand impact from the Coronavirus Jim Fitterling    Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Thanks  Hassan for the question  First on the plastics ban  From a Dow perspective  we don t produce materials that go into most of those products that were banned  So straws and lightweight ag films and some of the T shirt bags is not a market for us  Most of what we re selling into China goes into more durable packaging  goes into flexible food packaging  and that demand continues to be strong  Health and hygiene markets obviously continue to be strong  Non wovens is a big market for us as well On the Coronavirus  I had the experience to live there during the SARS epidemic  And it looks  it feels like to me what we went through during the SARS time period  You ve seen an impact on tourism  people staying at home  people not going to restaurants  the service industry gets hit a little bit  people may be making a run at the grocery store to stock up on things  You re seeing some pull on demand on things like materials that are going into household cleaners or disinfectants  Non wovens that are going into masks or wipes  So we re seeing some of that pull on demand  And I know our counterparts at DuPont are also seeing that  for example  on pull on some of their non wovens in their surgical masks and things as well It will take    once we figure out how to treat this  things will start to return to normal  And I think it took us in SARS  a few weeks to really  WHO and CDC to figure out how to treat it  and then everybody started to kind of get back into normal life  Customers have not gone back from Chinese New Year yet  So I talked to the businesses yesterday  they re still seeing customers take an extended Chinese New Year  But I would imagine  in another week  they re going to have to go back  because demand for some of their products is starting to pick up too OperatorAnd next we ll move on to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley Vincent Andrews    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThank you  and good morning  everyone  Just to come back to the Asian margins on polyethylene  one of the things that we ve noticed is that a lot of the negative margin has come from the increase in the naphtha feedstock costs rather than the decrease in the price  although  I guess  it s been slightly weak  So oil prices have been flat  So can you give us an assessment of what s going on in the naphtha market and what would happen if naphtha prices retreat  but PE prices therefore don t improve in terms of the sort of expectation for a recovery in the first half Jim Fitterling    Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Vince  Good morning  That s a good question  And I do agree with you that naphtha movement up and down  is a big contributor to what we saw happen with those margins both in Europe and in Asia Pacific  The Asian pricing has been stable  So that s been a good thing  Even the end of the year  and typically at the end of the year  you would see people doing some destock  and you might expect that price to get depressed  but it held up pretty well  But I think it s holding up well  because the breakeven costs over there  are much  much higher So if we re running at the bottoms right now on Asia and on Western Europe  and we still got this advantage on Canada  Argentina  US Gulf Coast  I think it speaks to the fact that the high cost producers are going to be under pressure for a while  And I think that s why the third party reports are out there saying people are pushing out expansion  people are talking about shuttering in some capacity  We ll see    we ll see how that develops The other thing I would mention is that typically in March to June  that s the heavy turnaround season for ethylene  And usually historically you have about 8  of the capacity offline  A lot of the third party reports that are out there right now  and turnaround activity have as much as 15  of that capacity offline  So I think as we go through the quarter and some of that capacity  it comes off  we re going to see some opportunities there for  some pricing and some margin expansion OperatorAnd next we ll hear from Jeff Zekauskas with J P  Morgan Jeff Zekauskas    J P  Morgan    AnalystThanks very much  What    is the  500 million that you plan to put into Sadara  optional on your part or was it part of a contractual obligation  What s the theory behind the additional investment  And are there any obligations that you ll face in 2021  Or is this the end of the investment Howard Ungerleider    President and Chief Financial OfficerHey  Jeff  good morning  This is Howard  That  500 million is what we had to put in last year  As you look at Sadara where we are in the cycle with chain margins and polyolefins and isocyanates  They ve got enough cash flow that they re generating to cover their own cost and to cover their interest expense  But the project was project financed  and the project financing all is  now that the project is fully operational  the principle is coming due and they don t have enough cash to generate  to pay all of that principle  So that  500 million is roughly our expectation at 2020  Conservatively will look like 2019  And in 2019  we had to put in  500 million which was our 35  ownership of the principal And so what we talked about    that Jim talked about on the  I think in the prepared remarks is that  we ve got agreement in principle now on the logistic    last logistics agreement  That s the last remaining step  Signature of that document is imminent  At that point  we will have achieved project completion  And then we  Sadara will work with the support obviously at both Dow and Aramco to reprofile the debt with the lender group  And so that s our focus and that    our expectation is that will take us through the better part of this year to get that done  So conservatively for modeling purposes  we said look  we ll put the  500 million in there  just as a precaution OperatorAnd moving on  David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank will have our next question David Begleiter    Deutsche Bank    AnalystThank you  Jim  just looking back on Q4  just a two part question  First PM C  can you comment on how it was so strong given  some weak siloxane margins  And second  the  50 million of catalyst sales and other benefits  solar fill benefits  were those expected to be realized in the quarter  when we last spoke back in October  November  Thank you Jim Fitterling    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So  thanks  David  Good question  One of the main things we had was we had lower cost  this fourth quarter than last year  because  there was a turnaround fourth quarter of  19 out of  18  And we didn t have that in the fourth quarter of  19  We also saw lower propylene raw material costs  So we had PDH out in turnaround  And propylene price has actually came down pretty significantly  So that rolled through on the acrylics chain  So you see some of that impact  We did get some margin expansion  So we saw siloxanes pricing slightly improve  and we also saw some volume gain in siloxanes versus what we had expected And to your point on the two one time things  catalyst and the solar fill  we had expected those  I mean  you never know exactly when the timing of those is going to happen  because they re capital projects  So when the solar fill charge comes  when they tell you  hey  deliver the material  we re ready to load up the plan  And I just happened in the fourth quarter  So I think that  when you can look at and say that one wasn t expected in Q4 OperatorAnd we ll move on to Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein Jonas Oxgaard    Bernstein    AnalystGood morning  guys  I was wondering  if you could talk a little bit about your capital policy for 2020  As far as I can tell  there is no buybacks in the guidance  But it looks    it does look like you should have some capex  some cash leftover  Am I missing something here Jim Fitterling    Chief Executive OfficerLet me talk a little bit  Jonas about  how we re approaching capex  and then I ll get Howard to talk about cash priorities for the year  So we re going to start the year here with a target of  1 75 billion of capex  We will keep all of our incremental high return debottlenecks in place  Talked about the furnace add in Canada  That s on the capital list  The two furnaces that are going on  the Texas 9 will go into commissioning in March  So that s on    finishing up that is on the capital list  about a dozen debottlenecks in siloxanes  and the alkoxylation facility that we re putting in place to support that 10 year contract Additionally  we re making the investment to retrofit FCDh into one of the Louisiana crackers  and that is really to be able to deliver propane and propylene economics at a much lower scale than PDH  but also do it with like 20  less greenhouse gas emissions  20  less energy cost  So we re going to be able to really do PDH scale economics that we did over PDH 1 at 150 000 to 200 000 tons  That s a big breakthrough for us and then that becomes a great licensing opportunity for us Now  we paid down  3 billion of debt in the year  but we wanted to pay down a little bit more than that  So when we look at remaining capital  we have to keep it balanced between deleveraging  and what we want to do for share buybacks  And what s in the base case here is we will cover dilution  I think you ll see from our share count that we ve been doing a good job  So making sure the shareholders don t get diluted  So that s first priority  Howard  do you want to talk about the other priorities Howard Ungerleider    President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Thanks  Jim  Good morning  Jonas  I think  Jim covered it well  Our target that we laid out at Investor Day is to cover dilution every year at a minimum  So when we look at the margin compression that we had last year and we look at the capital  we look at our capital structure targets over the economic cycle  We re on the higher end of that range  We did a very good job of doing  3 billion as Jim said  of debt pay down last year  but we want to do a little bit more  So as we enter 2020  the primary focus after the dividend and after the  1 75 billion of capex is really to incrementally continue to delever with operational cash flows With that said  Jonas  and I think your point is very valid and you look at the slide that we put out in the deck  We are a cash generating machine  And so as we continue to drive higher cash flows  you can expect a balanced approach with additional debt paydown and additional shareholder remuneration  but we just felt like it was prudent given the capital structure targets to start the year with a preferred focus on debt paydown OperatorAnd we ll move on to Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research Frank Mitsch    Fermium Research    AnalystHey  good morning  folks  I want to come back to the Polyurethanes   Construction Chemicals business  you reported some positive trends on the construction chemicals side  I was wondering how sustainable that was  and then again on slide 19  in terms of polyurethanes  you re showing MDI  as having the MDI spread as having bottomed in September  And so I m wondering if you could talk about what your outlook is there  Are we going to flatten out  Or is this a sustainable sort of recovery there  Any sort of color there would be very helpful  Thank you Jim Fitterling    Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Frank  I think on the MDI spreads  I think the current levels that we re at are probably sustainable  You could see some pressure down on some of that  But I m hopeful with the US China deal done that they get some confidence back in the markets and some of those downstream derivatives start to pull demand and that ll firm things up a little bit  As it comes to construction chemicals  we ve seen good volume and good demand in the housing side  And I think it s held up better for longer than we had expected  it s going into a wide number of applications  which has been good  And it s offset some softness that we ve seen in some other parts of the PU business for example  systems into automotive and into furniture embedded You think  sometimes that a mattress is a high ticket item  but they were under some pressure because of the price of a mattress  it s one of the things that consumers that they re tightening the belt a little bit  more kind of slow down purchases on  but no construction looks good  And I think we re off to with the weather  We re off to a pretty reasonable start to the year OperatorAnd next up  we ll have Steve Byrne with Bank of America Steve Byrne    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystYes  thank you  I wanted to ask you a little bit about your best owner mindset  What s your long term view of the value proposition of your key joint ventures  And is your ownership of those the best use for Dow  And then also related to this best owner mindset  was curious as to whether your recent benchmarking analysis has identified any new opportunities for you for a headcount reduction  You mentioned the e commerce platform is gaining traction  Is that an area where you think that might ultimately lead to trimming the sales force Jim Fitterling    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thanks  Steve for the question  On joint ventures  we do joint ventures for several reasons  The three key joint ventures that we have today  We have strong partners with and they were for the reason of market access and to make sure that we had access to low cost feedstocks  So when you look at that  you have to think about it in context of how do I serve the market with my customers  if I don t have access to that partnership and that feedstock Our priority on the ventures is we want them to be self sustaining and self funding and stand alone  That s why we re doing what we re doing with Sadara  The Kuwait joint venture is already in that spot  The Thai joint venture is also in that spot  And then they can  as they improve  they can yield dividends and payback  or they have the ability to fund their own growth as we move forward  All of our partners in the JVs are committed to that mindset and have the same mindset as we do  And obviously what we need to do with Sadara is get through this debt reprofiling to get it in the best long term sustainable solution We re doing a lot of work on footprint  Most of that would be  I think of divestiture work  like what we did in the fourth quarter exiting a facility in a market that has declined like Australia and polyurethanes was not competitive  Looking at our La Porte  Texas site  moving that capacity over to Freeport  getting of that site  selling that site to somebody who really wants to come in and expand there  It s a good site  It s a good location  We only had one asset on that location  So we needed to make a change there  And then obviously  we will look at product chains that inside Dow may not get investment money like we did with acetone derivatives in West Virginia  That s a    there is a better owner for that business and we re continuing to look that On digital  I believe digital is going to help us in two ways  If I look at the silicones business  Consumer Solutions  they are one of the most sard  Phonetic  efficient businesses that we have  They are doing about  3 billion of sales through that digital portal  What they do then is they focus their sard capabilities on application development and very close customer context  So they pull through a lot of demand through that chain  But what digital really does for us is  help us get that end customer and that end to end signal back into our plans  So in polyurethanes  to give you an example  as we are able to get good demand signals And that s a very complicated integrated chain through that polyurethanes chain  we can run the assets differently  in some cases  we can free up as much as 10  to 20  of incremental capacity off of an asset  So it isn t just about sard  it s also about how we run the asset  How we get working capital out  We did  400 million of working capital out in the fourth quarter by the old fashion way  When we get digital rolling  I think we re going to have the capability to see more working capital improvements OperatorAnd next we ll hear from John Roberts with UBS John Roberts    UBS    AnalystThanks  Congrats on an upside quarter  When you reprofile the Sadara debt  do you get paid back on these  500 million contributions right away or does that somehow get rolled into your investment  your equity Jim Fitterling    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Good morning  John  Hey  I don t want to have that negotiation with the lenders on this earnings call  What I would say though is  I wouldn t expect that  because that s been historical principal  I really think what our focus is really trying to get    to use Jim s words to try and get Sadara to a cash flow self sufficiency  So looking to the lenders and working with them to extend the tenors and or to adjust the amortization tables not to take a haircut  And that s our primary focus of what we re going to be working with them on OperatorAnd Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse  will have our next question Christopher Parkinson    Credit Suisse    AnalystThanks  Just a corollary of a question before  Can you just comment on that  your    any updates in your intermediate term outlook for the MDI SD  Phonetic   Just breaking out some key variables in the context of some capacity delays and so on and so forth  Just any update on your longer term spread expectations  Thank you Jim Fitterling    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  MDI    I think MDI s exposure in the marketplace  Chris is  basically in those areas  I talked about that have been a little bit slow automotive  some of the more rigid polyols and so appliances those things pull on MDI chain  That s been    what s been the softest  There have been announced delays and capacity expansion  which makes obvious a lot of sense given where we are in the market in the spreads and there is enough capacity out there to satisfy the demand for a while  So I think you ll see    these are not easy facilities to build and they re not easy facilities to operate My sense is  now that we ve got a little bit of confidence coming back in after the trade deals and we start to see maybe  some people seeing their way through higher demand  if automobiles start to pick back up  you re going to see things tighten a little bit  And these spreads have the potential to go up OperatorAnd next up  we ll hear from PJ Juvekar with Citi PJ Juvekar    Citigroup    AnalystYes  Hi  good morning  A question on the recycling  It seems that specialty and engineering plastics continue to grow  while the commodity plastics come under pressure  your bags  your straws  How much of your    how much of Dow s portfolio is in specialty category  And is there an update on the recycling initiatives from the alliance  And is it mostly focusing on recycling  mechanical recycling  And do you have any long term view on polyethylene demand growth  Thank you Jim Fitterling    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Good question  PJ  So I d say  our portfolio today is probably running around 40  of the higher value materials  So all of our functional polymers business would be in that category  That s about 25  of what we sell out of P SP today  And then another 15  on the high end of P SP would be  in things like health and hygiene products  etc   which are probably not in that same space  Recycling and these bands have been targeted at low end  single use  I would say  commodity types of materials  And people just aren t getting their heads around the need for behavioral change at a consumer level to make that happen So what we re working on  with the alliance  we now have more than 46 members in the alliance  and it s growing every day  We re focusing on chemical recycling back to feedstock  so that we can make recycled plastic out of taking the plastic  going back to chemical recycling and back through the cracker and the plastics plant  We re looking at mechanical recycling and going into high volume applications like construction materials  pallets  crates into asphalt for roadways  any number of those applications  they are going to be waste to energy facilities There is a large facility right now in Indonesia  500 000 tons mixed use recycling waste to energy  chemical and mechanically recycling both  We have several projects like that  With the alliance  We have a project with Nobel Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus working on a zero plastic waste city in India  showcasing what can be done there You re seeing  across the board  tremendous amounts of recycling activity  One of our customer is still there  I just announced that they ve taken Bubble Wrap to post consumer recycle  We launched AGILITY CE last year  which is up to 70  post consumer recycled material  You re going to see that go into things like collation shrink for water bottles or beverage cases  And we re getting it into a whole host of other applications  So this is taken off in a big way  big announcements like Nestle saying  they re going to spend  2 billion to buy  post consumer recycle packaging are great  because we need that demand pull on the chain to make this work OperatorThe next up  we ll hear from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs Dylan Campbell    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGood morning  This is Dylan Campbell on for Bob  Quick question on your US cracker fleet  We saw propane prices come up in the fourth quarter  And so I m curious on kind of your ability to flex your US cracker fleet in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter  And in early January  I think thus far in January  propane prices have come back in  So I guess kind of what your ability is to flex in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter Jim Fitterling    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  a good question  Dylan  We have the ability to flex  We can flex every day  but that doesn t  sometimes makes sense  but every week we re looking at the flex that we need to take  Ethane has been in rejection here recently  So it s been advantage  but there were periods in the fourth quarter where our variable costs from cracking propane were extremely low  and butane has been in the mix  all year as well  I d say with what s going on with TPC and the C4s  We re watching butane  because we create a lot more C4s out of that  So we don t want to get ourselves into a jam on C4s But propane has been advantaged  propane advantage is    a big advantage for Dow  because we have more flex in the industry  We can crack up to 70  plus propane in the fleet in the US Gulf Coast  And it s been advantage for Europe as well  So we ve been able to crack LPGs all through the fourth quarter and we re cracking now in Europe OperatorAnd we ll move on to John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets John McNulty    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystYeah  Thanks for taking my question  With regard to the silicones debottlenecking  the new furnace furnaces at Texas 9  can you kind of ballpark the opportunities in terms of the earnings add that that can give you this year  And then also  do you have any incremental cost cutting or efficiency levers that you can pull  just given the difficult backdrop  I know you have a little bit of the    still working on cutting out some of the cost tied to stranded cost from the separation  but anything  anything beyond that we should be thinking about Jim Fitterling    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Good morning  John  We ve got another  140 million of stranded costs to come out this year  and we re well on track to deliver that number  And we re obviously looking to liberate more out of working capital as I talked about and can get that cash  And some non operational things like the remaining settlement of the 2013 to 2018 part of the Nova litigation case which will come in there  We re doing a lot with all the businesses and functions on what we can do for efficiency  So  in fourth quarter leveraged services in Dow was down 13  in terms of cost  so they re bringing a lot of efficiencies out  Digitalization will help that and I think that will be a difference  I ll throw it to Howard  do we have a number on Texas 9 and on Canada Howard Ungerleider    President and Chief Financial OfficerWell  we didn t give a number this morning on the Canadian except for the capacity  John  So what I would say is  we take a 130 000 tons as ethylene  We re going to use our portion of that  we re not all of that  we re going to use our portion of that to make additional polyolefin  We ve got the reactor capacity already there  And so that s going to be the primary focus  The other thing that I would say  that wasn t in Jim s list is the  1 billion of cash that will get back from a lower transaction costs  We spent almost  1 2 billion in cash last year  to finish the DowDuPont spin out for now  And that will get    will get 1 billion of that back this year and then another  200 million in 2021 OperatorAnd that will conclude today s question and answer session  At this time  I would like to turn the

200574,422090,DOW,Exclusive  Falwell steered Liberty University land deal benefiting his personal trainer,news,"By Aram Roston and Joshua Schneyer LYNCHBURG  Va   Reuters    Evangelical leader and prominent Donald Trump backer Jerry Falwell Jr personally approved real estate transactions by his nonprofit Christian university that helped his personal fitness trainer obtain valuable university property  according to real estate records  internal university emails and interviews  Around 2011  Falwell  president of Liberty University in Virginia  and his wife  Rebecca  began personal fitness training sessions with Benjamin Crosswhite  then a 23 year old recent Liberty graduate  Now  after a series of university real estate transactions signed by Falwell  Crosswhite owns a sprawling 18 acre racquet sports and fitness facility on former Liberty property  Last year  a local bank approved a line of credit allowing Crosswhite s business to borrow as much as  2 million against the property  Falwell  one of the most influential right wing Christian leaders in the United States  has been buffeted by disclosures about his private dealings over the last year and a half  A Florida lawsuit brought public scrutiny to a relationship between the Falwells and Giancarlo Granda  a young man they befriended while he was working as a pool attendant at a luxury Miami Beach hotel and later backed in a business venture involving a youth hostel  Falwell filed an affidavit in 2018 saying he used his own wealth to lend  1 8 million to the  4 65 million project with Granda  And U S  President Trump s now jailed fixer  Michael Cohen  has said he helped the Falwells suppress racy personal photos  as Reuters reported this May  in the months before Cohen persuaded Falwell to endorse Trump s 2016 White House bid  There is no evidence that Cohen s efforts to suppress the photos were a quid pro quo for Falwell s vital political backing  The support Falwell provided to the two young men  Granda and Crosswhite  has some parallels  Both were aided in business ventures and both have flown on the nonprofit university s corporate jet  One difference  When Falwell helped Crosswhite  he used the assets of Liberty  the tax exempt university he has led since 2008  Among the largest Christian universities in the world  Liberty depends on hundreds of millions of dollars its students receive in federally backed student loans and Pell grants  In 2016  Falwell signed a real estate deal transferring the sports facility  complete with tennis courts and a fitness center owned by Liberty  to Crosswhite  Under the terms  Crosswhite wasn t required to put any of his own money down toward the purchase price  a confidential sales contract obtained by Reuters shows  Liberty committed nearly  650 000 up front to lease back tennis courts from Crosswhite at the site for nine years  The school also offered Crosswhite financing  at a low 3  interest rate  to cover the rest of the  1 2 million transaction  the contract shows  Crosswhite declined to answer questions about the deal   All I will say is that my wife and I consult each other before every major business deal and we bought the complex from Liberty together   he said in an email   My wife and I both work around the clock to make our business succeed   Falwell referred Reuters to the university for comment  Liberty issued a statement describing the transaction as both proper and beneficial for the school  Liberty had received the athletic center as a gift in 2011 from a trustee who has since died  but it quickly became a  drain on university resources   the statement said  Crosswhite had been leasing gym space at the property since 2013  and was thus  the most viable purchaser   Liberty said it adjusted the price and financed Crosswhite s purchase because its tennis team would continue to use the courts  Falwell has  tried to be a business mentor  to Crosswhite  the university statement said  but that effort did not  cause him to abandon his fiduciary duties  to Liberty  As Liberty s leader  Falwell draws an annual salary of nearly  1 million  and is obligated to put the university s financial interests before his own personal interests when conducting Liberty business   The concern is whether the university s president wanted to do his personal trainer a favor and used Liberty assets to do it   said Douglas Anderson  a governance specialist and former internal audit chief at  Dow Chemical   NYSE DOW  Co  who reviewed both the transaction and Liberty s explanation of it at Reuters  request  That would be bad governance  he said   At a minimum  the terms suggest the buyer got a great deal and Liberty got very little   The Crosswhite Athletic Club is set off a quiet residential lane about seven miles from Liberty s campus  Its large windowless buildings house indoor tennis and racquetball courts  a gym and pavilion  During a visit by a reporter in August  Crosswhite  a muscular 31 year old with short blond hair  was training a client in the well equipped facility  running him through kettlebell swings and dumbbell presses  On a wall  A sign for  Crosswhite Fitness   with a cross where the T should be  and a citation to a verse from the New Testament s Second Epistle to the Corinthians  Falwell has publicly credited Crosswhite with helping him lose 75 pounds   That s the kind of guy he is   Crosswhite told Reuters  He asked Reuters to submit written questions about his dealings with Liberty and Falwell  but did not respond to them  PITCHING A  SWEET DEAL  The story of the business relationship between Crosswhite  Liberty and Falwell appears to begin in 2011  That year  Falwell urged other Liberty personnel in an email to cut Crosswhite a  sweet deal  allowing him to offer private gym training at the Lynchburg fitness facility  then known as the Sports Racket  which Liberty had recently acquired through the trustee s donation   Becki and I wouldn t mind working out over there with Ben as a trainer because it is more private   he wrote in the email  which was reviewed by Reuters  Falwell and his wife  who goes by Becki  each work out with Crosswhite twice a week  the university said  Falwell has become a vocal advocate of the trainer s skills  as have other university executives and clients who work with Crosswhite  The Falwells brought the trainer along on Liberty s private jet during a 2012 trip to Miami  Later  Falwell sent an email directing Liberty to lease its gym space to Crosswhite s fitness business  which began a five year lease in 2013  The cost  according to a lease document   2 300 per month  Liberty said Falwell uses the university chartered jet to fly every year to his annual physical in Miami  Crosswhite joined him in 2012  to explain to the doctors Mr  Falwell s diet and exercise program and help document the results   the university said  Because Liberty s board requires an annual physical for Falwell  the president doesn t have to reimburse the university for the corporate jet travel to Miami  the statement said  It was in Miami in 2012  as well  that Falwell met Granda  the pool attendant he would later finance in business  The financial ties between Falwell and Granda have been detailed by BuzzFeed and others  In 2016  Falwell signed the deal transferring the facility to Crosswhite  The contract says the price is  1 2 million  but notes that the  Net Purchase Price  is  580 000  because Liberty  agrees to credit  Crosswhite with rental payments for seasonal use of the site s tennis courts through 2025  The courts are used by Liberty s tennis team for practices and tournaments  Liberty  agrees to finance the purchase  at a 3  interest rate  the contract says  To help Crosswhite in the transaction  Liberty was lending Falwell s fitness trainer more than half a million dollars to buy its property  The university would receive no cash up front from the sale  the contract shows  Transactions on such favorable terms could raise concerns over stewardship of corporate assets  and potentially insufficient scrutiny by the board  said Anderson  the independent governance specialist  In 2017  after Liberty had sold the facility to Crosswhite  some university representatives voiced concern about whether the indoor tennis courts and roof over them were receiving needed maintenance  as the sales contract required  internal emails show  Falwell wasn t included in the email chain  Liberty s general counsel  David Corry  responded that the school should remind Crosswhite of his maintenance obligations  according to the email exchange  which was reviewed by Reuters  But Corry  referring to Liberty University by its initials  added a note of caution   Ben Crosswhite enjoys a close working relationship with several LU administrators  including the President   Anyone communicating with Crosswhite should do so  with knowledge ahead of time that it may be second guessed   Corry wrote  Asked about Corry s warning  Liberty said he was raising the possibility that Crosswhite might complain to any one of  several people  at Liberty if he felt he was being treated  harshly  over the maintenance obligations  Therefore  Liberty said  the university needed to  have an approach that was not only legally sound  but cordial  professional and above reproach   In 2017  Liberty provided Crosswhite with another  75 000 line of credit to conduct maintenance and repairs  the university said in its statement  In an email sent earlier this month  Corry  citing a Reuters reporter s  persistent  attempts to reach former board members and the Falwells  reminded the former trustees they had signed confidentiality agreements  He told them they were required  forever  to keep secret what they knew about the university  Crosswhite s acquisition of the sports facility appears to continue benefiting him  Last year  according to a Lynchburg Circuit Court filing  the trainer s business obtained a  2 05 million credit line from a local bank against its interest in the facility  Liberty said the credit line amount was linked to the property s future value after Crosswhite builds a swimming pool there

What s Next for DowDuPont 
While DowDuPont has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

200627,422143,DOW,Dow  DOW  Gears Up For Q2 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,Dow Inc    NYSE DOW   is scheduled to come up with its second quarter 2019 results before the opening bell on Jul 25  The company is expected to face challenges from higher expected planned turnaround costs  margin pressure and currency headwinds  However  it will likely gain from higher expected demand and cost synergy savings in the quarter Dow s shares are down around 11  over the past three months  compared with the roughly 14 3  decline recorded by the  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement What do the Estimates Say Dow expects revenues for the second quarter to be in the band of  11  11 5 billion The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the second quarter for Dow is currently pegged at  11 3 billion  Some Factors at PlayDow  in its first quarter 2019 call  said that it expects improvement in its core value chains on a sequential comparison basis on the back of seasonally higher demand  strength in consumer care  packaging and infrastructure sectors and normalization of inventory levels  These factors are expected to support margins   The company is also seeing sequentially higher pricing in its key intermediates  which is also expected to support earnings  It is also expected to benefit from cost synergy realizations in the to be reported quarter  The company expects to realize more than  125 million of year over year cost synergy savings in the quarter  It is on track to achieve roughly  600 million of savings this year However  Dow noted that it expects some challenges in the second quarter  These include headwind from sequentially higher spending related to planned turnaround and maintenance activities  The company expects roughly  200 million associated sequential headwind in the second quarter For the Performance Materials   Coatings unit  shipping restrictions from a performance monomers facility in the Deer Park  TX  is expected to continue in the second quarter due to limitations caused by a fire at a nearby third party storage and terminal facility  The company expects around  40 million sequential and  50 million year over year headwind for the June quarter  Lower prices for siloxanes are also expected to continue to hurt margins  The segment  however  is expected to gain from seasonally higher coatings demand and continued demand strength in silicones Lower isocyanates pricing and margin pressure in isocyanates products are also expected to continue in the Industrial Intermediates   Infrastructure segment   Meanwhile  the company expects its Packaging   Specialty Plastics segment to continue to benefit from sustained strong demand  especially in functional polymers in the June quarter  However  the division is expected to face headwind from lower polyethylene pricing and margins Dow is also expected face headwinds from currency pressures in the June quarter  The company expects year over year currency headwinds of  20 million each for Performance Materials   Coatings and Industrial Intermediates   Infrastructure units for the second quarter  Moreover  currency is projected to be a roughly  50 million headwind for the Packaging   Specialty Plastics segment What the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model does not show that Dow is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below  Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP for Dow is  4 47   This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged at 82 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 86 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell

200638,422154,DOW,Analysts Estimate DowDuPont  DWDP  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"DowDuPont  DWDP  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 2  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This specialty chemicals maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 70 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  37 5  
Revenues are expected to be  8 85 billion  down 58 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 40 82  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for DowDuPont 
For DowDuPont  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that DowDuPont will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that DowDuPont would post earnings of  0 89 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 88  delivering a surprise of  1 12  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
DowDuPont doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-dowdupont-dwdp-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200410993,200410993

200654,422170,DOW,Gunmen kill 15 in Kenya hotel compound attack claimed by Somali Islamists,news,"By George Obulutsa and Baz Ratner NAIROBI  Reuters    Gunmen blasted their way into a hotel and office complex in the Kenyan capital on Tuesday  killing at least 15 people and sending workers diving under desks to escape an attack claimed by Somalia based Islamist group al Shabaab  More than 12 hours after the assault began at Nairobi s upscale 14 Riverside Drive complex  bursts of gunfire and blasts were heard in the area  undermining government assurances everything was under control  The shots rang out at around 3 30 a m  local time  0030 GMT  as a group of around 150 workers was escorted from a building where they had sought refuge  Many more remained inside and some needed first aid for gunshot wounds  a first responder told Reuters  By 1 a m  local time  15 bodies had arrived at Chiromo Mortuary and more were expected  an attendant told Reuters   Identification papers indicated that 11 were Kenyan  one was American and one was British  he said  The other two were not carrying documents  A U S  State Department official confirmed one of the victims was American   We can confirm that a U S  citizen was killed in the attack   the official said without giving further details  Kenya s Interior Minister Fred Matiang i had said at 11 p m  that all buildings at the scene had been secured and scores of people evacuated  But he did not comment on the attackers  whereabouts and said security forces were still  mopping up    Nairobi is a major hub for expatriates and the compound targeted contained offices of various international companies  in an echo of a deadly 2013 assault on a Nairobi shopping center in the same neighborhood    The main door of the hotel was blown open and there was a human arm in the street severed from the shoulder   said Serge Medic  the Swiss owner of a security company who ran to the scene to help when he heard of the attack from his taxi driver   Medic  who was armed  entered the building with a policeman and two soldiers  he said  but they came under fire and retreated  An unexploded grenade lay in the lobby  he said    One man said he saw two armed men with scarves on their head and bandoliers of bullets   Medic told Reuters  as gunfire echoed in the background  Kenya has often been targeted by al Shabaab  who killed 67 people

200671,422187,DOW,Special Report  The decisions behind Monsanto s weed killer crisis,news,"By Emily Flitter  Reuters    In early 2016  agri business giant  Monsanto   NYSE MON  faced a decision that would prove pivotal in what since has become a sprawling herbicide crisis  with millions of acres of crops damaged  Monsanto had readied new genetically modified soybeans seeds  They were engineered for use with a powerful new weed killer that contained a chemical called dicamba but aimed to control the substance s main shortcoming  a tendency to drift into neighboring farmers  fields and kill vegetation  The company had to choose whether to immediately start selling the seeds or wait for the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to sign off on the safety of the companion herbicide   For a graphic on dicamba drift damage click   The firm stood to lose a lot of money by waiting  Because Monsanto had bred the dicamba resistant trait into its entire stock of soybeans  the only alternative would have been  to not sell a single soybean in the United States  that year  Monsanto Vice President of Global Strategy Scott Partridge told Reuters in an interview  Betting on a quick approval  Monsanto sold the seeds  and farmers planted a million acres of the genetically modified soybeans in 2016  But the EPA s deliberations on the weed killer dragged on for another 11 months because of concerns about dicamba s historical drift problems  That delay left farmers who bought the seeds with no matching herbicide and three bad alternatives  Hire workers to pull weeds  use the less effective herbicide glyphosate  or illegally spray an older version of dicamba at the risk of damage to nearby farms  The resulting rash of illegal spraying that year damaged 42 000 acres of crops in Missouri  among the hardest hit areas  as well as swaths of crops in nine other states  according to an August 2016 advisory from the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  The damage this year has covered 3 6 million acres in 25 states  according to Kevin Bradley  a University of Missouri weed scientist who has tracked dicamba damage reports and produced estimates cited by the EPA   For a graphic on a timeline of the Monsanto crisis click   The episode highlights a hole in a U S regulatory system that has separate agencies approving genetically modified seeds and their matching herbicides  Monsanto has blamed farmers for the illegal spraying and argued it could not have foreseen that the disjointed approval process would set off a crop damage crisis  But a Reuters review of regulatory records and interviews with crop scientists shows that Monsanto was repeatedly warned by crop scientists  starting as far back as 2011  of the dangers of releasing a dicamba resistant seed without an accompanying herbicide designed to reduce drift to nearby farms  In 2015  just before Monsanto released its soybeans seeds  Arkansas regulators notified the firm of damage from illegal spraying of its dicamba resistant cotton seeds  Some cotton farmers chose to illegally spray old versions of dicamba because other herbicides approved for use on the seeds were far less effective  The EPA did not approve the new dicamba formulation that Monsanto now sells for use with cotton and soybean seeds   XtendiMax with Vapor Grip   until after the 2016 growing season  Monsanto s Partridge acknowledged that the company misjudged the regulatory timeline for approval of its new herbicide   The EPA process was lengthier than usual   Partridge said  Monsanto  however  denies culpability for the crisis that followed the two stage approval   The illegal misuse of old dicamba herbicides with Xtend seeds was not foreseeable   the company s attorneys said in a response to one class action suit filed by farmers in Missouri   Even if it were foreseeable that farmers would illegally apply old dicamba to their Xtend crops  which it was not  Monsanto is not liable for harms caused by other manufacturers  products   Monsanto s Partridge said in a written statement that the reports of damage from illegal spraying of dicamba on its cotton seeds in 2015 were  extremely isolated    Those who applied dicamba illegally should be held responsible   Partridge said  Monsanto s handling of the delayed herbicide approval may cause the firm legal and public relations damage  but it has boosted the company s business considerably  Instead of halting seed sales while waiting on herbicide approval  Monsanto captured a quarter of the nation s massive soybean market by the start of 2017  according to the U S  Department of Agriculture  Even the damage from dicamba may have boosted sales  Some farmers whose crops were harmed said in interviews that they bought Monsanto s new dicamba resistant seeds as a defense against drift from nearby spraying  State regulators believe the illegal spraying of dicamba tolerant cotton and soybean crops continued in 2017   after the EPA approved Monsanto s new herbicide  Farmers would still benefit from using old versions of dicamba because it is cheaper than XtendiMax  Many growers also have dicamba on hand because it is legal to use for limited purposes  Regulators have not yet determined  however  how much damage came from illegal spraying and how much came from the legal application of XtendiMax  which weed scientists say still vaporizes under certain conditions   Monsanto concedes that XtendiMax has caused crop damage  but blames farmers who the company says did not properly follow directions for applying the herbicide  The EPA  after delaying a decision on XtendiMax  gave the herbicide a limited two year approval   as opposed to the standard 20 years   in case drift issues arose  A U S  Department of Agriculture spokesman  Rick Corker  acknowledged in a statement to Reuters that the release of an engineered seed before its companion herbicide caused problems  The department  he said  is now in talks with the EPA about whether to coordinate approvals of paired seeds and chemicals   USDA and EPA are in discussions regarding the timing of our deregulations   Corker said in a statement  The EPA did not comment on whether it planned any policy changes in response to the dicamba crisis  EARLY WARNINGS Dicamba is cheap  plentiful  and has been used as a weed killer for decades  But its tendency to damage nearby fields had caused U S  regulators to limit its use to the task of clearing fields before planting or after harvest  when there are no crops to damage and cooler temperatures make it less likely the substance will migrate  Farmers who illegally sprayed dicamba during growing season are now facing fines of up to  1 000 for each violation of EPA rules limiting the use of dicamba  which are enforced by state regulators   Farmers with damaged crops have filed at least seven lawsuits   five class action suits and two by individuals   seeking compensation from Monsanto  The suits claim the company should have known that releasing the seeds without a paired herbicide would cause problems   Monsanto officials had been repeatedly warned of the potential for damage from illegal spraying of dicamba on seeds designed to resist the chemical  In October 2011  five scientists from Ohio State University addressed a conference in Columbus focused on the future of dicamba  In attendance were agriculture researchers from across the country as well as representatives of the companies Monsanto   Dow Chemical   NYSE DOW  and BASF  According to Douglas Doohan  one of the conference s organizers  three Monsanto employees  including Industry Affairs Director Douglas Rushing  attended the meeting  Monsanto had a keen interest in the topic because the company was far along in developing its new line of dicamba products at the time  In their introduction to the symposium  Doohan and his colleagues outlined what they called an increased risk of illegal dicamba spraying by farmers once dicamba resistant seeds became available  They also argued that dicamba resistant seeds   and the illegal spraying that might accompany them   would lead farmers whose crops were damaged to buy their own dicamba tolerant seeds to protect themselves from further drift  according to conference records  Monsanto s Rushing gave his own presentation about dicamba to the symposium  according to conference records  Rushing explained the need for a new herbicide and seed combination to replace those that had grown less effective as weeds become more tolerant to certain chemicals  according to slides outlining Rushing s conference presentation  He raised the issue of damage from dicamba drift  but said the risks could be reduced by using certain kinds of sprayers and taking other precautions   Rushing could not be reached for comment  Monsanto did not directly respond to questions about the symposium  DAMAGE REPORTS Years later  some of what the scientists outlined in their presentations was becoming reality  Monsanto released its dicamba resistant cotton seed in the summer of 2015  The seed was compatible with two other legally available herbicides  giving farmers options for dealing with weeds before the EPA s approval of XtendiMax  But farmers started digging into their dicamba stockpiles anyway  and damage reports started to trickle in  Monsanto officials were among the first to see those reports  according to minutes of an Arkansas Plant Board committee meeting in July 2015  Jammy Turner  a Monsanto salesman  was on the Arkansas Plant Board  the agricultural regulator that investigated the complaints  He and Duane Simpson  a Monsanto lobbyist  attended the committee meeting  There  the board s Pesticide Division Director Susie Nichols gave a report about drift damage complaints linked to the new seed technology  At that meeting  lobbyist Simpson was asked by the board what Monsanto was doing about drift damage complaints  according to the minutes  Simpson told the committee that the firm had been telling farmers not to spray dicamba illegally  even over crops specifically designed to withstand it  He said the company would consider pulling whatever licenses Monsanto had given to offending farmers to use its technology  At an Aug  8  2016 meeting of the same committee  Simpson was asked again how Monsanto was dealing with farmers illegally spraying dicamba on Xtend crops  This time  he responded that Monsanto saw no way to pull farmers  seed licenses over the issue  Monsanto did not comment on Simpson s statements in response to written questions from Reuters  The company said it would consider revoking a particular farmer s license if asked to do so by state regulators  when they have investigated and adjudicated an egregious violation   Larry Steckel  a weed scientist and professor at the University of Tennessee  said those early damage reports should have been a red flag to Monsanto against releasing its soybean seeds the following year   It turned out to be a precursor of what was to come   he said  Neither Turner nor Simpson responded to calls and emails seeking comment  Monsanto did not comment on the company s involvement in the Arkansas investigations  By the end of 2015  the damage reports linked to the Xtend cotton seeds were making the rounds among scientists  Weed scientist Michael Owen  a professor at Iowa State University  said he warned at the ISU Annual Integrated Crop Management Conference on Dec  2 3  2015 that no dicamba formulations had been approved for use on Xtend crops  He told attendees it wasn t clear when the formulas would be greenlighted  and that the situation was cause for concern  Monsanto representatives attended that conference  according to ISU Program Services Coordinator Brent Pringnitz  who handled the registration  He would not identify them  Owen said he also repeated his warning directly to Monsanto officials around the same time  but did not name them  Monsanto did not comment on Owen s assertion that he warned the company about dicamba spraying  FLAWED ASSUMPTIONS Farmers who spoke to Reuters and others who gave testimony recorded in state records described a variety of reasons why they purchased Xtend seeds before XtendiMax was available  One farmer in Arkansas  Doug Masters  planted Xtend cotton in 2015 and was caught illegally spraying dicamba  according to Arkansas Plant Board records  He said the Monsanto salesman who sold him the Xtend seeds told him that  by the time the plants came up in the summer of 2015  it would be legal to spray dicamba and he should go ahead and do it  according to the board records  Masters declined to identify the Monsanto salesman to Arkansas regulators  records show  He declined again  when reached by Reuters  to identify the representative  Masters admitted that he illegally sprayed dicamba  and the Plant Board fined him  4 000  assessing the maximum penalty allowed for four violations  Monsanto did not comment on Masters  testimony to the plant board  Ritchard Zolman  another Arkansas farmer caught illegally spraying his cotton in 2015  said in a disciplinary hearing held by the Arkansas Plant Board that he d planted Xtend seeds because he thought he could spray dicamba legally over his fields 14 days before his crops came up from the ground  according to records  But the Plant Board ruled it was illegal to spray dicamba onto a field where planted crops had not yet sprouted  disciplinary records show  Zolman was fined  3 000 for three dicamba spraying violations  records show   Zolman declined to comment  In Missouri  Gary Dalton Murphy III said he and his family planted Xtend soybeans in 2016 after  hearing  that dicamba would be legal to spray by the summer  He did not say who told him dicamba would be legal that season  When Murphy learned XtendiMax would not be available  the family got rid of their weeds by hand  hiring extra workers to help

States  low flying planes have been spraying naled  a tightly controlled pesticide often used as a last resort  It appears to be working  killing at least 90 percent of the target mosquitoes  Across the Biscayne Bay in Miami Beach  wind and high rise buildings make aerial spraying challenging  So  the effort in the popular tourist destination has focused on ground sprayed pyrethroids   pesticides that are safer but don t always work  The arrival in Florida of Zika  a virus that can cause a crippling birth defect known as microcephaly  has drawn into focus the limitations of the U S  mosquito control arsenal  Larvicides reduce future populations relatively safely  But for use against the mature mosquitoes that spread disease  only two classes of pesticides are approved  Each has drawbacks  Organophosphates  such as naled  are effective  But there are strict controls to limit risk  Pyrethroids are safer but have been used so much that mosquitoes  in many places  are immune   That s really the weak link in much of the United States   said Michael Doyle  director of the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District   We re kind of caught off guard   DENGUE PREVIEW Doyle led a 2009 effort against a dengue outbreak in South Florida  the first in the United States in nearly a century  Authorities threw everything they had at the Aedes aegypti  the same mosquito that carries Zika  backpack fogging  door to door yard inspections looking for watery breeding sites and larvicide spraying  Still  88 people were infected before the virus was brought under control more than two years later  and there continue to be sporadic cases in Florida  The outbreak highlighted gaps in the mosquito control arsenal that remain  according to pesticide makers  abatement officials and entomologists  Few companies make pesticides for use in public health outbreaks  a niche market that is expensive to get into  has a limited upside and varies season to season  Safety testing a new pesticide can cost up to  250 million and take 10 years  said Karen Larson  vice president of regulatory affairs at privately held Clarke Mosquito  As long as a product remains on the market  companies must continue testing for unforeseen side effects  an expense that some makers have blamed for decisions to abandon products   There s not a lot of profit   Larson said  Sales of the Dibrome

maker American Vanguard Corp  The U S  Environmental Protection Agency has approved several new pesticides in recent years  But it has received few requests for using them against mosquitoes  said Jim Jones  Assistant Administrator for the agency s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention   Although it s of critical importance  the amount one can sell is small and it s variable  which makes it difficult for business planning   Jones said   You can go many years without having much of a market at all  then suddenly  whether it s because of a nuisance outbreak of mosquitoes or something like West Nile or Zika  the market grows significantly   Abatement authorities have pressed for help with the cost of developing mosquito control pesticides  The 1996 U S  Food Quality Protection Act includes a provision for subsidies to defray the expense of safety testing  but Congress has never funded it  RISK AND RESISTANCE At least 49 cases of locally transmitted Zika infections have been reported in Florida  most in Wynwood and Miami Beach  Most people have no symptoms or mild illness  Because of the microcephaly link  efforts are focused on preventing infection among pregnant women  In Wynwood  the campaign began with pyrethroids  synthetic versions of a chemical derived from chrysanthemums  Amid signs of resistance  authorities switched to naled  Developed as nerve agents  organophosphates  at high doses  can cause nausea  convulsions and death  They can be toxic to wildlife  including bees  The EPA considers naled safe at permitted ultra low concentrations  and it is sprayed annually over 16 million acres in the United States  But it is banned in Europe  where the risk is seen as unacceptable  In the U S  territory of Puerto Rico  where Zika is widespread  the governor prohibited naled amid protests over safety concerns  Although naled killed more than 90 percent of mosquitoes in traps set in Wynwood  the Aedes aegypti s resilience remains a concern   This is truly the cockroach of mosquitoes   said Tom Frieden  director of the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  DROPPING PESTICIDES CDC entomologist Janet McAllister said pyrethroid resistance typically is limited by the mosquito s small range  When resistance to one pyrethroid develops  another often works  Still  she said   we would love to see additional classes of insecticides available because  even in places that may have an effective tool today  that doesn t mean it is going to last down the road   The EPA can fast track its evaluation of new pesticides and expand the use of old ones  In response to Zika  it expedited new uses for pesticide treated bed nets and mosquito traps  Still  development of pesticides is painstaking  Even if the EPA speeds up its evaluation  required safety data can take years to collect  And the expense of ongoing safety testing has prompted companies to drop products  Bayer CropScience  for example  told distributors it dropped the pyrethroid resmethrin in 2012  rather than do additional testing  Clarke Mosquito gave up temephos  a larvicide  six years ago  because of costs  Larson said  That decision led to stockpiling in southwest Florida  said Wayne Gale  director of the Lee County Mosquito Control District

200887,422403,DOW,Obama praises Argentina s  man in a hurry  Macri for reforms,news,By Jeff Mason and Richard Lough BUENOS AIRES  Reuters    U S  President Barack Obama on Wednesday championed Argentina s new center right leader Mauricio Macri as an example for other countries in Latin America  praising the fast pace of reforms to strengthen the economy  Obama  on a two day visit to Argentina that marks a detente after years of tensions  said Argentina under Macri was poised to play a more influential role on the global stage   In his first 100 days in office  Macri has distanced himself from South America s leftist bloc  old allies of former President Cristina Fernandez  and sought a thaw in relations with Western capitals as he seeks new investment in Latin America s No  3 economy   I can tell you President Macri is a man in hurry   Obama told a joint news conference after the two leaders held talks   I m impressed because he has moved rapidly on so many of the reforms that he promised  to create more sustainable and inclusive economic growth  to reconnect Argentina with the global economy and the world community   he said  Macri offers Obama a new ally in South America  a region where a strong leftist bloc turned its back on Washington over the past decade but where public opinion is now shifting toward the political center as governments grapple with graft scandals and an economic slowdown   Argentina is re assuming its traditional leadership role in the region and around the world   Obama said   His trip to Argentina to forge a new friendship follows a historic visit to former Cold War foe Cuba that aimed to boost U S  credibility across Latin America  For years  much of the region took a dim view of Washington s longstanding policy of trying to force change on Communist ruled Cuba by isolating it  a strategy that Obama has cast aside  Macri said Obama s visit marked the start of new  mature  relations in which the countries would cooperate on issues ranging from trade to fighting international drug trafficking  Macri has lifted capital and trade controls  slashed bloated power subsidies and cut a debt deal with  holdout  creditors in the United States  But he still has to grapple with double digit inflation  a yawning fiscal deficit and a shortage of hard currency  and has made securing new foreign investment flows a priority  NEW INVESTMENT The American Chamber of Commerce in Argentina said U S  firms would invest  2 3 billion in Argentina over the next 18 months  including more than  100 million each from General Motors Co  NYSE GM    Dow Chemical   NYSE DOW  Co  AES Corp and Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co  Argentine Finance Minister Alfonso Prat Gay urged business leaders  at a forum where the new investment flows were announced  to think long term and said policies aimed at cutting inflation and reinvigorating growth would be felt in the second half of the year   We ve cleaned out the rubbish   Prat Gay said in reference to Fernandez s protectionist policies that stunted investment   Now we re entering the starting gates   Obama said the two governments would work to identify barriers impeding greater trade flows between the two economies  adding that a free trade agreement was something that might lie at the end of the process   Right now there s a lot of underbrush  a lot of unnecessary trade irritants and commercial irritants that can be cleared away administratively and that s some of the work that we intend to do right away   Obama said  Foreign companies operating in Argentina routinely complain about costly customs requirements  cumbersome red tape and strong workers  rights  Obama said Argentina could be an effective partner in the fight against drug trafficking and organized crime and said both countries would work together in response to the Zika virus that has spread across parts of South America at lightning speed  The two countries announced an agreement on joint steps to fight climate change including working to cut carbon emissions from air flights and integrating solar and wind power into electricity grids  Crowds have cheered Obama s motorcade as it travels along Buenos Aires  tree lined boulevards  handing the U S  leader a friendlier reception than his predecessor George W  Bush  whose presence at a Summit of the Americas in 2005 was met with protests and snubbed by then President Nestor Kirchner  But left wing political parties have promised protests on Thursday  which coincides with the 40th anniversary of the coup on March 24  1976  that installed right wing military rule  In an era when Cold War thinking often put Washington behind right wing governments in the region  the United States initially backed the 1976 1983 dictatorship  during which as many as 30 000 people were killed   Obama said he would visit a memorial to victims of the  Dirty War  to pay tribute to the Argentines who stood up against human rights violations  and re affirmed that his administration would declassify U S  military and intelligence records related to the junta   I hope this gesture also helps to rebuild trust that may have been lost between our two countries

200888,422404,DOW,Supreme Court hands win to unions  splits 4 4 without Scalia,news,"By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON  Reuters    Public sector unions triumphed before the U S  Supreme Court on Tuesday when the justices preserved a vital source of cash for organized labor  splitting 4 4 on a conservative challenge that had seemed destined for success until Justice Antonin Scalia s death last month  The case brought by non union public school teachers in California had targeted fees that many states force such workers to pay unions in lieu of dues to fund collective bargaining and other activities  A loss in this case would have deprived unions representing teachers  police  transit workers  firefighters and other government employees of millions of dollars annually and diminished their political clout  The outcome illustrated the impact on the court of the Feb  13 death of Scalia  the long serving conservative justice who almost certainly would have cast a decisive vote against the unions  But by virtue of splitting 4 4  the justices affirmed a 2014 lower court ruling that allowed California to compel non union workers to pay the fees    The death of Justice Scalia has proved a disaster for public sector workers who have their paychecks raided by unions   said Iain Murray  vice president for strategy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute  a conservative think tank in Washington   The court  evenly divided with four liberals and four conservatives  left intact a 1977 legal precedent that allowed such fees  which conservatives have long abhorred  Conservatives for years have tried to curb the influence of public sector unions  which typically back the Democratic Party and liberal causes   The U S  Supreme Court today rejected a political ploy to silence public employees like teachers  school bus drivers  cafeteria workers  higher education faculty and other educators to work together to shape their profession   said Lily Eskelsen Garcia  president of the National Education Association teachers union  The case reached the high court after a Washington based conservative group  the Center for Individual Rights  sued on behalf of lead plaintiff Rebecca Friedrichs  an elementary school teacher in Anaheim  and nine other teachers  They argued the fees infringed upon the free speech rights of non union workers under the U S  Constitution   A DISASTER  During Jan  11 oral arguments in the case  Scalia was still on the bench  giving the court a majority of five conservatives  The conservative justices during the arguments voiced support for the non union teachers  It is the second case in which the court has split 4 4 since Scalia died  with more likely in the coming months  perhaps including major cases on abortion  voting rights and contraception insurance coverage  It remains unclear when Scalia will be replaced  Senate Republicans have vowed to block confirmation of President Barack Obama s nominee to replace Scalia  centrist appellate judge Merrick Garland  Republicans fear Garland s confirmation would tilt the court to the left for the first time in decades  At issue in the case decided on Tuesday were so called agency fees equivalent to union dues  currently mandatory for non union workers under laws in about half the states including California  The decision means the status quo remains  with the unions able to collect fees from non union workers  California s non union teachers pay the union  which has 325 000 members  around  600 annually in mandatory fees for collective bargaining  The non union teachers  lawyers said they plan to ask the court to rehear case   With the death of Justice Scalia  this outcome was not unexpected   said Terry Pell  president of the Center for Individual Rights  The split decision means there is  ongoing doubt about the constitutionality of its forcible collection of millions of dollars in dues   Pell added  About 5 million public sector employees are subject to union contracts that include mandatory fee provisions  according to the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation  which backed the non union teachers  Organized labor had expressed worries that a ruling throwing out the fees would give employees less incentive to join public sector unions because they would get all the benefits of collective bargaining undertaken by unions without having to pay for it  The teachers who filed the lawsuit in 2013 asked the justices to overturn the 1977 Abood v  Detroit Board of Education Supreme Court ruling that allowed laws that permitted public sector unions to collect fees from workers who were not members as long as the money was not spent on political activities  Agency fees are already banned in 25 states that have so called right to work laws  In those states  unions still represent workers but membership rates are lower  Federal employee unions also cannot collect such fees  The ruling comes as a relief to organized labor because unionized civil servants in states without right to work laws comprise its main power base

shareholders  Dow says the CEO did nothing wrong and that there have been no problems since with his expenses  Among the events Wood examined were Super Bowl weekends the CEO held with  family and friends  in 2008  2009 and 2010  For several years  Dow hosted top customers and executives at the National Football League s championship game  TWO GROUPS In some years  details in the report indicate  Liveris sought to avoid mingling with Dow customers  inside or away from the stadium  The report says that   since at least 2008  the Super Bowl programs have been split into two hotels  one for ANL s guests and one for the other Dow group   ANL are the initials for Andrew N  Liveris  Wood cites email exchanges between Liveris and Long  the customer events manager  ahead of the 2010 game between the New Orleans Saints and Indianapolis Colts in Miami  At one point  the report says  Long emailed Liveris to say that the CEO and his guests would be staying at the Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables  Florida  Customers and other Dow personnel would be at another hotel  According to the report  Liveris responded   Ok  Make sure they don t know I am there   Long left Dow in 2011  He did not respond to requests for comment  Dow spokeswoman Rebecca Bentley didn t dispute the emails between Liveris and Long  But she said Liveris never sought to duck clients   With respect to the Super Bowls  and many other events   Mr  Liveris met with Dow customers and other senior business people   she said  The Liveris Super Bowl party had 14 members in 2010  A preliminary invoice for the group s four day trip came to  218 938   Andrew and his friends and relatives incurred 11 14 of  that cost  the report says  It isn t clear who the other three attendees were  The report lists the 14 people  but OSHA redacted all names except the CEO s  The CEO s party received 14 Super Bowl tickets at a cost of  8 150 apiece  the report says  Liveris planned to fly his wife and several  personal  guests to Florida on Dow s jet  the CEO wrote to Long  The group had six SUVs with drivers at their disposal  the report says  Other expenses included football jerseys signed by players  Given the time demands placed on Liveris in running a global company  Bentley said  his  business and personal times often intersect  It is not uncommon for family members to attend events when the business purpose warrants it  especially if clients or business partners attending also have family members in attendance   Long handled other high end purchases  too  Among them  Penfolds Grange  a top shelf wine from Australia  where Liveris was born  In 2010  Long  based in New Jersey  bought approximately  90 000 worth of Grange on a Dow credit card  the report says  some that cost  in excess of  460 per bottle   Three cases were shipped to Dow in Midland  Michigan  on a corporate jet  the report says  One went to Liveris s house  and two to a Dow owned hotel  In previous years  the report says  Liveris sent bottles of Grange as a gift  Most of these went to business associates   It is not unusual for companies to give gifts to senior executives at core clients   said Bentley  
In December 2009  Liveris had three bottles of Grange sent to a teacher at Cranbrook  a private high school near Detroit attended by his younger son  The accompanying note  Liveris directed  should thank the teacher  for being such a great mentor and friend  to his son  and all of the Liveris family    Edited by Blake Morrison ",2015-09-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-super-bowls-and-fine-wines---document-describes-world-of-dow-ceo-362859,362859
201015,422531,DOW,U S  inflation muted in September as energy costs drop,news,"By Lucia Mutikani  WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  consumer prices rose marginally in September  painting a weak inflation picture that should give the Federal Reserve ample room to keep interest rates low for a while   The Labor Department said on Wednesday its Consumer Price Index edged up 0 1 percent last month as a rise in food and shelter costs offset a decline in energy prices    The ongoing inflation weakness will give the Fed leeway to take a restrained approach to tightening monetary conditions   said Robert Hughes  senior research fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research in Great Barrington  Massachusetts   The CPI had dropped 0 2 percent in August and economists had expected a flat reading in September  In the 12 months through September  the CPI rose 1 7 percent after a similar gain in August  The Fed targets 2 percent inflation and tracks an index that is running even lower than the CPI   Inflation has waned in recent months after quickening in the second quarter  with a stronger dollar and slower economic growth in China and the euro zone dampening import prices  Sluggish wage growth has also helped keep a lid on prices   The soft inflation backdrop and a recent global equities market sell off has led investors to push back their expectations for when the U S  central bank will raise interest rates from near zero to late next year  Just a few weeks ago  they had looked for a rate hike in July   Fed officials meet next week and their statement at the end of the two day meeting will be watched for changes in their assessment of the inflation environment   Economists had expected consumer prices to hold steady last month  and U S  Treasury debt prices slipped after the data was released  while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies  U S  stocks were trading higher  boosted by strong earnings from Yahoo Inc  O YHOO   Broadcom  O BRCM  and Dow Chemical  N DOW    BENIGN PRICE PRESSURES  The report showed underlying inflation pressures were also muted  despite increases in shelter and medical care costs   The so called core CPI  which strips out food and energy prices  ticked up 0 1 percent last month  while the year on year change held steady at 1 7 percent   Energy prices fell for a third straight month in September  with gasoline costs slipping 1 0 percent after dropping 4 1 percent in August   While declining gasoline prices frees up income for other spending  tepid wage growth is blunting the impact  Average hourly earnings adjusted for inflation fell 0 2 percent in September and were up just 0 3 percent over the past year    It is hard to have strong economic growth when spending power is largely flat   said Joel Naroff  chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland  Pennsylvania   Food prices gained 0 3 percent in September and were up 3 0 percent from a year ago  the largest gain in nearly 2 1 2 years   Within the core CPI  shelter costs increased 0 3 percent in September after rising 0 2 percent in August  The shelter index was up 3 0 percent in the 12 months through September  the largest increase since January 2008  Excluding shelter  the core CPI increased only 0 9 percent from a year ago   The medical care index increased 0 2 percent  with prices for nonprescription drugs posting a record increase

Asked about Dow s strategy in Kuwait  Chief Executive Andrew Liveris  speaking on the sidelines of a conference in Dubai  said his company was  moving from doing commodities just for commodities sake  moving more downstream and Kuwait is more about commodities

201017,422533,DOW,Bhopal s toxic legacy lives on  30 years after industrial disaster,news,"By Danish Siddiqui and Nita Bhalla  BHOPAL NEW DELHI  Thomson Reuters Foundation    Beyond the iron gates of the derelict pesticide plant where one of the world s worst industrial disasters occurred  administrative buildings lie in ruins  vegetation overgrown and warehouses bolted   Massive vessels  interconnected by a multitude of corroded pipes that once carried chemical slurries  have rusted beyond repair  In the dusty control room  a soiled sticker on a wall panel reads  Safety is everyone s business    On the night of Dec  2  1984  the factory owned by the U S  multinational Union Carbide Corp accidentally leaked cyanide gas into the air  killing thousands of largely poor Indians in the central city of Bhopal   Thirty years later  the toxic legacy of this factory lives on  say human rights groups  as thousands of tonnes of hazardous waste remains buried underground  slowly poisoning the drinking water of more than 50 000 people and affecting their health   Activists want this waste removed and disposed of away from the area  and feel Indian authorities  who now own the site  have fumbled on taking action   either by clearing up the waste itself or in pursuing Union Carbide to take responsibility    There is a very high prevalence of anemia  delayed menarches in girls and painful skin conditions  But what is most pronounced is the number of children with birth defects   said activist Satinath Sarangi from the Bhopal Medical Appeal which runs a clinic for gas victims    Children are born with conditions such as twisted limbs  brain damage  musculoskeletal disorders     this is what we see in every fourth or fifth household in these communities    Sarangi admits there has been no long term epidemiological research which conclusively proves that birth defects are directly related to the drinking of the contaminated water   TOXIC WATER  Built in 1969  the Union Carbide plant in Madhya Pradesh state was seen as a symbol of a new industrialized India  generating thousands of jobs for the poor and  at the same time  manufacturing cheap pesticides for millions of farmers   Fifteen years later  40 tonnes of Methyl Isocyanate gas was released and carried by the wind to the surrounding densely populated disaster remains unclear and under debate   The government recorded 5 295 deaths  but activists claim 25 000 people died in the aftermath and following years   Another 100 000 people who were exposed to the gas continue to suffer today with sicknesses such as cancer  blindness  respiratory problems  immune and neurological disorders  Some children born to survivors have mental or physical disabilities   While those directly affected receive free medical health care  activists say authorities have failed to support those sick from drinking the contaminated water and a second generation of children born with birth defects   In a rehabilitation center run by the charity Chingari Trust  located 500 meters from the factory site  disabled children aged between 6 months and 12 years gather for treatment which ranges from speech and hearing issues to physiotherapy    Our life changed emotionally and physically since we got to know about his medical problem when was just 4 months old   said 26 year old Sufia  sitting on a mat on the floor  cradling her two year old son Mustafa who has cerebral palsy    We had to stop the therapy when he was 8 months old as it was very expensive  My husband is an electrician and doesn t earn much  With the center it is good as it s free  It s also good to meet other mothers with their children and realize that I am not alone    CALL FOR CLEAN UP  The government was forced to recognize the water was contaminated in 2012 when the Supreme Court ordered that clean drinking water be supplied to some 22 communities living around the factory site    I don t think there is any doubt now that the waste dumped by Union Carbide is a serious problem and that it needs to be dealt with urgently   said Sunita Narain  director of the Delhi based think tank Center for Science and Environment   Studies by Narain s organization in 2009 found samples taken from around the factory site contained chlorinated benzene compounds and organochlorine pesticides 561 times the national standard   The profile of the chemicals found in samples from within the site matched the chemicals in drinking water in the outside colonies  said the report  leaving no doubt that there could be no other source of these toxins than Union Carbide   Studies since have confirmed water pollution  but the hazardous waste remains in pits in some 21 locations within the 68 acre site and buried in a wasteland outside  largely due to wrangles between authorities and activists on its disposal   The United Nations this week welcomed a government decision to reconsider the official figure of people affected by the gas leak  and look into additional compensation  but pressed authorities to get rid of the toxic waste    New victims of the Bhopal disaster are born every day  and suffer life long from adverse health impacts   said Baskut Tuncak  U N  Special Rapporteur on human rights and toxic waste    Without cleaning the contamination  the number of victims of the toxic legacy left by Union Carbide will continue to grow  and  together  India s financial liability to a rising number of victims   he added in a statement   Activists want Union Carbide  which was taken over by Dow Chemical Company  N DOW  in 2001  to take the waste out of the country  saying there are no adequate facilities in India to deal with it  They have also criticized state authorities for not pursuing the corporation for the clean up  State government officials were not immediately available for comment   Seventeen people living around the plant have filed a petition in the U S  courts to get the multinational to bear the cost of the clean up   Dow Chemical Co  has long denied responsibility  saying Union Carbide spent  2 million on remediating the site  adding that Indian authorities at the time approved  monitored and directed every step of the clean up work   Union Carbide was sued by the Indian government after the disaster and agreed to pay an out of court settlement of  470 million in damages in 1989  The company says the Indian government then took control of the site in 1998  assuming all accountability  including clean up activities   
 While Union Carbide continues to have the utmost respect and sympathy for the victims  we find that many of the issues being discussed today have already been resolved and responsibilities assigned for those that remain   Tomm F  Sprick  Director of Union Carbide Information Center  told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email     Writing by Nita Bhalla  Editing by Belinda Goldsmith ",2014-11-28,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bhopal's-toxic-legacy-lives-on,-30-years-after-industrial-disaster-318373",318373

201053,422569,DOW,RPT GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD Bernanke  does a Trichet ,news,"  Focus on Fed and Bernanke press conference
   U S  Treasury notes auctioned post S P outlook
   Earnings reports include European big banks
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt  European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON  April 21  Reuters    Investors have a treat in store
in the coming week when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
 does a Trichet  and holds a press conference for the first time
following the bank s rate setting meeting 
 It will be the highlight of a week    shortened by holidays
in many places    that also includes the first major auctions of
U S  Treasuries since rating agency Standard   Poor s fired a
warning shot at Washington over the budget deficit 
 The three events    rate meeting  press conference and
auctions    all speak directly to one of the main issues hanging
over financial markets  which have entered a period of almost
daily swings into riskier assets and then out again 
 When is the Fed going to pull the plug on the extaordinary
loose monetary policy that has pumped up assets across the
board 
 Bernanke s press conference on Wednesday     the first ever
regularly scheduled briefing by a Fed chief in the U S  central
bank s 97 year history    is an attempt by the Fed to
communicate clearly what is on its mind 
  Everyone is going to be looking at it   said Marc Ostwald 
strategist at Monument Securities 
 European Central Bank President Jean Claude Trichet has had
success communicating his bank s views via a post meeting press
conference  with emphasis on so called watchwords like  strong
vigilance  being used to gauge sentiment 
 Ostwald says investors will now be on alert for Bernanke
watchwords such as  extended period   to judge how long loose
monetary policy will run 
 The issue is crucial for investors of all stripes  World
equities  for example  hit a near 33 month high on Thursday
based in no small part on the availablity of cash engendered by
the Fed and others 
 The Bank of Japan  meanwhile  meets on Thursday with
monetary policy and the damage from Japan s triple disasters
still at issue 
 Economists at the Organisation for Economic Co operation and
Development cut Japan s growth forecast to 0 8 percent from 1 7
percent because of the earthquake  tsunami and nuclear crisis 
 
 TREASURY TEST
 Investor focus is also likely to be on a series of U S 
T note auctions    two year  five year and seven year on
Tuesday  Wednesday and Thursday  respectively 
 Such events usually go without a hitch and probably will
again  But they do come following S P s change of its outlook
for U S  government bonds to negative based on the country s
massive debt and deficit 
 While investors do not generally believe that S P s move
will have any tangible effect  it has reminded them of the
argument that Washington s fiscal path is unsustainable 
 PIMCO  the world s largest bond fund  is already eschewing
U S  government debt  while leading investor Jim Rogers says
Treasuries are a bubble 
  At some point along the line  people are going to realise
it s absurd to lend money to the United States government for 30
years in U S  dollars at 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 percent interest   he
told Reuters Insider   The market is just going to give up  
 He said the trigger could be when the Fed ends its
asset buying quantative easing programme  scheduled for June 
 That said  a lot of the demand for shorter term U S  debt
such as that being auctioned in the next week does not come from
the mainstream investment community  but from governments and
government entities 
 Monument Securities reckons only 28 percent of shorter term
U S  government debt is in free float  meaning that its low
yields may be more a reflection of lack of supply than any
endorsement of U S  economic sustainability 
 If this is the case  good auctions would not necessarily
imply broad investor approval of the U S  fiscal performance 
 
 EARNING RESPECT
 The coming week will also bring more reports in what has
generally been a good corporate earnings season 
 Of the 100 S P 500 companies that have reported
first quarter earnings so far  78 percent have either beaten or
met market expectations  data from Thomson Reuters StarMine
shows 
 In Europe  which started later  only 25 companies among the
those reporting for Q1 in the STOXX 600 have been heard from 
But 60 percent of them are above forecast 
 The week ahead brings the likes of Boeing  eBay 
Caterpillar  Microsoft and Dow Chemical
 With no sign of the euro zone debt crisis abating  European
earnings include some of the region s biggest banks  notably
Barclays  Santander  Deutsche Bank DBKGn DE  UBS and Creit
Suisse

 By Ryan Vlastelica
 NEW YORK  Sept 28  Reuters    U S  stocks surged on Monday 
as several merger deals bolstered investor confidence following
three straight days of losses 
 An increase in mergers and acquisitions is typically viewed
as bullish  as it suggests companies are more optimistic about
the economy and see values in the market 
  This is a very good sign   said Peter Kenny  managing
director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City  New Jersey 
 This is a very clear indicator that growth is anticipated in
the market  
 A number of companies announced large deals  Xerox agreed
to buy Affiliated Computer Services Inc for  6 4 billion  while
Abbott Laboratories said it would pay  6 6 billion for Solvay s
drug unit 
 Abbott shares climbed 3 percent to  48 75 while Affiliated
Computer s stock advanced 12 2 percent to  53 00  In contrast 
shares of Xerox sank 18 percent to  7 36 
 With Monday s gains  the Dow Jones industrial average is up
about 16 percent in the quarter so far  which would make it the
index s best such period since the fourth quarter of 1998 
 The Xerox deal comes a week after another large buyout in
the tech sector  when Dell agreed to buy Perot Systems for
about  3 9 billion 
  The tech sector is going to be one of the first
beneficiaries of an economic rebound   Kenny said   The fact
that these deals are in the tech sector is a further piece of
the recovery puzzle  
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 137 78 points  or
1 43 percent  to 9 802 97  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
rose 18 03 points  or 1 73 percent  to 1 062 41  The Nasdaq
Composite Index climbed 45 21 points  or 2 16 percent  to
2 136 13 
 The Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur observed on Monday and the
end of the third quarter two days later could translate into
thin volume and volatility as fund managers reposition their
assets amid fewer market participants  investors said 
 Dutch biotech firm Crucell said Johnson   Johnson bought
14 6 million new Crucell shares for over  400 million as part
of a flu vaccine development deal 
 Crucell shares fell 6 1 percent to  22 25 on the Nasdaq 
 But blue chip J J s stock was up 1 3 percent at  61 43 on
the New York Stock Exchange 
 Dow Chemical advanced 3 7 percent to  26 07 after it said
the Federal Trade Commission had cleared the way for its  1 68
billion sale of Morton Salt to Germany s K S AG to go ahead 
 Apple shares gained 2 1 percent to  186 19 on Nasdaq after
China Unicom said it would sell Apple s iPhone in China 
starting in October  France Telecom s Orange also said it would
sell the product later this year 
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago said its National

 NEW YORK  Oct 20  Reuters    Chemical maker DuPont posted a
bigger than expected 11 percent jump in third quarter profit on
Tuesday  but revenue fell short of Wall Street estimates 
 The results from the company  which sells to the
automotive  housing  and agricultural sectors  among many
others  will likely be seen as an indicator of the chemical
industry s health 
 While the strong earnings topped analysts  expectations 
much of the gain came from about  300 million in cost cuts 
 Wall Street typically prefers to see profits generated by
sales rather than cost cuts  but that should not be a black eye
for capital intensive companies like DuPont  Sterne Agee
analyst Mark Connelly said 
  The operating performance here is pretty credible   he
said   When a basic material company demonstrates substantial
cost reductions  it deserves some credit  
 DuPont s earnings came the same day the U S  Commerce
Department reported a smaller than expected increase in
new home construction 
 DuPont s Tyvek insulation  as well as products such as
Corian  Kevlar and Nomex  are very popular in the construction
sector 
 The company s stock slumped 2 7 percent to  33 70 in
afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading  eclipsing the 1 7
percent drop in the Standard   Poor s chemicals index 
 The stock drop seemed to surprise analysts  many of whom
had expected the cost cuts and low raw material expenses to
boost shares 
 STEADY IMPROVEMENT
 Compared with earlier this year  DuPont said it was seeing
demand for products slowly improve 
 With a more streamlined organization  permanent fixed cost
reductions and increased productivity  DuPont is
well positioned to capitalize as markets improve   Chief
Executive Ellen Kullman said in a statement 
 Net income rose to  409 million  or 45 cents per share 
from  367 million  or 40 cents per share  a year earlier 
Analysts on average expected 33 cents per share  according to
Thomson Reuters I B E S 
 Revenue fell 18 percent to  5 96 billion  missing the
analysts  average forecast of  6 14 billion 
 Revenue fell across all five of the Wilmington 
Delaware based company s segments  including its safety and
protection unit 
 Across the globe  revenue also fell  although demand in the
Asia Pacific region rose from earlier this year  the company
said 
 While the low price of glyphosate  a popular herbicide 
hurt crop protection sales in the third quarter  sales for all
of the agricultural unit s products should rise in the fourth
quarter  the company said 
 DuPont narrowed its outlook for the full year and now
expects earnings of  1 95 to  2 05 per share  compared with a
previous estimate of  1 70 to  2 10 
 The company said it would discuss its outlook for 2010 at
an investor day set for Nov  3 in Wilmington

 FRANKFURT  Oct 29  Reuters    German chemicals company BASF
SE reaffirmed it would likely cut its annual dividend for the
first time in 16 years as it repeated on Thursday its full year
earnings would slide significantly 
 After surprisingly strong third quarter figures two weeks
ago  some analysts had speculated that meeting its long term
pledge of maintaining its dividend might come within reach after
all for BASF  which paid 1 95 euros per share on its 2008
results 
 But the world s largest chemicals maker  releasing detailed
third quarter figures on Thursday  said net income had slumped
by two thirds to 237 million euros   349 3 million  on costs
related to the speedier integration of Switzerland s Ciba 
bought earlier this year  below the 401 million expected by
analysts on average in a Reuters poll 
  The third quarter report does not provide additional
positive news for the dividend   said UniCredit analyst Andreas
Heine 
 BASF shares dropped as much as 5 4 percent and traded 1 5
percent lower at 36 46 euros at 0928 GMT  while the DJ Euro
Stoxx European chemicals index advanced 0 3 percent 
 Fourth quarter operating profit before special items would
exceed the year earlier period but would fall short of the third
quarter of 2009  the company also said 
 
 SLOW AND UNEVEN
  After a steep plunge  we are now climbing gradually out of
the trough   said Chief Executive Juergen Hambrecht   The
recovery will be slow and uneven   He reiterated BASF s sales
and earnings would drop significantly in 2009 due to the
economic slowdown 
 On Oct  14 BASF had posted quarterly earnings before
interest and taxes  EBIT  excluding one off items of 1 25
billion euros  surpassing the 1 04 billion analysts had
predicted and lifting its stock to a 14 month high 
 Those results in turn raised hopes BASF might be able to
maintain its payout for 2009    an expectation the chemicals
maker has now dashed 
 Dow Chemical Co and DuPont  BASF s two U S  peers  this
month posted better than expected quarterly earnings combined
with a decline in sales  on job cuts and plant closures 
 Folding Ciba into its operations was progressing faster than
initially planned and would cost 800 million euros this year 
250 million more than previously forecast  BASF added 
 Annual synergies from the tie up from 2012 would rise to 450
million euros  compared with a previous assessment of more than
400 million 
 BASF shares trade at 14 2 times estimated earnings over the
coming 12 months  according to StarMine  which weights estimates
according to analysts  track record  slightly below the multiple
for the chemical industry of 15 8  on uncertainty around whether
BASF can defend its margins

201094,422610,DOW,UPDATE 3 LUKOIL trumps Valero for stake in Total refinery,news,"  Deal gives Russian firm a foothold in northwest Europe
   Expects to pay  725 mln for stake in Dutch complex
   Largest U S  refiner was front runner for stake
 Adds Valero  Dow comments 
 By Melissa Akin and Tom Bergin
 MOSCOW LONDON  June 19  Reuters    Russia s LUKOIL
 will buy a stake in a Dutch refinery from France s
Total   gaining a foothold in northwest Europe and
blocking a bid by the largest U S refiner  Valero   to
enter the region 
 Friday s deal  which expanded the No  2 Russian oil
company s refining presence in western Europe  coincided with a
state visit to the Netherlands by Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev 
 The Kremlin tacitly encourages Russian companies to invest
abroad as a way of increasing its foreign influence 
 The move was blow to Valero s efforts to win a stake in
Europe  where it has said it wished to buy refineries and take
advantage of cross Atlantic trading opportunities with its U S 
fleet of plants 
 Total  which has staked out positions in some of the most
prized oil projects on former Soviet territory  hailed a new
era in its relationship with LUKOIL  which is 20 percent owned
by ConocoPhillips  
  Russian crude oil  for which LUKOIL is one of the major
suppliers  represents one of the main sources of the Vlissingen
refinery   Europe s largest refiner  which retains a 55 percent
stake in the plant  said in a statement 
  More broadly  this type of crude oil represents a
significant portion for the supply of Total s European
refineries  
 In Russia  Total holds a coveted stake in state gas export
monopoly Gazprom s  huge Shtokman gas project in the
Barents Sea  It is a LUKOIL partner in the northern Russian
Kharyaga field and in Azerbaijan s Shah Deniz Caspian Sea gas
field 
 Irene Himona  oil analyst at Exane BNP Paribas  said the
deal was intended to secure cheaper crude for the refinery 
  LUKOIL is in a position to more or less guarantee crude
supplies from Russia  which tend to be cheaper  heavier
crudes   she said   It s supply optimisation  by Total   
 European refiners invest heavily to process more Russian
crude and benefit from its discount to lighter  sweeter North
Sea oil  Russia s Urals crude was trading at around  70 35 per
barrel on Friday  compared with  71 for benchmark Brent
 
 BLOW TO VALERO
 Valero said in May it had agreed to buy the 45 percent
stake in the 153 000 barrels per day Vlissingen refinery from
Dow Chemical Co   although it warned shareholders it was
subject to right of first refusal by Total 
 Valero Chief Executive Bill Klesse had described the
minority stake as an  exceptional entry point  into Europe 
Valero  a powerhouse on the heavily import dependent U S 
market for refined fuels  said it would complement trading in
the Atlantic basin 
  Although we are disappointed with the result  we will
continue to seek opportunities to acquire high quality assets
at attractive prices   Klesse said in a statement on Friday 
 Total said in a statement on Friday that it had exercised
pre emptive rights to buy Dow s stake in the refinery  Total
Raffinaderij Nederland  TRN   and sold it on to LUKOIL 
 A Total spokesman declined to say why the company had
engaged in the transaction 
 Dow Chemical  which has been raising cash through asset
sales to help pay down debt accumulated from its purchase of
Rohm   Haas  said Total s move would not affect the amount it
was paid or the timing of the transaction 
 LUKOIL said it expected to pay around  725 million 
matching the price Valero was expected to pay Dow 
 The Dutch purchase was LUKOIL s first success after years
of failed attempts to acquire downstream assets in northwest
Europe  a key market for the crude extracted from its fields in
the Timan Pechora province in Russia s north 
 It was seen as a potential buyer for Germany s
Wilhelmshaven refinery  eventually bought by ConocoPhillips 
BP s  Coryton  ultimately sold to Petroplus  
and several plants in the Amsterdam Rotterdam Antwerp oil hub 
 LUKOIL has invested heavily in a new Arctic terminal at the
Barents Sea port of Varandei and even built a special fleet of
ice class tankers to carry its crude oil to northern Europe 
 LUKOIL officials have long said they were seeking
downstream assets in strategic locations with strong
distribution networks 
 Last year  LUKOIL bought 49 percent of Italian refiner
ERG s  Isab di Priolo refinery  paying 1 35 billion
euro in a deal allowing it to break into the western European
refining business and expanding its portfolio in the
Mediterranean market

 Dow AgroSciences    which sells crop protection chemicals
such as herbicides and insecticides    booked 2008 sales of  4 5

 By Sven Egenter and Andrew Thompson
 ZURICH  July 24  Reuters    Syngenta  the world s largest
agrochemicals company  cut its 2009 outlook after a 9 percent
drop in first half profit as a weaker  weather affected planting
season hit demand and the stronger dollar weighed 
 Swiss Syngenta  which makes herbicides and insecticides as
well as genetically modified seeds  said on Friday it was now
aiming for earnings per share close to its 2008 level after
previously targeting EPS growth 
 Syngenta shares were down 2 1 percent to 251 Swiss francs by
0839 GMT  making them the biggest loser in an overall slightly
weaker European chemicals sector 
  As we expected  only price hikes were behind the internal
revenue growth which we think is not sustainable   ZKB analyst
Martin Schreiber said in a note 
  We have already considered the old outlook too ambitious
and forecast an EPS drop before exceptionals of 1 percent   said
Schreiber  who has an  underweight  rating on Syngenta 
 Solid results this week from DuPont  a key competitor in
herbicides and seeds  suggested Syngenta would also have
performed well 
 Other agriculture suppliers  like Canadian fertilizer
producer Potash Corp and Germany s K S  have been struggling
with lower sales  as farmers saw prices for their products
falling and had difficulties financing the purchase of seeds and
fertilizers 
 Syngenta chief executive Mike Mack told Reuters unfavourable
weather hit business in the spring but conditions for a good
start to the Southern hemisphere planting season were in place 
 
 ACQUISITIONS
 Syngenta s first half net profit dropped to  1 385 billion 
below a forecast for  1 474 billion in a Reuters poll  as price
increases failed to offset unfavourable currency effects 
 Sales stood at  6 7 billion  a 2 percent increase when
adjusted for currency swings 
  Mack said Syngenta was looking into acquisitions in various
segments but was not currently in talks on any major deals 
Earlier this year  Syngenta said it might bid for Dow Chemical s
 agricultural science unit if it came up for sale 
 Syngenta benefited last year from rising crop prices and
record food costs that spurred farmers to expand planting  but
the global economic downturn has dampened demand 
 Its shares trade at about 13 times forecast 2010 earnings  a
discount to U S  rivals Monsanto and DuPont

 TOKYO  Aug 10  Reuters    Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings  is
in talks to buy smaller rival Mitsubishi Rayon for up to  2 1
billion  the Nikkei business daily reported  in a move that
would help consolidate Japan s overcrowded chemicals sector 
 A spokesman for Mitsubishi Chemical  the country s largest
chemicals firm  said he  wouldn t deny  that Mitsubishi Rayon
was on a list of businesses it was considering for purchase 
but declined to comment further 
 A deal would not likely change Mitsubshi Chemical s global
ranking of No  14 in terms of chemical sales  but it would add
key specialised materials to its product lineup to help it
compete with larger rivals such as BASF 
 Mitsubishi Chemical shares rose 4 7 percent  while shares
in Mitsubishi Rayon  the world s No  1 maker of materials used
for acrylic resin  jumped by a fifth to a one year high in its
most active day of trade in at least 24 years

Nomura analyst Shuichi Nishimura wrote in a note 
  It would be industry consolidation  which we have been
saying is necessary for the Japanese chemicals sector   he
said 
 The deal  if agreed to at the top of the estimated price
range  would be the fifth largest by a Japanese company this
year  Thomson Reuters data showed 
 Global chemicals companies such as global leader BASF are
trying to focus on specialised compounds that command premium
prices  dropping businesses faced with competition from
low cost countries 
 Mitsubishi Chemical has been downsizing its petrochemical
operations  which have been losing out to Middle Eastern and
Chinese rivals  Instead it wants to build up its offering of
value added materials to catch up with BASF  Dow Chemical and
other major players 
  The deal would give them a chance to focus on high end 
high performance resins and distance themselves from fierce
price competition in basic petrochemical products   said
Nobuhito Owaki  analyst at J P Morgan Securities 
  Both of them make LCD panel components  but with little
overlap in actual products  and both firms offer carbon fibre 
which has long term growth potential   he said 
 Carbon fibre  a light weight high tech material known for
its strength and heat resistance  is used in products such as
cars and planes 
 Mitsubishi Chemical has said previously that it plans to
spend more than 250 billion yen on acquisitions 
 The two companies are likely to agree on a deal as early as
this autumn and plan to complete the deal in spring next year 
the Nikkei said 
 TENDER OFFER
 A tender offer is expected to be worth 150 200 billion yen
  1 5 billion  2 1 billion   the paper said  Mitsubishi Rayon
has a market capitalisation of  1 7 billion 
 The combined entity would have annual revenue of  33 9
billion  still less than half that of BASF  which had revenue
of 62 3 billion euros   88 5 billion  in 2008 
 The global chemicals industry has been undergoing
consolidation as major players seek to add specialised
materials to their lineup  including Dow Chemical s more than
 15 billion acquisition of Rohm and Haas 
 Credit Suisse analyst Masami Sawato said in a note that the
acquisition of Mitsubishi Rayon would bring its acrylic
business and polyacrylonitrile based carbon fibre products to
Mitsubishi Chemical 
 Separately  Mitsubishi Rayon agreed with Saudi Basic
Industries Corp  SABIC  to set up a joint venture with an
estimated cost of  1 billion to produce MMA monomers  the Saudi
company announced on Monday 
 Mitsubishi Rayon recently bought unlisted British chemical
firm Lucite for  1 6 billion  Lucite is the world s top maker
of methyl methacrylate  MMA  monomers  used in the production
of acrylic resins needed for products ranging from liquid
crystal displays and car lights to aquarium tanks 
 Mitsubishi Chemical and Mitsubishi Rayon do not have a
capital tie now  but were part of the same company before it
was split in 1950
