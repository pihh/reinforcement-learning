14112,235627,AON,4 Value Picks From The Undervalued P C Insurance Industry,opinion,The Zacks  industry is currently undervalued compared with the Zacks S P 500 composite as well as the Zacks  sector  The price to book  P B  ratio  the best multiple for valuing insurers because of their unpredictable financial results  is 1 4  less than the Zacks S P 500 composite s P B of 4 05 and the sector s P B of 2 69  Such below market positioning hints at room for upside in the coming quarters  Before their valuation increases  it is wise to add some undervalued stocks with growth potential to one s portfolio Driving ForcesUnderwriting results  a P C insurer s profitability measure  are favored by a benign catastrophe environment  During the first half of 2019  preliminary economic loss totaled  73 billion while preliminary insured loss was  20 billion  stemming from 163 catastrophe events across the globe  per reports from Aon  NYSE AON   However  the economic loss and preliminary insured loss were 40  and 45   lower than respective 10 year average  the report stated Also  the hurricane season that typically starts in June and lasts through November during a year gathers strength in August and September  Colorado State University  CSU  estimates  near average Atlantic hurricane season in 2019   There will be 14 named storms  including six hurricanes and two major hurricanes per CSU  In September  Hurricane Dorian made landfall  battering the Bahamas  Frequent occurrences of natural disasters should accelerate the policy renewal rate Per media reports  analysts at UBS Group AG estimate Hurricane Dorian to cause about  25 billion in losses in Bahamas  AccuWeather estimates the total damage and economic loss stemming from Hurricane Dorian to be in the range of  8 10 billion  Risk modeling and analytics firm RMS expects insured losses to range between  3 5 billion and  6 5 billion per a media release Though catastrophes are a concern for insurers  due to the high degree of losses incurred  they implement price hikes to ensure uninterrupted claims payment  After witnessing 19 back to back quarters of soft pricing market  insurers started increasing prices from the fourth quarter of 2018  which continued through the first half of 2019  Per Willis Towers Watson  NASDAQ WLTW  plc s Commercial Lines Insurance Pricing Survey in 2019  most of the commercial insurance lines should witness rate increase Property and casualty insurers are also increasingly taking reinsurance covers to shield their profits  These have been inducing increase in reinsurance renewal rates  Per a report in Insurance Journal  S P Global  NYSE SPGI  expects rates to rise about 5   Moody s 0 5  and Fitch 1  2   Per the report   analysts at UBS estimated that the reinsurance industry is in an excess capital position of around  30 billion  but that an estimated  70 billion of natural catastrophe losses in 2019 could erode this excess capital  Though P C insurers  financials are less sensitive to interest rates than life insurers   as the large financial portfolios managed by these carriers are designed to be fairly conservative  the improving interest rate environment will cushion investment income   However  there remains a high chance of Fed cutting rates for the second time this year in its ongoing two day FOMC meeting  given slowdown in growth  trade war with China and geopolitical tension like attacks on Saudi Arabia s oil facilities  The Fed had already made a 25 basis point rate cut in July Nonetheless  increasing adoption of technologies like artificial intelligence  robotic process automation  cognitive intelligence or blockchain and cloud computing should help insurers control costs Also  the insurance industry is well capitalized  enabling players to pursue mergers and acquisitions  thus curbing competition in the process  Also  sturdy capital levels help in boosting shareholder value through pay out of regular dividend and

Empliciti and Sprycel are also performing well on label expansion  Moreover  Bristol Myers has presence in other core therapeutic areas  including immunoscience and cardiovascular  Blood thinner drug  Eliquis  is expected to drive further growth  propelled by increased share in the novel oral anticoagulant market 
Meanwhile  the impending acquisition of Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  will broaden the company s oncology portfolio with the addition of the blockbuster drug  Revlimid  However  pipeline setbacks are concerns  The failure of the part 2 of the Checkmate 227 study was disappointing  given the potential in the NSCLC market

Shares of Lockheed Martin have gained 7 9  in the past three months  outperforming the Zacks Aerospace Defense industry s rise of 5 1   The Zacks analyst believes that Lockheed Martin enjoys strong demand for its high end military equipment in domestic and international markets 
Lockheed Martin is also the largest U S  defense contractor with a platform centric focus that guarantees a steady inflow of follow on orders from a leveraged presence in the Army  Air Force  Navy and IT programs  As a result  it witnesses solid order growth  In a year s time  Lockheed Martin has outperformed the industry 
However  the company s higher debt to equity ratio shows that the stock is highly leveraged when compared with its industry  Lockheed Martin also faces intense global competition for its broad portfolio of products and services  Additionally  suspension of the Turkish contract for the F 35 program may hurt the company s operating results

Alphabet s shares have gained 17 7  year to date  outperforming the Zacks Internet Services industry s rise of 3 8  over the same period  The Zacks analyst believes that Alphabet will continue to be driven by improving search   advertising revenues  hardware and AI

14217,235732,AON,Insurance   Brokerage Industry Near Term Outlook Bright,opinion,The Zacks  industry comprises companies that primarily offer insurance and reinsurance products and services  Insurance brokers act on behalf of their clients and offer advice keeping in mind clients  interests against brokerage fees   Some of these companies are also involved in providing risk management  third party administration and managed health care services Per London based Technavio  global insurance brokerage market size is estimated to grow by about  14 5 billion during 2018 2022 Here are the industry s three major themes Strong customer retention and increase in the number of insured have been driving insurance brokers  revenues  Moreover  income is generated through commissions earned on policies sold  While growth in aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products  rising population of baby boomers and millennials is boosting demand for medical insurance  life insurance  accidental insurance and other forms of insurance  This  in turn  leads to higher revenues as policy prices rise and volumes increase  Further  in case of some players  this trend is being supported by a steady diversification of operations through mergers and acquisitions  Also  with the market getting stronger on buoyant economic conditions  insurance brokers are capitalizing on their investments and generating better commissions and profits  With the business environment becoming more dynamic and complex  the need for insurance brokerage services has grown considerably  Additionally  utilization of data and analytics has strengthened insurance brokers  capabilities to cater to the increasing need for sophisticated risk management services  While investments in technology and analytics help insurance brokers generate solid revenues  expenses associated with such investments increase operating costs  Inorganic growth initiatives have increased debt levels of many players  As a result  interest expenses are expected to remain on the higher side Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Encouraging ProspectsThe Zacks Insurance   Brokerage industry is housed within the

While Aon has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Aon was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 45 on  2 47 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  9 13 on  11 24 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

14248,235763,AON,Aon  AON  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Aon  AON  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 25  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurance brokerage is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 43 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 2  
Revenues are expected to be  2 47 billion  up 5 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 17  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Aon 
For Aon  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 57  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Aon will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Aon would post earnings of  1 88 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 87  delivering a surprise of  0 53  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Aon doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aon-aon-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200475143,200475143

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Chevron  CVX   HSBC Holdings  LON HSBA   HSBC  and Sanofi  PA SASY   SNY   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Chevron s shares have outperformed the Zacks Integrated Oil industry year to date   12 1  vs   0 2    The Zacks analyst believes that Chevron s well economics in the Permian also continues to show improvement as the company has been able to achieve a 40  reduction in its development and production costs since 2015 
The company s existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry  targeting volume growth of around 4 7  in 2019 thanks to planned expansion in the Permian Basin 
However  the continued drop in Chevron s downstream segment earnings  partly attributable to a fall in domestic refined products sales margins  is a concern  In particular  Chevron s high profile Gorgon LNG development in Australia is suffering from mechanical issues that may restrict its ramp up

Shares of HSBC have lost 12 9  in the past six months against Zacks Foreign Banks industry s rise of 0 3   The Zacks analyst believes that while the company s initiatives to improve market share in the U K  and China are likely to lead to an increase in expenses and hurt bottom line growth  these efforts will support financials over the long term 
Its third quarter 2019 results reflect lower revenues and rise in credit costs  Additionally  its initiatives to strengthen digital capabilities globally and improve operating efficiency through further restructuring actions will go a long way in supporting profitability

14285,235800,AON,Insurance Brokerage Outlook Sanguine On M As  Rising Rates,opinion,"The Zacks  industry comprises companies that primarily offer insurance and reinsurance products and services  Insurance brokers act on behalf of their clients and offer advice keeping in mind clients  interests against brokerage fees  Some of these companies are also involved in providing risk management  third party administration and managed health care services Per London based Technavio  the global insurance brokerage market size is estimated to grow by about  14 5 billion during 2018 2022 Here are the industry s three major themes      Some of the revenue drivers of the industry are premium pricing  insured exposure and retention levels  The current environment is positive for this space given an increase in premium rates for all the areas of the insurance market  To put this into perspective  global property and casualty pricing is up about 5   Also  insured exposure continues to move higher  Moreover  growth in aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products  The rising population of baby boomers and millennials is boosting demand for medical insurance  life insurance  accidental insurance and other forms of insurance  This  in turn  should lead to higher revenues as policy prices rise and volumes increase      The insurance brokerage industry is witnessing fast paced consolidation  Mergers and acquisitions  M A  in this space have been rife in recent years  The industry has been traditionally fragmented with a number of small players  One of the factors driving mergers and acquisitions is the need of the companies to become specialized in their businesses  Also  small brokerage firm owners have to take big decisions about the future course of action as most of them belong to the baby bomber era and are ageing   Some other factors driving M A are the interest that private equity is showing in this sector  growing competition and a lack of organic growth      To maintain competitiveness in the industry  players are embracing technological change  The threat comes from new entrants  such as technology companies  Insurtech start up companies and others  These players are focused on using technology and innovation  including artificial intelligence  robotics and blockchain  to simplify and improve client experience  increase efficiencies  alter business models and bring about other disruptive changes in industries in which the existing players operate  While investments in technology help increase business efficiency  expenses associated with such investments increase operating costs Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Encouraging ProspectsThe Zacks Insurance   Brokerage industry is housed within the broader Zacks

signifies solid near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the top

14286,235801,AON,Why Should You Retain Aon  AON  Stock In Your Portfolio ,opinion,Aon plc   NYSE AON   has been in investors  good books on the back of rising revenues and inorganic growth strategies Aon has been witnessing a steady revenue stream over the last many years  This can be attributed to its solid fundamentals  such as expansions through buyouts and collaborations  divestitures and a solid financial position  Given its constant efforts to boost growth  we expect the top line to be consistently driven in the upcoming quarters The company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history  having outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters  the average being 0 6   This trend of consecutive estimate beats corroborates its operational excellence Recently  the company reported third quarter 2019 adjusted operating earnings of  1 45 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 4  and also growing 10 7  year over year owing to higher revenues  The quarter also witnessed a dip in operating expenses and solid segmental contributions  namely Commercial Risk Solutions  Reinsurance Solutions  Data and Analytic Services plus Health Solutions Its return on equity   a profitability measure   is 51 6   better than the industry average of 25 9   Further  the metric reflects the company s efficiency in utilizing its shareholders  funds Over the years  acquisitions have been instrumental in building Aon s growth trajectory  Its buyouts mainly aim at expanding its health and benefits business  flood insurance solutions  and risk and insurance solutions operations  The company also formed several alliances to enhance its capacity  thereby emerging as one of the largest insurance brokers In 2017 and 2018  Aon completed a total of 17 and eight acquisitions  respectively  to add to its portfolio  It recently agreed to acquire CoverWallet  the leading digital insurance platform for small and medium sized businesses  SMBs   This integration would provide Aon an access to the fast growing  digital insurance market for SMBs  which is valued at more than  200 billion in premium   We believe  these deals are likely to accelerate long term growth The company has also been divesting its non core operations to streamline business  From 2010 to 2015  it sold 27 businesses from the Risk Solutions segment and seven businesses in the HR Solutions segment that generated a substantial pre tax gain  Additionally  the company divested a business each from its Risk and HR Solutions segments in 2016 and its benefits administration and HR BPO platform to Blackstone  NYSE BX  in 2017  All these helped the company generate better return on equity and enabled it focus on its core business However  it has been issuing debts occasionally to repay dues  Long term debt has been persistently mounting since 2014 due to an increase in commercial paper outstanding  A high level of leverage escalates the company s borrowing costs  This  in turn  induced an elevated level of interest expenses  Heavy debt might result in high interest burden  thereby weighing on the company s margin Its long term growth rate is pegged at 12   above its industry s metric of 11  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings is pegged at  9 13  indicating a rise of 11 9  from the prior year reported number on revenues of  11 billion  implying 2 2  growth from the year ago reported number For 2020  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at  10 36 on  11 64 billion revenues  suggesting a respective 13 4  and 5 8  increase from the year earlier reported figures Shares of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company have rallied 24 8  in a year s time  outperforming its  s growth of 23 6  Stocks to

LONDON  Reuters    Local government pension schemes in Britain pulled money out of hedge funds last year  shifting cash to infrastructure projects such as wind farms and to private equity  a Reuters analysis of annual reports shows 
Local government schemes  which are among the largest pension investors in Britain  slashed their investments in hedge funds by a third in 2019  amid concern about low returns and high fees  the analysis shows 
The drop reflects a difficult year for hedge funds  with  65 86 billion yanked by investors globally in the year to March 2019 amid flat returns  according to data from eVestment  The FTSE 100 index  FTSE  rose 3 7  over the same period 
Hedge fund investments at the 10 largest local government pension schemes in England and Wales  which together manage 108 7 billion pounds   141 92 billion   fell to 854 3 million pounds from 1 3 billion pounds  in the 12 months to end March 2019 
The top 10 local government schemes are collectively bigger than any scheme run by a major private company or university in Britain  providing a key window on the strategy of UK pension managers 
It was the second year in a row that the UK schemes have pulled money from hedge funds  the Reuters analysis showed 
 Hedge funds have come under the spotlight in two areas in the last few years   said Colin Cartwright  partner with Aon  NYSE AON  Hewitt s Global Investment Practice   Performance  when you compare them with equity markets has not been great    and a greater focus on fund management fees  
Hedge funds typically charge both a management and performance fee 
By contrast  the pension plans added 958 6 million pounds to infrastructure investments  an increase of 24  from last year  including to projects such as Clyde Wind Farm in Scotland  one of Europe s largest operational windfarms 
Groups of local government pension schemes  LGPS  have started to pool their assets into large funds following rule changes in 2015  designed in part to boost their investments in infrastructure  The ruling Conservative party has also said it wants to spend more on infrastructure  particularly in the north of England 
Investments in private equity  which have long been favored over hedge funds  also rose by 597 million pounds  a 10 4  gain

Pension funds are important investors because they tend to park their money for the long term  and public pension funds account for about a fifth of hedge fund assets globally 
Hedge funds are often perceived as riskier investments and government run funds  such as these pensions  generally face pressure to stick to more staid places to put their money 
However  one of the top 10 LGPS  Kent  which did not invest in hedge funds but does invest in private equity  came under fire last year for its additional exposure to unlisted stocks via the now closed Woodford Equity Income Fund 
Of the five LGPS schemes to invest in hedge funds  three said they had cut back  including South Yorkshire  which continued to reduce its allocation to U S  based Permal Group  while one suffered losses 
Lancashire s hedge funds investments dropped 14  to 372 7 million pounds  but they declined to disclose whether they had redeemed cash or suffered losses as a result of poor performance 
Since March 2019  though  hedge fund returns have picked up  and a source at one LGPS said it has increased its hedge fund allocation 
The hedge fund industry made a 4 6  return between the end of March and the end of December  according to data from Hedge Fund Research  outperforming the FTSE 100  which rose 3 6  
 Given the current environment  we would counsel investors to exercise a degree of caution in drawing too many conclusions on whether to switch out of hedge funds   said Benjamin Cooper  head of manager research at investment consultant Cardano ",2020-01-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/britains-biggest-local-government-pensions-ditch-hedge-funds-for-wind-farms-2056807,2056807

Aon  NYSE AON  outpaced a booming market last year as its stock price jumped 43  compared to the 29  gain of the S P 500  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence

Now what
Aon is aiming for mid single digit annual organic sales growth over the long term  and it s on track for that goal in fiscal 2019  Investors will also be looking for continued margin expansion and improving returns on invested capital  as those promises from management likely supported this growth stock s rally last year  Earnings rose at a double digit pace thanks to growth in each of Aon s five business segments  and a continuation of those trends would support additional gains for investors in 2020 ",2020-01-10,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pgh3d,2056979

118204,339719,AON,Last decade most expensive for natural disasters  report,news,"LONDON  Reuters    The last decade was the worst on record for economic losses from natural disasters  amounting to  3 trillion   over a trillion more than the previous decade  insurance broker Aon  N AON  said on Wednesday 
The Asia Pacific region was the worst hit in the 2010 2019 period  accounting for 44  of the total  with earthquakes  tsunamis and tropical cyclones among the disasters  Aon said in a report 
More intense weather events  bigger populations in the path of disasters and greater supply chain disruption in a globalized economy contributed to the sharp rise in economic damage  Aon said 
 Perhaps the biggest takeaway from the last decade of natural disasters was the emergence of previously considered  secondary  perils   such as wildfire  flood  and drought   becoming much more costly   said Steve Bowen  director and meteorologist at Aon s impact forecasting team 
 Scientific research indicates that climate change will continue to affect all types of weather phenomena and subsequently impact increasingly urbanized areas  
Last year was the second warmest year on record for land and ocean temperatures  though Aon said economic and insured losses were lower than in the previous two years 
There were 409 natural catastrophe events totaling  232 billion in losses in 2019  with  71 billion covered by insurance programs  the report said 
The Aon 2019 estimates topped those by global reinsurer Munich Re  DE MUVGn   which said last week overall natural catastrophe losses were  150 billion  and insured losses  52 billion ",2020-01-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/last-decade-most-expensive-for-natural-disasters-report-2064430,2064430

certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results and those anticipated  Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results  as well as having been posted on our website Now  it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case  CEO of Aon Plc  You may begin Greg Case    Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  everyone  and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2019 conference call  I m joined today in Chicago by our two Co Presidents  Eric Andersen and Mike O Connor  and our CFO  Christa Davies  joins our discussion from London  Like previous quarters  we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website so that we can focus our time on these quarterly calls to provide you more insight and a longer term view for the firm First  let me start by recognizing the remarkable dedication of my Aon colleagues around the world  They re at the core of everything we achieve  and their execution this year was impressive  Their collective efforts continue to strengthen the firm and create long term momentum reflected through a strong finish to the year with positive performance across each of our core key metrics in the fourth quarter  including 7  organic revenue growth and acceleration from the prior year on top of a strong comparable  highlighted by growth of 5  or greater in four of our five solution lines  substantial operating margin expansion of 210 basis points and 17  EPS growth overcoming continued FX headwinds in the quarter And a similar performance across our key metrics for the full year highlighted by organic revenue growth of 6  for the overall portfolio  our strongest level of organic growth in over 15 years  reflecting continued acceleration of our historical trend  Double digit operating income and EPS growth  as well as record operating margin of 27 5   and 11  growth in free cash flow  delivering on our double digit annual growth target Our progress this year continues to reflect meaningful improvement against our objectives  which is a direct result of the strategic investments and actions we ve progressively taken to achieve our potential operating as one united global professional services firm  At this time last year  we looked ahead to 2019 and shared thoughts and aspirations for our firm as we turn the page to truly enter an era of Aon United  Now  a year later  our track record  both with clients and demonstrated by our financial performance  reinforces that our Aon United growth strategy is not only gaining traction  it s building momentum We ve been on our Aon United journey for over a decade  and along the way you ve heard us describe structural changes we have made to enable firmwide decisions and to make it easier for colleagues to work together within and across solution lines and geographies to fulfill the potential of our firm  As we look out to 2020  we re excited to have formalized a clear road map  highlighted on Page 6 of the presentation  that brings renewed focus and urgency to our journey and ensures we bring the best of Aon to our clients  We call this the Aon United Blueprint It covers four areas  our delivering Aon United effort  that was announced last quarter  translates the trust to conviction  built through our decade long change effort into a frontline client leadership program  making it easier for colleagues to collaborate and better articulate client benefits of Aon United consistently in local markets  Our Aon Business Services organization capitalizes on the benefits of scale to drive operational and client service excellence  Our New Ventures Group accelerates innovation at scale to address unmet client need and expand our addressable market  And our Aon impact model defines our colleague mission and the governing behavior and shared values that shape our culture  The full potential of our firm  the idea of Aon United  sits at the intersection of these four components We are committed to working differently  and the Aon United Blueprint lays out how we re executing on this objective  We know that when we consistently operate as Aon United and bring the full force of our firm to clients  we strengthen our value proposition  which translates into growth through winning more clients  doing more with existing clients  and identifying scalable new ideas to bring to clients You ve already seen the trend of our organic revenue growth consistently improve over the last six years from 3  in 2014 and 2015 to 4  in 2016 and 2017  5  in 2018 and now reaching 6  in 2019  The acceleration to date is a proof point that the Aon United approach we re taking to better understand and address the unique needs of clients is delivering differentiated insights that help businesses make better decisions  which is why we will continue to double down on investments and industry defining content and capabilities  These investments allow us to build  buy and scale capabilities that expand our reach and address increasing demand  which we believe underpins our ability to sustainably deliver mid single digit or greater organic revenue growth over the long term Our outlook is driven by three categories of growth  first  its continued growth across our core portfolio as we improve client value creation driven by our delivering Aon United program  As a baseline and as you ve heard us highlight previously  Aon operates in global markets across risk  retirement and health  each with demand characteristics that are increasing in both magnitude and complexity  Clients today face growing volatility and are confronting greater challenges than ever before Against that backdrop  the unmatched investments we ve made in proprietary data and analytics gives us a competitive advantage that defines  Phonetic  insights we provide to clients  ultimately allowing them to make better decisions that measurably improve their business or reduce their volatility  And when you combine the power of our analytics with our breath of expertise and Aon United behavior  we are deepening and further developing client relationships as we offer them more integrated solutions like many of the examples we ve used as context during these quarterly discussions  Simply put  we win more  retain more and do more with clients A perfect example is the success that we have achieved within our Enterprise Client Group  The Enterprise Client Group dedicates leaders to bring our Aon United efforts to life with our largest most complex clients by identifying and matching our best solutions to their specific business objectives  In 2019  we drove 50  more new business generation into existing relationships with clients in and this group as compared to a similar set of clients that we don t yet serve with a concentrated Aon United approach  And we have more than tripled the number of clients we serve in this way from approximately 50 to over 160 this year Second  we continue to strengthen our business mix as we evolve our portfolio toward higher growth areas of client demand  We re disproportionally investing organically and inorganically in priority areas that are defined by attractive growth and margin characteristics  A great example is delegated investment management within Retirement Solutions  which is a  1 8 trillion market expected to grow 10  over the coming years  We have invested both organically and through our acquisition the Townsend Group  and the combined business has grown assets under management at a 34  compound annual growth rate since launching in 2010 Townsend is just one of the 86 acquisitions we ve made in priority areas over the last five years  while divesting 84 non core businesses  The result is a positive portfolio mix shift as organic growth rates across our priority areas are into the high single and double digit ranges with significant potential to scale longer term And the third category is unlocking net new opportunities with innovation at scale  Aon has a strong track record of developing first to market solutions  For instance  we have created a  24 billion premium market in US mortgage reinsurance since 2012  We also have created a multi billion dollar premium market with our fully insured healthcare exchanges  both examples of connecting capital to previously uninsured risks Our New Ventures Group is central to our success in this third category of long term growth potential  The New Ventures Group accelerates net new innovation on behalf of clients and expands Aon s addressable market  The group serves as an incubator to rapidly scale our most significant growth  Phonetic  opportunities Let me tell you about our latest addition for the New Ventures Group  CoverWallet  the leading digital insurance platform for small and medium sized businesses  This unique platform offers customers advice  digital application  quote comparison  Phonetic   and policy management all online  with advisor standing by to lend support  We began our relationship with CoverWallet through a pilot program in the US and Australia  During the pilot  we directed a portion of our net new small business leads to CoverWallet s platform  which resulted in nearly doubling our new business growth  through increased conversion  cross sell  and the sale of ancillary services Penetration with existing clients increased by an impressive 20   Recognizing the success we are thrilled to welcome the CoverWallet team to Aon  CoverWallet is a great example of investment and differentiated capability that will serve as a building block to unlock new opportunity in the fast growing commercial insurance market for smaller businesses  a  100 billion global premium market with less than 5  served digitally today In summary we delivered a strong close to a year of significant improvement with momentum heading into 2020  As we continue to strategically position the firm to bring the best of global Aon to clients and execute against our Aon United growth strategy  The growth profile of the firm continues to improve  with further upside longer term  as we identify net new opportunities  the increase the firm s total addressable market Our team has greater conviction now than ever that the progress we have made over the last decade have made us a stronger firm  allowing us to operate differently and leading to better outcomes for clients  colleagues  communities and shareholders With that overview  I d like to turn the call over to Christa  for her thoughts on our financial progress this year and longer term  Christa  over to you Christa Davies    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global FinanceThank you so much  Greg  and good morning everyone  As Greg highlighted  we delivered a strong performance across our key metrics in both the quarter and for the full year as we continue to commercialize our Aon United strategy and demonstrate the growth potential of our firm In the quarter  we delivered 7  organic revenue growth with four out of five solution lines delivering 5  or greater  This translated into operating income growth of 12  and operating margin expansion of 210 basis points  We also delivered an incremental  54 million of restructuring savings in the quarter  And have now completed a 100  of the charges related to the program  Our strong growth and operational performance have enabled us to continue to fund the significant investments that Greg described across the firm to drive improved financial performance longer term As I reflect on the full year results  first  organic revenue growth accelerated 6   demonstrating continued improvement against our historical trend as we deliver on our goal of mid single digit or greater organic revenue growth over the long term  All five solution lines delivered similar or improved organic growth year over year  I would note  reported revenue was pressured throughout 2019 by an unfavorable impact from changes in FX  in addition to the impact of the divestitures of certain businesses we completed within the year  Most notably within our Retirement Solutions business  as we continue to shift our portfolio toward our highest growth and return opportunities Second  we delivered substantial operational improvement with operating income growth of 12  and operating margin expansion of 250 basis points to a record 27 5  margin  We delivered  169 million or 150 basis points of incremental restructuring savings for the full year  reflecting approximately a 100 basis points of core margin improvement  I would note this includes the absorption of significant investments to support long term growth as we continue to deliver client value in the Core  shift the portfolio to higher growth and higher margin areas and innovate scale to unlock net new markets  And we expect to continue to invest heavily in 2020 in some of our most attractive opportunities We translated strong operational performance into double digit EPS growth of 12  overcoming a headwind from FX translation and a higher effective tax rate within the year compared to the prior year period  FX rates continue to have an unfavorable impact on results in the fourth quarter  due primarily to a stronger US dollar  which has cumulatively resulted in significant net unfavorable impact of approximately  0 23 for the full year 2019 or a  68 million unfavorable impact on operating income If currency were to remain stable at today s rates  we would expect an unfavorable impact of approximately  0 06 per share for the full year 2020 with  0 05 of unfavorable impact or approximately  15 million of operating income expected in the first quarter of 2020  due to a stronger US dollar versus the euro Regarding our restructuring program  I m pleased to report that all charges related to the program are being incurred and the program is now closed  We delivered  529 million of annualized savings in 2019 and now expect to deliver  580 million of annualized savings in 2020  reflecting an increase of  45 million from a last estimate of  535 million I would note that incremental savings expected in 2020 will be spread throughout the year and reported as part of overall operational improvement  The total program reflects a cash investment of  1 485 million  and is expected to deliver a return on investment of 39  before any reinvestment  There are approximately  200 million of remaining cash outlays related to the program  of which a  180 million are expected to be incurred in 2020  before declining substantially thereafter Beyond the formal restructuring program  we will continue to identify efficiencies  drive improved productivity and enable growth of the firm as we unlock additional operating leverage through our Aon Business Services single operating model  Aon Business Services  our platform to deliver operations  technology and vendor management across the firm capitalize on the benefits of scale and draws operational and client service excellence As an example  earlier this year I provided insight into our efforts within Aon Business Services to move to a single CRM platform called Aon Connect  which standardizes our client facing sales process and creates a more holistic view of how to best serve clients across our firm  The platform also provides Aon colleagues with a more comprehensive view of each client s accounts  including information on existing relationships and insights in the client discovery process  which allows us to improve our pipeline and jeopardy processes As we ve ramped up usage of Aon Connect throughout 2019  our sales pipeline values have increased materially  In some businesses  our pipeline increased 30  year over year in Q4  Having a robust sales platform integrated into the business is contributing to increased win rates and penetration across solution lines with existing clients In 2019  usage of the platform was directly correlated to record new business wins in the US  This is an example of how our business platform within Aon Business Services combining technology with best practices is supporting our Aon United growth strategy through enabling long term growth and improved operating leverage Looking to 2020 and beyond  ongoing productivity improvements accelerating revenue growth and a portfolio mix shift to higher margin businesses are expected to drive continued long term margin expansion  noting that we ve delivered 70 to 80 basis points of operating margin improvement on average per year over the last decades Lastly  free cash flow increased by  164 million  or 11   to  1 61 billion  primarily reflecting strong operational performance  We achieved our target double digit annual growth despite approximately  130 million of net cash outflows related to certain litigation settlements that will create a tailwind to 2020  As we think about cash flow generation going forward  we re focused on maximizing the translation of accelerating revenue growth into the highest level of free cash flow in three ways  operating income growth  continued progress on working capital initiatives  and structural uses of cash winding down significantly in 2020 and 2021 Declining uses of cash  restructuring capex and pension collectively are expected to free up over  455 million of free cash flow by the end of 2021  as shown on Page 24 of our presentation  This has significant upside to our base of approximately  1 61 billion of free cash flow in 2019  prior to any operating income growth or working capital improvements  Together  these inputs give us confidence in our ability to deliver double digit annual growth and free cash flow over the long term We have the opportunity to substantial incremental debt capacity while maintaining our current leverage ratios as restructuring expenses are now complete and pension liability continues to improve  This provides significant financial flexibility over the coming years to further invest in value creation or return capital to shareholders  We re diligent about maximizing ROIC and make all capital allocation decisions on this basis  This is highlighted by the  2 billion of share repurchase in 2019  which remains our highest return on capital investment  given our free cash flow valuation I would highlight return on invested capital continues to improve as we shape the portfolio with a 190 basis point increase year over year to 23 5   driven by operating income growth and a reduction in capital  I would note that 23 5  ROIC is the highest the firm has had in its history In summary  full year results reflect strong performance on all four key metrics  driven by our Aon United strategy  We continue to accelerate organic growth  delivered record operating margin and achieved double digit EPS and free cash flow  all while making significant investments to improve the growth profile of the firm  We returned  2 4 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends in 2019  This success provides momentum as we head into 2020 and sports our expectation of continued long term shareholder value creation With that  I ll turn the call over to the operator and we d be delighted to take your questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  We will now begin the question and answer session   Operator Instructions  Speakers  our first question is from the Dave Styblo from Jefferies  Your line is open David Styblo    Jefferies    AnalystHi  Good morning  and thanks for the questions  and for the update  Greg  I wanted to start out with a broader question on the ABS and maybe the next set of key initiatives that you guys are working on over the next two to three years here  Obviously one of the focal point you talked about on that is how that can be used to support your long term margin goal of 70 to 80 basis points  I m curious as how much of that can help support that initiative as well as some of the benefits on the revenue side  I know Christa started  Phonetic  to get at that  but maybe if you could shed a little bit more color on how those efforts can help accelerate the revenue growth from here as well Greg Case    Chief Executive OfficerHappy to do that  Dave  and maybe I ll talk it a sort of overall level of focus and  Christa  you can embellish a little bit on sort of the direct impact on sustainable margins as well  David  it s important to step back at the core of our strategy to grow Aon has been this conversation that we ve been in for a long time around Aon United  And we have the external part of that  which is really the parts facing the market  meaning we re more consistently delivering the best of our firm to clients  And by the way  that s easy to say  everyone says it  it s very hard to do  but it benefits clients and colleagues immensely and you re seeing that show up on the top line But exactly to your point on Aon business services  equally compelling is asking the question  how can we be world class at client service  And if you think about it  most all industries have done this  all parts of financial services  manufacturing  etc  have addressed this challenge at a companywide level  but no one in our industry has ever done this  And the reason is again because it s really hard  And in essence  we undertook an investment to establishing our business services that takes really proven practice from sectors all around the world and then delivers it into our world  and again never really been done  It s a pretty bold step And if you think about    this it s really Aon United from the inside of the firm and delivering Aon United as the external facing piece  But this inside piece you re highlighting is really important  We ve absorbed a lot of disruption intentionally  single operating model  single OpCo  single brand  and in the end there were four things that come out of this  And one is  to your point  better client service in a coordinated way  and Christa described the example on some of the client connect piece  but beyond that is greater efficiency for sure  By the way  it didn t start with efficiency  we started with client service  Equally important is accelerated innovation And if you think about it  if we actually found a    hypothetically a blockchain solution and how long would it take us to implement it  10 years ago it would have taken us a long time  multiple years  Now actually with Aon business services  we ve got a way to accelerate innovation and then directly to your point it s about continuous improvement  This is a platform we ve invested in which allows us to actually get better and better and better over time and  again  we could never have done it without the incremental investment  And as Christa highlighted  we got a 39  return on it  but it wasn t the return that was important  it was the foundation that s in place  and we re very pleased about the progress  more to come  But we re more excited about the potential around margin expansion in 2021 and beyond and also what it can do from a client standpoint  But Christa  we ve talked very specifically about some of the opportunities there and  in essence  there are a lot of examples too Maybe before Christa  we go to Eric just as a quick example  Indecipherable  up every day Eric Andersen    Co PresidentYeah  Great    it s great to be here  I wanted to maybe tell a quick story to bring to light for you how this actually works in practice  And I ll use our reinsurance business as a way to describe it  Over the last 12 months  our reinsurance team has been building a center of excellence within our ABS business to provide cap modeling and advisory services in a low cost location  Now what essentially has it done is  it s created a standard across the entire business around the world and it s provided professional high end analytics It s also allowed the senior advisory team within the teams across the world to spend more time with their clients  and it s provided more structure and support  more advice on how actually to approach reinsurance transactions  And so you get a better standard of information and then obviously free up the time of the teams to be able to spend more time with clients  That s driven more retention  It s driven higher new business wins  There s actually been a great value add to the client Greg Case    Chief Executive OfficerAnd if I can add  Eric  you comment on this too  it s not    that was a reinsurance improvement  but that reinsurance improvement now gets translated into what it means for commercial risk or what it means for retirement  because we re actually learning best practices across the firm in ways we can never   Eric Andersen    Co PresidentYeah  That information gets scaled and used by commercial clients  reinsurance clients  pretty much anybody that needs that type of analytics Greg Case    Chief Executive OfficerSo that s very different  But  Christa  on the margin side  what are you thinking Christa Davies    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global FinanceYeah  So  Aon Business Services has absolutely enabled us to strengthen the platform and strengthen our ability to drive margin expansion long term  It s enabled us to drive productivity each year through our investments and platform  centers of excellence and third party partnerships  And one good example of that is  in 2019  we eliminated 600 000 hours of manual efforts and automated it in our Centers of Excellence and for our third party partnerships  And so  we re continuing to make improvement and it makes the sustainability of our continued margin expansion even stronger David Styblo    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  Thanks  Maybe something a little bit near term  On the cost savings  the new  580 million target for this year implies a margin tailwind of about 40 to 50 basis points  Is it fair for us to think about margins this year being better than the 70 to 80 basis point long term goal or are you guys thinking of using a good chunk of the cost savings for reinvestments Christa Davies    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global FinanceYeah  it s a really good question  Dave  And what we would say is  we re in a much stronger place in terms of margin expansion as a result of the investments we made in restructuring in Aon Business Services in particular  And so if you looked over the last 10 years  you would say that average has been 70 basis points to 80 basis points  Having said that  our gross margin expansion for the last couple of years has been way in excess of that  and will be in 2020 and 2021 Having said that  we will invest significantly in growth opportunities  because we ve got a number of very  very attractive areas of investment  And so we re not giving forward margin guidance  Dave  But  what I will tell you is  the gross margin expansion is significantly in excess of 70 basis points to 80 basis points  and then a really get netted  Phonetic  by investments we make in fantastic growth areas David Styblo    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  thanks  And I know the assets from before a little bit  but the mechanics  so when you re exiting the fourth quarter of  19 at  162 million run rate and you annualize that  you want to put something closer to  650 million  and that s well above but  580 million target  So what am I not understanding about the mechanics there as to why the discrepancy between those two numbers Christa Davies    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global FinanceYeah  look  it s a great question  Dave  and I certainly understand the math that you re doing  How we think about it  we really think about it in annual savings terms  So our cumulative savings in 2019 of  529 million and cumulative savings in 2025 of  580 million  and so we re driving substantial savings year over year as a result of the actions we took in 2019  And so you ve got a  50 million year over year benefit  And obviously those restructuring savings as well as the core margin expansion drove record margins in 2019 of 27 5    which we re extremely excited about David Styblo    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  thanks OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Thank you  speakers  Our next question is from Suneet Kamath from Citi  Your line is open Suneet Kamath    Citi    AnalystThanks  good morning  I wanted to start with a comment about buybacks being the best ROIC opportunity  Is that a function of sort of asking prices in terms of M A  being too high or your view of the intrinsic value of your stock price  Just some color on that would be helpful Christa Davies    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global FinanceDelighted to do it Suneet  So we manage the firm on return on capital  cash on cash return  And as we look at our return on capital of all the opportunities we have  whether that s M A investment organic investment or debt pay down or pension contributions  return on capital of buyback is the highest return on capital across the firm  And it s really based on our discounted cash flow of the firm  and the sustainability of the free cash flow outlook going forward and how much we think that s going to grow And so  look we definitely see attractive areas in M A  Suneet  We certainly see organic investment being extremely attractive  and some of our highest return on capital opportunities have been organic investments we ve made in the firm  like the healthcare exchanges  like data analytics like delegated investment management  Big 3  But what we would say is  it s really about the free cash flow growth long term and the sustainability of that  And so our DCF values are substantially above where we re trading today  which is why the return on capital buyback is still so high Suneet Kamath    Citi    AnalystGot it  And then maybe a quick follow up on that is  you had mentioned debt capacity as another lever in your tool kit  Given the difference between your DCF value in the current stock price  is the idea of using some of that capacity to accelerate share repurchases  something that you could    would consider Christa Davies    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global FinanceThe way we think about it Suneet is  our debt to EBITDA ratio and our current investment grade rating is incredibly important to us  And as EBITDA grows and our unfunded pension liability comes down  we ll add debt  keeping the leverage ratio the same  And so really it s about making decisions on an ROIC basis  And so that could be buybacks  that could be organic investment  it could be M A  But we ll continue to keep that leverage ratio the same  based on the importance of our current investment grade rating  both to our clients and to our financial flexibility Suneet Kamath    Citi    AnalystGot it  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question is from Paul Newsome of Piper Sandler  Your line is open Paul Newsome    Piper Sandler    AnalystGood morning  Congratulations on the quarter Christa Davies    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global FinanceThank you Paul Newsome    Piper Sandler    AnalystTalk a little bit more about the organic growth that we saw this quarter  which I think was better than most expected  Could you talk a little bit about what you see as the tailwind in pricing and maybe focus a little bit on the reinsurance sector  which obviously had a really big increase  was there anything in there that was one time in nature  Any big wins that kind of stuff  both in the reinsurance and across the other businesses as well Greg Case    Chief Executive OfficerHappy  Paul  to talk about sort of what s driven  sort of the overall growth profile  And again  both Christa and I reflected  that s actually been a trend  it s across the portfolio that s been going on for a number of years  I will come back to reinsurance  I would say reinsurance  obviously is the smallest quarter by far we have  we ll come back to the overall piece and we d actually reflect on the overall year And to start off with the impact from pricing as you highlighted is evident  but not material  Again evident  but not material in our full year organic of 6   That s true in reinsurance and that s true in commercial risk  If you think about it  half of our revenue base is not impacted by pricing at all  And certainly on the risk side  the Retirement Business  the health  the data analytics business  so take half of it out against the 6  completely  And then you sort of say the remaining piece that s left on the risk side  at third of that is fee based  So two thirds commission  one third fee based  And by the way  some of those commission based revenues  particularly in larger clients are cap  So it s more like a fee  So in essence  you start with literally the impact overall is evident as I said  but not material  Equally important is the work we do  I mean we are built to serve clients in changing rate environments  and the work that we do really changes their behavior  So there is not a direct linear correlation at all What we would say  if you step back  what s driving our progress  Our progress is really driven around new business  more clients  new clients  retention and rollover  And rollover by the way  might be the place where the price might show up  but it really is about new business and retention  And just  I picked a couple of things off quickly  and then maybe flip it to Eric and Mike on sort of just additional thoughts here But on the reinsurance side in particular  for the year  again that s 10  for the year  We feel very good about it  But 60  of that growth  call it  89 million   90 million  was a pure treaty net new  And then you ve got net new on FAQ  Phonetic  and you ve got net new on ILS  insurance linked securities  And essentially this is really a net new opportunity with exceptional retention rates And the same story really across the commercial risk portfolio  I ll pick one    once     frankly one sector  we could pick it anywhere around the world  And US brokerage  we had retention rates at 95  and then  170 million of net new in the quarter  overall for the year it s 10  year over year and 17  up in Q4  So this is a net new phenomenon for us and retention phenomenon for us and this is back to the idea of Aon United and what we re doing to strengthen our overall portfolio And again  I ll ask Eric and Mike to comment on it  But some of these pieces are about how we expand what we do inside the solution piece versus our overall  Eric  thought on that Eric Andersen    Co PresidentSure  Maybe  I ll start with sort of some of the market dynamics and then Mike  you can cover off some of the client pieces  I think from a market dynamics  what we re seeing is a bit of a flight to quality  In that  if you think about what we do on the insurance side for these clients  we help them on risk identification  first and foremost  We then work with them on risk mitigation  which is how do they actually handle the risk without going into the market to trade it  And we ve made a lot of significant investments in the data and analytics side there to help them understand their risk without actually ever going to the insurance market And then finally  if you do go to the insurance market  our team s global access to capital  our ability to provide insight structuring ideas  benchmarking all the things that we ve been talking about over the last couple of years in terms of investment into the business  actually allows our teams to be able to help them manage through what is a transitioning market  And I would say  maybe one last comment before I throw it over to Mike  Greg on the fact piece  is that the facultative business is tied pretty closely in certain parts of the world  certainly Latin America on how the primary market goes  whether it s the insurers themselves looking to transition some of their portfolio risks on an individual client basis or its clients themselves looking to access the global capital anywhere Now  we are    as Greg  we re going to build for it and our teams have been working really closely over the last several years to be able to effectively get ready for this moment  Mike  maybe a couple of comments on what the clients are actually doing Michael O Connor    Co PresidentYeah  Thanks  Eric  And maybe I d share one in this environment that comes to my mind  I think is really interesting  and it brings to life some of what we re talking about how we bring Aon United and deliver to a client  And these examples where we actually brought a full range of capabilities from our cyber solutions team to help this client  And as Greg mentioned  our enterprise client leader model that we ve rolled out  this is a situation where enterprise client leader was working with our cyber solutions team and really challenged the team to think about what we could do to this client This is a pretty sophisticated global financial services client and the team stepped back and invested the time to understand the client s posture around the globe  their capabilities  where they were at  and said how do we augment and supplemental that client s doing  And we came forward with a global solution around cyber risk assessment  impact quantification  our ability to help them with security testing and incident response  And that global proposition resonated with this client and left the client in a better position in terms of their readiness to basically respond to any incident that happened  And for me  that s a great example of our team making Aon United come to life for a client within a solution line and bringing more of Aon to that client to have more in that Greg Case    Chief Executive OfficerSo  in that example  Mike  literally three years ago  we replaced the cyber policy  It had been great  We declared victory  It s been awesome  And now  we literally had a conversation that really is much broader  We re serving the client differently  We re bringing more  The enterprise client leader really asked for holistic piece  And the good news is  even if this client says  they don t really want it  they just want a cyber policy  they actually see us differently because we re talking about their holistic business  In this case it worked out much better than that  But we have    probably that gives you a sense  I mean  literally what s driving our    the action here is really net new and retention  Again  we want to reflect    the price seems evident  but it s not material in the overall story  and it gets to the sustainability and what Aon United means at the client level Paul Newsome    Piper Sandler    AnalystAbsolutely  And it s a related question  Obviously Aon United has a piece of here    of cost cutting efficiencies  which I think are pretty easily    relatively easy for us to see as outsiders  But a lot of your examples here are essentially cross selling samples  How  as an outsider  should we sort of measure that change  And maybe you can talk about your internal measures as well in that respect Michael O Connor    Co PresidentWell  listen  we ll come back to    we d encourage you again  On Page 6  we ve got this Blueprint laid out  It s got some pieces to it  One of the pieces is  how do we deliver our firm at the front line  Delivering Aon United at the front line  we built a tremendous amount of infrastructure to try to support behind that  things that help our colleagues understand the firm Aon IQ  the client tracking piece that Christa described  all these things go into sort of how we make it easier for our colleagues to deliver the firm The translation of that is really simple  growth  So you re looking at growth  I mean  at the end of the day  if we re not actually serving clients more effectively and doing more with them  what are we doing  And by the way  that s got to be value driven  That s not a price driven effort  that s a value driven effort  How do we create more value for clients  We create more value  they understand it  we re going to do fine against that  So in essence  you look at the top line and understand what we re doing on top line and how that s evolving over time And then  you basically then look at Aon Business Services  Christa described it and we described it as well  that s another means for us to actually be better  The cap modeling example that Eric gave was really into how you serve clients get better  Those clients are actually getting better content than they ve ever gotten before  Our colleagues had to be comfortable and trust that over time and see it build  and now we re actually getting better and better  So clients are seeing better content  again  back to growth  And then  Aon Business Services obviously got great operating leverage because of great efficiency  and that means we can invest more back into the business But the translation    when you think about the question of how we re doing  it really is the simple things Christa was describing  organic growth  the operating leverage we have in the business which translates into margin improvement  and then    you follow our story  it hasn t changed    this free cash flow generation and delivering on our double digit free cash flow growth year after year after year  And as Christa highlighted  the Aon United effort has substantially strengthened our ability to deliver on that promise  which is going to be great for our clients  great for our colleagues  and of course we think very  very good for our shareholders Paul Newsome    Piper Sandler    AnalystThank you  and congratulations on the quarter Greg Case    Chief Executive OfficerAppreciate it OperatorThank you  Our next question is from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse  Your line is open Mike Zaremski    Credit Suisse    AnalystHey  Good morning  Christa  you talk about the tax rate thinking into 2020  and I see it was lower than expected this quarter  And maybe that had to do with the incorporation to Ireland Christa Davies    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global FinanceSo  Mike  what we would say is  we don t give tax guidance going forward  As I look back historically  exclusive of the impact of discrete items which can be positive or negative in a quarter  our historic underlying rate has been 18  for the last three years  And what you saw in the quarter  Mike  was some positive discreet and a change in the geographic distribution of income  but really 17 5  for the full year  which is dangerously close to the 18  we ve seen from the previous three years  The Ireland move will be concluded on the 31st of March  and it s really about preserving capital structure and financial flexibility Mike Zaremski    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay  And just to think about free cash flow and tax too  is the cash tax rate  is that should be similar Christa Davies    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global FinanceIt should be similar  yes  You re always going to have a slight difference in timing  Mike  between your GAAP tax rate and your cash tax rate because of settlements with tax authorities around the world  So  there ll be some disconnect in timing  but in general they re the same Mike Zaremski    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay  great  And my last question is on maybe CoverWallet and small    that small to midspace at a higher level  Does CoverWallet take balance sheet risk like a carrier or is it essentially a broker  I guess  strategically it sounds like Aon would like to do more in the small to medium space  So  is that a kind of strategic priority M A wise and would you consider kind of getting into the more plain vanilla  small  mid US brokerage space  like something your competitors are in Greg Case    Chief Executive OfficerWe ll start with the balance sheet  Christa Christa Davies    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global FinanceYes  So  Mike  let me just take the balance sheet piece  then I ll hand to Greg for the sort of more the overall growth opportunity  which we think is fantastic  So  Mike  as a company  we do not take balance sheet risk  So  this is in the same brokerage MGA space that we play in every single day  And so  our    we re a professional services firm  and we re in the business of delivering great services to clients and getting rewarded through performance fees  through straight fees and through commissions  And we do not take balance sheet risk in this business or in any other part of our business But  Greg  over to you on the small business opportunity  which is fantastic Greg Case    Chief Executive OfficerGreat  And that is highly consistent  like we ve already been and that s what we re going to do  We love bringing content and capability  and we re then essentially matching capital with risk around the world  And the capital we match is obviously insurance capital  but all types of capital  So if you think about a changing world  whether it s    whether it s small businesses or to climate change  do anything you want to think about  intellectual property wherever it is  we re matching capital with risk and using content to do that  That s the essence of what our firm is all about And the beauty of that is  those    that demand on that is getting higher and higher  That brings you to CoverWallet  and CoverWallet is just a wonderful example of really high  high end  high quality content capability that addresses small and mid sized businesses  And again  this is scalable capability  In essence  it s initially the application against the  200 billion small commercial market  growing at 6   less than 5  sort of digitally  And the opportunity to really grow that market over time  although the expectations are in the quarter of that market might be digital by 2023  So this is a massive growth opportunity to serve clients in an effective way  CoverWallet is going to be central to that in terms of sort of what we re up to and what we re doing  and we re looking forward to that You also ask about midmarket  I would say  listen  80  of what we do around the globe is midmarket  So  in essence  we ve always been midmarket  continue to drive midmarket  And certainly this has applications in that realm as well  We re serving large companies  medium sized companies and smaller companies  and then CoverWallet is really a means for us to sort of dig into that in a very    in a very  very strong way And then the digital assets that are brought to bear to  we think of applications much broader  So  this is a great example of content and capability that s scalable  A lot of our acquisitions that Christa was just describing really M A  if we re going to be buyback because of our view of relative undervalued stock  we re going to beat that return invested capital  It s necessarily not getting bigger  it has to be getting better  and CoverWallet helps us get better  I mean  this is content that we can scale  and that actually has a very high return of invested capital  That s the essence of it in terms of where we are in the overall perspective  That makes sense Paul Newsome    Piper Sandler    AnalystYeah  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question is from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo  Your line is open Elyse Greenspan    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystHi  Thanks  Good morning  My first question is on free cash flow  So  if my understanding  I guess  you re looking for double digits in 2020    double digits growth  sorry  Is that off of if we adjust the 2019 free cash flow level for all the restructuring cash that run through  just trying to get a sense of the base that we should think about using as you look to grow double digits this year Christa Davies    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global FinanceYeah  Great question  Elyse  So  it s off to  1 61 billion base for 2019  which has essentially got straight off the GAAP cash flow statement  cash flow from operations less capex  That s your starting point  And so we ll grow double digits in 2020 and we ll grow double digits in 2021 driven by three key things  The first is operating income growth  the second is working capital initiatives  and the third is declining uses of cash which you see on Page 37 of the PowerPoint Elyse Greenspan    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  In terms of organic growth as we think about 2020  you guys seem pretty bullish on the growth prospects  Just trying to think is there any seasonality that we should be thinking about with any of the quarters that growth might be skewed heavier either earlier or later in the year relative to any of the four quarters Greg Case    Chief Executive OfficerThere are patterns we can highlight  What we ve come back to  Elyse  is really    it s really the overall year in the portfolio  So  we start with our growth thesis  It s overall year and the portfolio  So  in essence  this is the 3   3   4   4   5   now 6   And what we ve essentially said is  we want to achieve mid single digit or greater growth over the long term  And we put in place a number of things to make that happen that we think will continue to improve and grow and strengthen our ability to do that and are positioned to do that Obviously  some of our solution lines have different patterns in terms of sort of where we go back and forth  which we can highlight  Christa  maybe you want to highlight some of those  But net net  what we re essentially saying is  we want to grow mid single digit or greater  and we re investing to do that  And you ve seen that track record continue to play out  And Elyse  in terms of quarterly patterning  Q1 and Q4  our strongest quarters  Q1 being our largest quarter of the year since revenue recognition  and Q1 is really much more reinsurance and EMEA  strong quarter  and Q4 is really US retail and health sort of strong quarter  So  they re the two biggest quarters of the year  Q3 is our seasonally weakest quarter Elyse Greenspan    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  And then  my last question following the incorporation to Ireland  I think you said that s going to take place at the end of March  I m just trying to understand would there be anything preventing you guys from issuing intercompany loans out of Ireland  I m just wondering if there s any kind of    anything that we need to pay attention to there Christa Davies    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global FinanceElyse  really the move to Ireland is really about maintaining a stable corporate structure and financial flexibility  It won t result in any change to Aon s current business operations  The move is really about remaining in the European Union single market  And so  it won t change any of our debt structuring internally or externally or any of our operations Elyse Greenspan    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  Thank you for the color OperatorThank you  Our next question is from Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs  Your line is open Yaron Kinar    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGood morning  everybody  My first question probably ties into Elyse s previous question on free cash flow  So  how confident are you in the ability to achieve the double digit annual growth in 2020  considering that projected year over year improvement in cash uses    it s actually declined by almost  250 million relative to the initial expectation Christa Davies    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global FinanceYeah  Yaron  we re extremely confident about achieving double digit growth in 2020 and 2021  and beyond  If you think about 2020 in particular  you have  130 million of tailwind from legacy litigation that s flowing into 2020 for a start  And then  you do have declining uses of cash of pension and restructuring into 2020  as you can see on Page 37 of the PowerPoint  So  just those two numbers alone are substantial  That s before you get to strong operational improvement and working capital initiatives  which drove the majority of the growth in 2019 Yaron Kinar    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  And without the litigation  would that still be the same answer Christa Davies    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global FinanceYeah  absolutely Yaron Kinar    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  And then  I guess  going back to Paul s previous question  is there any way to quantify how much of a cross sell opportunity Aon United is driven or maybe as a percentage of the 6  organic growth for the year Greg Case    Chief Executive OfficerYaron  again  we would suggest we come back  This is less    we don t think about it as cross sell  We think about it as a client leadership and client development  And again  a lot of the conversations we have aren t about sort of the next product  it s about how you understand client need more effectively  address client need  Sometimes you sell product  sometimes you have a great conversation and the client sees you differently and retention changes  Sometimes they see you differently  they don t buy that but they buy something else or the current stuff they actually feel better about the value you bring and you actually deliver greater value  they understand and pay you more for that  So  this shows up in many  many different ways You get this behavior in the water and watch our team do what they do and it s wonderful to see  We know this works  We know it s incredibly powerful  it works on new  it works on retention  it works on rollover  And Aon United is all about how we scale it  and actually how we put the mechanisms in place to do it more and more across the firm and then continue to keep better and better at it  And then in the end  you re going to    it shows up in top line revenue and it shows up in operating leverage  because it shows up in Aon Business Services as well  And you see it in top line  you see it in margin and you see it then in the translation to free cash flow  So that s how we d like you to think about it  that s how we think about it  Obviously  we ve got more detail behind that operationally  But that fundamentally is what we re all about  and what we re looking to try to do  And in our view in the end  this is what s driving sustainable mid single digit growth over time and our pieces around that  But  Eric and Mike in terms of how it shows up in the field Eric Andersen    Co PresidentYeah  I think a great tangible example of it is the Enterprise Client Group  And this is a group of client leaders within Aon across the world  that actually invest heavy time to understand the ins and outs of each individual client  And then they work within all the solution lines to either be able to craft products or services  Greg  as you mentioned or they work together to create something different and something new to add real value to the client So again it s hard to quantify based on each individual solution line  but that interaction with the client really could be very special and add great value for us with that relationship Yaron Kinar    Goldman Sachs    AnalystJust looking at the overall organization  is there any way to think of the move from 3  to 4  to 5  to 6  organic growth  How much of that has come through Aon United specifically Greg Case    Chief Executive OfficerWe don t want to  we don t want you to do that Yaron Kinar    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay Greg Case    Chief Executive OfficerAon United is what we are  it s not a separate thing  it s the fabric of the firm  It s the nature of the conversation  So the 3  to 4  is part new  by the net news record  new record  New record in terms of reinsurance  new record in terms of commercial risk  on the retirement  on the health side Aon United is about retention  Clients we might have lost  we re not losing now  By the way  the conversation we re having with clients around  if you re at RFP  why are we better  It s a different conversation  By the way  anybody can say what we re saying  but who has done single opco  single brand  single    basically single operating system  who is doing Aon Business Services  the answer is no one  So that has valued clients go wow  this actually makes a difference  So we don t want this to be separate  We want this to be an integral to what we do every day And then if it shows up in top line and margin and it shows up in free cash flow  our hope is you ll be very comfortable with that  that overall outcome Michael O Connor    Co PresidentYeah  And Greg  maybe I d add  the example you brought  which I think really brings the life for me is  think of the situation  when we bring a new idea to a client  And it s a great conversation  it s exciting solution  it can help them with a material issue  but they actually    it s not the right time   Indecipherable  it  Our team comes back and celebrates that  Our team comes back  the client is looking at us differently  they are thinking about us differently  And ultimately that helps us long term  That s delivering Aon United  And for us  we do that time and time again and good things are going to happen for the client in terms of us helping them  and helping us grow with that client every time Greg Case    Chief Executive OfficerBut the hard metrics are literally net new retention rollover  and then everything sort of is derivative against that  that drives overall top line and it cuts by the way across solution lines and then within solution lines  And by the way a lot of Aon United is doing more with clients in risk  doing more with clients in retirement  doing more clients in health  And then occasionally  understanding their needs and their issues and thinking across our solution lines  So these are that these are the types of things the team is doing  And we re building more and more momentum around it Yaron Kinar    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGot it  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question is from Brian Meredith of UBS  Your line is open Brian Meredith    UBS    AnalystYeah  thanks  I ve got two questions  The first one  Greg  I m just curious  if we look at your solutions  Retirement Solutions is clearly the one that s been lagging from an organic revenue growth  and I understand there are some structural headwinds in certain parts of that business  But I guess my question is  could you get that business to a mid single digit plus organic revenue growth rate kind of sustainably  And if so  what is it going to take to get it there  And what are the things that you re doing to get it there Greg Case    Chief Executive OfficerWhat is that we do  in all of our solution lines we believe in the end are mid single digit or greater over time  Maybe I ll just aren t high level and maybe Christa  you could give your thoughts on this as well  But net net  in step back this is about fundamental demand  Brian  Global world retirement  20  of the world is ready for retirement  80  is not  Fundamentally  this is a massive  massive sort of pool of demand that if you can address on behalf of a clients  you can make a huge difference And we ve talked about it before  when you juxtapose retirement and health  all of our clients have employees  their employees almost by definition on average are overspending on health and underspending on retirement  That s an incredibly insidious of set of behaviors that over the course of a decade or two makes a difference in the life of the family  If we can actually help them adjust that  one or two degrees hugely  hugely powerful And then there are pieces inside of what we re doing on the retirement side like delegated etc  that are incredibly powerful  and actually we know we re investing very  very heavily behind  But  Christa  your thoughts on that as well Christa Davies    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global FinanceAbsolutely  right Greg  That s where I was going to explain  Brian  I think there is an enormous portfolio mix shift going on within retirement  What you really see as we divested a lower growth talent business earlier in the year  that was a drag on organic through the first half of 2019  We ve been investing heavily in high growth areas like delegated investment management  which Greg talked about  which is growing double digits for us And in human capital  which is again growing high single to low double digits for us  And as these scale  will become a bigger part of the mix in retirement overall and for Aon overall  And we re really confident that retirement will become a mid single digit growth or greater part of our portfolio over time Brian Meredith    UBS    AnalystGot you Eric Andersen    Co PresidentAnd maybe one last comment  Christa  because I agree the human capital business has really performed well in the second half  There is also things that are happening legislatively like the Secure Act  which actually gives opportunity especially in North America  around multi employer grouping to be able to do more efficient    more efficient pension opportunities that we actually think there is    there is great opportunity for them  especially in North America going into  20 and  21 Brian Meredith    UBS    AnalystGreat  And then my second question  Greg  Aon United has done a great job in delivering extra value or more value to customers and I guess my question is  have you been able to boost yield or at least what you re charging for your service as I know that there was a conversation  Several years ago  we were talking about trying to trying to do that  Has that happened  How much is that contributing  do you think to this organic growth  And do we think that could be a tailwind going forward Greg Case    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  this is    all right  really appreciate that  because this is really at the heart of what we re trying to think about  And it really is about a value conversation with our clients  No kidding  value  And in essence  if we use the example  if we cast a dollar and we actually create value for clients that translates into  2 of value  and somebody else comes in and says I can do what you re doing for  0 50  but it translates into  0 52  if our client understands the value  really understands  better operating performance  stronger financial position  less volatility  whatever the source of value  Brian  if it s quantifiable  clients understand it  They are thrilled to pay for it  because it creates real value for them If we don t do a great job  and we are not adequate in describing the value  shame on us  right  That s the issue  By the way  that s a high bar  And that s what Aon United is all about  How do we get a little better every year at describing value  by the way  asking ourselves  are we really providing the value  if we re not investing behind it  And this is where we re back to kind of we re invested in content  intellectual capital  the CoverWallet example  many other strides  talents and these are content laid in investments that we can scale to clients to create more value We create more value and we get better in articulating  we re going to get paid for it and clients are going to be happier  And there are countless examples of that  Brian  We know it works  Question is how do we scale it  and that s how Aon United is different  And look  we re making a decision  we re doing some things different  What we re doing on delivering Aon United at the frontline is different  It requires different behavior  What we re doing on Aon Business Services is different  it requires different behavior  Turns out that behavior has tremendous benefit for clients and great economic leverage if we can scale it  And if we do  we can continue to do  we ll get better and better  But that s how we thought about it and we ve had great success at the micro level  What we want to see is  more and more success over time at the macro level across the firm  And that s the essence of the evolution of Aon United Brian Meredith    UBS    AnalystGreat  thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan  Your line is open Jimmy Bhullar    JPMorgan    AnalystHi  good morning  Most of my questions were answered  But just to clarify  you gave the rationale for the domicile change to Ireland being capital and operational flexibility  But should we assume any benefit on your tax rate  Or does the tax rate or would it not change at all Christa Davies    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global FinanceIt will not change at all Jimmy Bhullar    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay  And then on pricing  you mentioned that it s been a little bit of a benefit recently  obviously a lot of your business is dependent  Phonetic  on pricing  But what are you seeing out there in both commercial and reinsurance market  it seems like brokers commentary has gotten more positive recently  but how broad based do you think the pricing improvement is by region or and or by line Greg Case    Chief Executive OfficerAnd again  we don t view it as positive or negative  We view it as sort of  it s the price per unit  And we understand it and then we react to it  And we react to it on behalf of clients  So in essence  when price changes or per unit cost changes  per unit of risk  we re helping clients understand how to change programs to line design  Phonetic  programs  Eric mentioned  this is exactly what we re built for  The data analytics we have allow us to change programs  relay our programs  bring in different markets  Think about risk differently So in essence  we re constantly adapting to that on behalf of clients  And that s what we said for us  the impact on pricing was there  was evident  but it was not material Jimmy Bhullar    JPMorgan    AnalystAnd but  what are you seeing just as an observer in the market  that sort of as an unbiased viewer of the market  what are you seeing in terms of pricing trends overall and how it evolved as 2019 went    as you went through 2019 Greg Case    Chief Executive OfficerYou re seeing pressure here and there  where there have been specific caps  where there have been specific issues over time  But remember  there s    when you think about macro supply and demand of capital  there is a massive amount of capital out there  that can be used to be in the overall marketplace  So  globally across the market  a lot of capital out there  By the way  our view is  ironically  there is a lot more risk out there  those are being addressed  So there s opportunities to sort of help clients and support their needs  But there is pressure of late  based on some of the things that are happening around the world and the catastrophes around the world  But net net  we see abundance of capital and an opportunity to help clients address their risks needs Jimmy Bhullar    JPMorgan    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question is from Meyer Shields of KBW  Your line is open Meyer Shields    AnalystThanks  good morning  I had a question about CoverWallet  and the context is that in the US  direct to consumer auto insurance  has had much lower penetration than we ve seen in a number of other countries  I m wondering whether that s a constraint at least in the near term on CoverWallet s its growth Greg Case    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Meyer  this is broader than direct to auto  This is really sort of  if you think about small company  small businesses and their broad based set of risk needs  how do you address those risks needs more holistically and then how do you do it with an incredibly efficient platform underpinned by world class data and analytics  So that really is the thesis  And we ve actually as I described before  we spent a great deal of time with CoverWallet in pilot mode  before they actually became part of the overall Aon family  And we re quite optimistic about the opportunities here to help smaller companies succeed in ways they haven t before  understand our risk better  mitigate their risk more effectively and that really is the essence of what CoverWallet is about Meyer Shields    AnalystNo  I understand that  And that s helpful  I m trying to get a sense as to whether  there is some sort of a cultural impediment domestically to adopting direct to  in this case  enterprise  in terms of distribution Greg Case    Chief Executive OfficerI think it s less about    it s less about cultural impediments  it s more around  is there a compelling value proposition that a small business would understand  would value and would pay for  And if you get that combination right  and I said  well  this is a great way for me to understand risk in my business  get an overall solution that s actually very cost effective that I can understand  that by the way delivers when I need it  And then  I get to go back to do what I do  which is run by business  We think that s going to be reasonably attractive Meyer Shields    AnalystOkay  Now that makes sense  Thanks  Second small question  was there any timing from maybe the first part  Phonetic  of 2020 capital markets issues that contributed to the reinsurance segment s organic growth in 4Q Eric Andersen    Co PresidentNo  there was not  The 24     I m sorry  the Q4 number was really driven by some cat bonds that actually were just expiring and were renewing  So it was not necessarily new issuers or new buyers  but it was just traditional expiring that had to be replaced  But there was a significant amount of facultative business  that essentially matches the timing by which the risk gets placed either in the primary market or a renewal of a fact placement  So there was no timing back and forth Greg Case    Chief Executive OfficerAnd really  Meyer the issue or the question on reinsurance  we would suggest is in the annual question  it s a 2019 question  It s not the 17  in the quarter  which by the way  good  team did a great job on a smaller quarter  When you think about the 10  over the course of the year  and the root cause of that driven by    so much of that driven by net new  as I described before  treaty alone explained over 60  of the difference  And then the ILS explains a lot of the differences Eric described before  as did FAK  Phonetic   And so it really is the 10  organic for the year  which is really a powerful story  And the retail market was driving more opportunities and our reinsurance colleagues are picking those up  So all these things are sort of happening  but to deliver a 10  organic for the year  was really remarkable effort by our reinsurance colleagues Meyer Shields    Analyst100   Thank you so much OperatorThank you  I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Case for closing remarks Greg Case    Chief Executive OfficerJust wanted to say thank you to everyone for joining us and we look forward to the next quarter  Take care Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  65 minutesCall participants Greg Case

118208,339723,AON,Aon  AON  Q4 Earnings And Revenues Top Estimates,opinion,"Aon  AON  came out with quarterly earnings of  2 53 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 49 per share  This compares to earnings of  2 16 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1 61   A quarter ago  it was expected that this insurance brokerage would post earnings of  1 43 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 45  delivering a surprise of 1 40  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Aon  which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Brokerage industry  posted revenues of  2 89 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 62   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 77 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Aon shares have added about 5 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 6  
What s Next for Aon 
While Aon has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Aon was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  3 71 on  3 32 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  10 35 on  11 64 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

118209,339724,AON,Aon  AON  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Aon  AON   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Aon currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for AON that show why this insurance brokerage shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For AON  shares are up 3 2  over the past week while the Zacks Insurance   Brokerage industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 7 89  compares favorably with the industry s 1 37  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Aon have risen 15 77   and are up 34 91  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 6 38  and 22 19   respectively 
Investors should also take note of AON s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  AON is averaging 733 093 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with AON 
Over the past two months  5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost AON s consensus estimate  increasing from  10 36 to  10 38 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that AON is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of A  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Aon on your short list ",2020-02-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aon-aon-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200504446,200504446

118243,339758,AON,Space insurance costs to rocket after satellite crash,news,"By Carolyn Cohn  Tom Sims and Noor Zainab Hussain
LONDON FRANKFURT  Reuters    Space rockets and satellites are likely to cost more to insure after the European Vega rocket crash this month  which hit insurers with a record space market loss of 369 million euros   411 21 million   insurance industry sources say 
The Vega rocket carrying a military observation satellite for the United Arab Emirates veered off course shortly after take off and crashed 
Prior to the accident  Italian aerospace company Avio Aero  MI AVI   which built the Vega  said it had a 100  success rate 
The insurance loss for the rocket and satellite represents the largest recorded loss in the space market  satellite analysis firm Seradata said 
Until now  insurance premiums for commercial satellite and rocket accidents have been falling due to strong competition among insurers and improved rocket reliability 
But that could change in the aftermath of the Vega crash  leading to higher costs for space rocket launches 
 Space insurers have suffered two major claims within the past year and the cost of these losses far exceeds the premiums earned in this sector   said Nick Brown  group chief executive at insurer Global Aerospace  which is backed by major reinsurers Munich Re and Berkshire Hathaway  N BRKa  
 Insurance rates for both launch and in orbit have been at historically low levels and     need to increase significantly  
The Vega loss follows the failure of Maxar Technologies   N MAXR  WorldView 4 imaging satellite in January  resulting in a  183 million insurance claim 
Last year  space insurance payouts were  600 million  according to Seradata SpaceTrak data  outpacing premiums of around  450 million 
 Space rates could double as a result of this  Vega  failure combined with poor results last year   said one insurer  who said the Vega loss alone was expected to cancel out the whole of 2019 global space premium  with further launch and in orbit risks still remaining for the year 
There were 114 space launches globally in 2018  according to Avio Aero  builder of the European Vega launcher 
Unlike with most car insurance  cover for satellites or rockets is not compulsory  Only 60  of satellites launched in 2017 were insured  according to insurer  Mapfre   MC MAP  
For those who do buy insurance  an all risk policy covers damage of any kind and there is also liability cover available  in case a rocket hits something belonging to someone else 
Space insurance providers include the specialist Lloyd s of London market and insurance heavyweights AIG  N AIG   AXA  PA AXAF  and Allianz  DE ALVG   as well as reinsurers like Munich Re  DE MUVGn  
Munich Re said earlier this month it was one of the insurers of the Vega policy  Aon  N AON  was the broker  two sources told Reuters  Aon declined to comment 
Global Aerospace said it did not insure the Vega launcher 
Prices to insure satellites against damage have fallen by 50  in the past two to three years  one insurer said 
Space insurance premiums have dropped 75  in the past 15 years and 60  in the past 10  said a second insurance source  who expected rates to bounce after the recent losses 
But due to the intense competition in the insurance industry  a rise in premiums is not guaranteed 
David Todd  head of space content at Seradata  said it hinged on whether significant insurance underwriting capacity started to leave the market 
Andreas Berger  a  Swiss Re   S SRENH  board member in charge of the corporate insurance arm  said on Wednesday that the company would be reducing its exposure to the space industry  as part of an overhaul of the loss making division 
Space tourism will add a new dimension as space passengers may also want insurance 
U S  space agency NASA plans to allow private citizens to stay at the International Space Station for month long getaways at a cost of about  35 000 per night  with the first mission as early as 2020 
British billionaire Richard Branson s Virgin Galactic is also competing with Jeff Bezos  Blue Origin in the race for space 
Space travel could straddle both the space and aviation insurance sectors 
 The advent of space tourism represents a completely new area of risk for insurers   Global Aerospace s Brown said ",2019-07-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/space-insurance-costs-to-rocket-after-satellite-crash-1940648,1940648
118244,339759,AON,Brexit insolvency fears boost demand for trade credit insurance,news,"By Carolyn Cohn
LONDON  Reuters    Companies are stepping up purchases of insurance to protect themselves against insolvencies in Britain  industry sources say  in part due to concerns about the impact of Brexit 
The UK economy is feeling the pinch from the political uncertainty  which has hit consumer spending and led to a drop in the value of the pound 
This has contributed to high profile company collapses like that of travel firm Thomas Cook  which also suffered under the weight of its debt pile 
UK insolvencies rose by 12  in the second quarter compared with a year earlier  according to government figures  bringing insolvencies to their highest level in five years 
This has fueled interest in trade credit insurance  Companies buy such insurance if they supply goods or services to other businesses on credit  to protect against the risk they will not get paid  or will be paid very late 
An example could be a Dutch flower seller supplying a British supermarket chain  buying insurance in case of non payment 
 The demand for credit insurance is incredibly high   said Graham Bristow  managing director in credit solutions for insurance broker Aon  NYSE AON   one of the largest firms arranging such deals   There is no doubt Brexit is one theme  people are nervous  
   The insurance broker has seen double digit percentage growth in demand for trade credit insurance compared with 2018  and a similar increase in enquiries on top of that  Bristow added 
Richard Marriage  managing director in trade credit at insurer Nexus  said the firm had seen a 10  rise in enquiries this year  with the prospect of Britain failing to reach a negotiated withdrawal from the European Union   a so called no deal Brexit   one factor in the increased interest 
EU exporters to Britain were interested in the insurance  in addition to UK buyers  Marriage said 
Insurer Atradius has seen a 5 5  rise in its customers this year  and credit periods have shortened in Britain  The demand for quicker payment is another sign of the concern about Brexit  said Stuart Ramsden  Atradius  head of UK   Ireland Commercial 
PREMIUMS RISING
There were 14 000 trade credit policies in place last year  the most since the 2008 financial crisis  the Association of British Insurers said  The number of claims rose 60  from 2017 
Bristow and Marriage said premiums were rising  but declined to give a figure 
Another insurance source said rates were up by single digit percentages  helped by a broader trend for rising insurance premiums  There were double digit price rises in sectors such as retail  the source said 
In addition to sterling s fall  which has pushed up the cost of imports  a switch to online shopping and food delivery and high business rates have brought pain to British retailers such as Debenhams and restaurant owners such as Jamie Oliver 
Agriculture was another area of concern  with Brexit likely to lead to the removal of farming subsidies currently provided by the EU 
 Some politicians have said  we will replace them   but when and how   Bristow asked 
Other industry sources pointed to construction  logistics such as delivery firms  the auto industry and food wholesalers as also at risk 
If there is a no deal Brexit  supply chains are likely to be disrupted  risking more insolvencies  Alexis Garatti  head of macroeconomic research at trade credit insurer Euler Hermes  predicts UK insolvencies could rise by 15  next year under a no deal Brexit  He put the probability of a no deal Brexit at 40  
British insolvencies  seen by Euler Hermes as rising by 11  in 2019  are running ahead of the global average of an 8  increase  Garatti said 
Despite the risk  small businesses find it hard to buy trade credit insurance because of the cost  industry sources say  as they often have to insure the whole of their order book 
Lack of insurance could hit small business growth  according to Nimbla  which insures individual invoices against default 
A survey by Nimbla showed more than half of UK small and medium sized firms turned down new business because they were worried about its credit quality ",2019-10-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/brexit-insolvency-fears-boost-demand-for-trade-credit-insurance-1997152,1997152

118277,339792,AON,U S  insurers seek renewal of federal  backstop  against acts of terrorism,news,"By Suzanne Barlyn  Reuters    U S  insurers are pushing for the extension of a federal terrorism risk insurance program  hoping to fend off a possible gap that would leave their clients scrambling for alternate coverage   The program  which expires at the end of 2020  was created by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act  The law was passed after the attacks of Sept  11  2001  when insurers suffered steep losses and some stopped offering terrorism risk insurance on commercial buildings  The program requires insurers to offer certain types coverage for losses caused by an event that the U S  government has officially designated as terrorism  If losses from an attack exceed a set amount  a federal backstop kicks in to offset insurers  payouts  The program  which has never been triggered  is used by big businesses  owners of sports stadiums and other groups that insure against attacks that are deemed terrorism   A timely renewal of the program is a top priority for the American Property Casualty Insurance Association  the trade group s chief executive officer  David Sampson  said in a recent interview  Sampson also wants Congress to make the program permanent and provide more clarity about coverage for cyber terrorism  But the possibility that U S  lawmakers may not extend the program promptly is already spurring insurers and brokers to discuss alternatives with commercial customers  who are beginning the process of policy renewal for next year   I m not surprised that the industry is already thinking of it   said Howard Mills  global insurance regulatory leader for Deloitte   It has always been a big question for the market because Congress doesn t focus on it until the expiration date is right on top of them   The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act was signed into law by President George W  Bush in November 2002  Congress extended the program in 2005 and has unauthorized it twice since then  MEMORIES OF MADNESS Memories of a brief lapse in the program after 2014  when some conservative lawmakers called for the private sector to pay more terror related losses before federal government funding kicks in  are still fresh to the industry   What we experienced during that two week period was basically insanity   Jennifer Rubin  who heads the terrorism  war  and political violence products line for insurer Hiscox Ltd  said in a recent interview  Hiscox was  deluged  with requests for terrorism policies that were not tied to the federal program  she said  Policies that are not backed by the program  known as standalone coverage  tend to be costlier in high risk areas  such as New York  Washington and San Francisco  insurers and brokers said   But many customers in risky areas prefer them because they have fewer restrictions than the government backed program  which requires a U S  declaration that an international terrorism act took place  they said   GEARING UP Brokers Aon  NYSE AON  Plc and Marsh  a Marsh   McLennan Companies Inc  NYSE MMC  unit  said they have begun telling customers about alternatives to the government backed program  such as a contingency policy that activates if it does not renew on time  Many clients in high risk areas  such as New York  are already looking into buying two year standalone policies  which will insure them through 2021  regardless of what happens with the government program  said Christof Bentele  global head of crisis management  at Allianz  DE ALVG  Global Corporate   Specialty  a unit of Allianz SE  As commercial customers buy up standalone coverage  those who may also need this type of coverage at the last minute   if the government backed program lapses   may not be able to obtain it or may have to pay extra  insurers said   Many insurance professionals believe that a timely renewal is more likely next year than in 2014  They point to the recent takeover of the U S  House of Representatives by Democrats  with some Democrats saying that renewal of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act should be a priority  Also  at least one key Republican  U S  Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho  said on Jan  29 that renewing the terrorism program is a priority  Crapo is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee  Still  the Banking Committee will consider possible changes  such as boosting coinsurance and increasing amounts the U S  government may recoup through policyholder surcharges  Crapo said at the time   As the battle unfolds  some customers that already have the government backed insurance may decide to roll the dice and risk going bare if the program lapses  Bentele said

deal to buy pharmacy benefits manager  PBM  Express Scripts Holding Co  O ESRX  on Thursday  looking for new ways to hold onto their profits as the industry faces greater scrutiny for rising healthcare costs  The pharmacy benefits business  which tries to negotiate down the price of prescription medicines for large employers  has drawn fire from the Trump administration and Congress  who have questioned whether those discounts are really being passed on to consumers  Cigna s deal follows close on the heels of a rival  69 billion merger between CVS Health Corp  N CVS  and health insurer  Aetna Inc   N AET   announced in December  Together  the transactions would represent a massive consolidation of the market for managing employees  prescription drug benefits  prompting some experts to question whether they will be approved   Employers are growing increasingly frustrated with the cost of prescription drugs and a lack of transparency into the economics of how this works   said Jim Winkler  senior vice president for health at benefits manager and broker Aon  part of Aon Plc  N AON   Cigna and Express Scripts say the combination will lower costs for corporate clients by giving them more coordination between medical care and pharmacy benefits  particularly for pricey specialty drugs   Our employer clients will be delighted with that   Cigna Chief Executive David Cordani said in an interview  It could help Cigna more closely manage how costly drugs are prescribed and delivered to patients  and fend off potential competition from new players such as Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN    All told  the companies project  600 million in annual savings   Express Scripts shares were up 8 percent at  79 29 on Thursday afternoon  but they were trading 12 6 percent below the

thirds of the PBM market  a top U S  health official said on Wednesday   Anthem Inc  N ANTM  in October said it would expand its own pharmacy benefits business  and hired CVS to do so   Antitrust experts said the Trump administration would need to review how both deals between Cigna and Express and between CVS and Aetna would affect the U S  market  already the world s most expensive

deals get challenged   In 2016  the Obama administration scuttled two major health insurer mergers   Anthem Inc s purchase of Cigna and Aetna s purchase of rival Humana  NYSE HUM    largely on concerns the consolidation would raise costs for consumers  Today s deals between an insurer and PBM represents a so called vertical integration of players within the health industry  But it could limit the ability of large employers to choose who manages both prescription drug benefits and medical coverage for their employees   This type of merger would create a market straddling giant  with new profit maximizing incentives     ultimately leading to higher costs and potentially poorer coverage and care for consumers   said George Slover  senior policy counsel for Consumers Union  the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports  Most national companies with more than 20 000 employees use different companies to provide prescription drug benefits and medical coverage  Express Scripts CEO Tim

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   Eli Lilly  LLY  and CVS Health  NYSE CVS   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Alphabet s shares have gained  4 8  in the past one year  outperforming the Zacks Internet Services industry s decline of  7 9   Alphabet reported weak revenues in the first quarter due to increasing competition in the advertising business  currency fluctuations and a few changes in YouTube ads  
However  the Zacks analyst thinks strong initiatives toward elimination of bad ads and introducing useful major search updates are acting as tailwinds  Further  Google s robust mobile search is also a major positive  
Additionally  its strong focus toward bolstering presence in the cloud market on the back of expanding data centers and robust cloud offerings continues to aid growth  Google s strong focus on the innovation of its AI techniques and home automation space is aiding its business growth  However  the company s growing litigation issues and increased spending on YouTube and consumer gadgets might hurt its profitability 
 You can   
Shares of Eli Lilly have gained  39 1  in the past year  significantly outperforming the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry  which has gained  6  over the same period  Lilly beat estimates for earnings in the first quarter  However  Lilly lowered its sales guidance for 2019   
The Zacks analyst thinks revenue growth in 2019 will likely be driven by higher demand for its newer drugs including Trulicity  Jardiance  Taltz  Verzenio and new migraine drug  Emgality as some older drugs like Cialis face generic competition  Lilly has made significant pipeline progress in the past year with several positive late stage data readouts  multiple approvals and regulatory submissions  Lilly also added promising new pipeline assets through business development deals  
However  competitive pressure on Lilly s drugs is expected to rise in 2019  Generic competition for several drugs including Cialis  rising pricing pressure  currency headwinds and the impact of the failed Lartruvo study are expected to put pressure on the top line 
 You can   
CVS Health s shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry in the past three months  losing  22 6  versus  24 6   CVS Health ended first quarter 2019 on a promising note with both earnings and revenues trumping expectations  
Year over year growth in the top line was driven by a strong Pharmacy Services segment  benefiting from the upside in the specialty services  The Zacks analyst thinks that although the company is witnessing certain challenges related to 2020 PBM selling season  the long term prospects look bright  This apart  Aetna  NYSE AET  integration synergy looks promising  
Following this  CVS Health introduced a new segment Health Care Benefits which holds immense promise  On the flip side  during the first quarter  persistent reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions dented the company s retail LTC business growth  Also  Omnicare business performance should continue to remain soft through 2019 impacting CVS  pharmacy services arm

118305,339820,AON,Potential global cyber attack could cause  85 billion  193 billion worth of damage  report,news,"By Noor Zainab Hussain and Tanishaa Nadkar
 Reuters    A co ordinated global cyber attack  spread through malicious email  could cause economic damages anywhere between  85 billion and  193 billion  a hypothetical scenario developed as a stress test for risk management showed 
Insurance claims after such an attack would range from business interruption and cyber extortion to incident response costs  the report jointly produced by insurance market Lloyd s of London and Aon  NYSE AON  said on Tuesday 
Total claims paid by the insurance sector in this scenario is estimated to be between  10 billion and  27 billion  based on policy limits ranging from  500 000 to  200 million 
The stark difference between insured and economic loss estimates highlights the extent of underinsurance  in case of such an attack  the stress test showed  An attack could affect several sectors globally  with the largest losses in retail  healthcare  manufacturing and banking fields 
Regional economies that are more service dominated  especially the United States and Europe  would suffer more and are vulnerable to higher direct losses  the report said 
Cyber attacks have been in focus after a virus spread from  Ukraine to wreak havoc around the globe in 2017  crippling thousands of computers  disrupting ports from Mumbai to Los Angeles and even halting production at a chocolate factory in Australia 
Governments are increasingly warning against the risks private businesses face from such attacks  both those carried out by foreign governments and financially motivated criminals 
For example  Britain s National Cyber Security Centre announced on Friday it was investigating a large scale Domain Name System  DNS  hijacking campaign that hit governments and commercial organizations across the world 
In another recent incident  French engineering consultancy Altran Technologies was the target of a cyber attack that hit its operations in some European countries 
On a larger scale  personal data and documents from hundreds of German politicians and public figures  including Chancellor Angela Merkel  were published online in what appears to be one of Germany s most far reaching data breaches

118313,339828,AON,Insurance Brokerage Stock Outlook  Few Bumps In The Offing,opinion,The Zacks  industry comprises companies that primarily offer insurance and reinsurance products and services  Here the insurance brokers act on behalf of their clients and offer advice keeping in mind the clients  interests  Some of these companies are also involved in providing risk management  third party administration and managed health care services Here are the industry s three major themes Given an improving economy  strong customer retention and increase in insured exposure have been fueling revenue growth for the insurance brokers  Moreover  income is generated through commissions earned on policies sold  This in turn  leads to higher revenues as policy prices rise and volumes increase  Further  pertaining to some players  this trend is being supported by a steady diversification of operations through mergers and acquisitions  Also  with the market getting stronger on buoyant economic conditions  insurance brokers are capitalizing on their investments and generating better commissions and profits  As the business environment is becoming more dynamic and complex  the need for insurance brokerage services is growing convincingly  Additionally  utilization of data and analytics has strengthened the insurance brokers  capabilities to cater to the increasing need for sophisticated risk management services  While investments in technology and analytics should help insurance brokers generate solid revenues in the future  the expenses associated with such investments have kept operating costs elevated for a considerable period of time  Also  the inorganic growth initiatives have been inducing higher debt levels for many players  As a result  interest expenses are expected to remain escalated Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Cloudy ProspectsThe Zacks Insurance   Brokerage industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  188

research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group s

118314,339829,AON,4 Insurance Stocks That Have Crushed The S P 500 Year To Date ,opinion,The S P 500 has performed well so far this year after a disappointing 2018  The benchmark index has gained 14 9  year to date having lost 6 2  in 2018  The easing of tensions between the United States and China on optimism regarding US China trade negotiations  decline in weekly jobless claims to a 50 year low and strong manufacturing data likely drove the index on the growth path The U S  labor market continues to gain momentum  signaling a stable economy   However  at its Mar 20  2019 FOMC meeting  the Fed announced that short term interest rates will remain unchanged this year  implying that GDP growth might slow down to 2 1   Nonetheless  factors like low unemployment rate  estimated at 3 7  in

118316,339831,AON,Aon  AON  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Aon  AON  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 26  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurance brokerage is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 31 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 5  
Revenues are expected to be  3 21 billion  up 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 09  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Aon 
For Aon  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 16  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Aon will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Aon would post earnings of  2 13 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 16  delivering a surprise of  1 41  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

118347,339862,AON,Earnings Preview  Aon  AON  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Aon  AON  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 1  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurance brokerage is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 13 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 4  
Revenues are expected to be  2 83 billion  down 2 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Aon 
For Aon  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 39  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Aon will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Aon would post earnings of  1 23 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 31  delivering a surprise of  6 50  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

118348,339863,AON,AON  CI Q4 Earnings Due On Feb 1  Here Are Key Predictions,opinion,In the fourth quarter of 2018  sustained economic growth  high interest rates  higher premiums and rising investment income are some of the positive factors that will bolster growth for the insurance industry  setting the stage for better top line and bottom line growth Apart from the aforementioned factors  capital deployment through share repurchase by the insurance players should provide an extra cushion to the bottom lines So  here are a few major factors that influenced the insurance industry of late A Better Economy A thriving global economic scenario  backed by solid customer retention  constant mergers and acquisitions and rising insured exposure  continues to be one of the primary drivers behind this industry s growth  A strengthening economy in fourth quarter 2018  banking on low unemployment level  improving wages and a growing GDP should drive demand for coverages from these companies Increase in Interest Rates to Aid Investment IncomeNet investment income contributes to a lion s share of insurers  revenues  which in turn  is dependent on federal interest rates The Central Bank made four rate hikes in 2018  reflecting economic progress  a strong labor market and 2  inflation as targeted by the Fed  With the one quarter percentage point raise at the December FOMC meeting  the interest rate now stands at 2 50  Given a rising rate environment  insurers  investment income should gain from higher investment yields Data and AnalyticsThe use of data and analytics plus investment in technology is allowing the industry players to serve the growing customer needs  Adoption of advanced technology such as AI  artificial intelligence   robotic process automation  cognitive intelligence or blockchain and cloud computing has reshaped the way insurers do business and cater to the evolving customer expectations via a data driven approach that gives them a better understanding of the customer mindset The capabilities have provided them with a more customer centric approach and also helped them differentiate themselves in the market  In the fourth quarter  the companies are likely to have enjoyed higher premiums owing to heavy investments in the technological platform  which increase operating efficiency Elevated CostsAlthough investment in technology has helped insurers generate robust revenues and live up to evolving customer demand  the related expenses have kept the operating costs exorbitant for quite some time  Also  many players are suffering due to high debt levels on account of their inorganic growth initiatives  Thus  interest expenses are expected to remain high as of now Pricing Rise in premium rates should aid insurer s top line  Per InsuranceNewsNet findings  Commercial insurance  accounting for about half of U S  property casualty insurance industry premium  prices in the United States inched up nearly 2  year over year during the fourth quarter of 2018  This marked the fourth consecutive quarter of price hike  Per the statistics  all business lines  other than Workers  Compensation  saw a price increase in the range of 1 3   Workers  Compensation slid 1 5  in the fourth quarter Another major insurance line  the Personal Lines  witnessed average increase of 2 25  in the fourth quarter of 2018  Among the sub business lines  Homeowners rates in fourth quarter 2018 are stable at plus 3  for homes under  1 000 000 and at plus 2  for homes above  1 000 000  Automobile rates were down slightly while  personal articles rates were marginally up  both moving 0 5  Catastrophe Loss to Drain Underwriting ProfitabilityThe insurance industry s exposure to catastrophe events is anticipated to have affected the margins in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to California wildfires  Also  Hurricane Michael is expected to take a toll on insurers  fourth quarter profits  Per a report published in Insurance Journal on Dec 12  2018  insured losses from the California wildfire came in at  9 05 billion while catastrophe modeler CoreLogic estimated total losses resulting from the wildfires in Northern and Southern  NYSE SO  California between  15 billion and  19 billion  Going by the reports of Florida Office of Insurance Regulation  Hurricane Michael is forecast to cause about  4 3 billion insured loss Now let s take a look at how the following insurance players are placed before fourth quarter earnings release on Feb 1 Aon plc   NYSE AON   is likely to have suffered from escalated expenses due to organic and inorganic investments in the fourth quarter  The company is likely to endure a high financial leverage  which has been rising since 2014 due to a high commercial paper outstanding  The Reinsurance segment s revenues are also likely to decline as even the metric s Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a 57  year over year plunge Nevertheless  the company s constant efforts for strategic investments in expand its portfolio along with productivity improvement measures are expected to contribute to its revenues  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter total revenues stands at  2830 million  down 2 7  year over year Moreover  owing to Aon s consistent investments in data and analytics  we expect revenues from Data   Analytics services to be around  311 million  up 4 4  from the year ago quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Commercial Risk Solutions segment s revenues for the fourth quarter also indicates a rise of 7 2  from the prior year level  This is likely to be supported by growth across major geographies and management of renewal book portfolio along with double digit growth in the United States and Latin America Though Aon carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

What s Next for Aon

118365,339880,AON,Reinsurers flock to Monte Carlo as market storm brews,news,"By Jonathan Gould MONACO  Reuters    For a financial sector posting a double digit rise in earnings and boasting large cash piles  reinsurers sure see a lot of storm clouds on the horizon 
That s because they are facing what many see as an unprecedented problem  an abundance of reinsurance supply coupled with a lack of demand from insurance company clients that is driving up competition among reinsurers and driving down prices for all of them 
The gloomy outlook has pressured the share prices of the world s top reinsurers this year and the frustration of normally staid industry executives   who gather this weekend at the Mediterranean resort of Monte Carlo for their annual jamboree   is palpable 
 I am disappointed  exasperated  and even rather appalled by what is happening in the market   said Nikolaus von Bomhard  chief executive of the world s biggest reinsurer  Munich Re 
 I ve been in the business long enough to be able to say  this is bad news   he told a news conference last month 
Looking at reinsurers  current profits  things might seem fine 
The world s 31 top reinsurers   whose business is to help insurers pay big damage claims for disasters like hurricanes or earthquakes in exchange for part of the premium   posted a 12 percent rise in net income to  14 billion in the first six months of this year  compared with the same period last year  according to insurance broker Aon Benfield 
Unusually low payouts for natural catastrophes in recent years have also bolstered the bottom line  contributing to a rise in the amount of capital available for reinsurers to act as insurance companies to insurance companies   which Aon Benfield said increased by 6 percent to  570 billion at the end of June from the end of December 
On top of the big cash piles held by reinsurers such as Munich Re  Swiss Re and Hannover Re  outsiders have also been muscling in 
Capital market investors such as pension  hedge and sovereign wealth funds as well as wealthy individuals  looking for higher returns than they can find on government or corporate bonds  have been pouring money into the reinsurance market via specialized investment vehicles 
PRICE WAR
As if that were not enough  insurers like Allianz  Axa and Zurich are feeling financially stronger and more capable of retaining risk  prompting them to cut back on the amount of reinsurance protection they buy 
With the market shrinking  many reinsurers have been forced into successive rounds of price cuts or have granted improved terms and conditions to their customers to protect market share 
Credit rating agency Standard   Poor s sees prices on average down by 5 10 percent this year and next  with smaller and non diversified reinsurers having the toughest time 
 Those who aren t able to defend their competitive positions and their bottom lines could struggle to survive   said S P analyst Dennis Sugrue 
Consolidation among smaller players has long been predicted but little has come to pass so far  Market observers predict the internecine price war is unlikely to come to an end any time soon and share prices will remain under pressure 
The STOXX Europe 600 insurance index  which includes insurers and reinsurers  has risen by 4 8 percent since January   however this has been driven by insurers  with many reinsurers having lost ground 
Munich Re s shares have fallen by 2 4 percent and No 2 player Swiss Re s by 1 2 percent  French reinsurer Scor is down nearly 10 percent so far this year 
Faced with a difficult reinsurance market  big reinsurers are choosing to boost dividends and buy back their own shares  a move that credit rating agencies say makes sense 
 Returning capital to shareholders reduces the pressure to do something that has higher risk   said Moody s analyst Stan Rouyer 

 This is the right time to return capital to shareholders

118367,339882,AON,Exclusive  Analysis suggests Anthem deal could raise health costs,news,"By Caroline Humer and Diane Bartz NEW YORK WASHINGTON  Reuters    As questions mount over whether health insurer Anthem Inc s  N ANTM  proposed  48 billion purchase of  Cigna Corp   N CI  will win U S  antitrust approval  an exclusive analysis produced for Reuters suggests the merger could lead to higher costs for large companies offering workplace medical benefits  More than 154 million people receive health benefits through employers  many of them large national corporations  The large employer market is a top concern for U S  Department of Justice regulators reviewing the Anthem deal  company officials say  The government could block a deal if it finds evidence it would drive up the cost of such coverage  Anthem and Cigna  the nation s No  2 and No  5 health insurers  are among a handful of carriers selling national coverage plans to employers with thousands of workers across many states  Anthem has said the added heft will work for employers  not against them  A bigger Anthem  it emphasizes  could drive better deals from doctors and hospitals and pass savings onto these customers  In addition  Anthem has argued that there still will be plenty of competition  large employers pit smaller  local insurers  bids against those of large national carriers in regional markets  Anthem officials told an investor conference last month that many employers include health plans from several smaller insurers to cover far flung employees   But an Aon Hewitt analysis of benefits data for Reuters found that a majority of large employers buy worker health benefits from just one or two insurers  Among 75 companies representing a cross section of industries  54 percent used a single insurer and 26 percent used two  the analysis found  Aon Hewitt  a unit of Aon Plc  N AON  which helps employers select their benefit plans  based its analysis on data from over 400 customers that participate in healthcare cost research   The companies cited in the analysis for Reuters are all self insured and have more than 10 000 employees  It is not known how the Justice Department will define the large employer market  Spokeswoman Maurissa Kanter said Aon Hewitt did not conclude  whether or not carrier consolidation would be a competitive issue that could lead to higher prices for employers   She also said that the data did not  support an argument for or against market consolidation   Several human resources directors from large corporations also told Reuters they review potential benefits contracts from only the biggest insurers  rather than regional players  UnitedHealth Group  N UNH   Anthem   Aetna Inc   N AET  and Cigna are the only national players in the employer health insurance market   It is less efficient for companies to hire multiple regional insurers  and the merger could allow the few remaining national insurers to raise their rates  said Peter Carstensen  an antitrust expert and professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin Law School    The Aon Hewitt data on its face is bad for the deal and hurts their chances of getting approval   Carstensen said   A Justice Department official declined to comment on its review of the deal  It is also considering Aetna s proposed  34 billion purchase of  Humana Inc   N HUM    If both acquisitions were approved  it would result in an unprecedented consolidation of the top insurers  from five to three  Thomson Reuters Corp has benefits contracts with Cigna and Aetna  A company spokesman declined to comment on the merger  LOWER ODDS OF A DEAL  Anthem has said that buying Cigna would help it drive deeper discounts from hospitals and doctors  holding down the price of medical coverage    What the Department of Justice will see is that we are going to bring a better focus on managing the cost of care   Anthem Chief Executive Joseph Swedish told an investor conference last month   But at least some large U S  employers fear they will face higher prices if the deal goes through  according to Wall Street analysts  Concerned employers include Detroit automakers  according to a person familiar with the industry s position  Other employers found merit in Anthem s assertion that the deal could benefit customers by eliminating overhead   There is some chance that consolidation could lower some of those costs   said Michael D Ambrose  chief human resources officer for Archer Daniels Midland Co  N ADM   which buys coverage from Anthem and other Blue Cross Blue Shield plans   The deal has raised opposition from leading medical groups  California s insurance commissioner and Democratic lawmakers   Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte recently lowered the odds

   Factors to Be Considered This Quarter
We expect organic revenue growth in every major revenue line  including double digit growth in Data and Analytic Services  Operating margin should benefit from core operational improvement and savings from investments in its Aon United operating model

Aon has invested capital in numerous strategic initiatives to boost the performance of its Risk Solution segment  The segment is likely to perform well in the first quarter on the back of these investments 
We expect a favorable impact from foreign currency translation due primarily to a weaker U S  dollar  in the first quarter 
We expect that U S  tax reform to feel a modest upward pressure on the effective tax rate 
Debt to EBIDTA  which was 3 2 at the end of Dec 31  2017  will be elevated in the first quarter as a result of the same of outsourcing business 
The company is committed toward enhancing shareholders  value  Its share repurchase programs might favor the margin by limiting the outstanding share count

118464,339979,AON,Insurance Stocks  Aug 4 Q2 Earnings Roster  BRK B  CI  AON,opinion,The second quarter earnings season is at its high with 70  members of the elite S P 500 Index having reported solid quarterly numbers so far  Per the latest   the performance of 350 index members  accounting for 79 3  of the index s total market capitalization   having already reported their financial numbers this quarter  indicates that total earnings have increased 11  on 5 9  higher revenues  The beat ratio is impressive with 74  companies surpassing the bottom line expectations and 16   outperforming the top line The Finance sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  has delivered a strong performance till now  About 83 3  companies on the S P 500 Index  accounting for 77 7  of the index s total market capitalization  that have reported quarterly results  shows 7 1  earnings growth on 4 8  increase in revenues  both on a year over year basis  The beat ratio of 80 0  for the bottom line compared favorably with that of the S P 500  However  the beat ratio of 66 3  for the top line is lower than the same of S P 500   The second quarter witnessed several catastrophe losses  likely to weigh on underwriting results as well as the bottom line of insurers  Per Aon Benfield  the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc   NYSE AON    the estimated amount of catastrophe losses suffered globally is  53 billion in the first half of 2017  A few insurers have incurred losses due to severe wind and hail catastrophe events  happened in during April May in the U S  Nonetheless  prudent underwriting standards should have helped the insurers guard against capital reserve erosion  preserved on a benign catastrophe environment  Net investment income  a major component of an insurer s top line  has witnessed improvement  albeit far lower than the historical highs  The Federal Reserve has been increasing the interest rates  reflecting confidence in the developing economic conditions  In fact  the Fed has raised interest rates thrice in three quarters  A better rate environment not only increased net investment income but has also improved investment yields Higher rates should offer some respite to the life insurers which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistent low rates  Annuity sales should have also gained from higher rates  However  life insurers have considerably cut their exposure to interest sensitive product lines Notably  an improving economy means more disposable income and a better consumer sentiment  This in turn might have also boosted more policy writings  driving the premiums higher to generate a lion s share to an insurers  top line  Besides  core business growth  geographic expansion  strategic buyouts and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase have probably lifted the insurers On the flip side  we do not expect pricings to have been strong  To write new business and retain renewals  insurers have been curbing the pricing pressure  Commercial property  workers  compensation and general liability were mostly experiencing this soft pricing Let s find out where the following insurers stand before their release of quarterly numbers on Aug 4 Berkshire Hathaway Inc   is a conglomerate providing insurance and reinsurance  Besides  it operates railroad systems  generates  transmits and distributes electricity  plus regulates natural gas distribution and storage facilities among others   Last quarter  Berkshire missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15 79   The company s Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and an  of 0 00  leave our earnings surprise prediction inconclusive  Both the Most Accurate estimate as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at  1 85  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  We caution against the Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into an earnings announcement Berkshire Hathaway is likely to report higher catastrophe losses in the soon to be reported quarter  which in turn will render volatility to earnings  It has also likely experienced a decline in operating earnings across Insurance Operations and Finance   Financial products segments  However  the company s Railroad  Utilities and Energy units have likely witnessed a rise in operating revenues   Read   With respect to the surprise trend  Berkshire beat estimates in two of the last four quarters but with an average negative surprise of 3 12  Berkshire Hathaway Inc   NYSE BRKa  Price and EPS Surprise   Cigna Corp    NYSE CI   provides health care and related benefits  the majority of which are offered through workplace  Last quarter  Cigna beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13 52   The company s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  with an Earnings ESP of  1 61  makes us confident about an earnings surprise this quarter  The Most Accurate estimate is pegged at  2 52 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at  2 48 per share Per our proven model  a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2 or at least 3  Hold  for an earnings beat  You can see  Cigna s upcoming results are expected to demonstrate its continued strong operating performance from the Global Supplemental Benefits business  Strong management of fee for service expenses will keep the medical costs at bay  Group Disability and Life segment  premiums and fees are expected to grow on the back of modifications in the claims process made last year   Read   With respect to the surprise trend  Cigna surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 1 35  Cigna Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Aon Corp   AON  offers risk management services  insurance and reinsurance brokerage  human resource consulting as well as outsourcing services worldwide  Last quarter  Aon beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13 28   The company carries a Zacks Rank  3  which although increases the predictive power of ESP  its Earnings ESP of 0 00  however  makes our earnings surprise prediction difficult  Both the Most Accurate estimate as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at  1 45 per share On the back of proactive client partnerships  Aon is likely to increase retention rates  boosting global revenues in turn  Aon s strategic investments to strengthen underlying performance and numerous initiatives to maximize return on invested capital are expected to boost its Risk Solution segment  Share buybacks are likely to have boosted the bottom line  However  rising operating expenses and pricing pressures in various countries across Europe and Asia might weigh on the upside   Read   With respect to the surprise trend  Aon outpaced

118468,339983,AON,Willis Towers Watson Insiders Sell  406 Million,opinion,"Jeffrey W Ubben  a board member of Willis Towers Watson PLC  NASDAQ WLTW   sold  shares of the company worth a total of  46 3 million on Monday  August 28th  Mr  Ubben has served as a Director of Willis Towers Watson since January 4  2016  He is the Founder  CEO and Chief Investment Officer of ValueAct Capital  Through ValueAct  Ubben continues to hold 4 227 358 shares of Willis Towers Watson which is worth approximately  625 million 
According to   Mr  Ubben has sold roughly  400 million worth of Willis Towers Watson stock in the month of August alone  roughly 2  of the company s market capitalization  
The company s shares last traded at  147 87 as of Tuesday  August 29  approximately 97 7  of its 52 week high  While the stock is up 22  year to date  Mr  Ubben appears to be taking some chips off the table  Could the recent insider transactions signal a troubling road ahead for shareholders 
Willis Towers Watson operates as an advisory  broking  and solutions company worldwide  The company was formerly known as Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company and changed its name to Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company in January 2016  right when Mr  Ubben of ValueAct joined the board of directors 
Analysts covering the stock often compare the company to a peer group that includes Aon plc  NYSE  NYSE AON   Arthur J Gallagher  NYSE AJG   Marsh   McLennan Companies   NYSE  NYSE MMC  and CNA Financial Corporation  NYSE CNA   Analyzing Willis Towers Watson s valuation metrics and ratios provides further insight into why insiders may be selling their shares 
Potential Reasons For Insider Selling
We define fundamental metrics and present charts below that may help explain why insiders are selling their shares 
Return on Equity  ROE  measures a company s profitability in relation to the book value of Shareholders  Equity  ROE is a measure of how effectively management makes investments to generate earnings for shareholders  It s calculated as Net Income   Average Total Equity  Willis Towers Watson s ROE of 4 5  is below all of its selected comparable public companies  AON  32 9    AJG  11 8    MMC  27 4   and CNA  9 3   
Furthermore  Return on Invested Capital  ROIC  is used to evaluate the ability of a company to create value for all its stakeholders  debt and equity  It is calculated as NOPAT   Average Invested Capital where NOPAT is defined as Net Operating Profit After Tax  Notice in the above chart the company s ROIC of 2 8  is also well below all of its peers  AON  7 0    AJG  4 4    MMC  14 0   and CNA  6 9   
Net Profit Margin is defined as Net Income   Total Revenue  All else equal  companies with higher profit margins command higher valuation multiples  However  Willis Towers Watson s net profit margin of 6 1  is below its entire peer group but its P E multiple of 40 9x trades above this same peer group as illustrated below 
Although the company s stock is up 22  year to date  shares are up only up 25  since August 2014  Additionally  the stock has hovered around the  145  150 range over the last three months  Insiders may be trying to take some chips off the table while fundamentals appear stretched and the stock remains in a holding pattern 
The fundamental charts above indicate that the company s stock may be trading at a premium and helps explain why insiders have been selling shares  Value investors long Willis Towers Watson may want to re evaluate their positions ",2017-08-30,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/willis-towers-watson-insiders-sell-406-million-200210403,200210403

118633,340148,AON,The Right Stocks For Today s Market,opinion,Another week  another rally  The market began the current trading week on a high note once again  and it seems as if this bull just can t be stopped  The S P 500 has moved higher in 13 out of the last 15 weeks  and the current week looks like it will extend that streak  Yet with that index now firmly ensconced above the 1 400 mark  the bull and bear cases are beginning to sharpen  The bullish case On the bullish side  money is pouring into the market at a fevered clip as formerly bearish hedge funds shift their bias to bullishness  Individual investors are playing their part as well  The weekly sentiment snapshot conducted by the American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  shows bullish investors holding a 13 percentage point lead over bearish investors  To be sure  stock prices are simply a function of supply and demand  and demand is quite strong right now  The bearish case The bearish side also has some merit  Economists express concern that the recent run of positive economic data may have run its course and fear the U S  economy will cool in coming months  This is precisely the scenario that played out in 2011  as a strong start to the year met with a cooling off period in the spring that led to a market rout in the summer  Technical analysts also talk of an over bought market right now  and a number of measures suggest we re due for a pullback    For now  investor enthusiasm is the overarching theme  though who knows how long that will last  What is known  a certain group of stocks should benefit from a rising market  while also offering much more robust downside protection    I m talking about low beta stocks  Beta measures how a stock moves in relation to the broader market  and those with a beta of less than 1 0 means that they are fairly decoupled from the broader market   My colleague Tim Begany recently touched on this theme  You can read his take on the best stock to own for a correction      I went searching among stocks in the S P 500  large cap stocks  and S P 400  mid cap stocks   and found 38 of them to have a beta below 1 0 and also have a price to earnings  P E  ratio below 12  Even if the economy slows and earnings growth becomes a real challenge  these low priced stocks won t get penalized for their valuations    Below is a table of 20 stocks that sport a beta of less than 0 7   Here s what this list is telling me      1  Remember Wal Mart     A low beta doesn t mean a stock won t budge  Shares of Wal Mart  NYSE  WMT   which sport a beta of just 0 34  have still managed to rise more than 20  since bottoming out last summer  That s due to slightly better operating trends  especially in the retailer s grocery division  2  Health care is seemingly safe A number of drug and medical device companies are in this group  Companies such as Abbott Labs  NYSE  ABT   Watson Pharmaceuticals  NYSE  WPI   Amgen  Nasdaq  AMGN   Gilead Sciences  Nasdaq  GILD  and Baxter International  NYSE  BAX  all have a beta below 0 5  largely due to the fact that they have a high degree of recurring revenue and rarely tend to deliver quarterly results far from the consensus forecasts  They all trade for around 10 times earnings  which is well below the broader market s multiple  which is closer to 15    3  Steer clear of defense and for profit education The list of low beta stocks also carries a lot of defense sector and for profit education stocks  Each of these groups faces real headwinds and may see limited  or even negative  sales growth in coming years  In this instance  the low beta tells you that these stocks are likely dead money    at best    4  The winners So what s left  You ll note a handful of insurers on the list  including Chubb  NYSE  CB   Hanover Insurance  NYSE  THG   Aon Corp   NYSE  AON  and Travelers  NYSE  TRV   These could all prove to have solid upside if the economy gets much better  as pricing becomes less competitive in this business when an economy expands  Their low betas mean these insurers are unlikely to fall much if the economy slips backward  either    Perhaps my favorite name on this table is Archer Daniels Midland  NYSE  ADM   which may soon come out of a multi year phase of operational challenges  Many of this agricultural processor s divisions have been caught on the wrong end of the cycle  crushing profit margins in the process  The company s EBITDA margins have fallen 200 basis points in the past six years to just 4 5  in fiscal  June  2011  Yet analysts at Citigroup think the company     is in store for sequentially improving profits across the majority of its businesses over the coming quarters  with the exception of ethanol   They see earnings per share rising from  2 60 in fiscal 2012 to  3 25 in fiscal 2013 and  3 50 in fiscal 2014    Shares of ADM have hovered right around the  30 mark during the past three years  but that earnings strength could finally move the stock up toward the  40 mark    I also think investors continue to overlook a solid current turnaround that is underway at tax prep firm H R Block  NYSE  HRB   I am not expecting an overly robust tax season for the company  but I think the company s long term strategy should yield solid benefits   Risks to Consider  A low beta wouldn t necessarily keep these stocks from falling in a down market  If that happens  then you d likely need to focus on negative beta stocks that move in the opposite direction of the market    The rising market doesn t mean you should sell your stocks  But replacing high beta stocks in your portfolio with low beta stocks should provide a buffer of comfort if the market turns choppy  Any of the stocks I mentioned above are a good place to start looking

118634,340149,AON,Insurance Stocks Running Out of Steam,opinion,"The U S  insurance industry is running out of steam  with companies that have reported Q1 earnings so far showing a year over year slowdown  The insurers that are yet to report are unlikely to change the picture as the industry apprehends an 11 8  earnings decline  Moreover  the pace of premium rate increase  though not dramatic  has stalled thanks to the continued low interest rate environment  Fundamental challenges such as weak underwriting gains and low investment yields also stand out  While loss of earnings momentum can be short lived  a respite from the underlying weakness is not expected before long  Earnings growth would also be stalled by heightened market competition    The ongoing reserve development brings some relief  Also  increasing demand from economically recuperating American households should keep the endeavor to reach a favorable pricing cycle alive  A lot depends on catastrophe losses too  The forecast of a below average 2014 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to keep catastrophe losses modest similar to last year  This should lead to further recovery in underwriting and a lower combined ratio this year  Looking at broader trends  the overall health of the industry improved to a great extent in the recent past riding on improved macroeconomic trends  after enduring pricing pressures and reduced insured exposure since the latest recession  Moreover  learning from past experiences  insurers are now resorting to expense saving measures  If insurers manage to overcome the short term resistance that may be holding back premium rate increase  they should ultimately witness margin expansion and mitigate the adversities of the still low interest rate environment to their investment income  Also  insurers now have ample capital to take on new challenges and increasing awareness on the risk of catastrophe  That said  though the market condition isn t soft anymore  reasonable hardening is not expected at least in the near term  Moreover  stress on balance sheet  lack of real employment growth and legislative challenges are threatening insurers  ability to rebound to the historical growth rate  Also  limited organic growth opportunities and more capital for regulatory requirement will push the industry toward consolidation  Insurers are seeking structural economies of scale through mergers and acquisitions for a bigger share of the market  While this will help insurers stay afloat  inter segment competition will alleviate  So increasing profitability after complying with regulatory requirements would be quite a tall order Zacks Industry Rank Within the Zacks Industry classification  insurers are broadly grouped in the Finance sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors  and are further sub divided into five industries at the expanded level  Insurance   Property   Casualty  P C   Insurance   Multiline  Insurance   Accident   Health  Insurance   Life and Insurance   Brokers  The level of sensitivity and exposure to different stages of the economic cycle vary for each industry  We rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry 
As a guideline  the outlook for industries with Zacks Industry Rank  88 and lower is  Positive   between  89 and  176 is  Neutral  and  177 and higher is  Negative   The Zacks Industry Rank for Insurance   Property   Casualty is  31  Insurance   Accident   Health and Insurance   Life is  105  Insurance   Multiline is  150 and Insurance   Brokers is  168  Looking at the Zacks Industry Rank of the five insurance industries  it can be safely said that the near term outlook for the group is  Neutral  Earnings Trends So far 54 5  companies in the Insurance industry  which is the medium level  or M level  component of the broader Finance sector  have reported Q1 results  The earnings beat ratio  percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises  is 75 0   while the revenue beat ratio stands at 50 0   The broader Finance sector looks downbeat in terms of growth  So far  68 4  of the sector participants have reported Q1 results  with decent beat ratios but disappointing earnings and revenue growth rates  While the earnings beat ratio came in at 66 7   the sector is expected to witness an earnings decline of 7 0  year over year compared with growth of 18 4  in the prior quarter  However  the sector is expected to register full year earnings growth of 3 6   Revenues are also expected to decline 3 6  compared with a marginal fall of 0 6  in the prior quarter 
Modest Growth Ahead for Life Insurers Life insurers managed to increase net income in the last few quarters by trimming underwriting expenses and with the help of a modest increase in premiums  But downward pressure on investment yields due to higher hedging costs  lower income from the variable annuity business and more burdensome capital requirements will continue to mar profitability  Moreover  life insurers have been struggling with low interest rates for years  as these primarily invest in long term interest earnings assets which were not able to generate sufficient returns to match their future commitments related to the policies sold to various individuals  Until the interest rate environment reverses  life insurers will have to continue to seek alternative asset classes to optimize return from investments  But the addition of any risky asset class in their investment portfolios with hopes of better yield may result in further losses  However  continued tapering of fiscal stimulus raises the hope for rate increase  which should significantly benefit life insurers  In a higher rate environment  cash inflows of life insurers will lead to higher returns and increased profit margins  The industry s statutory capital level improved significantly in the last few quarters  with the help of steady retained earnings and effective capital management  A beefed up capital market should keep the industry s liquidity profile strong in the upcoming quarters and help industry participants confront challenges  Moreover  continued economic recovery and higher disposable income will help life insurers broaden their customer base  Also  the carriers are transforming their products and businesses to make them attractive and profitable for customers Growth Momentum Continues for P C Insurers P C Insurers have been witnessing improvement across most segments in recent quarters  However  market hardening  which is the key to improvement  appears to have slowed again  After struggling with falling prices for years  the industry witnessed better premium rates in 2013  but lack of improvement in the interest rate environment is again restricting the improvement  Moreover  the carriers are still feeling the pressure on their investment portfolios due to the overall low interest rate environment  On the other hand  concerns related to weak capital levels are now things of the past  as the industry s capital position has been building up on the back of better than before earnings  While a pause in improving pricing power and continued pressure on investment income are concerns  capital strength and stronger preparation to withstand catastrophe related losses should prompt decent results from P C insurers in the upcoming quarters  As property casualty insurers hold about two thirds of the invested assets in the form of bonds  their capacity is highly sensitive to changes in credit market conditions  With credit and equity markets showing improvement  insurers are likely to incur lesser realized and unrealized capital losses on their portfolios in the quarters ahead          Moreover  insurance volume is expected to expand going forward on speedier economic recovery  With improved employment in the private sector and recovery  though uneven  in the housing markets  a number of carriers have seen growth in insurance sales in the recent quarters  Further  the recent quarters have seen a rebound in claims paying capacity  as measured by policyholders  surpluses   which reflects the industry s resilience  Conservative investment strategies and capital restructuring efforts will continue to help property casualty insurers improve their financial footing in the upcoming quarters  Most importantly  proactive steps on transformational measures  including adoption of technology solutions  will give a competitive advantage  Also  in order to meet evolving consumer demands  insurers must innovate OPPORTUNITIES The industry has been undertaking several structural changes that will make underwriting and pricing schemes even more attractive to consumers  Also  improving fundamentals on the back of favorable macroeconomic trends make the stocks of a number of industry participants appear attractive  We remain positive on Allied World Assurance Co   NYSE AWH   Aspen Insurance Holdings Ltd   NYSE AHL   Atlas Financial Holdings  Inc   NASDAQ AFH   W R  Berkley Corporation  NYSE WRB   AEGON N V   NYSE AEG   Horace Mann Educators Corp   NYSE HMN   Prudential plc  NYSE PUK  and Symetra

continued pressure on investment yield and lower income from the variable annuity business to restrict the earnings growth rate of life insurers at least in the near term  Also  pressure on
