170140,391656,CRM,4 Reasons Why Salesforce Could Acquire Zuora,news,"It is no secret that salesforce com  NYSE CRM  is an acquisitive company  While there is much speculation on what companies and services Salesforce might acquire next  there are at least four reasons to believe that Zuora  NYSE ZUO  should be on the shortlist of targets 
1  Salesforce s CEO is already a large Zuora shareholder
One of the strongest arguments that Salesforce could be interested in acquiring Zuora is that there is already a strong connection between the two companies  Zuora s founder and CEO  Tien Tzuo  was employee No  11 at Salesforce and spent nine years at the company  eventually rising to the role of Chief Strategy Officer  
When Tien Tzuo was ready to start his own company  Salesforce s CEO Mark Benioff gave Tzuo his blessing  Benioff personally invested in a  6 5 million  A  round of funding for Zuora pre IPO as a sign of good faith  That investment paid off for Benioff in a big way  Today  Marc Benioff s undisclosed initial investment is worth more than  40 million  making him one of Zuora s top 10 shareholders with 2 7  of the total shares outstanding  

Granted  Mark Benioff s personal investment is not the same thing as Salesforce itself owning a piece of Zuora  However  Benioff is the chief decisionmaker when it comes to making acquisitions for Salesforce  The fact that Benioff is well aware of Zuora and believes in the company enough to invest in it could lead to a discussion of an acquisition down the road 
2  Zuora would extend Salesforce s enterprise cloud software services
Taking a step back  it helps to explain what Zuora s software product does to better understand why it could be a good fit for Salesforce 
Zuora is an enterprise software platform that helps subscription based companies manage and bill their clients  For example  an online video streaming company could theoretically use Zuora s platform to keep track of subscribers and handle billing so that the streaming company can focus on delivering the product  effectively outsourcing some back office functions  
Zuora s product addresses a market need that was not being met by pre existing enterprise resource or customer relationship software  such as Salesforce  In fact  Mr  Tzuo got the idea to start Zuora after asking Salesforce customers what problems they still needed help with  The company was able to find product market fit and has quickly grown its client base 

ZUO Revenue  Annual  data by YCharts
Salesforce is currently not addressing the market for billing software or subscription management  therefore  acquiring Zuora s product suite would be highly complementary  Acquiring a fast growing company like Zuora would also boost Salesforce s overall growth rate 
3  Zuora s product natively works within Salesforce s software
As a result of the connection between Zuora s founder and Salesforce  the company made sure its product was compatible with Salesforce s software  But Zuora is more than just compatible with Salesforce  it was built specifically to work in coordination with Salesforce s customer relationship management  CRM  system to beef up what clients can do with their customer data if they use both Zuora and Salesforce 
In fact  Zuora has heavily noted its synergy with Salesforce software in its marketing materials  Zuora has noted that its unique ability to run natively in salesforce com s application does a better job of weaving together functionality and leveraging a company s CRM data 
Close product alignment is another critical factor that could make Zuora an attractive acquisition target for Salesforce 
4  Zuora s stock is on sale
Despite Zuora s interesting set of products and fast revenue growth rate  the company s stock price hasn t performed well since its 2018 IPO  Zuora went public in April 2018 at  14 per share  The stock initially moved higher  but has struggled over the last year as investors have discarded the stocks of many recent tech IPOs 

ZUO data by YCharts
Salesforce may want to jump on the opportunity to acquire Zuora  given its depressed share price 
Very possible but not guaranteed
Obviously  it is extremely difficult  if not impossible  to predict which companies will be acquired  However  there are some good reasons to think that Zuora could make an interesting target for Salesforce  At the end of the day  Zuora would need to be a willing seller  and it is not clear the founder would be willing to sell his company near the current stock price ",2020-01-15,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pic4-,2059985

170299,391815,CRM,Top 5 Things to Know in The Market on Monday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Monday  March 4 
1  U S   China Nearing Trade Deal
With little data on the economic calendar  markets will likely focus more heavily on trade related headlines following reports the U S  and China were close to striking a deal to end a bitter year long trade dispute 
U S  President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could seal a formal trade deal at a summit around March 27  given progress in talks between the two countries  the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday 
The two countries appear close to a deal that would roll back U S  tariffs on at least  200 billion worth of Chinese goods  while Beijing makes pledges on structural economic changes and eliminates retaliatory tariffs on U S  goods 
2  Trump Complains About Stronger Dollar
President Donald Trump renewed criticism of the Federal Reserve and said the U S  central bank s tight monetary policy was contributing to a strong dollar and hurting the United States  competitiveness 
 We have a gentleman that likes a very strong dollar at the Fed   Trump said at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill  Maryland  on Saturday   I want a strong dollar  but I want a dollar that s great for our country not a dollar that is so strong that it is prohibitive for us to be dealing with other nations  
Trump has repeatedly criticized the Fed and its chairman  Jerome Powell  whom he appointed  for raising interest rates 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a basket of six major currencies  was little changed at 96 46  after hitting its highest in around a week at 96 52 earlier 
3  U S  Futures Point to Higher Open
U S  stock futures pointed to a higher open at the start of the trading week  thanks to reports of progress on U S  China trade talks 
At 5 35AM ET  10 35 GMT   the blue chip Dow futures were up 74 points  or about 0 3   the S P 500 futures rose 6 points  or around 0 25   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a gain of 30 points  or roughly 0 4  
In earnings  Salesforce com  NYSE CRM  is the only major company due to publish its latest quarterly figures 
Elsewhere  European stocks were mostly higher  with the pan regional STOXX 600 index hovering around levels not seen since the beginning of October 
Earlier  markets in Asia started off a new trading week on a robust note  with Chinese stocks rallying to their best level since June 2018 



4  Oil Prices Gain on Signs of Slowing U S  Output
In commodities  oil prices edged higher after data showed U S  energy firms last week cut the number of drilling rigs to the lowest in almost nine months  suggesting early signs of moderating domestic production growth 
Crude futures were also generally supported by hopes that the U S  and China would soon resolve their trade disputes  which have dragged on global economic growth 
U S  West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 55 cents  or around 1   to  56 34 per barrel  while international Brent crude oil futures were at  65 83 per barrel  up 76 cents  or about 1 2

5  Less Than A Month to Go Until Brexit
With less than a month to go until Britain is due to leave the European Union  the odds of a delay to the March 29 deadline are shortening 
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar reportedly told colleagues in his cabinet that a delay to June was  very likely   according to Ireland s Sunday Independent who cited an unnamed minister  A motion in the U K  parliament  due to be debated next week  also opens the door for an essentially technical delay of a couple of months  but it s still not clear whether the EU would agree to that  as ministers in France  Spain and Germany have all pushed back against the idea 
In the meantime  British Prime Minister Theresa May will set out plans for a  1 6 billion fund   2 1 billion  to help boost economic growth in Brexit supporting communities 
May  whose exit deal with Brussels was rejected by a large majority of lawmakers in January  has promised parliament will get to vote on a revised deal by March 12 
Sterling was at  1 3230  inching toward its near eight month high of  1 3351 hit last week  on easing fears of a no deal Brexit

stock performance information  based on the market movements of 6 400 publicly traded companies  And in all of this information  it s possible to find the upgrades Upgrades happen when an analyst revises his view of a stock   and bumps it up  Sometimes it s in response to a particularly good quarter  sometimes to a merger or an acquisition  or sometimes the analyst saw a hint that good times are in store  Investors should be alert  to take notice and be ready to act when top analysts upgrade a stock Here  we highlight three stocks that received some upgrade love today Salesforce com  CRM

line revenue beat the forecast  as did the 75 cent EPS figure The upgrade on Salesforce came from RBC Capital analyst Alex Zukin  Zukin holds 5 stars from TipRanks  and is ranked  29 overall in the analyst database On Salesforce  Zukin had already rated the stock a Buy  but now he s made the stock one of his Top Picks  Supporting his increased optimism  Zukin writes   We think that Salesforce continues to grow cRPO  20  and that there are many avenues to sustain growth  including service and marketing  the platform  and international and future initiatives  we think Salesforce can continue to drive premium growth for its size and it remains an important strategic asset  Along with the upgraded stance  Zukin also raised his price target on the stock to  215  suggesting an upside of 24  for CRM   To watch Zukin s track record  click here All in all  Salesforce gets a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus  based on no fewer than 24 Buys against a single Hold  Shares currently

for CLI   FFO  or funds from operation  was down year over year at 38 cents  and while top line revenue showed a yoy gain to  131 9 million  it still missed the forecast  Share values started sliding

Analyst Steve Sakwa  reviewing the stock for Evercore ISI  sees plenty of reason for optimism in this stock and upgrades his view from Neutral to Buy  Backing his bullish stance  Sakwa writes   We are upgrading CLI to Outperform from In Line and increasing our PT to  27 from  24 as a result of  i  rising confidence that CLI will be able to sell their entire suburban office portfolio in a reasonable time frame and  ii  our conviction that CLI s sale of their suburban portfolio will cause a re rating in the stock due to simplification and a higher quality portfolio that could be monetized more easily  In addition to upgrading his rating on the stock  Sakwa also raised his price target by  3  to  27  His new price target implies an upside of 15    To watch Sakwa s track record  click here

after losses in December  and will hopefully augur better times ahead  On another positive note  the Q3 earnings report  released in early November  showed a bottom line EPS of 19 cents  solidly above both the forecasts and the year ago number  This came despite a top line revenue miss This stock underperformed in 2019  but BTIG analyst Mark Palmer  rated 5 stars and  41 overall in the TipRanks database  sees reason for optimism  He points out that EVOP has a  solid growth profile  potential for margin expansion  and its scarcity value as a relatively small merchant acquirer in a consolidating payments market   Palmer sees EVOP s recent share price decline as opening up a buying opportunity  Palmer puts a  32 price target on this stock to go with his Buy rating  This shows his confidence in 17  upside growth in the next 12 months   To watch Palmer s track record  click here  We are bullish on EVOP s prospects in 2020 and beyond for several reasons including its growth opportunity in the high growth B2B payments space in which it is differentiated based on its focus on the less competitive accounts receivable payment area  versus the more competitive accounts

170380,391896,CRM,Salesforce com  CRM  Upgraded To Buy  Here s What You Should Know,opinion,"Salesforce com  NYSE CRM  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Salesforce com is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Salesforce com  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Salesforce com
For the fiscal year ending January   2020  this customer management software developer is expected to earn  2 89 per share  which is a change of 5 1  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Salesforce com  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term 
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here    
The upgrade of Salesforce com to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-12-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/salesforcecom-crm-upgraded-to-buy-heres-what-you-should-know-200491927,200491927

Zendesk is a cloud based platform that helps businesses improve their customer experience  The company started as a customer support cloud  and now with Zendesk Sunshine  it has become a complete customer relationship management platform  CRM   Zendesk initially catered to growing small to mid sized businesses  SMB  who are just beginning to have significant customer relations issues  Today the company services an increasing number of Fortune 500 enterprises 
The platform provides businesses with omnichannel solutions so that they can meet their customers  needs in a way that is most convenient to the customer  Zendesk has helped connect nearly 900 million customer queries with a solution in the past year 
Why ZEN 
In this digital age we the markets have seen a plethora of CRM platforms  so what makes Zendesk worth investing in 
Zendesk focusses on ease of implementation and use  with all the sophisticated software being handled on the backend  You don t need a professional to help integrate like you would with Salesforce 
The platform is open and cloud based  meaning that you can access it wherever and whenever you want  It also is easily integrated into other enterprise software 
Gartner has recognized Zendesk as the Magical Quadrant leader in CRM Customer Service Centers for 3 years running  In a press release regarding this award  the firm expressed its thoughts about this award means   With one of the fastest growing customer bases of any vendor  Zendesk believes it was recognized for its overall value proposition  ease of set up  usability  API integration  and rapid adoption  
The Level

14 out of 16 sell side analysts are calling ZEN a buy right now  no sell ratings   with an average price target of  195 that would represent a 28  upside

170413,391929,CRM,Top 5 Things To Know In The Market On Tuesday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday  May 29 
1  Sea Of Red In Europe As Italy Risk Rocks Markets
A deepening political crisis in Italy provoked a second day of heavy selling on European financial markets  with the euro cut to a 6 1 2 month low  stocks punished and short term borrowing costs surging for the government in Rome 
Italy s FTSE MIB led losses across the continent  with the index down around 3  
Investors also fled Italian debt  as the 2 year bond yield soared by 172 percentage points to 2 42   the biggest one day rise since 1992 
Italy s anti establishment parties abandoned plans to form a coalition government after the country s president  Sergio Mattarella  refused to accept their euroskeptic candidate for economy minister 
Mattarella then asked Carlo Cottarelli  a former International Monetary Fund official  to try to form a new government  with snap elections expected 
Financial markets fear that the elections  which could take place as early as August  may become a de facto referendum on Italian membership of the currency bloc and the country s role in the European Union 
That sparked the euro to slip below the  1 16 level for the first time since late 2017  while the gap between Italian and German 10 year bond yields   a measure of Italian risk   widened to its highest in over four years 
Meanwhile  political uncertainty in Spain hit Madrid traded stocks  as Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy s struggle to stay in power raised fears of new elections 
2  Dow Futures Drop 200 Points
U S  stock futures pointed to a sharply lower open  as investors returning to their desk after a long weekend monitored political turmoil in Italy  while awaiting fresh data and earnings 
At 5 50AM ET  the blue chip Dow futures sank 200 points  or about 0 8   the S P 500 futures slumped 21 points  or nearly 0 8   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a decline 47 points  or roughly 0 7  
U S  stocks were closed Monday due to the Memorial Day holiday 
On the earnings front  Booz Allen Hamilton  NYSE BAH  and Momo  NASDAQ MOMO  are scheduled to publish their latest corporate results ahead of the open  while Salesforce com  NYSE CRM  and HP  NYSE HPE  are due after the bell 
In data  the S P Case Shiller house price index  HPI  is set to be released at 9AM ET  followed by consumer confidence at 10AM ET and the Dallas Fed s manufacturing survey at 10 30AM ET 
3  Treasurys Rally Amid Risk Off Mood
In another sign that investors were flocking to safer bets  U S  government debt prices posted sharp gains 
The yield on the benchmark 10 year Treasury note fell to a six week low of 2 799   It last stood at around 2 85   down 8 6 basis points 
The yield on the 30 year Treasury bond was also deep in the red at 3 02  
Core European bond prices also rallied amid the risk off atmosphere across global markets 
Germany s 10 Year dipped 6 0 basis points to 0 27   hitting the lowest in more than five months with its fifth straight decline 
4  Dollar Jumps To Near 7 Month Highs
The lack of risk appetite ploughed cash into the U S  dollar  lifting the dollar index  which benchmarks the greenback against a basket of six global currencies  to 94 91  the highest since November 7 
But against safe haven yen  it dipped 0 6  to a three week trough of 108 75  USD JPY  
The euro sank 0 9  against the dollar to 1 1519  EUR USD   the weakest in almost seven months 
The British pound fell 0 5  to 1 3240  GBP USD   the weakest in about six months 
5  Oil Prices Stay Under Pressure
Crude prices continued to struggle near their lowest levels in around six weeks  amid expectations that Saudi Arabia and Russia would pump more oil to ease a potential shortfall in supply 
Brent crude futures were up 20 cents  or around 0 3   at  75 50 a barrel  within sight of their lowest since May 8 at  74 53 reached in the last session

170415,391931,CRM,Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,news,"Investing com   Top 5 things that rocked U S  markets this week
1  Blowout Jobs Report  Italian Political Turmoil  Return of Tariff Tantrums Rock Markets
U S  markets were rocked by the return of tariff tantrums and geopolitical uncertainty in the Eurozone but as focused shifted to domestic issues a bullish jobs report helped steady risk appetite 
Private payrolls grew by 223 000 for the May  a sharp uptick from the 163 000 in April  according to a report released Wednesday by ADP and Moody s Analytics  That beat economists  forecast of 189 000 
That provided the impetus for U S  stock to recoup some of their losses which followed fears that a global trade war beckons 
U S  tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Canada  Mexico and European Union were triggered at midnight Friday  drawing retaliatory measures from all three of the United States  allies 
U S  markets were also roiled by Italian political turmoil  which has since abated after Giuseppe Conte was sworn in as Italy s new Prime Minister 
Corporate earnings garnered investor attention as HP Inc  NYSE HPQ  and Salesforce com Inc  NYSE CRM  were among the notable names that delivered earnings  beating expectations on the top line 
The S P 500 closed roughly flat for the week at 2 734 62 
2  Crude Oil Prices See Red for Second Straight Week 
Crude oil prices adding to their 5  loss last week  with a 3  slump this week following an expansion in U S  oil output and uncertainty on whether OPEC and its allies would ease limits on production 
As the OPEC meeting slated for June 22 draws closer  traders remained wary of the oil cartel easing production limits despite a Reuters report mid week  citing a Gulf source  OPEC and its allies would stick to production curbs  which have helped slash the glut in global supplies 
Fears that limits on the production cut agreement could be eased overshadowed a weekly Energy Information Administration report showing U S  crude supplies unexpectedly fell by 3 6 million barrels in the week ended May 25 
Crude futures settled 1 8  lower on Friday as data showed U S  oil rigs increased  pointing to signs of growing domestic output 
3  Dollar Notches Third Weekly Win
The dollar scraped its third straight weekly win after a strong jobs report Friday helped the greenback recover some of its early week losses 
The U S  economy created more jobs than expected and wage growth topped estimates  paving the way for the Federal Reserve to hike rates in June  helping the greenback steady against its rivals 
The greenback suffered heavy losses on Wednesday after the EUR USD rallied on reports that Italy s anti establishment parties were prepared to return to the negotiation table and resolve their differences to form the country s next government 
Last ditch talks by Italy s Five Star Movement and League were successful as Giuseppe Conte was sworn in as Italy s new Prime Minister on Friday 
The dollar rose 0 24  to 94 18 against a basket of major currencies on Friday 
4  Gold s Promise Falters
Gold prices were unable to add to their gains from last week  posting a weekly loss as the prospect of the further Fed rate hikes in the wake of an upbeat jobs report reduced demand for the yellow metal 
In the aftermath of the U S  jobs report showing higher than expected wage growth  traders  expectations for a faster pace of rate hikes edged higher  Analysts warned  however  that a single jobs report  albeit solid  was not enough to warrant a faster pace of rate hikes 
Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool showed the odds of a fourth rate hike at the Fed s December meeting rose to 32 6  from 27 6  yesterday 
 Average hourly earnings at 2 7  year on year is within the range it has trended since mid 2016 and not enough to warrant a faster pace of rate hikes   analysts at CIBC said in a note 
5  Traders Ready to Call Bitcoin s Bluff  
Bitcoin saw lower lows this week but its test of  7 000 was met with a wave of buying  stoking hopes of a recovery in the popular crypto 
Some analysts said earlier this week that the  7 000 region triggered some  very key  support for bitcoin  opening the door to a possible recovery 
 We think Bitcoin is starting to bottom off some very key support around  7 000 and we think it s going to start a recovery process here   Robert Sluymer  head of technical strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors  told CNBC s  Futures Now  on Thursday 
Yet  traders continued to adopt a cautious approach  appearing unwilling to make a meaningful return to the crypto space as data showed the crypto total market cap remained stagnant compared to last week 
The total crypto market cap was roughly unchanged from a week ago at  329 billion 
Over the past seven days  Bitcoin fell 0 09  on the Bitfinex exchange  Ethereum fell 2 69   while Ripple XRP rose 0 79  on the Poloniex exchange ",2018-06-01,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/top-5-things-that-moved-markets-this-past-week-1477659,1477659

170418,391934,CRM, VC Firm Lightspeed Raises  1 8B to Invest in Crypto Companies  Others ,news,"Lightspeed Venture Partners  a US based venture capital firm  has raised  1 8 billion to invest in startups operating in a variety of industries  from cryptocurrencies to biotechnology  TV streaming services  and beauty products  On Monday  the company s partners  Reuters that about  1 05 billion of the new funding would be allocated to a new fund that will be focused on investments in more mature companies  even though the VC firm has been known for betting on early stage investments 
Lightspeed  which is the first investor in the messaging application Snapchat  aims to expand its business in Southeast Asia and start investing including in cryptocurrencies  
Jeremy Liew  a Lightspeed partner  said that later stage companies are more consolidated in their industries than young startups  but the former ones are less likely to generate astronomical returns  something which certain startups could achieve 
As part of its business growth  the VC firm hired Brad Twohig   a former investor with Insight Venture Partners   as a new partner to help it manage the future investments 
Lightspeed s  1 billion fund for growth stage investments is part of a broader trend in the VC industry in which institutional investors are switching from startup investing or going for a combination of early stage and growth stage companies 
During the last five years  the startups backed by Lightspeed have carried out 17 IPOs  half of which have been held since January 2017  The VC firm invested in companies like Snap  personal stylist provider Sitch Fix  data storage service Nutanix  AppDynamics  bought by Cisco   MuleSoft  acquired by Salesforce com  NYSE CRM    and Informatica  Since its launch in 2000  the VC firm can boast with 24 early stage company investments that have gone through IPOs  the most of any fund out there 
Liew  who managed Lightspeed s investment in Snap  admitted that the messaging app was the Jackpot 

 If you point to one moment in time for the firm it was probably the Snap IPO  But really  it s a decade of hard work  and it all came to fruition at the same time

170426,391942,CRM,Why Salesforce com  CRM  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Salesforce com  NYSE CRM   This company  which is in the Zacks Computer   Software industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This customer management software developer has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 46 44  
For the last reported quarter  Salesforce com came out with earnings of  0 66 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 47 per share  representing a surprise of 40 43   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 61 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 93 per share  delivering a surprise of 52 46  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Salesforce com  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Salesforce com has an Earnings ESP of  4 97  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on December 3  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-11-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-salesforcecom-crm-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200487711,200487711
170428,391944,CRM,Salesforce Q3 Earnings On Deck  Can CRM Stock Reach New Highs  ,opinion,"Salesforce   NYSE CRM   is set to report its third quarter financial results after the closing bell on Tuesday  December 3  The company has seen its shares rise 18  in 2019 but it has lagged behind the broader software market s 41  run 
Investors have been enthusiastic about the growth runway Salesforce has in its cloud based customer relationship management software  As more enterprises transition to cloud based data  companies like Salesforce have the opportunity to garner a large chunk of that business  On top of that  Salesforce recently held its Dreamforce event  which gave investors better insight into the company s trajectory 
Dreamforce Conference 
Salesforce wrapped up its Dreamforce conference last week as it hosted customers  partners  and key stakeholders at a week long event  Dreamforce s conferences and sessions provided valuable insight for investors about the company s operations and how it plans to conduct its business in the new digital era 
During the Dreamforce conference  Salesforce announced that it expects to generate  34 billion to  35 billion in revenue for fiscal 2024  This implies a growth rate of about 20  annually  which is impressive considering it is roughly double the  17 billion the company expects to bring in fiscal 2020 
Earlier this year the company forecasted revenue of  26 billion to  28 billion for fiscal 2023  which would be roughly double the  13 3 billion it achieved in fiscal 2019  Salesforce executives also announced that its acquisition of MuleSoft was finally starting to come together 
The company introduced Accelerators  which allow customers to integrate data from outside sources directly with Salesforce Service Cloud and Salesforce Commerce Cloud  The firm also debuted the Flow Designer that allows users to navigate a smart integration platform instead of writing complex code to unlock the legacy system data 
These two new programs unveiled at Dreamforce integrates MuleSoft s capabilities into Salesforce s operations  which bodes well for investors who were hesitant about the acquisition 

Outlook 
The projections that Salesforce shared with its event attendees was definitely encouraging and its 26  and 25  revenue growth rates in fiscal 2019 and 2018  respectively  attest to the company s ability to deliver on its new target  To drive top line growth and to better equip itself for the expected cloud computing shift  Salesforce has made a series of acquisitions that have weighed on its margins 
However  management has indicated that the acquisitions would likely slow for the time being as Salesforce works to integrate Tableau Software into its ecosystem  Salesforce has also taken stakes in other smaller companies like Dropbox   NASDAQ DBX    SVMK   NASDAQ SVMK    and Zoom Video   NASDAQ ZM   that can better expand its reach in the tech industry  Salesforce is already a titan in the CRM space as the next  don t match Salesforce s market share 
Our Q3 consensus estimates forecast earnings to grow 8 2  to  0 66 per share and for sales to reach  4 44 billion for a 30 79  rally  Subscription and support is projected to bring in  4 15 billion for a 30 9  hike 
Looking ahead to the firm s full fiscal year figures  earnings are anticipated to pop 3 64  to  2 85 per share and revenue is projected to rally 27 7  to  16 96 billion 
Our fiscal 2021 estimates call for top line growth off 22 8   which would be on target with Salesforce s new 2024 forecast 
Takeaway 
The tech giant s acquisitions and the way Salesforce has been able to integrate the capabilities of the acquired firms into its own operations is a good sign moving forward  Salesforce is certainly not cheap as it trades 57X its forward earnings  which might discourage many investors 
Additionally  the company is not immune to volatility  which could weigh on the business  short term operations  However  this doesn t seem to be a company with its sights set on short term success as it is gearing up for a major secular shift towards the cloud 
Salesforce is currently trading around 3 4  below its 52 week high of  167 56 per share and a strong Q3 report  with encouraging forward guidance  could potentially send it to new highs and close the gap with the broader software market

signage from insurance companies  It is a big money business  and one that can enrich astute investors that know the right insurance stocks to buy  As with all stocks  there is risk  With insurance companies  you ve got risks coming from not only the market but from Mother Nature herself  Just think about all the payouts coming after catastrophic events like hurricanes and tornados  Today s Bull of the Day is an insurance company that makes its money from a business that doesn t have to deal with natural disasters on a grand scale  I m talking about a stock that s in the HMO business Today s Bull of the Day is Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Wellcare Health  WellCare Health Plans  Inc  provides government sponsored managed care services  The company operates in three segments  Medicaid Health Plans  Medicare Health Plans  and Medicare Prescription Drug Plans  PDPs   This stock really took a hit along with the entire industry earlier this year  There was a fear that politically the climate could change and setup a candidate with a  Medicare for All  plan to take office  That would have provided a major shock to the industry  Now that those fears have subsided a bit  the stocks in this industry have been on the move to the upside The Medical   HMO industry is in the Top 24  of our Zacks Industry Rank  Wellcare is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The reason for the favorable Zacks Ranks lies in the series of earnings estimates coming in to the upside recently  Over the last thirty days  seven analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current year while six have done so for next year  The bullish moves have really contributed to some upside action in our Zacks Consensus Estimate  The current year consensus is up from  13 99 to  15 42 over the last ninety days while next year s number is up from  16 56 to  16 99  With the economy rocking and rolling  summer vacations were more fun than ever  Folks were out there buying boats and RVs  taking family vacations to Europe  and enjoying theme parks  You may think that this bullish momentum helped out industries like Leisure and Recreation Services  After digging into the numbers  I myself was shocked to see that this industry actually ranks in the Bottom 14  of our Zacks Industry Rank  That means that individual companies within that industry have been seeing negative earnings estimate revisions coming in from analysts  That  typically  is not what you want to see when looking for your next stock to buy  That s why I m naming Six Flags Entertainment as today s Bear of the Day Six Flags Entertainment Corporation owns and operates regional theme and water parks under the Six Flags name  The company s parks offer various thrill rides  water attractions  themed areas  concerts and shows  restaurants  game venues  and retail outlets  It owns and operates 25 parks  including 22 parks in the United States  2 parks in Mexico  and 1 park in Montreal  Canada The company is currently a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   The reason for the negative Zacks Rank is the recent string of negative earnings estimate revisions coming from analysts  Over the last ninety days  nine analysts have cut their estimates for the current year and next year  That bearish attitude has dropped our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Current Year from  2 76 down to  2 59  Next year s number has come down from  3 00 to  2 79 Six Flags Entertainment Corporation New Price and ConsensusThat bearish sentiment has gone through the rest of the industry  which is why it s not in the good graces of our Zacks Industry

However  management has indicated that the acquisitions would likely slow for the time being as Salesforce works to integrate Tableau Software into its ecosystem  Salesforce has also taken stakes in other smaller companies like Dropbox and Zoom Video that can better expand its reach in the tech industry  Salesforce is already a titan in the CRM space as the next  don t match Salesforce s market share Our Q3 consensus estimates forecast earnings to grow 8 2  to  0 66 per share and for sales to reach  4 44 billion for a 30 79  rally  Subscription and support is projected to bring in  4 15 billion for a 30 9  hike Looking ahead to the firm s full fiscal year figures  earnings are anticipated to pop 3 64  to  2 85 per share and revenue is projected to rally 27 7  to  16 96 billion Our fiscal 2021 estimates call for top line growth off 22 8   which would be on target with Salesforce s new 2024 forecast Takeaway The tech giant s acquisitions and the way Salesforce has been able to integrate the capabilities of the acquired firms into its own operations is a good sign moving forward  Salesforce is certainly not cheap as it trades 57X its forward earnings  which might discourage many investors Additionally  the company is not immune to volatility  which could weigh on the business  short term operations  However  this doesn t seem to be a company with its sights set on short term success as it is gearing up for a major secular shift towards the cloud Salesforce is currently trading around 3 4  below its 52 week high of  167 56 per share and a strong Q3 report  with encouraging forward guidance  could potentially send it to new highs and close the gap with the broader software market Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special

170482,391998,CRM,CES kicks off with no lead women speakers or code of conduct,news,"By Salvador Rodriguez and Paresh Dave SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    The technology industry s premier annual gathering kicks off next week with no women leading the keynote sessions and no code of conduct that might prevent incidents of sexual harassment  despite efforts by organizers to cast the show as a more inclusive event  CES  the showcase for the latest consumer electronics from televisions to self driving cars  is known for mostly male attendees and female models known as  booth babes  showing off the new technology  It has attracted criticism for not making itself more welcoming for women or toning down its sexualized atmosphere even as the issue of harassment and assault has grabbed headlines in the last six months and propelled the  MeToo movement into life   The fact that this large global gathering of tech leaders is totally ignoring this issue makes them completely tone deaf and irresponsible   said Liliana Aide Monge  chief executive of California coding school Sabio  who is skipping CES for the second year in a row because of the lack of women and minority speakers  The organizers of CES  which opens its doors to nearly 200 000 attendees in Las Vegas on Tuesday  drew criticism last month from executives at  Twitter Inc   N TWTR  and other tech companies for a keynote list dominated by white men  CES made a concerted push to diversify its entire speaker lineup  but ultimately failed to find a high ranking female executive for an individual keynote address   To keynote at CES  the speaker must head  president CEO level  a large entity who has name recognition in the industry   said Karen Chupka  who oversees the event as senior vice president at the Consumer Technology Association  CTA   in a blog post a month ago   As upsetting as it is  there is a limited pool when it comes to women in these positions  We feel your pain  It bothers us  too  The tech industry and every industry must do better   On top of that  CES also will go forward without creating a code of conduct  a mechanism several conferences in technology and other industries have adopted in recent years to set rules for behavior for attendees  from guidelines on using inclusive language in presentations to requirements that attendees wear name tags at all events  even after hours  to deter misconduct    It s sad that CES doesn t have a code of conduct   said Y Vonne Hutchinson  founder of ReadySet  a diversity focused consulting firm   They have a lot of influence  If they re choosing not to leverage that to promote diversity and inclusion at large  that communicates to the rest of the industry that maybe it isn t as necessary as we keep saying that it is   HIGH STAKES Evidence of the effect on shows  safety and tone is mostly anecdotal  but several conferences with these codes  including hacker convention DEF CON  CoreOS Fest and Cloud Foundry Summit  say they have removed attendees after reports of harassment   The stakes are high for the technology industry  rocked in the past year by a sexual harassment scandal at Uber Technologies Inc  UBER UL  and misconduct by some prominent Silicon Valley investors   The organizers of CES say they expect attendees to heed their own companies  standards of business conduct and will kick out anyone who behaves poorly  but will not introduce a set of guidelines   We don t necessarily have specific rules because we assume everyone will be held accountable to the standards of being in an office   said Chupka    Unacceptable  behavior would be addressed by the executive team and legal counsel as necessary  the CTA said   We have the right at any time to revoke a show badge and or trespass an individual   CES notes that it has received no reports of sexual harassment at the event in recent years   Women subjected to uncomfortable situations at or near past CES gatherings told Reuters that they did not report incidents because they were too used to it or did not recognize there was a way to do so  To change that thinking  the show is debuting a security app that lets attendees report issues from crimes to broken elevators  While there will be no effort to promote the app specifically as a way to report sexual harassment  attendees may do so  and CES said its lawyers will be ready to act  SLUSH CODE  The need for a code of conduct became apparent at Finland s Slush tech startup event in 2016 when multiple women spoke up about being inappropriately touched and receiving unwanted propositions for sex by male attendees as well as being ignored by investors who were only interested in working with male entrepreneurs   The following year  it doubled security  trained staff on how to handle reports of harassment and instituted a code of conduct  including a requirement to wear name badges at all times as a way to make it easier for attendees to identify a harasser  A similar approach has been adopted by some in the U S  tech industry  Salesforce com Inc s  N CRM  Dreamforce event  second only to CES in attendee numbers  added a code of conduct in 2014  while film  tech and music conference South by Southwest added one in 2016  Meanwhile  large conferences run by  Oracle Corp   N ORCL  and RSA Security have not adopted such a code  It remains to be seen if CES s lack of a code of conduct will prove costly   Las Vegas  reputation for excess is part of the problem  said Liz Lopez  a tech marketing professional who has attended several industry conferences in the city

NEW DELHI  Reuters    Uber s  UBER UL  chief of policy for India and South Asia has quit  two sources familiar with the matter said on Monday  in the latest high level departure at the online taxi company 
Shweta Rajpal Kohli  a former Indian journalist who joined Uber last year  would join cloud based software maker Salesforce com Inc  NYSE CRM  next month  the sources told Reuters 
Uber  in a statement to Reuters on Tuesday  confirmed Kohli had quit 
Kohli was mostly tasked with building Uber s relations with regulators and government officials in India  a market where the firm has faced several regulatory and reputational hurdles 
One source said Kohli  was leading government engagements in the influential circles  so her exit is a step back for Uber  
Uber was briefly banned in New Delhi after one of its drivers raped a woman passenger in 2014 
Uber hired a law firm this year to investigate how the firm managed to obtain the medical records of the rape victim  an incident that led to criticism of the culture at the U S  firm  sources told Reuters in June  Uber declined to comment 
Kohli is the latest senior executive to leave Uber  The firm s European policy chief quit in October  shortly after the departure of Uber s top boss in Britain 
Uber has suffered a tumultuous few months which has seen former CEO and co founder Travis Kalanick forced out after a series of boardroom controversies and other regulatory battles in multiple U S  states and around the world 
Uber counts India as its second biggest market after the United States  It operates in about 30 Indian cities and competes with Ola  a ride hailing service backed by Japan s Softbank

For the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of  2 65 per share and revenue of  16 56 billion  which would represent changes of  3 64  and  24 66   respectively  from the prior year 
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for CRM  Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near term business trends  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability 
Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near term stock prices  Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank  This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple  actionable rating system

170535,392051,CRM,Earnings Preview  Salesforce com  CRM  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Salesforce com  NYSE CRM  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended July 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 22  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This customer management software developer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 47 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  33 8  
Revenues are expected to be  3 95 billion  up 20 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Salesforce com 
For Salesforce com  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Salesforce com will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Salesforce com would post earnings of  0 61 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 93  delivering a surprise of  52 46  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Salesforce com doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-08-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-salesforcecom-crm-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200455532,200455532

170607,392123,CRM,The Day Ahead  Top 3 things to watch ,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
The euro in focus
EUR USD could be the  one to watch   as Eurozone economic sentiment data for August is expected to show a slight drop to 34 2 from 35 6 in the prior month 
The economic sentiment data will be followed by a speech by the European Central Bank s Constancio  who may offer further clues on the central bank s thinking on monetary policy  following the release of somewhat dovish minutes from the ECB s July meeting released last week 
The ECB s July policy meeting minutes revealed officials warned that the recent surge in the euro could hamper the central bank s efforts to get inflation closer to its target of below  but close to  2  
Retail Sales 
Canadian retail sales due Tuesday could offer further insight into the impact of the Bank of Canada s decision to raise rates for the first time in seven years in July 
Economists  forecasts a drop in retail sales to 0 3  in June compared to the month prior  but expect retail sales excluding automobiles  so called core retail sales  to rebound to 0 3  in June from a  0 1  slump in May 
USD CAD has struggled to stem losses since the Bank of Canada raise rates  falling to C 1 2573  down 0 11   on Monday 
Is the  force  with Salesforce 
Salesforce com Inc  NYSE CRM  is slated to report second quarter earnings after US markets close on Tuesday amid growing investor expectations the company will top earnings estimates on both the bottom and top line 
Salesforce generated  1 23 billion from operations in the first quarter  up 17  year over year  following an uptick in user adoption of its cloud computing offering  Tough competition from Microsoft  however  is expected to remain a concern for Salesforce

What s Next for Salesforce com 
While Salesforce com has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Salesforce com was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

There has been a noticeable change in tone out of Washington the last two days  Most noticeably the tweet cycle has moved from negative to positive  As much as President Trump loves tariffs  he loves the stock market a whole lot more  What may be even more important is that the equity market knows it will always have a friend in Trump  With a friendly Fed and friendly President  I would find it hard to believe if the equity market did not rally to new highs 
The 5  Rule 
I think what may be more important is that any time the market approaches its highs  we should at the very least keep in the back of our mind that Trump may launch a trade or economic attack  It would seem the President is willing to take a 5  hit in stocks until softening his tone  It sounds stupid and naive  but the evidence would suggest that it may very well be the case

170683,392199,CRM,Salesforce Pre Earnings Trade,opinion,"First let s look at Salesforce com Inc  NYSE CRM   Earnings are June 4th  2019 
Let s work on identifying our edge  Using some of my own methods  I ve first found a  sweet spot  at entering the trade nine days before  and exiting 3 days before earnings 
In CML Trademachine  we have seen pre earnings optimism contribute to just under 200  in profits with a long call strategy  see below  from days  9 to  3 prior to earnings 
 courtesy CMLVIZ com 
I ll buy to open the  155 strike  at the money  June 28th 2019 calls  Three calls have a maximum loss of  2160  appropriate risk of 2  in a  100 000 account 

As an alternative  we can combine a ratio trade with an imbalanced calendar to create a high probability of profit with limited risk 
For an imbalanced calendar  we will sell more calls in the front month and buy fewer calls in the back month  Because we have 3 long calls in the 45 day expiry time frame  we still will be net long  and so have limited risk 
Let s sell to open 10 of the June 7th 152 5 strike calls  and buy to open 9 of June 14th 152 5 strike calls 

And voila  we have a profitable range from 150 77 and up  with an over 62  chance of profit based on the standard distribution alone  We profit if the price goes up  stays the same  or slightly goes down  

We also know we have about a 63  chance of the price going higher with CMLViz  so this overall is a very high probability trade  likely exceeding 80  
Implied volatility in CRM also increases steadily up to earnings 
  courtesy chartaffair com 
Volatility dramatically improves the likelihood of profit   The first chart shows the current volatility of 39   and the second shows volatility at 60  which is the mean volatility at T 3 

Increased volatility will dramatically help the trade  and time does not have a large impact on the trade pre earnings ",2019-05-20,Tim Knight,https://www.investing.com/analysis/salesforce-preearnings-trade-200422907,200422907
170684,392200,CRM,Ex JPMorgan analyst largely cleared in U S  of insider trading,news,"By Nate Raymond
 Reuters    A former JPMorgan Chase   Co  N JPM  investment banking analyst has been largely cleared of U S  charges that he disclosed information about upcoming mergers that allowed a friend and another man to make over  600 000 through insider trading 
Ashish Aggarwal  who previously worked at J P  Morgan Securities LLC in its San Francisco office  was found not guilty by a federal jury in Los Angeles on Tuesday of 26 of 30 counts he faced  prosecutors said 
The jury  following three days of deliberations  was hung on four remaining counts of insider trading and tender offer fraud  prosecutors said 
 We are very pleased that the jury took the time to carefully evaluate the evidence and agreed with us that Mr  Aggrawal was not guilty   his lawyers  Derek Cohen and Grant Fondo  said in a joint statement 
Thom Mrozek  a spokesman for the U S  Attorney s Office in Los Angeles  said prosecutors  will review the case to determine if we want to proceed on the unresolved counts  
Aggarwal  28  was charged in August 2015 in connection with what prosecutors said were tips he provided a college friend  Shahriyar Bolandian  who they said in turn tipped his childhood friend  Kevan Sadigh 
Prosecutors said Aggarwal tipped Bolandian to inside information before the announcements of Integrated Device Technology Inc s 2012 acquisition of PLX Technology Inc and Salesforce com  NYSE CRM  Inc s 2013 acquisition of ExactTarget Inc

170793,392309,CRM,Oracle hit with whistleblower lawsuit over cloud accounting,news," Reuters     Oracle Corp   N ORCL  was sued on Wednesday by a former senior finance manager who claimed she was terminated in retaliation for complaining about improper accounting practices in Oracle s cloud services business 
Shares of Oracle fell about 2 6 percent to  39 23 in after hours trading 
In a complaint filed in U S  District Court in San Francisco  the former executive  Svetlana Blackburn  accused upper management of trying to push her to  fit square data into round holes  to make Oracle Cloud Services  results look better 
 We don t agree with the allegations and intend to vigorously defend the matter   Oracle spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger said 
Blackburn said her bosses instructed her to add millions of dollars of accruals for expected business  with no concrete or foreseeable billing to support the numbers   and said executives above her added accruals on their own 
Like many legacy software companies  Oracle faces a dilemma with the move to cloud computing   essentially software in servers in data centers accessible through the internet rather than traditional packaged software  The older type of software still generates massive profits for Oracle 
Last quarter  Oracle s traditional on premises software sales shrank slightly compared with a year earlier  but still generated  6 35 billion in revenue  70 percent of total revenue for the quarter  In comparison  cloud revenue was  735 million  or 8 percent of the revenue  but grew by 40 percent 
The Redwood City  California based company has come under considerable pressure from younger and smaller cloud first companies such as Salesforce com Inc  N CRM   whose chief executive delights in mocking Oracle s cloud strategy 
Oracle has invested aggressively in its cloud business over the last few years in a bid to gain market share in the cloud  Safra Catz  Oracle s co chief executive  said in March that the cloud business was in a  hyper growth phase  
Blackburn said Oracle terminated her employment on Oct  15 last year  one month after the alleged wrongdoing began and two months after she received a positive performance review 
She said Oracle had come to view her as  more of a roadblock than a team player who would blindly generate financial reports using improper bases in order to justify the bottom lines that her superiors demanded to see  
V J  Chetty  a lawyer for Blackburn  declined additional comment 
Blackburn s lawsuit also accused Oracle of violating the anti retaliation provisions of the federal Sarbanes Oxley corporate governance and Dodd Frank financial reform laws  It seeks punitive damages  double back pay and other remedies ",2016-06-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/oracle-hit-with-whistleblower-lawsuit-over-cloud-accounting-405954,405954

Any recent changes to analyst estimates for CRM should also be noted by investors  These revisions help to show the ever changing nature of near term business trends  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook 
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near term share price momentum  We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon  Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear  actionable rating model

170852,392368,CRM,Facebook puts a price on suburban living for employees,news,"By Olivia Oran and Sarah McBride NEW YORK EAST PALO ALTO  Calif   Reuters     Facebook Inc   O FB  is offering employees at its Silicon Valley headquarters at least  10 000 to move closer to the office  a reflection of the challenges many tech companies face in the increasingly expensive and congested San Francisco Bay area  To qualify for the payment  which the social networking firm started offering in the last 12 months  according to current and former Facebook workers  employees must buy or rent a home within 10 miles  16 km  of the Facebook campus at One Hacker Way  a desolate strip of road overlooking a marsh about 30 miles  48 km  south of San Francisco  Some Facebook employees with families to support could earn a one off payment of  15 000 or more for housing costs  Facebook s efforts  along with similar programs at some other technology companies including investment management technology company Addepar  data company Palantir and software firm SalesforceIQ  a unit of Salesforce com Inc  N CRM   could help ease a major source of tension in San Francisco  an influx of young  wealthy tech workers who commute to Silicon Valley on private buses and often displace lower income residents  But Silicon Valley has a housing affordability crisis of its own  and if Facebook s program gains traction it could further accelerate the gentrification of nearby communities  especially the low income city of East Palo Alto   A lot of local families are going to get hurt   said John Liotti  chief executive officer of East Palo Alto community advocacy group Able Works  Facebook says the program is not about social engineering   Our benefits at Facebook are designed to support our employees and the people who matter most to them at all stages of life   a Facebook spokesman said  Cynics suggest the company might be looking to encourage people to spend more time in the office while also cutting the cost of its luxury bus service  whose drivers recently unionized  For Mark Shim  an engineer who had worked at Addepar  living across the street from the Mountain View based company earned him a  300 a month bonus  But the money  which was a taxed benefit  wasn t the reason behind his housing decision   For me  it wasn t financially driven as my rent has gone up more than 60 percent since I moved to Mountain View and the stipend doesn t keep up with the rent spikes in the area   said Shim  who has since joined another company    If you live closer to work you are less worried about leaving at an exact time  and if you re in the middle of solving a cool problem  you ll spend the extra time to finish that up   Lissa Minkin  vice president of people at Addepar  said the perk was designed to help employees spend more time on personal interests or with their families   Not having a long commute makes a huge positive impact on maintaining a healthy work life balance   she said   Tech workers say the commute is getting worse  What would have been a one hour commute each way three years ago has stretched to 90 minutes or more as the tech economy has boomed and more cars hit the road   San Francisco area drivers spend more time in gridlock than those of any city other than Washington  D C   and Los Angeles  according to traffic data service Inrix  Still  plenty of young techies are willing to endure it  Take Nilesh Patel  a single technology worker who commutes from San Francisco to a large company almost 40 miles  64 km  away so he can cultivate his rich social life in the city   I didn t want to move into one of those depressing bachelor complexes   he said about the generic Silicon Valley apartment buildings that often house people like him  Even for those who might consider a more suburban lifestyle   10 000 doesn t necessarily go very far in a city like Menlo Park  where the average rental is  3 600 a month  according to data from online real estate company Trulia  And moving south won t provide an escape from the resentment tech workers have engendered in San Francisco neighborhoods like the Mission  where community activists protesting gentrification have blockaded tech company buses  In East Palo Alto  once a crime ridden city that provided an element of gritty flair amid the bland office parks and strip malls that dominate much of Silicon Valley  the recent influx of tech money has brought plenty of benefits  Crime  including robbery  auto theft and rape  has declined over the years  according to city data  New businesses like the city s only full fledged grocery store have opened  and many new arrivals are trying to help by tutoring kids and donating to local causes  said Liotti  But the newcomers  who locals call  los Facebuqueros  regardless of where they work  have also contributed to increasing evictions and sky rocketing rents   We re dealing with a huge displacement of lower income individuals   said Tom Myers  executive director of the Community Services Agency in Mountain View  which this month passed ordinances to try to take pressure off lower income renters  There s also the chance that the housing incentives backfire

fruitful telephonic discussion with President Xi  According to him   big progress  was being made and a deal with China was  moving along very well  Our ChoicesDespite the pessimism surrounding this

170883,392399,CRM,Record giving to non profits boosting U S  software company Blackbaud,news,By David Randall NEW YORK  Reuters    Big data is starting to make its way down to even the smallest non profit  and fund managers are finding a way to buy in  Among their favorite targets  U S  software provider Blackbaud Inc  whose cloud based software is a favorite among non profits looking to cash in on the record levels of charitable giving in the United States   A total of 45 U S  mutual funds added shares of the Charleston  South Carolina based company to their portfolios between June and August  double the number from the previous quarter  according to the most recent data from Morningstar  Those purchases by fund managers are one reason why shares of the company are up nearly 40 percent for the year amid a down market and trade at a price to earnings ratio five times that of the broad S P 500   Analysts say that the  2 9 billion market cap company is riding two trends  an economic recovery that has disproportionately rewarded affluent households that contribute the bulk of donations  and the popularity of fundraisers such as the  Ice Bucket Challenge  that are widely shared on social media    Now with Facebook  O FB  and digital fundraising  you need technological expertise  even if you re a smaller non profit   said Eric Marshall  whose  2 billion Hodges Small Cap Fund has been adding to its position in the company  currently worth  28 4 million  according to Thomson Reuters data   At the same time  products offered by larger competitors such as Salesforce com Inc  N CRM    Oracle Corp   N ORCL  and MicroStrategy Inc are often poor fits for the smaller non profits that are the company s target market  he said  Blackbaud  by comparison  offers Web based analytics software that can help organizations communicate with donors  manage volunteers  process payments  and identify future prospects along with a recommendation for how much an organization should ask them to give    This is an under the radar provider of services to an area of the market that doesn t get a lot of attention  but once you win customers they are very sticky   he said  likening its potential to that of Tyler Technologies Inc  whose shares have gained 700 percent over the last five years as its software to manage such local government operations as county records and traffic tickets caught on   SLOWING BULL MARKET Yet while Blackbaud s shares are trading near the record high of  63 97 they hit on Aug  18  the company s future prospects are dependent in part on the same bull market that allowed Americans to donate a record  358 2 billion in 2014  a 7 1 percent increase from the year before  according to a report by the Giving Institute  Donations by individuals make up 72 percent of total giving in the United States  with the level of donations rising about one third as fast as the stock market  the organization said   With the benchmark Standard   Poor s 500 index down approximately 2 5 percent for the year to date  the U S  stock market is on track to post its first annual loss after dividends since 2008 and halt a rally that has returned 72 8 percent over the last five years alone  That could dampen the size of donations from high net worth households  which contribute as much as two thirds of all funds given to non profits in a given year  according to the Giving Institute   Giving tends to track the overall economy  and any type of economic sensitivity would be something that  Blackbaud  would be impacted by   said John Rizzuto of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey  who covers the company   Despite those concerns  Rizzuto has a buy rating on the shares  in part because he expects the company s  aggressive  growth plans to bear fruit even if the stock market stalls  Overall  four analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters follow the company  and their recommendations are evenly split between  buy  and  neutral   The average target price among them is  64 50  a slightly figure higher than the record high for the stock  The most recent  Kevin Liu of B  Riley   Co  initiated coverage of the company with a  neutral  rating and a target price of  66 on Tuesday  He did not respond to a call for comment   GROWTH PLANS The company  which did not respond to requests for comment  told analysts in July that it expects to expand its total addressable market to  6 5 billion from its current  5 billion  largely through acquisitions  It reports its next earnings results on Oct  27   Within the last 16 months  the company has spent  160 million to acquire MicroEdge  which developed software mostly used by deep pocketed foundations   190 million on Smart Tuition  a company that made payments software used by private K 12 private schools  and  35 million on Whipple Hill Communications  which made cloud based applications used by private schools   The company has a strong track record of buying higher margin businesses while it expands its target market  said Thomas Roderick  an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus   Company Inc who has a  buy  rating on its shares  With the purchase of Smart Tuition  for example  the company now has an  end to end  solution for K 12 private schools that ranges from accounting packages aimed at Dioceses to financial aid assessment tools to collection systems for tuition and delinquent payments  he said   At the same time  the company s strong balance sheet and growth in an area of the economy that many investors are not exposed to could make it an acquisitions target  Rizzuto said    As much as there is an 800 lb gorilla in the nonprofit space  that s what Blackbaud is   he said

170890,392406,CRM,Salesforces Rises  Nears Resistance,opinion,"Summary

Salesforce com  NYSE CRM  soared on Wednesday morning  trading 9  higher after posting earnings that beat Wall Street expectations 
Our view is that it is likely to trade into its resistance zone  followed by a period of decline 


The cloud software company reported earnings per share of  0 61 and total revenue of  3 39 billion  above analyst estimates of  0 50 and  3 37 billion  For Q4 and FY19  management s forecast for earnings and revenue beat analyst estimates 
A beaming Marc Benioff exclaimed   That was fabulous third quarter  It was all about the cloud  artificial intelligence  machine learning  and deep learning  
Our analysis is based on the stock s market cycles  Viewed as such  CRM has now begun the rising phase of its current cycle  which is timely based on our work  Yet the previous cycle fell below the point from which it started  which indicates a new negative trend is now in place 
Given this  CRM is likely to fail at the resistance zone between  137  142  In that zone  we believe the stock is a good sell  with likely further declines into early 2019

Key Events
Shares in Europe and futures on the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ 100 have been seesawing this morning  following an uninspired Asian session earlier today that saw investors struggle to second guess the possible outcome of ongoing global headwinds 

The STOXX 600 opened higher  with most sectors in the green  but later slipped into negative territory  The pan European benchmark index remains below the shooting star s high it posted yesterday  which itself confirmed the resistance of a high wave candle posted on August 14 
US futures reversed an early gain and have since been wavering around neutral levels  at time of writing managing to eke out small gains  In the Asian session  Australia s S P ASX 200 climbed 0 75 percent  outperforming its regional peers  while China s Shanghai Composite lagged  sliding 0 31 percent 
Global Financial Affairs
During yesterday s US session  stocks a slightly higher record  while Treasurys sold off 
The S P 500 closed 0 03 percent higher  with gains in Real Estate   1 19 percent  offsetting weakness in most other sectors  Technically  traders may have been discouraged by the index s failure to hold above the 2 900 milestone after the open 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average performed slightly better  ticking 0 06 percent higher  Although it failed to post a new record  the index resumed its upward trend from the April low 
The NASDAQ Composite outperformed its US peers with a 0 15 percent climb  posting a fresh record high  as technology stocks led the US equity advance 
Overall  investors remained indecisive even amid the recent record highs hit by US majors and ahead of the return to normal trading volume after the summer vacation  The clouds that have gathered over Donald Trump s presidency have added to lingering global risks  ranging from the US China trade war to the threat of emerging markets instability spilling over to other markets  Traders are positioning themselves based on headlines  which may spark considerable volatility going forward 

In FX markets  the US dollar jumped  wiping out losses made yesterday and Monday  Technically  the global reserve currency may still find resistance by the broken uptrend line  where its advance stumbled  as well as by the 50 DMA above it  at the 95 00 psychological level 

The pound edged higher despite reports that senior officials from both sides of the Brexit negotiation table now see the October deadline as unattainable 
At the same time the euro slipped lower  weighed by reports that Italy may seek support from the ECB via new bond purchases 
The Canadian dollar rallied on the news that the country was willing to make concessions on dairy products in order to reach a new North American trade deal 
The Australian dollar slid alongside government bond yields  pressured by a reduced outlook for interest rate hikes 
Bitcoin is set to end a rally that spanned five straight weekday sessions  Despite it being in a lingering bear market  year to date  hashrates for the Bitcoin network  which reflect mining activity  have picked up significantly  Could that be a positive signal for alt currencies 

Crude oil inched lower this morning  for a second day  pressured by rising US supply  However at time of writing it reversed slightly  likely on the prospect that investment in Venezuelan production could halt the South American s output drop  Technically  the price hit a resistance area  as traders sold off when it reached the 50 and 100 DMAs 
Up Ahead
Economists expect GDP figures due today will show the US economy grew at a slightly slower pace in the second quarter 
Companies including Salesforce com Inc  NYSE CRM  and Dollar General  NYSE DG  report their earnings results on Wednesday 
China s official factory PMI are due Friday 
Also on Friday  the Bank of Korea decides on interest rates  with weak jobs growth recently easing speculation of a possible hike

170938,392454,CRM,Salesforce com  CRM  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Salesforce com  NYSE CRM  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 27  2018  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This customer management software developer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 50 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  28 2  
Revenues are expected to be  3 37 billion  up 25 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Salesforce com 
For Salesforce com  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Salesforce com will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Salesforce com would post earnings of  0 47 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 71  delivering a surprise of  51 06  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Salesforce com doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/salesforcecom-crm-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200361061,200361061

170963,392479,CRM,SAP buys expenses software maker Concur for  7 3 billion ,news,"By Harro Ten Wolde
FRANKFURT  Reuters    Germany s SAP  DE SAPG  has agreed to buy U S  expenses software maker Concur  O CNQR  for  7 3 billion in cash  strengthening its position in cloud computing but sending its shares down almost 3 percent on concern over the price 
SAP has been slow to embrace cloud computing  which allows businesses to cut costs by ditching bulky servers for network based systems  but the Concur deal announced late on Thursday accelerates its growth in the cloud while protecting its position in travel and expenses management 
The German business software company said it would offer  129 per share for Concur  a 20 percent premium over the Sept  17 closing price and just short of the  130 36 record high Concur shares set in January after a two year upward run 
That is equal to the 20 percent premium SAP paid for its 2012 acquisition of cloud procurement software maker Ariba  and comparable with the 18 and 19 percent arch rival Oracle  O ORCL  paid for Taleo in 2012 and RightNow in 2011 
 It seems expensive  But we believe that Concur is the leader in its market and the potential synergies will be a valuable addition   Bernstein analysts wrote in a note 
Societe Generale analysts wrote   The shares are likely to react negatively today given the high price paid and Oracle s lackluster results last night  
Oracle reported profit that fell below Wall Street estimates  hurt by weak hardware sales  It also said that Larry Ellison  its co founder and leader for 37 years  is to step down as CEO 
SAP  which competes in cloud computing with global rivals including Oracle  IBM  N IBM  and Salesforce  N CRM   will finance the Concur acquisition through a credit facility agreement of up to 7 billion euros   9 billion  
The company had seen the cloud phenomenon as threatening its core business model  but it began a series of acquisitions with the  3 4 billion purchase of SuccessFactors in 2011 after Oracle embarked on its own belated cloud buying spree 
 SOMETHING BIG 
With the acquisition of Concur  SAP will increase its cloud users to 50 million from 38 million 
 We have something big here  guys   SAP Chief Executive Bill McDermott told analysts and reporters on a conference call 
Concur has 23 000 clients  including companies  governments and universities with a total of more than 25 million users of its travel and expense management software 
About a third of Concur users run SAP software and the German company expects to add Concur customers 
Based on 57 million outstanding shares  the offer for Concur is valued at  7 3 billion  Including debt  the offer represents an enterprise value of about  8 3 billion  SAP said 
Global business spending on cloud services is expected to jump 20 percent this year to  174 billion  research firm IHS estimates  rising to more than  235 billion by 2017 
Bernstein analysts said they believe that SAP is driving to own the procurement process  in which customers pay based on the volumes of goods and services they buy  rather than by the number of users  which requires extra sales efforts 
As well as Ariba  SAP also owns Fieldglass  which allows companies to manage their temporary staff and independent contractors and services 
 The advantage of the procurement usage based models is that the more clients procure via Ariba and Fieldgass  the more revenue is generated   the analysts wrote 
Concur s software increasingly links suppliers and travel management companies  and is integrated with hotel chains including Intercontinental Hotels  L IHG  and Starwood  N HOT  
SALES BOOST
SAP expects to gain between 3 billion euros and 3 5 billion euros in sales from cloud computing by 2017  out of a total of at least 22 billion  but CEO McDermott said that SAP would raise the outlook after completion of the Concur acquisition 
SAP shares were down 2 4 percent at 58 45 euros by 0459 ET  the biggest decliners in a 0 6 percent weaker European technology index  amid a wider market buoyed by relief that Scotland voted to stay in the United Kingdom  FTEU3  
Shares in Concur  which reported a 28 6 percent rise in revenue to  178 37 million in the quarter to June 30  have fallen more than 17 percent since early this year  The drop has been partly down to a general retreat by investors from high momentum stocks but also because of declining margins  Jeffries  analysts wrote in late April 
Concur trades at 44 times expected earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   according to Starmine data  against a ratio of 30 for Salesforce com  N CRM  
The Concur board of directors has unanimously approved the transaction  which is expected to close before the end of the first quarter of next year  subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals

171008,392524,CRM,Is Salesforce com  CRM  Stock Outpacing Its Computer And Technology Peers This Year ,opinion,"Investors focused on the Computer and Technology space have likely heard of Salesforce com  CRM   but is the stock performing well in comparison to the rest of its sector peers  Let s take a closer look at the stock s year to date performance to find out 
Salesforce com is one of 632 individual stocks in the Computer and Technology sector  Collectively  these companies sit at  8 in the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different groups  measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the sector to gauge the strength of each group 
The Zacks Rank is a proven system that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions  highlighting a variety of stocks that are displaying the right characteristics to beat the market over the next one to three months  CRM is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  
Within the past quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CRM s full year earnings has moved 35 73  higher  This signals that analyst sentiment is improving and the stock s earnings outlook is more positive 
Based on the latest available data  CRM has gained about 23 61  so far this year  At the same time  Computer and Technology stocks have gained an average of 5 38   This means that Salesforce com is outperforming the sector as a whole this year 
Looking more specifically  CRM belongs to the Computer   Software industry  which includes 51 individual stocks and currently sits at  60 in the Zacks Industry Rank  On average  stocks in this group have gained 13 29  this year  meaning that CRM is performing better in terms of year to date returns 
Investors with an interest in Computer and Technology stocks should continue to track CRM  The stock will be looking to continue its solid performance ",2018-05-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-salesforcecom-crm-stock-outpacing-its-computer-and-technology-peers-this-year-200318403,200318403
171022,392538,CRM,HPE Vs  CRM  Which Enterprise Tech Stock Should You Buy ,opinion,"The enterprise technology industry has been a hot stock option for years  and most investors interested in this space have heard of Hewlett Packard Enterprise   NYSE HPE   and Salesforce   NYSE CRM    With both companies presenting positive yet distinct stock signals  which should investors hop on now  Let s dive right into the question 
HPE is an integrated systems company focused on enterprise offerings like IT solutions  servers  and cloud based products  The stock currently sports a  B  grade for Value and an  F  grade for Growth in our Style Scores System 
Meanwhile  Salesforce is a cloud based software company engaged in the customer relations management business  CRM is currently holding an  A  grade for Growth and an  F  grade for Value in our Style Scores System 
HPE and Salesforce are both Zacks Rank  2  Buy  options  so whichever direction an investor decides to move in  they can feel secure knowing that both stocks have an improving earnings outlook  Let s break down why each stock has received their respective Style Scores to help better choose an investment strategy 
Two Different Stories
A typical value investor will most likely invest in HPE  especially when compared to Salesforce  HPE currently has a P E ratio of 12 5  while Salesforce has a PE ratio of 59 3  This is the most popular metric used to determine value and is a measure of price divided by earnings  Here we see HP clearly trades at a discount to CRM based on this metric 
In regards to valuations  the P B ratio is also useful and helps compare a stock s market value with its book value  HP has a P B ratio of 1 1  which is a strong discount to Salesforce and its P B ratio of 9 4  These metrics highlight the huge discrepancies between HPE s  B  grade in Value and Salesforce s  F  in our Style Scores System 
Although these stocks may seem lopsided in these regards  Salesforce s strength and HPE s weakness lie in growth  Salesforce s arguably insane PE ratio is indicative of  fast growth to come in the near future to level out the price  while HPE s P E ratio is indicative of steady growth  but at a much slower rate 
In addition  Salesforce is expected to witness EPS growth of 24 2  on an annualized basis over the next three to five years  almost triple that of HPE s 8 5   This further supports the earlier notion that Salesforce stock is overvalued because of anticipation for massive growth 
Bottom Line
Both HPE and Salesforce are Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stocks  with overall positive earnings revisions  Although this is the case  they have very distinct and polar strengths and weaknesses  Overall  HPE is the best option for value investors  while Salesforce appeals to the growth investor

171042,392558,CRM,Salesforce com  CRM  Soars To A 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Salesforce com Inc   NYSE CRM    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 13 61  over the past month  CRM hit a new 52 week high of  124 69 in the previous session  Salesforce com has gained 21 76  since the start of the year compared to the 6 01  move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 8 88  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a fantastic record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on February 28  2018  Salesforce com reported EPS of  0 35 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 33 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1 34  
For the current fiscal year  Salesforce com is expected to post earnings of  2 03 per share on  12 65 billion in revenues  This represents a 50 37  change in EPS on a 20 72  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  2 56 per share on  15 07 billion in revenues  This represents changes of 26 32  and 19 14   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Salesforce com may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for CRM  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Salesforce com has a Value Score of F  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 61 45x current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 56 78x versus its peer group s average of 24 69x  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 54  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective Salesforce com Inc Price and Consensus
    Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Salesforce com currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Salesforce com meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though CRM shares could still be poised for more gains ahead ",2018-03-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/salesforcecom-crm-soars-to-a-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200296405,200296405

171074,392590,CRM,Founders Of Tableau Software Just Sold  66 Million Worth Of Stock,opinion,"Tableau Software  NYSE DATA  insiders have sold  66 6 million worth of stock since Tuesday  It s worth taking a closer look at the company with the stock trading at such a rich valuation 
Insider Selling  Tableau Software
A number of insiders have been selling shares of Tableau Software according to   Since August 9th  executives and directors have sold a total of  214 6 million worth of stock which represents 3 4  of the company s total market capitalization 
However  yesterday s  by Pat Hanrahan  Co Founder  Chief Scientist and Director  and Christian Chabot  Co Founder and Chairman  notably caught my eye  The two co founders have sold a total of  66 6 million worth of stock since Tuesday which is approximately 1 1  of Tableau Software s total market capitalization  These large trades propelled me to take a closer look at the company 
Potential Reasons For Insider Activity 
Tableau Software provides business analytics software products and was founded in 2003  Management of the company reported Q4  17 earnings on February 1st that easily beat Wall Street estimates  This led to a number of equity analysts either upgrading their rating or raising their target price on the stock  Shares immediately soared and hit a two year high  Management obviously wants to cash in on this and take some chips off the table as highlighted by the recent selling activity  But does this signal that management is less confident in the company s future prospects 
Analysts covering the stock often compare the company to a peer group that includes ServiceNow Inc  NYSE NOW   Salesforce com  NYSE CRM   Red Hat Inc  NYSE RHT  and New Relic Inc  NYSE NEWR   Analyzing Tableau Software s valuation metrics and ratios relative to its peer group offers insight into why insiders may be selling their shares   is the average annual growth rate of revenue over a five year period  It s calculated as follows 
5yr CAGR     Revenue FY 5   Revenue FY      1 5 years    1 
The chart below plots the five year revenue compound annual growths for Tableau Software  and it s peers 
The company s projected 5 year revenue CAGR of 11 2  is below all of its selected comparable public companies  NOW  29 7    CRM  19 7    RHT  13 8   and NEWR  28 4   
 is used to evaluate the ability of a company to create value for all its stakeholders  debt and equity   is another helpful metric that represents the dollars in earnings a company generates per dollar of assets  ROA is typically used to gauge the efficiency of the company and its management at deploying capital to generate income for shareholders  In general  a higher return on assets suggests management is utilizing the asset base efficiently 
Notice below the company s ROIC of  16 7  is only above NEWR   24 1   and below NOW   6 7    CRM  1 1    and RHT  15 9    Similarly  Tableau Software s ROA of  13 4  is again only above NEWR   17 9   and below NOW   6 3    CRM  0 1    and RHT  7 6   Although the company s growth prospects and returns are less attractive than its peers  its valuation multiples trade at a premium The company s shares last traded at  77 75 as of Thursday  up 43 0  over the last year  While the stock has made impressive gains  the recent insider transactions could signal a troubling road ahead for shareholders 
In addition to the premium valuation multiples  finbox io s average fair value estimate of  67 79 implies  12 8  downside and is calculated from 6 valuation models as shown in the table below  Each analysis uses consensus Wall Street estimates for the projections when available How Should You Interpret this 
While executives are always happy to tell you all the reasons why their stock is a buy  their actions can tell a different story about the company s future prospects  A trend of selling activity may indicate that insiders think the stock is going down over the upcoming time period  and are trying to sell before the price falls  Keep in mind that insider activity is only one aspect of stock research and that there are other important items to consider 
I recommend you continue to research Tableau Software to get a more comprehensive view of the company s fundamentals by looking at 
Valuation  how much upside do shares of Tableau Software have based on Wall Street s consensus price target  Take a look at our  that compares the company s upside relative to its peers 
Forecast  what is Tableau Software s projected EBITDA margin  Is the company expected to become profitable in the near future   
Risk Metrics  what is Tableau Software s asset efficiency  This ratio measures the amount of cash flow that a company generates from its assets

171121,392637,CRM,Guidewire  GWRE  Reports Loss In Q1 Earnings  Revenues Beat,opinion,Guidewire Software  Inc    NYSE GWRE   reported first quarter fiscal 2018 non GAAP loss of 6 cents per share  outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents per share  The reported figure was  however  much lower than the year ago bottom line figure of 2 cents per share The company posted revenues of  108 2 million  which increased 15  from the year ago quarter  The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  101 million and was above the guided range Management noted that the recent consolidated release of the Guidewire platform has been instrumental in the enhancement of its product suite  The company is also banking on its strategic partnership with Salesforce   NYSE CRM   for its growth Notably  the company is transforming to a subscription based model from a term license based one  which might hurt the top line in the near term  This is because term license revenues include advance payments and subscription based revenues are a bit delayed Nevertheless  management is extremely optimistic about the several cloud based products launched in the quarter  at a time when the P C insurance industry is moving steadily toward adoption of cloud solutions So far this year  Guidewire stock has gained 56 0   substantially outperforming the 27 5  rally of the  it belongs to Revenue Details The company has three main segments namely Maintenance  License and Other and Services Maintenance revenues amounted to  18 9 million  up 15  year over year  However  the same from License and other decreased 22  from the year ago quarter to  30 1 million  Service revenues surged 52  from the year ago quarter to  59 1 million Management stated that a substantial majority of the first quarter s revenues were from subscription based products  Backed by the strong performance of subscription products  management expected increase from subscription sales were in the range of 30  to 40  from 20  to 30  for fiscal 2018 However  growth of the Maintenance revenues that are part of subscriptions will be negatively impacted while the change in the company s business model is in progress  because of the delayed revenue recognition from the subscription based products  Per management  the license revenues will have a negative impact in fiscal 2018  The sales process might be a bit elongated due to the time taken by customers to choose between on premise and cloud delivery options  Perpetual license revenues facing a decline will be a further drag to the license and other revenues Meanwhile  services revenues were better than expected in the quarter  The segment is anticipated to improve its performance in the near term backed by proper implementations of InsuranceNow  Also  the corrective measures taken up via use of sub contractors to eradicate the capacity related constraints have been beneficial for the revenue generation at the Services segment Additionally  management is optimistic about the completion of the Cyence buyout that determines the economic impact of a cybercrime via a software platform  which is built on cyber security related data science  The integration of Cyence would imply that the company would be able to provide an entire life cycle to the insurance products starting from designing to transaction management Guidewire Software  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Margin DetailsIn first quarter fiscal 2018  non GAAP operating margin was 50 9  compared with 62  in the year ago quarter  The decline was slight owing to the negative impact of higher mix of low margin services revenues and shift in investments to the cloud based model According to management  Guidewire is investing more over impressive product suite that  might prove to be tailwinds for future growth  As of now  these are affecting the company s margins Balance SheetThe company had cash and cash equivalents of  653 5 on Oct 31  2017 as compared with  687 8 million in July 31  2017 GuidanceFor second quarter fiscal 2018  revenues are expected to be in the range of  152 to  156 million Non GAAP operating income is

It broke above that triangle in August  and started toward the target at 103 25  Mid September it came back to retest the break out and then reversed higher  It paused as it came back to the prior high and then Friday pushed through resistance to a new high  A Measured Move to the upside gives a target to 102 on this leg 
Momentum supports more upside price action  The RSI is rising and strong in the bullish zone  The MACD is also rising and positive  The Bollinger Bands  are also opening higher  There is no resistance over Friday s high  Support may come at 97 50 and 95 40 followed by 92  Short interest is low at 2 4   The company is expected to report earnings next November 15th 
The weekly options chain for this week show most open interest on the call side and it is spread from 95 to 104  The November monthly chain  the first covering the earnings report  also shows the majority of the open interest on the call side  It is biggest at the 97 50 strike and then the 100 strike then 95  The at the money straddle is pricing in a  4 50 move by November expiry  This bodes well for more upside

Elsewhere look for Gold to continue lower in the short run while Crude Oil slowly grinds higher  The US Dollar Index looks to continue consolidation with a possible reversal building while US Treasuries are heading lower 
The Shanghai Composite looks to mark time in the slow uptrend while Emerging Markets pause and possibly retest the recent breakout  Volatility looks to remain very low keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts agree with the only caution a possible pause in the QQQ  perhaps a rotation back to the IWM again  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

171220,392736,CRM,3 Marc Benioff Quotes Every Tech Investor Needs To See,opinion,"It has been an up and down week around the global markets already  and now that we have reached  hump day   some investors might be in need of some midweek motivation  And in honor of Salesforce s   NYSE CRM   earnings announcement last night  this week s edition of Wednesday Wisdom will feature words from the cloud king himself  Marc Benioff 
Benioff started developing software as a kid and was reportedly raking in nearly  1 500 from royalties on his self made computer games in high school  After spending the first 13 years of his career at Oracle   NYSE ORCL    Benioff left to found Salesforce  which would quickly become the worldwide leader in customer relations management software 
Just last night  Salesforce reported that it recently became the first enterprise cloud software company to break the  10 billion revenue run rate  and there s no doubt that Benioff s dynamic leadership was a major catalyst for this historic accomplishment  also read    
Benioff is  without question  one of the software industry s titans  and like the great minds of Bill Gates  Steve Jobs  and Larry Ellison  investors tend to listen when he speaks  So as earnings season wraps up and the technology sector remains relatively hot  let s take a look at three Benioff quotes that every tech investor should benefit from 
While this quote was likely aimed at the entrepreneurs and would be Benioffs of the world  it is also useful for tech investors to keep in mind  Are you just finally getting a grasp on the importance of the Internet of Things and self driving cars  Great  but you can bet it won t be long until the next big thing comes along  and you better be ready to adapt again 
Again  here we see Benioff speaking to the up and comers and dreamers throughout the industry  Benioff believes in the value of the beginner s mind the kind that is fresh  inspired  and without hesitation  This is important for seasoned investors to remember too  Even if you ve been trading stocks for years  the ability to approach your investment ideas with the excitement of a beginner can keep your portfolio crisp 
Of course  this is easier said than done  but its meaning remains the same  As investors  we must have an eye on the future at all times and we must be able to adapt to changes  What s the point of predicting something will happen if you don t have a winning strategy to profit from it

171255,392771,CRM,Opening Bell  Stocks Extend Fall On Central Banker Summit  Oil Slides,opinion,"by Pinchas Cohen
Key Events
Global stocks extended their declines from last week which was dominated by fiscal policy  This week  focus will shift toward monetary policy as Central Bankers will meet at Jackson Hole  Wyoming to undoubtedly a discuss what s on every participant s mind the persistence of low inflation 
Global Affairs
The STOXX Euro 600 Index is set for a third day decline  with little market participation  following lower averages in Sydney  Tokyo and Seoul  US futures are following global stocks decline  suggesting American stocks will extend their politically induced declines from last week 
In addition to an impotent US fiscal policy  and a monetary policy that can t seem to catch a break from non cooperative inflation levels  investors must also worry about geopolitics  including the recent European terror attacks and fresh tensions with North Korea 
As a result of such  the safe havens gold and yen gained  However  in stark contrast to normal market moves  the dollar also advanced 
This year s annual summit hosted by the Kansas City Fed at Jackson Hole  Wyoming will include the world monetary policy leaders Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi 
The central bankers must wrestle with finding the optimal path for interest rates  In the US  inflation is simply not picking up this year  Even though Europe is experiencing its biggest economic expansion since the Great Recession  it can t operate in a vacuum  and must consider how inflation in the United States and its slower path toward increasing the interest rate would affect the Eurozone  Additionally  while the EU is enjoying a bullish outlook  they face a rising euro  The rising currency could potentially hurt exports  as they would become more expensive for non EU countries 
In addition to any hints which may be provided on decision regarding interest rates  market participants will also listen for clues on Fed balance sheet reduction

The DAX has been trading in a short term falling trend since June 20  On August 11  it bounced off the uptrend line it has been on since June 24  2016  the day the Brexit vote results were revealed  The significance of this uptrend is confirmed by the 200 dma  red  that is retracing it 
However  although the price found support it stopped short of overcoming the short term downtrend  and has turned back down  On Friday  we saw a bearish indication  a dead cross execution  when the 50 dma  green  crossed below the 100 dma  blue  
The price is fluctuating  and is looking for an opening for the price to move into  either the short term downtrend line with a break above 12400 00 or a longer term uptrend line with a break below 11800 00 
Salesforce is scheduled to report its second quarter earnings results after the bell

While Salesforce  NYSE CRM  outperformed the S P 500 this year  32 percent versus the 8 percent  it has been unable to overcome the  91 level since May 
Bulls would point out that on Wednesday the price registered a fresh record  92 24 close  bears would argue that the Bearish Engulfing pattern on the following day by the resistance since May renders it moot or even shows the bulls are in a weaker position 
Between November 2015 and March 2017 the price has been trading within a massive ascending triangle  In the beginning of April that price provided an upside breakout  the implications of which provided a  30 upside move to 113  The price pressure since May would be part of a return move  which can return toward the low  80 s

Mario Draghi is set to speak after minutes from the Governing Council s July meeting released last week revealed that decision makers are still uncertain how to communicate upcoming changes in their policy settings  Previous changes have unintentionally caused unwarranted market fluctuations  such as when the ECB tried to distance itself from Draghi s July press conference in a failed attempt to ease euro bullishness

	The success of an investor depends on proper identification of overpriced toxic stocks and the rightly priced ones  However  the over bubble stocks and the fairly priced stocks are intermixed in the market place in such a way that it becomes very tough to differentiate between them  Investors who can figure out the toxic stocks and dump them at the right time are likely to benefit 

	Usually  toxic stocks are susceptible to external shocks and are burdened with huge amount of debt  Moreover  the price of the toxic stocks is unjustifiably high  The irrationally high price of the toxic stocks is only short lived as the intrinsic value of these stocks is lower than the current bloated price 
	The high price of the toxic stocks can be attributed to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some serious fundamental drawbacks in the stock  If you own such stocks for a long stretch of time  you are likely to witness huge erosion in your wealth 
	On the other hand  if you can pinpoint the toxic stocks  you may gain by resorting to an investing strategy called short selling  This strategy allows you to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls 
	While short selling excels in bear markets  it typically loses money in bull markets 
	So  identifying toxic stocks and disowning them at the right time is the key to shield your portfolio from big losses  Profits can be made by short selling them Screening Criteria
	Here is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks Most recent Debt Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average    High debt equity ratio implies high leverage  High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount P E using 12 month forward EPS estimate greater than 50   A very high forward P E implies that a stock is highly overvalued   Change in F  1  and F  2  Estimate  12 Weeks  less than  5    Negative EPS estimate revision for this and the next fiscal year during the past 12 weeks points to analysts  pessimism Zacks Rank more than or equal to  3  Hold    We have not considered Buy rated stocks that generally outperform the market

quarter  Adjusted operating expenses as percentage of revenues decreased 90 bps to 54 2  The decrease can primarily be attributed to lower hardware and sales   marketing expenses  which were down 140

to be about  1 billion in fiscal 2017  roughly equivalent to fiscal 2017 level ARR is projected to be better than fiscal 2017  Further  management anticipates SaaS gross margin to eventually rise to 80  in the long haul Our TakeOracle continues to gain traction on its cloud endeavors  Specifically  the company s offerings in SaaS and PaaS have gained significant momentum in the past few quarters  which improves competitive position against salesforce com and Workday  Further  the continuing transition to cloud from on premise as reflected by the AT T   NYSE T   deal is a key catalyst We believe the company s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top line growth for the foreseeable future  Moreover  Oracle continues to win new customers in HCM  ERP and CX However  higher

171336,392852,CRM,Salesforce Vs  Oracle  Which Stock Is The Better Buy ,opinion,"As the technology sector continues its full blown shift to cloud computing  investors interested in this space tend to run into the same few names  We all know about Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and its profit driving Web Services unit  and there s been plenty said about Microsoft s   OTC MFST   Azure division 
Today  we re going to be looking at two of the other cloud computing leaders  Oracle   NYSE ORCL   and Salesforce   NYSE CRM   
Of course  these competitors have much different stories  As we know  Oracle is a software behemoth and has a massive footprint in several markets  while Salesforce founded by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff is the cloud based CRM king 
Nevertheless  the two companies directly compete in the customer relationship and enterprise computing spaces  and the love hate rivalry between their two top executives has been well documented over the years 
And if an investor can find room for both of these cloud giants in their portfolio  I say more power to them  But for those who are looking for just one cloud stock right now  let s put Salesforce and Oracle head to head to see which one comes out on top 
Head to Head
As we jump into our head to head comparison of Salesforce and Oracle  let s take a look at some key metrics for both of these stocks 
As you can see right off the bat  Oracle has the edge in our key Zacks metrics  Thanks to an earnings beat in its most recent quarter  as well as one positive full year earnings estimate revision within the last 60 days  Oracle has moved up to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
And while neither stock has very impressive VGM grades  Oracle has the slight edge  Trend focused investors should not that Oracle has  B  grades for both Value and Momentum  On the other hand  Salesforce has a  B  grade for Growth 
On the topic of growth  we see some interesting figures here  For Oracle  it s clear that the company is at a point where year over year comparisons will be challenging  However  investors should note that the company s current fiscal year is up in May  Looking ahead  we expect to see earnings growth of 8 5  on sales growth of 3  next year 
For Salesforce  the sales growth is clearly still there  but as has always been the case for the company  earnings are a slight concern  Salesforce has historically struggled to turn a GAAP profit  but its attractiveness as a growth stock is boosted by its consistent revenue gains 
Based on the Zacks metrics  we ll have to give Oracle the nod here  But remember that the Zacks Rank is a 1 3 month indicator  and in the long term  both of these companies stand to benefit from their dominant positions in the cloud computing space

Our system looks at six key metrics   
Earnings per Share   EPS  Growth  Salesforce reported a recent EPS growth rate of  75   That s below the software industry average of 12 28   That s not a good sign  We like to see companies that have higher earnings growth 
Price to Earnings   P E   The average price to earnings ratio of the software industry is 69 82  And Salesforce s ratio comes in at 342 46  Its valuation looks expensive compared to many of its competitors 
Debt to Equity   The debt to equity ratio for Salesforce stock is 26 78  That s below the software industry average of 59 65  The company is less leveraged 
Free Cash Flow per Share Growth   Salesforce s FCF has been higher than its competitors over the last year  That s good for investors  In general  if a company is growing its FCF  it will be able to pay down debt  buy back stock  pay out more in dividends and or invest money back into the business to help boost growth  It s one of our most important fundamental factors 
Profit Margins   The profit margin of Salesforce comes in at  2 24  today  And generally  the higher  the better  We also like to see this margin above that of its competitors  Salesforce s profit margin is above the software average of  22 86   So that s a positive indicator for investors

54 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny Excluding stock based compensation  earnings increased 5 3  on a year over year basis to 60 cents  which was slightly better than management s guided range of 57 59 cents  The growth reflected benefits from operational efficiencies that boost operating margin in the quarter Revenues declined 0 5  year over year to  11 94 billion but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  11 89 billion  Management had anticipated revenues to decline in the range of 2  or remain flat on a year over year basis However  Cisco s fourth quarter outlook was disappointing  Revenues are anticipated to decline primarily due to lower order growth in the reported quarter  which affected backlog  Management anticipates order growth to remain weak in the fourth quarter  similar to the third quarter level  Cisco Systems  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise     Moreover  ongoing transition to subscription based model will continue to hurt top line  The company also expects macro related headwinds in the public sector  particularly the U S  federal government business to impact revenues Further  weakness in the service provider business segment in the Americas and intensifying competition from the likes of Huawei in the emerging markets are other concerns that will continue to hurt top line growth Shares of the company fell more than

Switching  Wireless  Security and Other increased 2   13   9   and 57   respectively  on a year over year basis  However  this increase was partially offset by weak performance from NGN Routing  Collaboration  Data Center and Service Provider Video segments which decreased 2   4   5  and 30   respectively Geographically  on a year over year basis  revenues from the Americas and EMEA declined 4   and 6   respectively  Weak service provider business in the Americas  foreign currency exchange volatility in the U K  and oil price related uncertainty in the Middle East hurt top line growth APJC revenues increased 2  driven by solid growth in India and modest growth in Australia and Japan  Growth in China was affected by tough year over year comparisons  due to service provider video business in the year ago quarter  Total emerging markets declined 12  while the BRICs plus Mexico  down 49  year over year  went down 10  In terms of customer segments enterprise declined 2   public sector declined 4  and service provider dipped 10   However  commercial grew 3   not as healthy as management anticipated  in the reported quarter  Weak European market impacted growth in both enterprise and commercial segments Operating DetailsNon GAAP gross margin  including stock based compensation  contracted 200 basis points  bps  from the year ago quarter to 62  in the reported quarter  The expansion can primarily be attributed to higher service gross margin  up 210 bps  Operating expenses as percentage of revenues decreased 310 bps to 37 9  primarily owing to decrease in most of the expense line items  As percentage of revenues  Research and development  R D   General and Administrative  G A  and Sales and Marketing  S M  expense declined 90 bps  170 bps and 60 bps  respectively As a result  operating margin  including stock based compensation  expanded 110 bps to 24 2  AcquisitionsCisco completed the acquisition of AppDynamics during the quarter  Moreover  the

industry leading cloud first software defined  SD  WAN platform that addresses the Edge networking needs of the company s most demanding customers  The acquisition is expected to close in the second half of calendar 2017 MindMeld is a privately held artificial intelligence  AI  company  Cisco expects MindMeld to simplify and enhance the collaboration experience even further through the power of AI and machine learning MindMeld is expected to power new conversational interfaces for Cisco s collaboration products  simplifying user interaction with the company s technology as well as increasing

is expected to be in the range of 63 64   while operating margin is anticipated between 29 5  and 30 5  for the quarter Our TakeWe believe that Cisco s expanding footprint in the rapidly growing security and data center market are promising  The company s security solutions continue to add customers  which is positive in our view Additionally  the company s partnerships with the likes of salesforce com   NYSE CRM   and International Business Machines   NYSE IBM   will help it to gain significant traction in the cloud and Internet of Things  IoT  market space in the long run Moreover  continued share buyback and dividend hikes are positive in our view However  the disappointing fourth quarter guidance will weigh on the share price at least in the near term Zacks Rank   Key PickCisco currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Extreme Networks   NASDAQ EXTR   carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  is a stock worth looking in the sector  You can see  Long term earnings growth rate

171463,392979,CRM,Your Two Minute Earnings Preview For Salesforce  CRM  Stock ,opinion,"This video takes a quick look at Salesforce com  NYSE CRM  shares ahead of their earnings report  This cloud focused company has been in the news a lot lately  and it is undoubtedly looking to get back on track and stretch back to 52 week highs following this report 
However  investors should note that CRM shares have very mediocre fundamentals  which include a Zacks Rank  3  hold  and a  C  grade for its VGM score  So  overall earnings estimates have been mixed  while the company s poor value metrics  F grade here  are balanced by its strong showing on the growth front  A grade in this area  
Still  investors should note that the company is in the top 40  from an industry rank look  so the overall fundamentals for the segment appear to be relatively strong  But one caveat to this is CRM s extremely poor history in earnings season  as the company has missed estimates in two of the last four quarters  and it had a six quarter streak without a beat not too long ago SALESFORCE COM Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   
It is hard to trust CRM based on these numbers  and especially with a downward slope on the estimate front  This is an area of the market where guidance is usually key though  so be on the lookout for this to override any sort of negativity we see in the near term metrics for the report 
Salesforce com reports after the bell on 11 17 and we are looking for earnings of  0 03 per share  before non recurring items   Make sure to watch the video for a quick guide to CRM stock heading into the report  That said  if you want to learn more about trading in earnings season  then check out David Bartosiak s views on Salesforce  Furthermore  he gives us some ideas on how to play the options market  and you can watch his views below

171484,393000,CRM,New Highs For The Holidays ,opinion,"Technology finally joined the party on Tuesday  as the NASDAQ left its counterparts in the dust with an advance of 1 1  to 5275 6  Since the election  the space had been lagging other industries like financials and industrials  Meanwhile  the Dow kept up its winning ways with a seventh straight session of gains  improving 0 29  to 18 923 1  The S P went from a breakeven performance on Monday to a 0 75  increase on Tuesday to 2180 4  The Russell was also at a new high  suggesting that the small caps are coming along for the ride as well  
Much of this rally can be credited to the end of the election  but it should also be mentioned that the economy continues to release solid numbers  Today  the retail sales report beat expectations with a 0 8  increase  while there was an upswing in activity for the Empire State Manufacturing Survey  The end of the election and solid fundamentals have the editors talking about S P 2200 and new highs once again  We will make new highs before Thanksgiving  Maybe even before the week is out   said Steve in RTA  Kevin Matras thinks we will eventually hit 2400  but didn t say when  And in Counterstrike  Jeremy stated    N ow the bears are in trouble as a break higher will bring about 2200 quickly   see more on this below  
The portfolios were active yet again Tuesday as RTA used the sector rotation to sell parts of two names for big profits and then added more of two other positions that were beaten down without reason  Zacks Short List had four swaps this week  including two names with solid returns  Large Cap Trader added its next two buys  while Brian bought one position each in Game Changers and Stocks Under  10  Learn more about all this in the highlights section Big Returns for RTA and Short List
  When the Reitmeister Trading Alert bought MKS Instruments  MKSI   Steve thought that this semiconductor related name could get back to its previous high of  54 73  Well  the sector rotation made that a reality  The editor trimmed the position on Tuesday for a nice profit of 19   The portfolio now holds a 6 2  allocation in the name  By the way  RTA also gave American Woodmark  AMWD  a haircut as we re nearing its quarterly report  Steve lessened the position s risk and got a solid return of 9 6   The portfolio still has a 6  allocation  There were also buys today  see below  
  This week s adjustment for Zacks Short List had four swaps  including the short coverings of Salesforce com  NYSE CRM  for a nice 10  profit and Paycom Software  PAYC  for a solid 7 8  gain  Learn about all of today s buys and sells below Today s Portfolio Highlights 
  The next two picks for Large Cap Trader were released this morning  each with 8  allocations  Firstly  John added Regeneron Pharma  REGN   a biopharma company that s focused on treatment for serious medical conditions  This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  has a Zacks VGM Score of  B  and is part of a space in the top 32  of the Zacks Industry Rank  REGN had a positive EPS surprise of 6  in its most recent report  Annual EPS for 2016 is around  8 65  before improving to  9 10 in 2017 
The other buy today was Lennox International  LII   a provider of climate control solutions  Therefore  it s part of the Building Products Air conditioning   Heating industry  which puts it in the top 8     of the Zacks Industry Rank  It has a Zacks VGM Score of  A  and  like REGN  reported a positive earnings surprise of 6  in its most recent announcement  Get a lot more information on both of these new buys in the complete commentary 
  Sector rotations are crazy things  Sometimes they create quick profits  such as the 19  surge for MKSI mentioned above   but other times it beats down undeserving companies  Steve LOVES to capitalize on illogical plunges  so he couldn t resist the  insane  selloff in Dick s Sporting Goods  DKS  despite a solid quarter  The editor added more shares of DKS on Tuesday for Reitmeister Trading Alert  bringing the portfolio s allocation up to 9 1   But that wasn t all  Euronet Worldwide  EEFT  also took a beating unnecessarily  prompting Steve to add more shares to that position as well and bringing the allocation up to 7 5   Read the full write up for a lot more on all of today s moves 
  Shares of Mastec  MTZ  soared approximately 20  since the election  but that didn t scare off Brian from adding this construction services company to Game Changers on Tuesday  This move is part of the editor s plan to realign the portfolio with the new administration taking power next year  On Monday  he added four names and let us know another one was coming today  MTZ is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  with a Zacks Style Score of  A  for growth and  B  for value  Brian is putting the remaining cash into MTZ  Read the full write up for more specifics on this new addition

  The first of three new additions to Stocks Under  10 was released on Tuesday  The portfolio picked up The Container Store Group  Inc   TCS   a specialty retailer of storage and organizational products  The stock had a dramatic run up yesterday  but Brian thinks there s still more upside to come  He is especially emboldened by TCS  status as a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and the Zacks Style Scores of  A  across the board  Get a lot more info on this new addition in the complete write up    Oil and Tech gave equities an extra push that was missing over the last few trading days  The help was needed to test the 2175 level on the S P futures and now the bears are in trouble as a break higher will bring about 2200 quickly  The Trump rally is confirmed now  a full 7  higher from the panic selling just a week ago  I have 2240 targets in the S P 500 and I wouldn t be surprised if we see this target hit before Christmas  Looking at the portfolio  four out of five stocks performed well today  With the markets breaking out  Counterstrike will be maintaining the long only portfolio for the time being  It s just too hard to be short at the moment   said Jeremy in Zacks Counterstrike  who plans to add a couple more stocks in the next few days

171505,393021,CRM,4 Trade Ideas For Salesforce com,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Salesforce com made a low in February after a more that 355 drop over 2 months  The path higher took the next 4 months and made a new higher high in June  From there the stock price languished moving in consolidation against a falling trend resistance and horizontal support  A descending triangle had formed  It broke that triangle to the downside in September  eventually retracing 50  of the move higher from that February low and at the target move out of the triangle 
The Spinning Top doji at the low was confirmed higher the next day and the stock has been moving higher since  Friday saw it end the week back just under  76  which has been an important price level since early May  first as support in the triangle  and then since September as resistance 
As it sits there the RSI is rising and on the edge of a move into the bullish zone while the MACD is rising and positive  The Bollinger Bands are also opening to the upside to allow a move higher  There is a gap to fill to 78 94 above and resistance above 76 stands at 77 70 and then 80 40 and 82 70 before the 84 48 top  Support lower may come at 74 and 72 followed by 70 and 68  Short interest is low at 2 8  
The November 4 Expiry options chain shows large open interest on the call side at the 74 50 and 75 strikes and then again at the 79 strike  The November monthly chain  the first after the company reports earnings on the 17th  shows open interest much larger on the call side and biggest at the 72 5  75 and 77 50 strikes 
Salesforce com Inc  NYSE CRM 
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 76 with a stop at 74 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock on a move over 76 with a November 75 70 Put Spread   1 75  and selling a December 85 Call  55 cents  
Trade Idea 3  Buy a November 75 77 5 Call Spread   1 20  and sell the November 70 Put  95 cents  
Trade Idea 4  Buy the November December 80 Call Calendar  70 cents  and sell the November 70 Put  95 cents  
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which heading into the last week full week before the election the equity markets continue to look troubled on the short timeframe  with the weakness starting to leak into the longer timeframe for the small caps 
Elsewhere look for Gold to drift higher while Crude Oil continues the short term move lower  The US Dollar Index looks ready for consolidation or a pullback short term while US Treasuries are biased lower  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue to drift higher as Emerging Markets are biased to the downside in consolidation 
Volatility looks to remain in the normal range but creeping up so adding a headwind for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts also show short term weakness with the IWM the weakest as it falls and the SPY next but the QQQ still holding near all time highs  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

171555,393071,CRM,Teck Resources  Sociedad Quimica Y Minera  Salesforce com  Twitter And Walt Disney Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   October 06  2016    highlights definitely Teck Resources  NYSE      as the Bull of the Day and Sociedad Quimica y Minera  NYSE      as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Salesforce com  NYSE CRM   NYSE      Twitter Inc   NYSE     and Walt Disney Co   NYSE      

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

  

	With concerns building over the Federal Reserve and their interest rate policy to close out the year  some investors are starting to worry about the health of the materials market  After all  a stronger dollar would hamper commodity prices  and many stocks have begun to see higher volatility levels thanks to these fears 

	However  investors shouldn t throw out all stocks in this industry due to these concerns  as there are still several gems out there  This includes the broader miscellaneous mining segment  which actually has a top 10  industry rank right now and has plenty of promising names that could be solid investments no matter what the Fed does in the next few months 

	One to keep an eye on in particular from this group is definitely Teck Resources  NYSE       This roughly  10 billion Canadian company mines various products such as zinc  gold  copper  and coal and it has been surging for much of 2016  In fact  the company has jumped by over 160  so far in 2016  and with an  A  momentum grade  there is plenty of reason to think it can still march higher  But momentum isn t the only reason to like TCK these days  as it has several other strong fundamental factors backing up its near term potential 

TCK in Focus

	A crucial aspect to consider when evaluating TCK stock is its most recent earnings estimate revisions  Analysts following the stock have been universally raising their earnings estimates for the full year and the next year period  while current quarter estimates are also on the rise 

	But it isn t just the agreement among analysts  as the magnitude of these revisions has also been strong  This is particularly true when you look to the current year and next year consensus estimates  which have seen astounding growth in the past few weeks  The current full year estimate has jumped by over 60  in the past two months  while the following year has surged by over 70  as well 

	But before you worry about TCK living up to these juiced estimates  consider its recent track record in earnings season  The company hasn t missed estimates in any of its last five quarters  while it has  on average  more than doubled the consensus estimate at earnings season over the past year 

  

	Many materials stocks are on a nice run here in 2016  with strong gains seen in many business segments  Yet  with possible Fed action coming  questions are starting to appear regarding a variety of commodity plays 

	This is especially true in the fertilizer and broad commodity markets  as this industry has a  of all that we cover right now  In fact  not a single stock in the group has a rank above  hold   suggesting broad based weakness for this market  Today though  I wanted to take a quick look at one you need to avoid in particular  Sociedad Quimica y Minera  NYSE        a Santiago  Chile based giant that may be poised for a drop soon 

Why SQM May Be in Trouble

	SQM has been on a tear so far in 2016  as the stock has added close to 50  in the time frame  While the bulk of the gains came in February and March  SQM is actually on a nice run over the past few weeks  and the stock is back at fresh 52 week highs 

	This may turn out to be a great time for investors to sell though  as recent trends have actually been moving decidedly against the stock  In particular  the fundamental picture is pretty poor for SQM  as the stock has a VGM score of  F  

	This includes some pretty poor grades for its value and growth component scores too  SQM actually has a grade of  F  for value  thanks to its PE of 25 which is higher than the industry average  and a P S ratio that is double the industry average  Additionally  SQM has a grade of  D  for growth thanks to a projected double digit percentage decline in current cash flow growth  and a ROE that is below the industry average 

Earnings Estimates

	But the weak fundamentals aren t the only reasons to avoid SQM stock  as the company also has been seeing sluggish earnings estimates  In fact  the current consensus is roughly 8 5  lower than it was 60 days ago  while we see a similar negative trend for the following year as well  And even worse for SQM is that the most recent earnings estimates have been even lower  with the Most Accurate Estimate about 4 6  lower than the consensus 

	While this is obviously poor news  it also doesn t help that SQM has a pretty bad track record of living up to earnings expectations  The company has missed estimates in three of the last four quarters and its average miss in the past year is approaching 17

Why Did Salesforce  CRM  Stock Tank Wednesday 

	While Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff appears to be very serious about acquiring the struggling social networking company  its investors do not seem to like the idea 

	On Wednesday  shares of cloud computing giant Salesforce com  NYSE     were tumbling  down around 6 5  in afternoon trading after reports tying it more closely to a sale bid for Twitter Inc   NYSE      have surfaced 

	According to the   who cite unnamed sources  Mr  Benioff believes Twitter to be an  unpolished jewel  and has a desire to make it a  great company  

	But this will be harder than it looks  Salesforce has been busy these past few months  spending over  4 billion on acquisitions  so a Twitter buyout could seriously hurt the company s valuation  According to   Mizuho analyst Abhey Lamba estimates that purchasing Twitter could  destroy  12 17 billion  20 25   of  Salesforce s  value  which could take 2 3 years to recapture if all goes well   said in a research note 

	Along with depleting up to a quarter of its valuation  Salesforce will have to deal with Twitter s notoriously jumbled management team  potentially a situation that could cost the company even more money and further strain its growth 

	Twitter investors  on the other hand  seem to be happy at the reports  TWTR stock is up around 7  in afternoon trading to  25 17 per share 

	Salesforce isn t the only company seemingly interested in buying Twitter  Media conglomerate Walt Disney Co   NYSE      has also reportedly shown interest in making a sales bid

Analyst s Comments
For fiscal 2Q17  analysts expect Salesforce to post revenue and non GAAP  generally accepted accounting principles  EPS  earnings per share  of   2 0 billion and  0 22  respectively  It is very likely that Salesforce s fiscal 2Q17 results will follow its past trends and meet or exceed analysts  expectations 
For fiscal 2Q17  Salesforce has provided revenue and EPS  earnings per share  guidance in the range of  2 01 billion to  2 02 billion and  0 24 to  0 25  respectively 
However  Piper Jaffray is not very optimistic about Salesforce s impending fiscal 2Q17 results  According to Investor s Business Daily  Alex Zukin  an analyst with Piper Jaffray  stated that  our checks indicate a somewhat lighter new business quarter than prior periods with typical Q2 seasonality combining with a few one time factors  
However  the research house clarified that it does  not believe these issues to be structural or competitive in nature   As a result  it did not adjust the rating or price target on Salesforce stock  Piper Jaffray has an  overweight  rating on Salesforce s stock  with a  100 price target

171661,393177,CRM,Demandware Climbs On Acquisition,opinion,"DemandWare Inc   NYSE DWRE  is having an incredibly strong day in the market today  and for good reason  Early this morning  it was announced that the company would be acquired in a deal with Salesforce com  NYSE CRM   Today  we ll talk about the details of the acquisition  how investors are reacting to the news  and what we can expect to see from DWRE and CRM moving forward  So  let s get right to it 
CRM To Acquire DWRE
As mentioned above  Demandware is having an incredibly strong day after announcing news that it would be acquired by salesforce com  According to the agreement surrounding the acquisition  CRM will be paying DWRE  75 per share in order to acquire the company in an all cash transaction  At the price per share offered  the total that will be paid for DWRE comes to a whopping  2 8 billion  The transaction is scheduled to take place during salesforce s second fiscal quarter of 2017  which will end on July 31  2016 
Why Would Salesforce com Want To Acquire Demandware 
According to several analysts  corporate spending on digital commerce platforms will likely grow at more than 14  annually  This will bring the market value to  8 544 billion per year by 2020  DWRE is currently holding a leadership position in the industry  and it will extend salesforce com s leadership role  The company is hoping that by acquiring Demandware  it will be in a position to capture the multi billion dollar digital commerce market using a product that will be called Salesforce Commerce Cloud 
The Commerce Cloud will soon be an integral part of the Salseforce Customer Success Platform  The platform will give companies the opportunity to reach out to and connect with their customers in new ways  This is actually a great thing for customers of both companies  As a result of the acquisition  salesforce com customers will be able to access the industry leading enterprise cloud commerce platform  However  DWRE customers aren t left out  they will now have access to salesforce com s leading sales services  All in all  this is a great move on both sides of the fence 
How The Market Is Reacting To The News
As investors  we know that the news moves the market  Any time there s positive news released that is associated with a publicly traded company  we can expect to see gains  For DWRE investors  the news that was released was overwhelmingly positive  After all  the acquisition price comes at an incredible premium  As a result  the stock is climbing dramatically in the market today  Currently  12 32   the stock is trading at  74 7 per share after a gain of  26 72 per share or 55 68  thus far today 
When it comes to salesforce com however  things aren t going quite as well  At this point  it seems as though investors are uncertain as they weigh the cost associated with the multi billion dollar acquisition  Currently  12 36   CRM is trading at  83 60 per share after a slight loss of  0 11 per share or 0 13  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have an overwhelmingly bullish opinion of what we can expect to see from both DWRE and CRM  The reality is that the acquisition that was announced today is a match made in heaven  Both companies compliment each other incredibly well  This will likely lead to long run gains on both sides of the fence

171663,393179,CRM,Salesforce  CRM  Inks Its Biggest Deal  Buys Demandware ,opinion,Growth through acquisitions continues for salesforce com   NYSE CRM    The company has recently entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the provider of software as a service e commerce solutions  Demandware  Inc    NYSE DWRE   for approximately  2 8 billion Headquartered in Burlington  MA  Demandware delivers support for websites  mobile applications and digital storefronts  It provides Demandware Commerce Center  Demandware LINK  Development Platform and Commerce Cloud  Its customers include multinational corporations  retailers  and branded consumer product manufacturers Financial Terms of the TransactionAs a result of this agreement  Salesforce will be making a purchase offer for all the outstanding shares of Demandware for  75 00 per share in cash  The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 Demandware shares jumped 56  in response  above the closing price of  47 9  that the company witnessed this Tuesday  and reached a level of  74 8 in pre market trade on Wednesday  We believe this is an expensive acquisition by Salesforce  so there was minimal impact on its share price in Wednesday s early trade Benefits of the DealThe acquisition will add value to Salesforce s existing portfolio  Not only will it enhance the process efficiency of both the companies  but it will also make the CRM platform more efficient in handling sales  marketing and service functions The digital marketing capability of Demandware will empower Salesforce to create a strong marketing platform  The deal will bring competitive advantage for Salesforce and will help the company to gain market share from traditional software providers such as Oracle Corp   NYSE ORCL   and SAP SE   TO SAP    both of which already offer cloud based e commerce services So  this acquisition will make it easy for Salesforce com to tap the digital e commerce marketing business  This is the largest acquisition that the company has made to date On the other hand  this will be a favorable deal for Demandware  given the scope for growth  As Tom Ebling  CEO of Demandware puts it  Becoming part of Salesforce will accelerate our vision to empower the world s leading brands with the most innovative digital commerce solutions that enable them to connect 1 1 with customers across any channel  Financial Impact of the DealThe aforementioned deal is expected to boost Salesforce revenues by  100 million to  120 million in fiscal year 2017  However  the deal is expected to decrease fiscal year 2017 non GAAP EPS by approximately 7 cents Revenues for second quarter 2017 are expected to increase by up to  10 million  whereas second quarter 2017 non GAAP EPS is expected to by be down 3 cents Buoyed by the above forecast  Salesforce updated its guidance provided on May 18  2016  Salesforce now projects second quarter 2017 revenues between  2 005 billion and  2 025  previously  2 005 billion and  2 015 billion   representing 23  to 24  year over year increase  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  1 983 billion  The company expects non GAAP earnings per share in the range of 21 22 cents  previously 24 25 cents   The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 9 cents The company now expects revenues in the range of  8 26 billion to  8 32 billion  up from the previous projection of  8 16 billion to  8 20  representing 24  25  year over year increase  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  8 128 billion  Similarly  non GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2017 are now projected to come between 93 cents and 95 cents compared with the earlier guidance of  1 00 and  1 02  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 36 cents Few ProjectionsAccording to Centaur Partners  Software as a Service  SaaS  and cloud based business applications are likely to grow from  13 5 billion in 2013 to  32 8 billion in 2016  reflecting a compounded annual growth rate  CAGR  of 19 5  Another research firm  IDC projected last year that public IT cloud services spending would grow at a five year CAGR of 22 8  to over  127 billion in 2018  The growth rate is six times that of the broader IT market  In 2018  public IT cloud services will make up more than 50  of global software and storage development According to the research firm  Gartner  worldwide spending on digital commerce platforms will grow over 14  annually  reaching  8 544 billion by 2020 Therefore  we believe that this acquisition will help Salesforce gain significant market traction in this space To Sum UpCloud computing is a flourishing part of the technology space and has been gaining momentum in recent years   Therefore  companies are acquiring assets across the world to achieve their long term goals We believe that Salesforce s sustained focus on expanding business through strategic acquisitions and investments will drive growth over the long run Going forward  we consider the rapid adoption of the Salesforce Customer Platform to be a positive  Overall  the company s diverse cloud offerings and considerable spending on digital marketing remain catalysts In view of increasing customer adoption and satisfactory performances  market research firm Gartner acknowledged Salesforce as the leading social CRM solution provider  We believe that the rapid adoption of Salesforce s platforms indicates solid growth opportunities in the ever growing cloud computing segment Salesforce has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  ,2016-06-01,Zacks Investment

171664,393180,CRM,Salesforce com Investors Lose Big In Demandware Acquisition,opinion,"Under even the most optimistic integration scenarios  we believe that Salesforce com Inc  NYSE CRM  proposed acquisition of DemandWare Inc  NYSE DWRE  for  75 share or  2 85 billion represents an unacceptable transfer of wealth from CRM to DWRE shareholders  As noted in prior reports  Demandware is far from profitable  Salesforce is not much better  Our models show that more than  2 billion of the  2 8 billion purchase is an overpayment and a direct destruction of value for CRM shareholders 
Salesforce Is Spending On A Profitless Business
Since going public  Demandware s operations have focused on revenue growth with no regard to the bottom line  The company s after tax profit  NOPAT  has declined from   7 million in 2012 to   38 million in fiscal year 2015  Conversely  Demandware s revenue has grown from  79 million in 2012 to  254 million over the last twelve months  TTM   per Figure 1 
Figure 1  Demandware s Growing Losses

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Acquisition Is A Misallocation Of Capital
In a nutshell  Salesforce is paying  2 8 billion to acquire an unprofitable company  Demandware lost   38 million in NOPAT in the last twelve months   The deal generates an ROIC of  1   which is lower than Salesforce s 2  ROIC and well below the company s 9  weighted average cost of capital  WACC   To justify paying  75 share  Salesforce would need  at a minimum  Demandware s NOPAT  assuming no capex  to be  257 million or 9  of the  2 8 billion purchase price  At that level  the deal would earn Salesforce an ROIC equal to its WACC  which is still a low hurdle  but at least the deal would not destroy value 
How Much Is Salesforce Overpaying 
To get a sense of how much shareholder value Salesforce is destroying  let s look at some reasonable scenarios for how much the company can improve Demandware s business so that it generates some cash flow  First  we account for liabilities that investors may not be aware of that make DWRE more expensive than the accounting numbers would suggest 
 68 million in   4  of market cap prior to acquisition announcement 
 31 million in   2  of market cap prior to acquisition announcement 
Next  Figures 2 and 3 show the implied stock prices that Salesforce should pay for DWRE to achieve a ROIC equal to its WACC  assuming different scenarios for revenue growth and NOPAT margins  In each of these scenarios  we conservatively assume that Salesforce can grow Demandware s revenue and NOPAT without spending on working capital or fixed assets  In Figure 2  the revenue growth scenarios assume that upon acquisition  DWRE immediately achieves Salesforce s NOPAT margin of 2 1   The current margin is  14 9  
Figure 2  Implied Acquisition Prices For CRM To Achieve 9  ROIC with 2 1  NOPAT margin
Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings    values in millions except per share amounts  
The big takeaway from Figure 2 is that even if Demandware grows revenue by 50  compounded annually for the next five years  the most Salesforce should pay to ensure an ROIC equal to WACC is  11 share  or  2 4 billion  85   less than the proposed purchase price  For reference  Demandware grew revenue by 48  in 2015  and consensus estimates peg revenue growth at 28  in 2016 
Figure 3  Implied Acquisition Prices For CRM To Achieve 9  ROIC with 4 2  NOPAT margin
Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings    values in millions except per share amounts  
In Figure 3  the revenue growth scenarios assume that upon acquisition  DWRE immediately achieves a 4 2  NOPAT margin  which is double CRM s TTM NOPAT margin  Even in this scenario  the most Salesforce should pay for DWRE is  22 share  or 71  below the actual acquisition price 
In addition to significantly higher revenue growth expectations  both scenarios are made more optimistic by the high NOPAT margin estimates  DWRE s TTM NOPAT margin was  14 9   
The bottom line is that Salesforce s management should have some explaining to do to justify this acquisition at  75 share 
Implied Synergies Are Unreasonable
The only reason for a firm to pay a premium over the market value for another firm is if the acquiring firm believes there are significant synergies attainable through acquisition  As the deal is constructed  Salesforce is paying a premium of  27 01 share  from 5 31 16 close price   or slightly over  1 billion above market price  Salesforce has yet to make any mention of the dollar value of synergies between the two companies 
Conclusion
Until investors hold management accountable for intelligent capital allocation  they can expect companies to continue to destroy shareholder value without feeling any accountability to their investors  Given our analysis above  we think it fair to ask both management teams how this deal is fair to their investors  The answer for DWRE investors appears easy  The answer for CRM investors is not so easy

Good Projections
For the first quarter of its fiscal 2017  Salesforce posted earnings of eight cents per share  which was on par with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Today s trading activity is more so inspired by its improved guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of the year 
The company upped its Q2 revenue projection to a range of  2 005 billion to  2 015 billion  which would represent an increase of 23  year over year  Our current consensus estimate calls for revenues of  1 983 billion in the quarter 
Furthermore  Salesforce upped its full year guidance  For fiscal 2017  the customer relationship management innovator expects revenues to fall between  8 16 billion and  8 20 billion  This estimate comes in ahead of our current consensus estimate of  8 129 billion 
Salesforce s projected growth highlights its capacity for growth compared to its competitors  The company s earnings are currently expected to grow by over 350   the industry average EPS growth is just 4 55   Its projected sales growth of 22  also exceeds the industry average  which comes in at 5 05   These metrics have helped earn Salesforce an  A  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system 
Don t Lose Your Head In The Cloud 
While Salesforce is showing several good signs  it isn t quite a  must buy  right now  One of the most glaring reasons why some investors may want to avoid the stock right now is its weak value metrics  Currently  CRM holds an  F  in the Style Scores Value category 
Salesforce is showing relatively weak value related ratios  especially compared to its industry competitors  The company currently holds a P E ratio of 214 60  Industry average  18 95   a PEG ratio of 8 64  Industry average 1 75   and a P B ratio of 10 19  Industry average  4 12  
Additionally  Salesforce has not proven its ability to beat earnings expectations recently  It has failed to post a beat in the last four quarters  and it has come in behind the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 43 75  in that time frame 
Bottom Line
Overall  the outlook for the cloud computing and software sectors remains solid  Salesforce  along with other industry leaders like Amazon  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   and its Amazon Web Services segment  are displaying impressive sales growth  On top of these results  forward looking projections indicate that the market for these services will continue to grow 
The issue with Salesforce is not its product or its customer base  Instead  the company has shown a struggle to consistently create value for its shareholders  If Salesforce can trim down costs  boost earnings  and continue to grow its sales  it is in a great position to succeed in the long term  For now  this stock holds some uncertainty ",2016-05-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/salesforce-(crm)-stock-up-after-earnings:-time-to-buy-200131064,200131064

Salesforce com Earnings   Technicals


On Wednesday afternoon after the close  salesforce com  CRM  announced first quarter earnings that crushed analyst estimates and sent shares skyrocketing in the post market session  The company announced adjusted earnings of 24 cents per share on  1 78 billion in revenues while analyst were looking for 23 cents per share on  1 89 billion in revenues  This is also compared to the same period last year where the company posted  1 41 billion in revenues  CRM expects second quarter EPS in the range of 24 to 25 cents with full year guidance at  1 to  1 02  Analysts currently have an average price target of  90 70 
Looking over the chart you will see that shares caught a strong bid in the post market session and haven t slowed down a bit with highs hitting  83 62 after closing the day at  77 87  a 6 9  jump in price  If shares can hold above  82 90 then they will be at all time highs and the previous high should act as some support followed by  82 and  80 while resistance will come in at whole dollars as we trade in new territory  Expect shares to be volatile with above average volume and range as gap ups into new highs like this can be pretty whippy  Typically gap ups into all time highs come down as profit takers and short sellers take advantage of the move but we ll have to see how these support levels hold up before taking a position 
Executive Comments
 We re thrilled that first quarter revenue growth accelerated to 28  year over year in constant currency   said Marc Benioff  chairman and CEO  Salesforce   Given the strong response to our Customer Success Platform  we are raising our fiscal 2017 revenue guidance by  80 million to reach  8 2 billion at the high end of the range

 Our first quarter was an extremely strong start to our fiscal year  with outstanding execution across the board   said Keith Block  vice chairman  president and COO  Salesforce   We continued to drive larger and more strategic transactions in the first quarter  including yet another 9 figure transaction  No other enterprise software company is building strategic relationships of this size and scale and certainly not at this pace

As investors scrambled to get a piece of these tech companies  they ironically got their head stuck in the clouds  Due diligence went out the window when it came to objectively evaluating these businesses  But the warning signs were all there  And the smart investors frequently pointed them out  Negative earnings  Increasing costs  Growth dependent on easy money policies  It wasn t tough to figure out that most of these cloud companies  business models were unstainable 
Yet no one cared  The  cloud  was hot and investors were getting all hot and bothered at just the mention of it  And that s why we got the massive run up in various cloud names  But the infatuation didn t last   
The final straw that broke the camel s back was Tableau Software s  N DATA  recent earnings report  As a maker of data analysis and charting software  Tableau was considered one of the high flying cloud names  But after reporting a failure to harvest tax benefits from some assets  investors kneecapped the stock in their rush out the door  The stock fell 50  the following day 
This disaster shook the entire cloud space  Big names like Salesforce  N CRM  and SAP  N SAP  dropped right alongside Tableau  And one cloud company in particular  Workday  N WDAY   the human capital management software vendor  dove over 18  on the news

So far the trade has worked out pretty well for us  We re now waiting for a good setup to pyramid our initial short position  Workday has a lot further to fall  Let s go over why

The first thing we need to address is the rampant stupidity plaguing the tech space  Actually  maybe it s not stupidity  If someone offers you a bunch of free money  you would take it too  right 
That s exactly what we ve seen in the tech industry these past few years  Easy money policies implemented by the Fed after the  08 crash pumped a lot of liquidity into the system  Investors suddenly had tons of cash and were being forced further out on the risk curve in search of return  And as is always the case in a free money environment  the dollars poured into the newest  shiniest  unproven business model with the hope that this lottery ticket would be the winner 
This time around  that lottery ticket was tech    and cloud companies were the Powerball  And boy did the tech companies love it  They took full advantage 
With so much money flowing in  it became easy to get around the normal restrictions that keep a company financially disciplined  These companies bent the rules and built business models that relied on large  consistent streams of easy money  And by doing so  their businesses became unsustainable 
Here s the thing  you can t just build an entire business on the assumption that you ll have easy money forever  If you do  you ll be screwed when the cycle turns  And that s exactly why a company like Workday is hurting so badly right now 
But when the times were good  they were real good  Workday is a prime example of a tech company that made sure to milk those good times  Their go to move was to issue new shares every time they needed to pay for something  You can see the upward trend in their outstanding shares below 

Investors loved the cloud  And they loved Workday  So they kept buying and sending the stock price higher  And in return  Workday kept issuing shares and collecting investors  money  It was a real nice system they had going 
Everybody  won   Investors got more cloud shares and WDAY got more money to help fuel their growth  Or really  to help buy their growth 
High sales growth is obviously essential for a growth stock like WDAY  And it s true the company has had strong revenue gains since it IPO d in 2012  But it s never enough to just look at revenue growth alone  The key is to see how it came about  And in Workday s case  they ve been selling a dollar for 95 cents 
Check out the steep upward trend in their sales and marketing and R D costs 

Their sales and marketing expense equals almost 37  of total revenue  And R D costs equal nearly 41   Combine them  and they take up nearly 80  of revenue    it s ridiculous  And these costs will only keep increasing because this is how they buy their revenues  To help put it in perspective  competitor Oracle s  N ORCL  cost of sales and development is half of Workday s as a percentage of revenue 
With growth coming at such an expensive price  it s no wonder Workday has never made a dime  Take a look at their earnings per share since they ve been public 

Not only have they consistently lost money  but in the past few years it s been getting worse  EPS is actually downtrending as the company loses more and more 
But hey  it didn t matter to investors 
 Losing money  No problem  Here s some more  As long as you re  growing     
Workday had no incentive to reign in its expenses because investors weren t focused on the bottom line  Nothing was stopping them from throwing endless amounts of money into sales and development  Investors rewarded them for it and their stock price appreciated  So Workday continued to do the same thing over and over again 
There are bulls out there who claim Workday could trim these two expenses and become profitable  But there s a problem with that logic  If they cut those expenses  where would their revenue increases come from  Their growth is completely dependent on heavy spending in those two areas 
Easy money is like heroin to a drug addict  Once you start using it    good luck kicking the habit 
And that s why we call it buying growth  Without an increasing flow of money into sales and development  revenue growth stops 
But the easy money didn t just go to sales and development  It also went to pay employees 
That s the huge benefit of having a stock price that s rocketing higher  Employees are happy to take stock options over cash  The mentality becomes  why get a lump sum now when you can get some sweet optionality with company shares   I mean  the stock s going to the moon isn t it  Why cap your gains 
That s how employees thought  Everybody bought into the popular delusion  And Workday took full advantage by issuing options instead of cash  The money they saved went right back into buying growth  As of November 2015  Workday had over 12 million shares in exercisable options  That comes out to an equivalent of almost 10  of the company s current market cap  That s a lot of shares  
So all this seems like a pretty great racket right  Just use easy money to pay for everything  The company wins  the investors win  and everybody s happy 
But here s the problem  This strategy only works when the stock price is rising  As soon as it decides to go the other way  the stuff hits the fan  And it hits hard  The whole business model falls apart  And that s why we say it s completely unsustainable 
Think about the new Workday employees coming through the door  Wide eyed college kids planning to change the world through their fancy HR software  They see the stock price rising and they believe in their mission  They also swear their HR system is revolutionary  So of course they think the company s stock is probably undervalued  Forget about the hardcore business side of it and the sustainability aspect of the model  Who cares about that  Let s just go with the dream here  So yes  they gladly accept stock options in lieu of real cash payments  It s clearly the better choice 
But sadly  these kids  hopes and dreams of fixing the world really just hinge on the stock price rising  Why  Because they aren t THAT stupid  Their awesome degrees from their awesome ivy league schools won t let them be  So yea  even though they likely believe that building Workday s HR system is as important as solving world hunger  a falling stock price still means less money in their pockets  They start to realize that they can t go to the bar and buy rounds with options that become more worthless by the day  It s just too hard to impress the opposite gender like that  It won t work  So at that point  they say screw you  pay me real cash 
And this is where the model starts to fall apart  Workday needs the best talent coming in  And without a strong stock price  they have to pay up a lot more for that to happen  The cash that starts going to employees gets taken away from the growth  buying  strategy  So sales and development spending go down  This in turn causes revenues to take a hit  Lack of revenues piss off investors because they see less growth  And as always  the investors  solution is to take their frustrations out on the stock price  which gets hammered  And now with the stock price even lower  all of Workday s problems become worse  It makes it even MORE expensive to hire good people  Plus it s tough to issue new shares to get cash because the demand is gone  Investor s are turned off  And even if Workday can issues shares  they re getting less cash for each offering because of the lower price  This leads to less spending on sales and development once again  Which leads to less growth and more disenfranchised investors  And that leads to   yada yada yada 
You see the downward spiral forming  It turns into a giant negative feedback loop that tanks the company 
As every good drug dealer knows  you don t get high on your own supply  But that s exactly what Workday did with the model they built around paying for everything with their own appreciating shares  I mean  didn t they learn from what happened to Pacino in Scarface  If you choose to build this type of business model  these are the consequences you ll eventually have to face 
And just remember how easy it was to start this chain reaction  All Tableau had to do was report some tax issues and the whole industry crumbled  Talk about walking on thin ice  
The Tableau earnings release was the  that signaled the beginning of the end  It caused the initial large price drop that triggered the negative feedback loop  which we re now benefiting from by being short WDAY stock 
What s funny is that there are many companies that followed Workday s lead and jumped into this space with the same business model  So now  not only are all their businesses in trouble  but the vicious competition between them is cannibalizing whatever revenues they ve been able to gain thus far 
Bloody Red Ocean
 Workday operates in the Human Capital Management  HCM  solutions market  And as you can tell from the graphic below  courtesy of Apps Runs The World   the space is very fragmented 

SAP holds the top spot in the HCM market with an 11  share  Workday is fortunate enough to come in second with 9  of the market  But this percentage isn t much of the total pie  You can see above that there are way too many companies fighting for the same customers  Not only that  but there are more companies entering the market everyday  The competition has transformed the space into a bloody red ocean where the economics have become terrible 
For example  take the competition between Workday and their archenemy Oracle  The founders of these companies have a rocky history  so they especially love screwing with each other  Oracle recently decided to offer heavy discounts to their HCM customers in an obvious attempt to steal market share from Workday  So Workday had to respond  They chose to switch up their billing model to make it more lenient on their customers  And according to analysts  this move was basically the equivalent of telling their customers   just pay us whenever you feel like it  
Various analysts lowered their ratings of Workday after seeing the effects this billing change had on their latest earnings report  Steve Koenig of Wedbush Securities cut his price target citing disappointing revenue growth due to the new  more flexible payment schedules  Barclays  and Nomura Securities also downgraded the company for similar reasons  while also commenting on the heightened competition in the HCM industry 
As the analysts mentioned  this destructive competition is widespread in the industry  It isn t just limited to the cat fight between Oracle and Workday  SAP is another example of a company hurting from the scrapping  They re on record complaining about competition from various companies including Workday  But they re not backing down  They re willing to go to the mats too 
So  should SAP decide to focus on a margin rate and not compete in those markets and let them have the marketplace  The answer is  Hell no  You will have to compete  in some cases  on a lower profile margin rate 
So not only are these companies losing tons of money  but the situation is only getting worse  Their negative margins are going to become even more negative  It s a race to the bottom for market share  Investors would be stupid to expect profits anytime soon 
And all these losses are coming at a time when a lot of big companies are actually reconsidering the use of HCM software  There has recently been a lot of backlash against ranking employees with the types of systems HCM companies provide  You probably remember the scathing article in the New York Times about Amazon s  O AMZN  s internal practices and culture  Part of the criticism included the use of HCM tools that evaluated employees  These tools were supposedly abused by management and cutthroat employees to create a toxic work environment 
Companies are thinking about moving away from these tools because they re finding them to be ineffective  All they do is piss off employees  It s bad enough being stuck in a cubicle  But now the company is going to do things like monitor your computer and then rank you based off that information  Really  Can you imagine that during March Madness  You definitely need as many games playing as you have monitors available  We imagine the response is likely the same among employees whose companies try to overly penalize them for their love of college basketball 
 Go Blue   Breaking Up With The Cloud
So what we have here is a business model dependent on easy money  terrible industry economics with losses everywhere  and a possible trend away from the industry s main product  Clearly these companies are in huge trouble 
But bulls may still say that none of this matters as long as revenues are growing  They think that if there s growth  the stock price will be fine  But this just isn t true  This type of mentality doesn t work in a bear market  It doesn t matter how fast you grow your revenues when investor sentiment has changed  As VC Joe Floyd reveals in his diagram below  multiples can compress a lot faster than revenues can grow 

And from a valuation perspective  Workday is one of the most expensive stocks out there  Just take a look at Workday s price to sales ratio compared to its competitors  It s almost double everyone else s 

Considering how overvalued it still is  Workday makes a great   even after its recent fall  Our team at Foundation is currently waiting for an area to pyramid our short position  We believe the company has a lot further to drop 
Investors have finally broken up with the cloud  And Workday is the company that will be dumped the hardest ",2016-02-21,Macro Ops,https://www.investing.com/analysis/workday's-unsustainable-business-model-200118983,200118983

171713,393229,CRM,Collapse Of The Too Big To Fail Banks In Europe,opinion,"There is so much chaos going on that I don t even know where to start  For a very long time I have been warning my readers that a major banking collapse was coming to Europe  and now it is finally unfolding  Let s start with Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn   The stock of the most important bank in the  strongest economy in Europe  plunged another 8 percent on Monday  and it is now hovering just above the all time record low that was set during the last financial crisis  Overall  the stock price is now down a staggering 36 percent since 2016 began  and Deutsche Bank credit default swaps are going parabolic  Of course my readers were alerted to major problems at Deutsche Bank all the way back in September  and now the endgame is playing out  In addition to Deutsche Bank  the list of other  too big to fail  banks in Europe that appear to be in very serious trouble includes Commerzbank  DE CBKG   Credit Suisse  VX CSGN   HSBC  N HSBC  and BNP Paribas  PA BNPP   Just about every major bank in Italy could fall on that list as well  and Greek bank stocks lost close to a quarter of their value on Monday alone  Financial Armageddon has come to Europe  and the entire planet is going to feel the pain 
The collapse of the banks in Europe is dragging down stock prices all over the continent  At this point  more than one fifth of all stock market wealth in Europe has already been wiped out since the middle of last year  That means that we only have four fifths left  The following comes from  

The MSCI Europe index is now down 20 5  from its highest point over the past 12 months  says S P Global Market Intelligence  placing it in the 20  decline that unofficially defines a bear market 
Europe s stock implosion makes the U S   sell off look like child s play  The U S  centric Standard   Poor s 500 Monday fell another 1 4    but it s only down 13  from its high  Some individual European markets are getting hit even harder  The Milan MIB 30  Madrid Ibex 35 and MSCI United Kingdom indexes are off 29   23  and 20  from their 52 week highs  respectively as investors fear the worse could be headed for the Old World 

These declines are being primarily driven by the banks  According to   European banking stocks have fallen for six weeks in a row  and this is the longest streak that we have seen since the heart of the last financial crisis 

The region s banking gauge  the Stoxx Europe 600 Banks Index FX7   5 59  has logged six straight weeks of declines  its longest weekly losing stretch since 2008  when banks booked 10 weeks of losses  beginning in May  according to FactSet data 
 The current environment for European banks is very  very bad  Over a full business cycle  I think it s very questionable whether banks on average are able to cover their cost of equity  And as a result that makes it an unattractive investment for long term investors   warned Peter Garnry  head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank 

Overall  Europe s banking stocks are down 23 percent year to date and 39 percent since the peak of the market in the middle of last year 
The financial crisis that began during the second half of 2015 is picking up speed over in Europe  and it isn t just Deutsche Bank that could implode at any moment  Credit Suisse is the most important bank in Switzerland  and they announced a fourth quarter loss of 5 8 billion dollars  The stock price has fallen 34 percent year to date  and many are now raising questions about the continued viability of the bank 
Similar scenes are being repeated all over the continent  On Monday we learned that Russia had just shut down two more major banks  and the collapse of Greek banks has pushed Greek stock prices to a 25 year low 

Greek stocks tumbled on Monday to close nearly eight percent lower  with bank shares losing almost a quarter of their market value amid concerns over the future of government reforms 
The general index on the Athens stock exchange closed down 7 9 percent at 464 23 points   a 25 year low   while banks suffered a 24 3 percent average drop 

This is what a financial crisis looks like 
Fortunately things are not this bad here in the U S  quite yet  but we are on the exact same path that they are 
One of the big things that is fueling the banking crisis in Europe is the fact that the too big to fail banks over there have more than 100 billion dollars of exposure to energy sector loans  This makes European banks even more sensitive to the price of oil than U S  banks  The following comes  

The four U S  banks with the highest dollar amount of exposure to energy loans have a capital position 60 percent greater than European banks Deutsche Bank  UBS  Credit Suisse and HSBC  according to CLSA research using a measure called tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio  Or  as Mayo put it   U S  banks have more quality capital  
Analysts at JPMorgan  N JPM  saw the energy loan crisis coming for Europe  and highlighted in early January where investors might get hit 
  Standard Chartered  L STAN   and  Deutsche Bank  would be the most sensitive banks to higher default rates in oil and gas   the analysts wrote in their January report 

There is Deutsche Bank again 
It is funny how they keep coming up 
In the U S   the collapse of the price of oil is pushing energy company after energy company into bankruptcy  This has happened 42 times in North America since the beginning of last year so far  and rumors that Chesapeake Energy  N CHK  is heading that direction caused their stock price to plummet  

Energy stocks continue to tank  with Transocean  RIG  dropping 7  and Baker Hughes  BHI  down nearly 5   But those losses pale in comparison with Chesapeake Energy  CHK   the energy giant that plummeted as much as 51  amid bankruptcy fears  Chesapeake denied it s currently planning to file for bankruptcy  but its stock still closed down 33  on the day 

And let s not forget about the ongoing bursting of the tech bubble that I wrote about yesterday 
On Monday the carnage continued  and this pushed the Nasdaq down to its lowest level  

Technology shares with lofty valuations  including those of midcap data analytics company Tableau Software Inc  N DATA  and Internet giant Facebook Inc  O FB   extended their losses on Monday following a gutting selloff in the previous session 
Shares of cloud services companies such as Splunk Inc  O SPLK  and Salesforce com Inc  N CRM  had also declined sharply on Friday  They fell again on Monday  dragging down the Nasdaq Composite index 2 4 percent to its lowest in nearly 1 1 2 years 

Those that read my articles regularly know that I have been warning this would happen 
All over the world we are witnessing a financial implosion  As I write this article  the Japanese market has only been open less than an hour and it is already down 747 points 
The next great financial crisis is already here  and right now we are only in the early chapters 
Ultimately what we are facing is going to be far worse than the financial crisis of 2008 2009  and as a result of this great shaking the entire world is going to fundamentally change ",2016-02-09,Michael T.

171732,393248,CRM,High Revenue Growth Masks Problems At Demandware,opinion,"Demandware  DWRE   72 share  IPO d in 2012 based on plans to create shareholder value by providing e commerce platforms for retailers and brands worldwide  So far  the plan is not working as the company s profits have declined  Paradoxically  the stock price has climbed over 140  since its IPO  The stock is dangerously overvalued and earns a place in the Danger Zone this week 
Revenue Growth Is Misleading
Demandware joins our list of cloud based companies that fail to make money  The list includes names such as Salesforce com  NYSE CRM   Workday Inc  NYSE WDAY  and Box Inc  NYSE BOX   Unfortunately  too many investors appear willing to overlook this fundamental flaw and focus on revenue growth instead  Since 2012  Demandware has grown its revenue by 42  compounded annually  Businesses aren t built upon revenue growth though  Only profits can sustain a business 
Net operating profit after tax  NOPAT   which has never been positive  has moved in the opposite direction to revenue  Since 2012  NOPAT has fallen from   6 million to   26 million in 2014  This trend has continued into 2015  as NOPAT has declined even further to   28 million on a trailing 12 month  TTM  basis 
Profit Headed the Wrong Way

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
The biggest reason for the company s widening losses has been its rising costs  In 1Q15  revenues grew 54  year over year  YoY   while cost of revenues grew 69   Since 2012  cost of revenue has grown by 31  compounded annually and operating expenses have grown 53  compounded annually  Attracting new customers and developing new features has been increasingly expensive for Demandware 
As could be expected  with negative profits  Demandware has also never achieved a positive return on invested capital  ROIC   In 2012  Demandware earned a  16  ROIC  which has since fallen to  35  in 2014 and  23  on a TTM basis  Operating pretax margins  NOPBT  have only declined since IPO from  9  in 2012 to  16  on a TTM basis as well 
Fierce Competition In a Saturated Market
Demandware generates revenues through creating and servicing clients  e commerce activities  including online presence  omni channel integration  or customer relationship management  Demandware takes a percentage of sales generated through these channels  Investors are failing to realize just how much competition this business model creates  In the same year Demandware went public  4 other cloud software companies had a public offering  highlighting the exuberance the market has had  In addition  IBM  NYSE IBM   Oracle Corporation  NYSE ORCL   Hewlett Packard Company  NYSE HPQ  and Dell all have competing products  For example  Oracle s ATG Web Commerce product can provide companies with an established digital presence but can also provide integrated hardware and software infrastructure  More importantly  Oracle can do so profitably giving it a big advantage in pricing and product innovation 
IBM s WebSphere product also competes with Demandware  Smaller and more aggressive competitors lurk within the market  Salesforce com  Workday  and ServiceNOW all compete in the cloud big data market  albeit unprofitably 
Aside from the traditional technology based competitors  Demandware indirectly competes with traditional retailers  Demandware receives a portion of revenues generated through sites it develops  and while this revenue sharing aligns the company with clients  it makes the company dependent on its clients and vulnerable to their retail competitors  such as Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and eBay  whose margins are razor thin 
Figure 2 shows how poorly Demandware stacks up against many of its numerous competitors  Due to Demandware s low ROIC  the company will face pressure from competitors who possess greater pricing power and the ability to reinvest in their business
Figure 2  Demandware Lags All Competition
 Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  
A Hollow Bull Case
The success of Demandware relies heavily upon its ability to add new clients  create new services to further integrate clients into its system  and at some point make money  To date  the company s profits have only declined while competition has increased  Beware revenue growth that belies profit declines  That trend has a very limited life span 
Demandware s position as a lower cost alternative leaves it little pricing flexibility  Low price doesn t always win out in the technology sector  Ultimately  retailers will gravitate towards the product that provides the best overall value  Larger competitors  like IBM or Oracle  have greater resources  brand cache  and exposure  These competitors stand squarely in the way of Demandware s future 
Stupid Money  Buyout  Risk
The industry in which Demandware operates lends itself to rampant acquisition speculation  The hope is that larger competitors will purchase Demandware  and large tech firms have a long history of buying smaller firms to bolster existing products or enter new spaces  However  in this case  potential acquirers IBM and Oracle already have robust business models providing cloud based e commerce  so purchasing an unprofitable Demandware does not provide any strategic value  Take Salesforce com as a prime example of a cloud business struggling to find a suitor  It would be much wiser for any potential acquirer to let the price of Demandware fall back to more reasonable levels before initiating any acquisition efforts 
Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic Accounting
In order to derive the true recurring cash flows  an accurate invested capital  and a real shareholder value  we have made several adjustments to Demandware s 2014 10 K  The adjustments we made are as follows 
The largest income statement adjustment was  1 million   1  of revenue  in non operating expenses hidden in operating line items  Despite removing these expenses  Demandware s NOPAT is still negative   25 million 
The largest balance sheet adjustment made was the removal of  36 million in assets related to midyear acquisitions  This adjustment represented 12  of reported net assets  Despite removing this amount from invested capital  Demandware still generated a  35  ROIC in 2014 
The largest adjustment to shareholder value came in the form of  105 million in outstanding employee stock option liabilities  These option liabilities represent 4  of Demandware s current market cap 
Valuation is Out of Touch
Demandware is dangerously overvalued  To justify its current price of  72 share  the company must raise its pretax  NOPBT  margin from  16  to 5  and grow revenue by 31  per year for the next 18 years  In this scenario  Demandware would then be generating over  20 billion in revenue  higher than eBay s 2014 revenue  Growth at the levels implied by the market price seems unrealistic given the stiff competition the company faces  A more realistic value for Demandware  even giving them credit for 15  NOPBT margins  above retailers but below large tech firms like IBM and MSFT   and 10  revenue growth for the next decade  the stock is only worth  12 share today    a 83  downside from current levels 
Catalyst
The biggest potential catalyst for Demandware  much like other recent Danger Zone stocks  is an earnings miss  When revenue growth stories fail to produce the profit results the market is expecting  the stock can drop drastically  Take Workday s recent 15  decline after recent earnings or even Netflix s 20  drop in late 2014 as prior examples  Demandware walks a fine line between  hyper revenue growth  and unprofitable cloud business  An earnings miss can easily flip sentiment from exuberant to negative 
Short Interest
Short interest stands at 3 6 million shares  or less than 10  of shares outstanding 
Heavy Insider Selling  Not Much Buying
In the past 12 months  insiders have bought 265 thousand shares and sold 1 5 million shares  for a net of 1 2 million shares sold  This figure represents 3  of all shares outstanding 
Executive Compensation Not Based On Profits
Demandware s executives are paid annual cash bonuses in addition to long term stock awards  90  of the cash bonuses are based upon corporate performance with the remainder based upon individual performance  Half of the corporate performance bonus is based upon non GAAP EBITDA and a company defined  renewal dollar percentage   while the other half is based on the discretion of the compensation committee using company defined metrics for success  The compensation committee is able to award executives with equity incentive awards that are aimed at aligning executives with the interests of shareholders  Metrics for how executives earn these equity awards are not abundantly clear in Demandware s proxy document  other than they are based on individual performance and remaining competitive against the company s peer group

171740,393256,CRM,Top Trade Ideas For The Week April 27  2015  Bonus Idea,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Salesforce com  NYSE CRM   has been trending higher in a wide channel for at least a year  More recently  the stock price moved off of a bottom near 56 in February to a high at 71 in just a few days  Since then the price action has consolidated in a symmetrical triangle  Friday it tested the top of the triangle but failed to break over the top  A break of the triangle carries a target of 76 50 and there is a Measured Move higher to 78 from the move into the consolidation 
There is resistance at 69 and 69 85 followed by 71  Support lower comes at 67 and 65 70 followed by 63 60 and 62  The momentum indicators give some support to the bullish case  The RSI is in the bullish zone  although moving sideways with a current downward tilt  The MACD is testing a cross up  which would be bullish  after resetting lower  The Bollinger Bands  have tightened  often a precursor to a move in the stock price 
The company reports earnings next May 19th  after the market close or May 18th depending on where you look  and short interest is moderate at 3 9   The May 1 Expiry options chain shows large open interest at the 67 Put Strike and the 70 Call Strike  while looking beyond earnings at the May 22 Expiry chain shows most of the open interest to the upside at the 70 50 and 71 Strikes 
Salesforce com Inc  NYSE CRM 
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 69 with a stop at 67  A straight stock purchase 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the May 1 Expiry 69 Calls  offered at 50 cents late Friday   A defined risk trade  with only the premium spent at risk 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the May 1 Expiry 69 70 Call Spread  31 cents  and sell the May 1 Expiry 66 Puts  29 cent credit   Adding leverage and capping the upside   this trade offers a nearly 50 1 reward to risk ratio 
Trade Idea 4  May 22 Expiry 69 71 1 2 Call Spread  50 cent credit   Gives the stock more time to move and a wider range still with a 4 1 reward to risk ratio 
Trade Idea 5  Buy the May 22 Expiry 69 76 Call Spread   1 85  and sell the May 22 Expiry 63 50 Put   1 12 credit   Covers nearly the full measured range and adds leverage with protection below the triangle consolidation  This gives a 9 5 1 reward to risk ratio 

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the last week of April  sees the equity indexes looking strong on the weekly timeframes and a bit mixed on the short term view 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue lower while Crude Oil rises towards a major character change area  The US Dollar Index looks to continue to consolidate the large move higher while US Treasuries are biased lower in the short term in their uptrend  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are biased to the upside with risk of the Chinese market becoming overheated at any point 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s ARCA SPY  ARCA IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  Their charts all look higher ion the weekly timeframe but on the daily timeframe the QQQ may be a bit stretched while the IWM and SPY test resistance but with some strength  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

171782,393298,CRM,Is This IPO Hopeful The Market s Next Big Gainer ,opinion,One month ago  almost to the day  I shared this little Wall Street fact of life  The pace of initial public offerings  IPOs  always follows the broader market  So it should come as no surprise that  as the S P 500 Index has already charged 9  higher this year  IPO activity is heating up  too  This week alone  nine companies plan to go public  Who cares  Well  you should  Because one of those companies happens to be Marin Software  MRIN   In February  I singled out Marin as a possible  hot IPO   thanks to its leverage to the mobile advertising boom   Remember  mobile advertising spending is expected to surge from  3 2 billion last year to  20 billion by 2015   However  there was one big caveat  price  Since overpaying for an IPO never makes investment sense   and Marin hadn t provided a proposed pricing range yet   we couldn t determine whether or not it represented a bargain  But we can now  So let s get to it before the company begins trading tomorrow  Survey Says  Later tonight  underwriters plan to price Marin s IPO between  11 and  13 per share  Is that a fair price range  Normally  we could tell in a flash  We d simply pull up everyone s favorite valuation metric   the trusty price to earnings ratio   for each of the company s competitors and the broad market  Then we d compare it to the IPO in question  based on its earnings per share  In Marin s case  however  it s not that easy  As I previously noted  much like every other small cap  mobile advertising company   including Augme Technologies  AUGT   Millennial Media  Inc   MM  and Velti Plc  VELT    Marin isn t profitable yet  Given the infancy of the mobile advertising industry  though  we shouldn t immediately shun these companies because of their lack of profitability as potential investments  I assure you  the growth and  in turn  profits are forthcoming  Thankfully  we do have two alternative and meaningful valuation proxies that we can use to determine a fair price to pay for Marin  More specifically  we can evaluate previous investments by venture capital firms and price to sales  P S  ratios for similar companies   Valuation Proxy  1  Venture Capital Investments In November 2012  Marin raised almost  20 million through a private placement with existing stockholders  Its official purchase price   13 5312 per share  And since Marin has increased its sales since November  it s not a stretch to assume that the stock is more valuable as a result  So  based on previous investments  the proposed range of  11 to  13 per share represents a modest bargain  Granted  the venture capital firms  average cost per share is actually lower than  13 53  That s because they had invested in previous financing rounds  dating as far back as 2010  at lower prices  as low as  5 53 per share   Nevertheless  if we get a chance to buy in at prices equal to their most recent investment  we should take it   Valuation Proxy  2  Price to Sales Ratios The going P S ratio for a mobile advertising firm is between 2 and 3  But that s based on an extremely small sample size  In a broader context  Marin is really a software as a service  SaaS  company  And if we include those companies in our analysis   including salesforce com  CRM   Guidewire  GWRE  and Workday  WDAY    the range of P S ratios checks in at 8 on the low end and 36 on the high end  Now  I m always a bit conservative when it comes to valuing an IPO  Accordingly  let s use a P S ratio range of 8 to 10 for Marin  Doing so values shares at about  15 80 to  19 75  So  again  the proposed pricing range of  11 to  13 appears to be a bargain  Granted  underwriters might be underpricing the deal to produce a one day pop  They ve been known to stack the deck  so to speak  to make their track record appear more impressive  But that s precisely why we re completing our valuation analysis in advance of the stock s debut  It s the only way to remain rational with our purchasing decisions  You see  if the IPO does  indeed  pop out of the gates  we know at what point the price becomes prohibitive  As for most other investors  who usually don t hear about an IPO until it begins trading   well  they re left to their own devices  i e    human nature   When they see a dramatic price run up for an IPO  they often buy in  thinking it s a momentum play that should be purchased at any price  And more often than not  such an investment  strategy  yields losses  not profits  Bottom line  Based on previous venture capital investments  the explosive growth on the horizon for mobile advertising firms and prevailing price to sales ratios  Marin is a compelling investment for under  20 per share ,2013-03-21,Louis Basenese,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-this-ipo-hopeful-the-market’s-next-big-gainer-159856,159856
171783,393299,CRM,Why The Bear Market For High Beta Stocks Will Continue,opinion,"This article is a friendly wake up call of sorts for investors in high beta social media  cloud  biotech and e commerce plays  You know  the stuff with triple digit P E ratios  if profits even existed   trading at nutty price to sales  and so on 
First of all let s establish  for the sake of the record  that this  high beta  group has been slaughtered  The major indices have held up well  as we observed in  Boring is the New Sexy   But high beta has basically entered a full on bear market  Consider the following as of this writing  May 6th intraday  
Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  is more than 26  off its January highs Yelp  NYSE YELP  is more than 45  off its March highs Salesforce com  NYSE CRM  is more than 22  off its March highs Twitter  NYSE TWTR   which we remain short on  is more than 55  off its December highs iShares Nasdaq Biotech  NASDAQ IBB   the biotech ETF  we re short   is 18  off February highs after a large dead cat bounce Those are bear market numbers  You can quibble over what a bear market is or isn t  but the generally accepted rule of thumb is a greater than 20  decline from highs 
Many investors are hoping for a comeback in these names  We recently read of a prominent Wall Street analyst calling YELP a buy because  having fallen 40   it was now attractively valued based on the growth story and what have you 
Our two cents  Forget the growth story angle  Realize that the growth story is not what drove these stocks in the first place  Oh  it made a difference absolutely  The growth story always serves as optimism rocket fuel  whether justified or non justified  helping to inflate bubble like valuations 
But here is the bottom line  If you were heavily long high beta and are now wondering what the heck happened  guess what  You were making a big macro bet  You were playing the macro and just didn t know it 
You probably thought the  bottom up  analysis is what mattered  As such you were focused on stuff like 

the future of social media
incredible growth rates and user uptake
metrics of user engagement
the  new sharing economy 
the ability to monetize mobile
etc etc and so on


But you know what  All that stuff was a red herring relative to the real drivers of the crazy valuations now being relentlessly deflated  All these stocks were simply vehicles   Uber black sedans if you will   for a game of macro musical chairs 
Fred Wilson  a legendary venture capitalist  provides the key to understanding this in a recent blog post 

 the moral of this story is that you can push valuations when you have investors knocking down your door  but unless you are cash flow positive and expect to remain so for the foreseeable future  you do that at your own risk  You will need to find someone to top that price down the road and that person may not be there 
  A VC  The Valuation Trap

Wilson was talking about pre IPO companies in that post  and the danger of taking a pre IPO valuation so high that the hurdle becomes a point of no return  This is the predicament Box now finds itself in 
But the same logic further applies to already public companies  When you take valuation too high  relative to rationality or sense  the problem is that no future growth can justify it beyond a certain point 
Amazon and Twitter are classic examples  How much is the future growth of AMZN worth  How much is the future growth of TWTR worth  Nobody knows  Nobody can really say  Both of these companies have great stories though  And so the power of the story itself was used to justify multiples detached from any semblance of reality 
And this is where we get into the  macro  aspect of all these high beta names  Beyond a certain point  aggressively inflated growth company valuations are no longer about growth  They are simply about greater fool theory  GFT   in the sense of valuation tethered to nothing  expanding or contracting solely on capital flows 
Let us hypothetically say that XYZ is a hot new social media stock  XYZ s prospects are so hot  in fact  that the company s stock trades at 600 times earnings 
Given this state of affairs  what is to prevent XYZ from trading at 900 times earnings  Nothing really   any growth projection that can justify 600x earnings can also justify 900x earnings 
But at the same time  what is to prevent XYZ from falling to 300x earnings  Again  nothing really   a deceleration of capital flows can cut the multiple in half  and at 300x earnings it is still priced for super growth 
And thus  when the valuation gets  silly  enough  the actual stock price could rise or decline by 50   with no change to the underlying story at all 
This is why  beyond a certain valuation level  the growth story itself no longer matters  Only capital flows matter   which are a function of the macro picture 

Markets are best understood through the lens of game theory  GFT  Greater Fool Theory  is a major aspect of that  It helps us see how seemingly irrational price moves can be driven  at least in part  by rational bets  Or rather  an irrational move can be driven in part by dummies  investors whose analysis is outright bad  faulty  or non existent  and driven in part by sharp eyed operators who know the stock is a dog  but also know there is  momo  for the taking 
  Strategic Intelligence Report  29  03 29 14

In the quote above  the  dog  stock we referred to was King Digital  KING K   for which we joked the symbol should have been KNGA to better rhyme with ZNGA  In that issue we previewed the bad omens of the Candy Crush IPO and predicted that the Box IPO would either be delayed or come off badly if at all 
Why  Again  because of the macro  Not all high beta stocks are dogs  but again  when the valuation becomes untethered from reality  there is so much two way flexibility   either up OR down   that capital flows matter far more than the actual growth story itself 
Live by the sword  die by the sword  If your favorite long term investment has such a bright future it can trade at twice the current valuation without making anyone blink  it can also probably trade at half that valuation   or a third or a quarter   entirely dependent on big picture drivers such as what central banks and hedge fund managers are doing  independent of the story so beloved of analysts and true believers 
And this is why we say  beyond a certain threshold of valuation irrationality   which was delivered to us via Ben Bernanke  momo hedge fund managers  and so on   all these stocks had become  macro bets   As we outlined in Tiger Soup and further elaborated on via Death of the OCBN and Boring is the New Sexy  the math of near zero interest rates coupled with the rocket fuel of silicon valley optimism to create a giant momentum basket for which capital flows are now reversing  and for which the pain is likely to continue ",2014-05-07,Mercenary Trader,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-bear-market-for-high-beta-stocks-will-continue-211924,211924

171810,393326,CRM,BCG  Private Banking Will Get More Complicated ,opinion,The Boston Consulting Group has made public a new study of the market for wealth management  that is  chiefly  for private banking   taking in a  including  the dynamics of offshore banking  the emergence of alternative business models  and key trends that will continue to press at the margins of such managers  Offshore Banking Switzerland is a landlocked country  so referring to it as a center of  offshore banking  seems pretty off putting to those of us for whom that phrase still connotes tropical islands with actual  and sandy  shores  Still  offshore banking for purposes of this report consists of the investor practice of booking assets in a place where the investors themselves have no residence or tax domicile  This practice  unhappy though it makes the jurisdictions that aren t the beneficiaries  isn t going to go away  As the BCG observes  wealth management clients  will always seek diversification broad private banking capabilities  specialized expertise  high quality service  discretion  and domiciles with relatively high levels of economic and political stability   The amount of wealth held offshore in Switzerland by clients in Western Europe declined in 2011  and will likely continue to erode   says BCG  Switzerland  which is joined by Luxembourg in this  has suffered from the difficulties of Western Europe and their high exposure to investors there  More broadly  the development of such centers  and the diplomatic pressures brought to bear upon them  are such that individual relationship managers may no longer  be able to serve clients from a large number of domiciles because regulatory compliance will become more complex and country specific   making it impossible to master the distinct requirements of many different client domiciles   That is in fact the theme throughout this report  If you re a private banker  your life is getting more difficult  and you d better get used to it  Alternative Business Models And Key Trends Three new business models in particular are pressuring established wealth manager using older ways of doing business  external asset managers  family offices  and online wealth managers  In each case  traditionalists may reflectively want to defend their own turf  their own business model too  but they might decide that in some respect it is better to join  em  For example  online wealth managers aren t just online brokers anymore  they offer  advice  research  portfolio management  and investment products   and they do so in ways that are becoming more user friendly over time  Bank based wealth managers ought to consider their own branded online platforms  and the 24 7 availability of services that implies  Players in the wealth management market will have to adapt to each of the following trends  Continued growth in the emerging marketsContinued pressure for wealth managers from competition  product commoditization  the slowness of recovery of demand for high margin products  and other constraintsMore sophisticated clients  confident in taking a large active role in their own affairsSimpler and more modular productsMore transparent pricing  more closely linked to service models In this difficult context  those who survive will be those who have strongly embedded risk management throughout all their systems  who have developed multi channel capabilities and a social media presence  and who keep up to date with technology and infrastructure in order to meet customer expectations  especially in regard to customer relations management  CRM  itself  Size of the MarketGlobal private financial wealth grew by just 1 9 percent in 2011  You might contrast that  for scale  with the growth recorded in 2009  9 6 percent  or 2010  6 8   BCG attributes the slowdown to  overall economic uncertainty and struggling equity markets in major developed economies   All of the growth that did occur can be chalked up to what the BCG calls the  new world   or the emerging market nations of Eastern Europe  Latin America  the Middle East  Africa  and the Asia Pacific  ex Japan   Drilling down a bit  in Asia Pacific ex Japan private wealth increased by 10 7 percent in 2011  reaching  23 7 trillion  The amount of wealth held in equities in this region increased by only 4 1 percent  but the amount held in bonds rose by 17 5 percent  and cash or deposits increased 13 4 percent  In the Old World of mature economies  Western Europe  North America  and Japan  private financial wealth shrank by   9 percent  In Japan  private wealth decreased by 2 percent in 2011  The amounts held in cash and deposits remained  virtually flat   while the amount held in equities dropped by 7 6 percent  Over the next five years the BCG expects private wealth at a compound annual growth rate of between 4 and 5 percent  It expects that the fastest growing asset class will be equities  with a CAGR of 4 9 percent  As to the size of the market for managing wealth  the bottom line is this  Ultra High Net Worth households held  7 1 trillion in 2011  an increase of 3 6 percent over 201  At the
