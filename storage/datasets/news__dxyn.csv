1515,223030,DXYN,5 Great Value Stocks For Growth Investors In September ,opinion,Value investors always tend to invest in stocks that trade at a lower price regardless of what the performance of the companies might indicate  In other words  these stocks are known as value stocks and are mostly undervalued  Growth investors  on the other hand  usually incline toward stocks with above average earnings growth than the market  These stocks are mostly overvalued and are expected to generate substantial capital gains Value investing is for investors looking to buy stocks whose value is lower than the intrinsic value  Hence  these investors are always on the lookout for stocks with low price to earnings  P E  ratio or high dividend yield  On the flip side  growth investors focus on stocks with higher P E ratio and industries with strong momentum In recent years  growth stocks have stolen the thunder from value stocks  But the tide seems to be turning  as the outperformance of such growth stocks forms the basis of an argument which tend to favor the value stocks rising to prominence in the near term The Federal Reserve s recent announcement of a possibility of raising the interest rates  and the consistent improvement of the labor market has not only strengthened the case for interest rate hike but has also eliminated the fears over the health of the U S  economy However  it is a difficult task for the investors to zero in on the stocks that offer great value despite trading at a low price at the moment  Given the stark difference between value investing and growth investing  taking a prudent investment decision might appear to be a daunting task  An investor needs to use the right tools and metrics to select such stocks which are currently trading below their intrinsic value and to invest in those stocks before they re discovered by the market This is where our proven Zacks Rank system comes to the rescue  Using our proven methodology  investors can not only identify the attractive picks but also ascertain the industries which might turn out to be value accretive  going ahead The attractiveness of a stock as an investment option is confirmed by its Value Style Score and the Growth Style Score of  A   or  B    Our research shows that stocks with Style Scores of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  offer the best upside potential Based on the above measures  we have shortlisted five stocks sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and having Value Score and Growth Score of  A  The Chemours Company   NYSE CC   headquartered in Wilmington  DE  deals in chemical business  The company s operations consist of Titanium Technologies  Fluoroproducts and Chemical Solutions Cooper Standard Holdings Inc    NYSE CPS   was established in 1960 and has is headquartered in Novi  MI  The company operates as a supplier of systems and components for the automotive industry  Its products include sealing and trim  fuel and brake delivery  fluid transfer  thermal and emissions and anti vibration systems Ducommun Inc    NYSE DCO    headquartered in Carson  CA  manufactures components and assemblies for domestic and foreign commercial and military aircraft and space programs Horizon Global Corporation   NYSE HZN    headquartered in Troy  MI  is a designer  manufacturer and distributor of towing  trailering  cargo management and accessory products for original equipment  aftermarket and retail customers The Dixie Group  Inc    NASDAQ DXYN   was founded in 1920 and is based in Dalton  GA  The company is a leading carpet and rug manufacturer and supplier to higher end residential and commercial customers serviced by Masland Carpets and Fabrica International  to consumers through major retailers under the Bretlin  Globaltex and Alliance Mills brands and to the factory built housing and recreational vehicle markets through Carriage Carpets Where Do Zacks  Investment Ideas Come From You are welcome to download the full  up to the minute list of 220 Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks free of charge  There is no better place to start your own stock search  Plus you can access the full list of must avoid Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sells  and other private research ,2016-08-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-great-value-stocks-for-growth-investors-in-september-200151397,200151397

1517,223032,DXYN,Think Out Of The Box  Bet On 6 Stocks With Rising P E,opinion,"The price to earnings ratio  or P E ratio  is perhaps the most extensively used equity valuation metric  It measures the extent to which a stock is undervalued or overvalued by dividing its current market price with its historical or estimated earnings 
Now  normally investors  perception is that the lower the P E  the higher is the value of the stock  The logic is very simple   its current market price does not justify its higher earnings and therefore leaves room for upside 
But have you ever thought of the fact that stocks with rising P E can also be rewarding  We ll tell you why 
Power of Rising P E
The concept is that as earnings rise  so should the price of the stock  Solid quarterly earnings and the forward guidance boost forecasts for future earnings  leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price  After all  a stock s P E gives an indication of how much investors are ready to shell out per dollar of earnings 
So  if the price is rising steadily  it means that investors have high hopes on the stock s fundamental strength on which they expect its earnings to rise at a faster pace 
Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growth
Percentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal to the previous year
 These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years  
Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeks
Percentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks
 These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes  
Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500
Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500
 Here  the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500  
Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100 
 A 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal  
In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers 
Zacks Rank equal to 1  Only companies with a Strong Buy rating can get through 
Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just six 
Here are the six stocks 
The Dixie Group Inc    NASDAQ DXYN    This is a leading carpet and rug manufacturer and supplier to residential and commercial customers  The Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 8   at the time of writing 
Stamps com Inc    NASDAQ STMP    This is a provider of Internet  based services for mailing or shipping letters or packages with the Zacks Industry Rank in the top 22  
Pacira Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ PCRX    It is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products  The Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 36  
Humana Inc    NYSE HUM    The company is into health services  The Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 24  
Motorcar Parts of America Inc    NASDAQ MPAA    It is a renowned manufacturer of replacement alternators and starters for imported and domestic cars and light trucks  The Zacks Industry Rank of the stock is in the top 2  
Aegean Marine Petroleum Network Inc    NYSE ANW    It is a marine fuel logistics company  However  its Zacks Industry Rank is not favorable being in the bottom 16

1522,223037,DXYN,5 Top Ranked Stocks To Buy As Consumer Spending Expands,opinion,"In a clear departure from previous months  data released on Thursday revealed that consumers had quickened spending substantially during the month of April  The recently released GDP report had underlined the economy s problems during the first three months of the year  Given this backdrop  a pickup in consumer spending indicates that the economy has emerged from its first quarter chill and is ready to turn the corner 
During the previous month  all of the major expenditure categories experienced moderate to strong expansions  Shrinking supply in the labor market and subsequent wage gains is believed to be the reason behind these gains which makes it a great time to invest in consumer discretionary stocks 
Pace of Spending Hits 4 Month High
According to the Department of Commerce  consumer expenditure increased by 0 4  in April  in line with estimates  This was an improvement over the upwardly revised pace of 0 3  for the month of March  More importantly  it is the fastest pace of growth recorded since Dec 2016 
This notable increase in personal expenditure was accompanied by an even sharper increase in incomes  Personal income increased by 0 4  in April  twice as much as the 0 2  increase in March  Even as both expenditure and income increased last month  the savings rate remained flat at 5 3   This metric has now remained unchanged for a third month in a row 
Tight Labor Market  Wage Gains Powering Gains
Economists across the board believe that the rise in spending is an outcome of a tightening labor market  This in turn has led to wage gains  which has boosted purchasing power significantly  Further evidence of an improving labor market was received from recently released initial claims data  Though jobless claims increased by 1 000 during the week ended May 20  the four week average declined to its lowest level in 44 years 
Meanwhile  the consumer confidence index declined from 119 4 in April to 117 9 in May  However  the survey s labor market differential registered the second best reading in 16 years  This metric is derived using data from respondents who believe jobs are in abundance and those who think they are tough to secure 
Previously  it has also been utilized by Janet Yellen to gauge the unemployment rate  Leading economists believe that its current level should signify that the economy is nearing full employment  Needless to say  such a state of affairs will only spur further wage gains and consequently higher consumer expenditure 
Our Choices
Fresh data on consumer spending has signaled that discernible improvements are taking place on this front  A concurrent increase in income levels also bodes well for consumer discretionary items 
Investing in stocks benefiting from such trends looks like a prudent option at this point  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult 
This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score
