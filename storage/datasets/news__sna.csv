32347,253862,SNA,Will Snap on s Efforts Bring The Stock Back On Growth Track ,opinion,Snap on Incorporated   NYSE SNA   is losing footing in investors  books  owing to soft sales trend and currency headwinds  These hurt the company s second quarter 2019 performance  A glimpse at this stock s price performance reveals that it has underperformed the  in the past one year  Shares of this Kenosha  WI based company have lost approximately 16  wider than the industry s 1 5  decline Nevertheless  the company s robust business model helps enhancing the value creation processes  which focuses on safety  quality of service  customer satisfaction and innovation  Also  its RCI program  designed to enhance organizational effectiveness and minimize costs  has been driving margins and profitability  Moreover  Snap on s recent acquisitions are helping its Repair Systems   Information Group segment to return growth  That said  let s take a closer look at the factors impacting its performance Hurdles on the WaySnap on is grappling with soft sales trend that continued for the fifth straight time in the second quarter  Sales dropped due to adverse impacts of foreign currency translations  partly offset by organic sales growth and contributions from acquisitions  Additionally  decline in sales across the Commercial   Industrial Group segment hurt the company s top line  which was also impacted by currency headwinds The company s top line in second quarter 2019 included negative impacts from unfavorable foreign currency of about  19 5 million  Further  unfavorable currency hurt operating income by nearly  5 9 million  In fact  currency had an adverse impact of  10 1 million   5 1 million and  5 9 million  respectively  at the company s Commercial   Industrial Group  Tools Group and Repair Systems   Information Group segments in the reported quarter  Though management expects currency translations to improve in the third quarter  the magnitude of impacts on quarterly results remains to be seen Will Growth Efforts Aid Revival Snap on s growth strategy focuses on three critical areas  namely enhancing the franchise network  improving relationship with repair shop owners and managers  and expanding critical industries in emerging markets  Additionally  the company is dedicated toward various strategic principles and processes aimed at creating value in areas like Rapid Continuous Improvement  RCI   The RCI process is designed to enhance organizational effectiveness and minimize costs besides helping Snap on to boost sales and margins  and generate savings  Savings from the RCI initiative reflect gains from the continuous productivity and process improvement plans Management intends to boost customer services along with enhancing manufacturing and supply chain capabilities through the RCI initiatives and further investments  Savings from RCI initiatives mainly drove gross margin expansion in the second quarter  The company anticipates making progress on these growth strategies in 2019  which should drive its bottom line Apart from these  the company s Repair Systems   Information Group segment  which remained sluggish for the last few quarters  recorded sales growth of 1 7  in second quarter 2019  Organic sales at the segment improved 3 5   owing to increased sales to original equipment manufacturer   OEM   dealerships  Moreover  its operating expense margin improved 130 basis points  bps   driven by higher sales to OEM dealerships and the benefits from RCI initiatives The company acquired Cognitran Limited  a market leader in after sales solutions  which is likely to improve its Repair Systems   Information Group segment  Notably  the buyout is expected to reinforce Snap on s capabilities while providing solutions through integrated upstream services to OEM clients  Cognitran focuses on flexible and highly scalable  Software as a Service   SaaS  products for OEM consumers and their dealers  These products also focus on the creation and delivery of services  diagnostics  parts and repair information to the OEM dealers and connected vehicle platforms We expect the aforementioned growth initiatives to act as tailwinds

32349,253864,SNA,Why Snap On  SNA  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Snap On in Focus
Based in Kenosha  Snap On  SNA  is in the Consumer Discretionary sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 8 71   Currently paying a dividend of  0 95 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 41   In comparison  the Tools   Handheld industry s yield is 1 78   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 91  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  3 80 is up 11 4  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Snap On has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 15 12   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Snap On s current payout ratio is 31   This means it paid out 31  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
SNA is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  12 28 per share  with earnings expected to increase 3 94  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  SNA presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-10-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-snapon-sna-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200473542,200473542

32360,253875,SNA,Toolbox trade wars  How a sure winner in U S  dispute has yet to reap benefits,news,"By Timothy Aeppel
FRANKLIN PARK  Ill   Reuters    Nestled in an industrial park near the end of the runway of O Hare International Airport  Metal Box International Inc  should be one of the winners of a little known trade war over toolboxes 
In January  the U S  International Trade Commission ruled Chinese imports had harmed domestic producers of big tool chests sold in retail stores  prompting the Trump administration to slap anti subsidy duties of up to 95 percent on Chinese boxes  That could jump far higher later this year  after the administration decides whether to add anti dumping duties on top of the anti subsidy charges 
 This is a game changer for us   said Mitch Liss  one of the owners of the privately held company  who said regaining just a small slice of the Chinese business would make the factory boom 
Metal Box International is one of only two remaining U S  producers of such boxes  The other is Waterloo Industries  a far larger company recently acquired by Stanley Black   Decker Inc  NYSE SWK   the global tool producer 
So if retailers were going to start buying American again to avoid the mounting duties  it would almost certainly be visible at this factory 
It hasn t worked out that way  There was a small uptick after the January ruling  Liss said  but so far no boom in orders  After spending  300 000 on new equipment in a surge of optimism  he put plans to buy additional machines on hold and has not added any new workers 
Meanwhile  the Trump administration s move last week to crack down on steel and aluminum imports is threatening to boost costs for Metal Box International as well as Stanley Black   Decker  which uses those metals to fashion similar tool chests 
Stanley Black   Decker declined to talk about whether it was seeing any impact on its business from the new toolbox duties  though a spokesman told Reuters the International Trade Commission s decision could mean  increased volume in the plant  which can translate into growth in U S  manufacturing jobs  
A spokesman for  Home Depot   NYSE HD  said he would not discuss the company s tool chest sourcing  for competitive reasons  
The current battle over steel and aluminum tariffs underscores the risks and complexity in trade disputes  which often pit America s love of cheap imports against its desire to protect blue collar jobs  Winners and losers aren t always initially clear 
Tariffs on steel and aluminum could help some U S  workers   United States Steel Corp cited the prospect of tariffs this week as its reason to restart a mill in Illinois  for instance 
For a graphic  click 
But as a consumer of steel  Liss said the metal tariffs will hurt him but quickly adds that he understands why industries are looking for protection from cheaper imports 
TURNING TO WASHINGTON TO SAVE THE PLANT
Metal Box International had a strong business in tool chests as recently as 2014  when among other models it sold a design to Home Depot with glass on the fronts of the drawers   which made it easier to see which tools were in each compartment  Those were a big seller 
But the business quickly faded  he said  as they were displaced by imports that sold to retailers at lower prices than Metal Box International could match  Shipments of boxes fell by half in 2015 and fell again by half in 2016  said Liss 
The company was planning to shut down when Liss heard that his last U S  competitor  then called Waterloo Industries  was planning to file a trade case  Waterloo coordinated its efforts with Liss  who traveled to Washington to testify against the importers 
The trade case targeted only a slice of the toolbox industry  Small  portable toolboxes were excluded  as were professional type toolboxes sold by companies such as Snap On Inc  NYSE SNA   which market directly to buyers 
Companies have long sought trade protection in Washington  often finding as much success under Republicans as Democrats  The trade dispute process is meant to be bi partisan  with an equal number of Democrats and Republicans sitting on the International Trade Commission 
But the climate now has shifted decisively in the favor of protection under Trump  especially for old line industries like steel  The Commerce Department said it launched 82 new investigations into trade cases last year  a 58 percent jump over the year before 
 There is the potential element of companies knowing that they re dealing with a more sympathetic administration   which may be prompting more complaints  said Scott Lincicome  a trade expert at the free market oriented Cato Institute 
The Department of Commerce can do subtle things to help companies succeed in these cases  he noted  like offering better guidance in how to draft complaints  But Lincicome said the number of trade cases were already on the rise before the last election  These things always tend to  come in waves   he added 
The Metal Box International plant  which employs about 100 people  was building Husky brand tool chests for Home Depot one recent day  with workers clustered around an assembly line inserting drawers into the boxes as they rumbled down the line 
The metal bending machines Liss bought are already lined up in the middle of the plant  but not yet operational  Ever thrifty  Liss bought the machines from a company that reconditions equipment  rather than splurging on new 
 I bought these for  75 000   he said   New  each would cost  250 000  
Liss said most workers here are unaware how close the plant came to shutting down or how tenuous the situation remains  And even those who do know  like the director of operations Tom St  Germain  tend not to talk about the political atmosphere that seems to be helping U S  producers like them 
Germain said he likes President Trump  but added that  if he shut his mouth and did his job  he d be more successful  
Liss calls St  Germain almost every day to check whether big orders are rolling in 
These are early days  Liss said  so it still might happen  Retailers may have already stocked up on imports as they anticipated the trade ruling in favor of the domestic producers  But this would normally be a busier time  since Father s Day   along with Black Friday and Christmas   are the highpoints of their annual selling cycle

32462,253977,SNA,Trump orders review of visa program to encourage hiring Americans,news,"By Steve Holland KENOSHA  Wis   Reuters    President Donald Trump on Tuesday ordered a review of the U S  visa program for bringing high skilled foreign workers into the country  putting technology firms and the outsourcing companies that serve them on notice that possible changes may be ahead  Seeking to carry out a campaign pledge to put  America First   Trump signed an executive order on the H 1B visa program  It was vague on many fronts  but in a press briefing and a fact sheet the White House pointed toward basic goals  One objective  said Trump aides  is to modify or replace the current lottery for H 1B visas with a merit based system that would restrict the visas to highly skilled workers  Indian nationals are the largest group of H 1B recipients annually  Such a change could affect companies  such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd  Cognizant Tech Solutions Corp and Infosys Ltd  that connect Silicon Valley with thousands of foreign engineers and programmers  None responded to requests for comment  Trump announced the order and made remarks at a visit to the headquarters of Snap On Inc  NYSE SNA   a tool maker in Wisconsin  In addition to addressing the visas issue  he also ordered a government review of government procurement rules favoring American companies to see if they are actually benefiting  especially the U S  steel industry   With this action  we are sending a powerful signal to the world  We re going to defend our workers  protect our jobs and finally put America first   Trump said  As he nears the 100 day benchmark of his presidency  Trump still has no major legislative achievements  With his attempts to overhaul healthcare and tax law stalled in Congress  Trump has leaned heavily on executive orders to change policy  It was unclear whether the latest such order would yield immediate results  The H 1B visas section included no definite timeline  while the government procurement section did   We hope the goal of President Trump s executive order on the H 1B program is  mend it  don t end it    said Robert Atkinson  president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation  a major technology industry group  Going to a more merit based H 1B system could attract more people with advanced science and technology skills  he said in a statement  But he said some ideas could make the system ineffective  such as requiring advertisement of job openings for long periods to prove the unavailability of U S  workers  H 1B CRITICS Critics of the program say most H 1B visas are awarded for lower paid jobs at outsourcing firms  many based in India  They say that takes work away from Americans and lowers wages    Right now  widespread abuse in our immigration system is allowing American workers of all backgrounds to be replaced by workers brought in from other countries   Trump said  Tech companies have been bracing for Trump to make changes to the H 1B program  The visas are intended to go to foreign nationals in occupations that generally require specialized knowledge  such as science  engineering or computer programming  The government uses a lottery to award 65 000 visas yearly and randomly distributes another 20 000 to graduate student workers  Critics say the lottery benefits outsourcing firms that flood the system with mass applications for visas for lower paid information technology workers    Right now H 1B visas are awarded in a totally random lottery and that s wrong  Instead  they should be given to the most skilled and highest paid applicants and they should never  ever be used to replace Americans   Trump said  More than 15 percent of Facebook  NASDAQ FB  Inc s U S  employees in 2016 used a temporary work visa  according to a Reuters analysis of U S  Labor Department filings  Facebook did not respond to requests for comment  Infosys  India s No  2 IT services firm  has said previously that it is ramping up work on on site development centers in the United States to train local talent in an effort to address the visa regulation changes under consideration  It warned last week that onerous changes to U S  visa rules could affect its earnings   NASSCOM  the Indian IT service industry s main lobbying group  said it backs efforts to root out H 1B abuses  but said the idea that H 1B visa holders are cheap labor is inaccurate

32463,253978,SNA,Trump just signed a  buy American  order  but his own businesses don t,news,"President Trump signed an executive order April 18 that he says will promote a  Buy American and Hire American  agenda  The order targets the US H1 B visa program  which is designed to attract foreign workers with specialized advanced skills  and directs government agencies to enact changes to prevent fraud and abuse of the program 
Trump signed the order at the headquarters of Snap On Inc  NYSE SNA    a hand and power tool manufacturer based in Wisconsin 
 We are going to defend our workers  protect our jobs and finally put America first   Trump said in his remarks 
But a recent examination of US hotels owned by the Trump Organization reveals just how much they rely on foreign imports  a practice that could come under fire from his own administration 
The rooms in Trump hotels are adorned with furniture and products that have traveled farther than most guests  Sets of toiletries in the bathroom were imported from Central America  shipped to the US from the Trump Hotel in Panama City  Headboards  tall and grand and often covered in velvet or leather  came from Jiashan  China  Light fixtures were brought in from Kamenick   enov  a town in the Czech Republic 
To track where Trump hotels buy goods  Business Insider consulted ImportGenius  a company that compiles data from US Customs into proprietary databases  The resulting list shows Trump s businesses have imported furniture  fixtures  building materials  apparel  and supplies from more than 15 countries since 2012  Over the past two years  the companies have received shipments nearly 50 times 
Skye Gould Business Insider
Trump has repeatedly emphasized his commitment to domestic manufacturing   both on the campaign trail and as president  He wasted no time in pulling the US out of the Trans Pacific Partnership  and has continued to highlight his stance against globalism and free trade 
 We will follow two simple rules  Buy American and hire American   the president said in his inauguration speech  using the same language that s in the new executive order  But that agenda stands in conflict with the Trump Organization s own business practices 
Buying globally
On November 25  the Trump Doral   an 800 acre golf resort in Miami   received a 924 pound shipment from Hong Kong that included golf club covers  In January 2016  the Doral received two containers of massage beds  15 290 pounds  worth  from Moers  Germany  In February 2015  the hotel received 18 566 pounds  worth of logo emblazoned dark brown ice buckets with accompanying lids and trays  sent from Nonthaburi  Thailand  to Los Angeles 
The information about these shipments comes from bills of lading  which note everything a ship is carrying as well as who is sending and receiving the cargo  Michael Kanko  the CEO of ImportGenius  tells Business Insider that the company compiled the data by pulling all the records connected with the businesses and addresses that Trump listed in his public financial disclosure forms 
 We painted a picture of Trump s reliance on foreign imports by searching our global shipping databases for cargo movements related to Trump companies   Kanko says  The list is incomplete   because products might not have been made in the cities they were shipped from  and items that arrived in the US by truck or plane are not included   but it does show the globalized nature of the Trump family s hospitality empire 
Jessica Rinaldi ReutersTrump hotels are not alone in the practice of sourcing furnishings  fixtures  technology  and supplies from other countries 
 It s certainly common in the hospitality world to import supplies and decor from overseas  especially China   Kanko says 
Arthur Dong  a professor of strategy and economics at Georgetown University s McDonough School of Business  has consulted for companies in the hospitality industry  and says people would probably be shocked by how many components of US hotels come from foreign sources 
 The irony of this situation is that it s pretty well known within the hospitality industries that there are global vendors who supply many of the hotel chains around the world   he says  referring to the contrast between Trump s rhetoric and his family s business practices   Four Seasons  Marriott  and Hilton all declined to comment on their practices  
 President Trump will be  in a sense  hurting some of his own business interests by putting up these barriers   Dong says 
The new free trade debate
Throughout his campaign  Trump repeatedly promised to renegotiate the US s free trade agreements  claiming they kill American jobs by making it easy for companies to move production overseas or import products from foreign manufacturers  His executive order on the TPP likely killed that trade deal  which was negotiated under President Obama but was not ratified by Congress  The TPP would have created stronger economic ties between the US and 11 other countries   including Japan  Vietnam  Canada  and Mexico but not China   by reducing tariffs and other restrictive policies for trade between them 
Trump is also expected to issue an executive order to renegotiate NAFTA  a deal that eliminated most tariffs on goods traded between the US  Canada  and Mexico  He has called NAFTA  which was negotiated by George H  W  Bush and later approved by Bill Clinton   the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country  
Since World War II  trade deals have been largely embraced by both Democrats and Republicans because economists have found the agreements drive economic growth  Until Trump campaigned in opposition to free trade  most criticism of TPP and other deals came from progressives like Bernie Sanders  who said free trade creates winners and losers  even though overall gains might outweigh losses  A corporation may profit from access to foreign markets with lower wages  but domestic workers could consequently lose their jobs 
Since the election  Trump has stuck with his anti free trade rhetoric  In a meeting with The New York Times before his inauguration  Trump suggested he would favor a 45  tariff on Chinese exports to the US  On January 23  he suggested he would impose a  very major  border tax on companies that move their operations outside the US  And the following week  press Secretary Sean Spicer suggested that a 20  tax on imports from Mexico could help fund Trump s proposed border wall 
Yet many of Trump s imports come from China  ImportGenius  data shows that Trump has received 20 shipments from the country over the past five years  as well as 17 from Hong Kong   The largest shipment received in 2016 had six containers   weighing a total of 217 382 pounds   full of Miss Universe branded Chi hair straighteners and hair dryers  which were shipped from Shenzhen to Houston in September  
Associated Press Evan Vucci
Made in USA
Susan Helper  a professor of economics at Case Western Reserve University and the former chief economist at the US Department of Commerce  says that imposing higher tariffs could lead more hotel chains to buy things like furniture or light fixtures from US makers  But that will depend on what kinds of changes the administration makes 
 If there are tariffs just on a couple countries like China or Mexico  then stuff can move to other countries   she says  suggesting that companies might simply find production facilities elsewhere or start buying from places that aren t subject to higher fees   If it s across the board tariffs  then you d be more likely to see stuff come to the US  
While Trump hasn t said much about the origins of items in his hotels  he has repeatedly acknowledged that his clothing was manufactured abroad   Shipping data shows that much of Ivanka s line is too   When pressed  Trump has said he d like to buy domestically made products but that it was hard to find them 
 They don t even make this stuff here   Trump said on ABC  after anchor George Stephanopoulos suggested he should lead by example 
Trump only mentioned apparel and TVs in relation to that claim  it is true that no TVs are 100  US made   but when it comes to headboards and chairs  there are plenty of domestic manufacturers that furnish hotels 
 It s certainly very possible and it s certainly not difficult   says Amy Wolbert  senior vice president at Kindel Furniture  which is based in Grand Rapids  Michigan  Wolbert is quick to acknowledge  however  that furniture is generally more expensive when made in the US   The project has to have budgets that will support it  Everything comes down to budgets  
Chip Somodevilla Getty ImagesKindel  which was founded in 1901  provided a couple of pieces for Trump s new International Hotel in DC  a coffee table and leather armchair  Wolbert says that while Kindel sometimes makes pieces for hotels  its furniture is so high end that the company usually sells only a few items at a time  rather than furnishing every room 
 We seek to do more commercial work because it helps us grow and it helps increase volume and shipments   she says   It s always great to get that kind of work because it helps balance out the consumer who s going to buy a sofa one year and then maybe not buy furniture again for two  five  seven years  
Wolbert says she s watched many Michigan furniture makers pack up shop  a phenomenon that Dong says has been the case nationwide  Trump s trade policies could shift the market back in favor of US makers  he says  or even incentivize foreign companies to establish furniture factories in the US  But companies might also just start making components overseas and assembling the parts in the US so that they can get a  Made in USA  label and avoid tariffs 
 His credibility would go up 
Wolbert isn t sure whether policy changes like the ones Trump is proposing would bring Kindel more business  But she points out that there are other good reasons  besides US jobs  for clients to buy furniture from American makers  since they can deliver and repair products much faster 
Jessica Rinaldi ReutersHelper says switching to domestic manufacturing could even save money because of those factors  In addition to lowering shipping costs  she says  eliminating the long lead time provides other benefits 
 What companies sometimes do is order more than they think they re going to need and put it in their warehouse in case   she says   This is particularly an issue in clothing  The average apparel company that s importing from China may import three times as much as they expect to sell so they re covered in case there s a run on demand  So there s just a huge amount of waste  
If hotel chains do start buying more American made products  however  they d most likely have to find ways to accommodate the higher prices   either by cutting budgets elsewhere or charging guests more 
 The cost will be passed onto the consumer in the way of higher room rates  because they re confronting higher costs on many of the inputs   Dong adds 
But he says that the president would be wise to put his money where his mouth is  regardless of those challenges 
 If he doesn t start buying from American sources  it ll make him look a little bit hypocritical   Dong says   His credibility would go up if he were to direct his company managers to start sourcing  in the US   and I believe that when they start doing that  they re going to make it very public to make Americans aware that he s going to eat his own cooking  ",2017-04-20,Business Insider,"https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/trump-just-signed-a--039;buy-american-039;-order,-but-his-own-businesses-don-039;t-475829",475829
32465,253980,SNA,NIKE  NKE  Q4 Earnings To Suffer From Currency Headwinds,opinion,"NIKE Inc    NYSE NKE   is slated to release fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results on Jun 27  The question lingering in investors  minds is whether this leading sports apparel retailer will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of nearly 7 9   Moreover  it maintained a spectacular earnings record for more than three years  delivering positive earnings surprises for 27 straight quarters  In the trailing four quarters  the company recorded average positive earnings surprise of 9 8   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement NIKE  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
    What to Expect The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 67 cents  reflecting a year over year decline of 2 9   We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal fourth quarter has remained unchanged in the past 30 days Moreover  NIKE has outperformed the industry in the past month  indicating a positive sentiment ahead of the earnings release  Shares of the company have gained 1 7  compared with the  s growth of 0 2   Additionally  its shares have witnessed an improvement of 12 9  in the past year 
 

Factors at PlayNIKE s strong earnings track record is supported by the solid execution of Consumer Direct Offense through innovation and focus on direct to customer business  The company s performance graph is also influenced by strength in international and NIKE Direct businesses alongside momentum in North America  These factors should continue to drive its top and bottom line performances in the to be reported quarter Notably  NIKE s North America business returned to healthy  sustainable growth in fourth quarter fiscal 2018  The momentum continued in the last three quarters  registering revenue growth of 6   9  and 7   respectively  in the first  second and third quarter of fiscal 2019  Solid growth across footwear and apparel  driven by innovative platforms  and robust owned and partnered Digital growth bolstered the segment s performance  Moreover  growth across sportswear  Jordan  NIKE Kids and Running categories is likely to boost results The company expects the momentum in North America to continue in fiscal 2019 and beyond  driven by strong pipeline of innovative products  brand recognition and creation of digitally led consumer experiences  It targets mid single digit revenue growth in North America in the next five years NIKE continues to seek opportunities for increasing global footprint  popularity and market share  Apart from acquiring new brands  the company has been focusing on broadening its territory through growth of e commerce and NIKE Direct businesses  which are contributing meaningfully to top line growth  In just two years  the enhancement of its digital platform nearly doubled its revenue contributions from NIKE com and its apps  crossing the  2 billion contribution mark Moreover  the company plans to continue investing in the digital transformation  particularly in mobile apps throughout fiscal 2019 and 2020 However  higher SG A expenses from increased demand creation expenses and operating overheads are likely to remain a drag  Further  the unfavorable currency environment due to the global trade and geopolitical dynamics is likely to weigh on the company s sales Expectations for Upcoming QuarterDespite all positives  adverse impacts of FX headwinds somewhat hurt guidance for fourth quarter fiscal 2019  Notably  the currency environment has turned unfavorable lately due to global trade and geopolitical dynamics  which led to strengthening of the U S  dollar  This is likely to weigh on the company s sales on a reported basis  Driven by FX headwinds of nearly 6 points  it expects reported revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter to be in a low single digit  This is largely softer compared with reported revenue growth of 13  in the prior year quarter The soft reported revenue guidance also resulted from the dismal performance of the recently launched innovation platforms   React and Air Max 270   as well as impacts of the World Cup  Further  gross margin growth in the fiscal fourth quarter is likely to be partly offset by higher input costs   including cotton  chemicals and labor  FX sourcing headwinds  and the shift in supply chain investments from the fiscal third quarter to the fourth quarter SG A expenses are expected to increase in the high single digit range  driven by investments  Other expenses  net of interest expenses  are anticipated to remain flat The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth quarter revenues is pegged at  10 2 billion  reflecting an increase of 3 8  from the year ago quarter  Moreover  revenue estimates for North America are pegged at  4 139 million  suggesting 6 8  increase from the year ago quarter What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that NIKE is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is

32469,253984,SNA,Is Snap on  SNA  A Profitable Pick For Value Investors Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Snap on Incorporated   NYSE SNA   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Snap on has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 28  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 62  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Snap on s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 39  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that Snap on has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 94  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Snap on stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Snap on has a P S ratio of about 2 41  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 36 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  SNA is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Snap on currently has a Zacks Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Snap on a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too    For example  the P CF ratio comes in at 11 54  which is lower than the industry average of 11 59  Clearly  SNA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall    Though Snap on might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of D  This gives SNA a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has decreased by 0 1  in the past month  while the full year 2020 estimate has inched down by 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Snap On Incorporated Price and Consensus    Despite the bearish analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  Snap on is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front However  with a sluggish industry rank  among bottom 13  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Tools   Handheld industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and industry trends to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius

32487,254002,SNA,Snap On  SNA  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Snap On  SNA  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 7  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This tool and diagnostic equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 03 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  12 6  
Revenues are expected to be  963 17 million  down 1 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 2  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell

For Snap On  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 17  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Snap On will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Snap On would post earnings of  2 85 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 88  delivering a surprise of  1 05  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Snap On doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/snapon-sna-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200382003,200382003

32509,254024,SNA,Finding Value In Consumer Durables   A Very Diverse Sector ,opinion,"Introduction
This is part 3 of a series where I have conducted a simple screening looking for value over the overall market based on industry classifications and subindustry classifications reported by FactSet Research Systems  Inc  In part 1 found here I covered the Consumer Services Sector  In part 2 found here I covered the Communication Sector  In this part 3 I will cover the Consumer Durables Sector and its many diverse subsectors 
Table of FactSet Sectors and Subsectors
In each article in this series  I will be providing a listing of screened research candidates from each of the following industry sectors  the sector I m covering is marked in green 

A Simple Valuation and Quality Screening Process
With this series of articles  I will be presenting a screening of companies that have become attractively valued primarily as a result of the bearish market activities experienced in 2018 from each of the above sectors  I will be applying a rather simple valuation and quality oriented screen across each of the sectors  First  I have screened for investment grade S P credit ratings of BBB  or above  Next  I have screened for low valuations based on P E ratios between 2 and 17  Finally  I have screened for long term debt to capital no greater than 70  
By keeping my screen simple  and at the same time rather broad  I will be able to identify attractively valued research candidates that I might have overlooked through a more rigorous screening process  In other words  I m looking for fresh ideas that I might have previously been overlooking  Furthermore  I want to be clear that I do not consider every candidate that I have discovered as suitable for every investor  However  I do consider them all to be attractively valued  Additionally  I also believe that every investor will be able to find companies to research that meet their own goals  objectives and risk tolerances as this series unfolds 
In this part 3  I have found 9 research candidates from the Consumer Durables Sector as follows 
Sector 3  Consumer Durables
Motor Vehicles
Automotive Aftermarket
Homebuliding
Home Furnishings
Electronics Appliances
Tools   Hardware
Recreational Products
Other Consumer Specialties
As I suggested in part 2  it is not only a market of stocks it is also a market of sectors  Although virtually every sector will contain companies that are quite different from each other  you will commonly also find great similarities for companies in each sector  For example  this Consumer Durables Sector has a lot of things in common within each respective company in the sector  The key is in the name  Consumer Durables are products that have a long shelf life  Consequently  they are also products that typically do not have to be continuously replaced  at least on a short schedule 
Products such as motor vehicles  homes and home furnishings  electronic appliances  tools and hardware  etc   can be held onto especially during bad economic times  In other words  consumers can wait to replace or repair these items if necessary when the economy is weak  Consequently  one attribute that many Consumer Durables  companies share is significant vulnerability to recessions  As I review the 9 research candidates in this sector  I ask that the reader note two things about their operating performance during recessions  First note that their profitability and their dividends performed horribly during the Great Recession of 2008  Next  note that they all have tended to perform great since the recession ended 
This kind of operating behavior is a primary reason why I believe in first evaluating a company over a long historical period  I believe it s important to understand  as comprehensively as you can  the  nature of the beast  so to speak  Unfortunately  evaluating a business over a shorter timeframe can often mislead you into believing things about the business that are not necessarily true   at least over the long run  Therefore  when analyzing a stock  I always start with a long timeframe   20 years or more  Then from there I will shorten the timeframe incrementally  This process can provide important and significant insights about the business being examined 
For example  I can easily evaluate whether the company is a consistent performer or whether it is cyclical  I can also get a feel for the company s dividend record  if it pays one  and I can evaluate whether the company s growth is accelerating or decelerating  These are just a few of the perspectives I can gain by starting with a long timeframe and then incrementally drilling down over shorter timeframes 
Although this is clearly overgeneralizing  evaluating the Consumer Durable Sector over the last decade or shorter would suggest operating performance that is better than longer term historical norms  Consequently  investors could easily delude themselves into thinking that companies in the sector can perform better than they are capable  Overconfidence can be just as deadly to an investor as overblown fears  Although it is true that we cannot invest in the past  we can certainly learn from it

Summary And Conclusions
I hope the reader keeps at the forefront of their mind that this series is about identifying attractive valuations in each of the sectors as presented by FactSet  To be clear  my objective is not to present the very best companies in every sector that I cover  Instead  my goal is to provide potential research candidates that are attractively valued in each of the sectors 
This is very relevant to the Consumer Durables Sector because 6 of the 9 research candidates covered in this article are extremely undervalued in my opinion  Significantly low valuations can be a great risk mitigator for the prudent long term investor  However  considering the vulnerability that consumer durables have during recessions  even significantly low valuations might not adequately mitigate the risk of investing in them  Therefore  I believe that conducting a comprehensive  and most importantly  an ongoing research and due diligence process before investing in any company in this sector is of paramount importance  Although these low valuations portend to produce extremely high short to intermediate term total return potential  investors should remain cognizant of what could happen during an economic downturn 
Finally  I suggest that the reader further note that these are not necessarily great dividend opportunities  Two of the companies covered in this article do not pay a dividend and some that do have a pretty spotty record which includes significant dividend cuts  However  Leggett   Platt and Stanley Black   Decker are Standard   Poor s Dividend Aristocrats and Snap On Inc  NYSE SNA   is a Dividend Challenger  Nevertheless  I believe that investors need to pick and choose making sure that any of these prospective research candidates are compatible with their goals and objectives

32510,254025,SNA,Snap On  SNA  Q4 Earnings Meet Estimates,opinion,"Snap On  SNA  came out with quarterly earnings of  3 03 per share  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  This compares to earnings of  2 69 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
A quarter ago  it was expected that this tool and diagnostic equipment maker would post earnings of  2 85 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 88  delivering a surprise of 1 05

32621,254136,SNA,Why Gaming Giant Sony  SNE  Should Be On Investors  Radar,opinion,One high growth tech stock that is still thriving under the radar and should be in investors  spotlight is Sony Corporation   NYSE SNE     the Japanese gaming giant  Sony s shares have appreciated 36 9  over the past six months  as it enjoys solid momentum in games  music  and home entertainment   its highest margin segments  This compares favorably with the  s rally of 23  Despite such impressive price momentum  the company s trailing 12 month price to earnings ratio stands at 14 1  lower than S P 500 Index s PE multiple of 20 6  The stock is trading at a discount relative to its industry  which indicates that it is undervalued compared with its peers In the chart below  we can clearly see how the company s steep earnings growth over the past year has outpaced the modest and gradual increase in share price The discounted valuation combined with the growth catalysts make this Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company an attractive pick right now  Let s briefly discuss some of these growth drivers Growth DriversSony is perhaps best known for its PlayStation gaming console  televisions and headphones  In gaming  the company has reportedly sold more than 75 million PlayStation 4 consoles since the launch of the line four years ago  The figure is almost double the estimated unit sales of Microsoft Corporation s   NASDAQ MSFT   Xbox One consoles and quadruple of Nintendo Co  T 7974   s   OTC NTDOY   Wii U console In fiscal third quarter 2018 results  Sony s Game   Network Services segment climbed an impressive 16 2  year over year  Burgeoning demand for next generation video game consoles  explosion in eSports and the massive digital shift in the video game industry are tailwinds for the segment  Further  augmented and virtual reality might prove to be catalysts for Sony s gaming business  Sony s VR products are set to capitalize on its existing base of more than 75 million PS4 users The company s Music segment is benefiting from elevated Visual Media and Platform sales  In addition  Recorded Music sales are growing on the back of a steady rise in digital streaming revenues  Sony s TV business is also set to benefit from an industry upswing as more and more consumers upgrade to OLED and 4K screens  Home Entertainment   Sound segment is another strong growth driver for the company Semiconductors are riding high on demand for camera chips for smartphones  including Apple s iPhone  Semiconductors carry robust margins and expanding image sensors demand for mobile products should boost its growth prospects Sony managed to chart positive growth in its operating segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2018  All in all  we can see that Sony s high margin segments are accelerating at a swift pace  which implies healthy earnings growth over the coming quarters In ConclusionSony has been firing on all cylinders to boost profits and results are slowly beginning to manifest themselves in better operating income and margin performance  Sony s restructuring efforts and streamlined operations will help generate sustainable profit in the coming quarters  propelling future growth Clearly  Sony has its fingers in several pies and there are high chances that the company will soon become a tech powerhouse in multiple industries The industry trends are in Sony s favor as well  The rise of autonomous cars and factory robots can help its semiconductors business move beyond smartphones  In gaming  soaring software and service revenues can extend the PlayStation 4 up cycle and smoothen profits between new hardware launches  In fact  we believe that secular trends might make Sony a solid long term growth story The company s quarterly numbers have been surpassing estimates  while future projections are climbing higher  Sony has scored consecutive earnings beats over the trailing four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 79 8   You can see  Further  analysts have also revised the company s estimates higher in recent times  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 has gone up from  3 30 recorded a

32635,254150,SNA,Is Snap on Incorporated  SNA  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Snap on Incorporated   NYSE SNA   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Snap on Incorporated has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 8  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Snap on Incorporated s current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint  which is 18 4  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 2  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Snap on Incorporated has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 8  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Snap on Incorporated s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Snap on Incorporated has a P S ratio of about 2 5  This is somewhat lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is noticeably below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Snap on Incorporated currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes SNA a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Snap on Incorporated is just 1 3  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 2 1  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  SNA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Snap on Incorporated might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of A  This gives SNA a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days  and one lower  while the full year estimate has seen six upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen about 5 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Snap On Incorporated Price and Consensus    This favorable trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineSnap on Incorporated is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Boasting a formidable industry rank  top 8  out of more than 250 industries  and a strong Zacks Rank  the company deserves attention right now  However  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite positive estimate revision activity  investors should wait for industry trends to turn around first   When it does  this stock could be a compelling value pick Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018 In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you like to know about our 10 finest buy and hold tickers for the entirety of 2018 Last year s

lower than S P 500 index s PE multiple of 21 4  The stock is also trading at a discount relative to its industry  which indicates that the stock is undervalued compared with its peers The discounted valuation combined with the growth catalysts make this Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company an attractive pick right now  Let s discuss some of these growth drivers Growth CatalystsSony is perhaps best known for its PlayStation gaming console  televisions and headphones  In gaming  the company has reportedly sold more than 75 million PlayStation 4 consoles since the launch of the line four years ago  The figure is almost double the estimated unit sales of Microsoft Corporation s   NASDAQ MSFT   Xbox One consoles and quadruple of Nintendo Co  T 7974   s   OTC NTDOY   Wii U console  PS4 clearly emerges as the leader in the current generation of video game consoles and continues to be the best selling gaming hardware Console sales generate additional revenues from game downloads and subscription fees for online gaming  In the recent fiscal third quarter results  Sony s Game   Network Services  GN S  segment climbed an impressive 16 2  year over year  Burgeoning demand for next generation video game consoles  explosion in eSports and the massive digital shift in the video game industry are tailwinds for the segment  Further  augmented and virtual reality might prove to be catalysts for Sony s gaming business The company s Music segment also witnessed a 22 4  surge in sales on a year over year basis  benefiting from elevated Visual Media and Platform sales and driven by  Fate Grand Order  application  In addition  Recorded Music sales improved on the back of a steady rise in digital streaming revenues  Sony s TV business is set to benefit from an industry upswing as more and more consumers upgrade to OLED and 4K screens Home Entertainment   Sound segment was another strong growth driver for the company  with sales in the segment jumping nearly 22  on the back of improvement in product mix of televisions  This indicates a shift to high value added models Semiconductors are also riding high on demand for camera chips for smartphones  including Apple s iPhone  Semiconductors carry robust margins and expanding image sensors demand for mobile products should boost its growth prospects Sony managed to chart positive growth across its operating segments in the fiscal third quarter  All in all  we can see that Sony s high margin segments are accelerating at a swift pace  which implies healthy earnings growth over the coming years Recent ProjectionsSony expects to sustain the momentum in Music and Home entertainment businesses  Overall  the GN S segment is likely to benefit from an expected increase in PS4 hardware and network sales  Sony s VR products are set to capitalize on its existing base of more than 75 million PS4 users Music sales are projected to be driven by higher than expected Visual Media and Platform sales  as well as Recorded Music sales  Image sensor unit sales for mobile products are likely to drive Semiconductors sales higher  while an expected increase in television unit sales will drive HE S revenues Summing UpSony has really been firing on all cylinders to boost profits and the results are slowly beginning to manifest themselves in better operating income and margin performance  The company has created an impressive ecosystem of the PlayStation family  The company s restructuring efforts and streamlined operations will help generate sustainable profit in the coming quarters  thus propelling future growth Clearly  Sony has its fingers in several pies and there are high chances that the company will soon become a tech powerhouse  in multiple industries The industry trends are in Sony s favor as well  The rise of autonomous cars and factory robots can help its semiconductors business move beyond smartphones  In gaming  soaring software and service revenues can extend the PlayStation 4 up cycle and smoothen profits between new hardware launches  In fact  we believe that secular trends might make Sony a solid long term growth story The company s quarterly numbers have also been surpassing estimates  while future projections are climbing higher  Sony has scored consecutive earnings beats over the trailing four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 79 8   Sony Corp  T 6758  Ord Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Further  analysts have also revised the company s estimates higher in recent times  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 has gone up from  2 89 recorded a couple of months back to  3 86 today   a move of 33 6   This indicates that analysts are feeling bullish about the stock We believe that this would be a great time for investors to consider

32706,254221,SNA,What s In The Cards For Snap On  SNA  This Earnings Season ,opinion,Snap on Incorporated   NYSE SNA   is scheduled to report second quarter 2017 results  before the opening bell on Jul 20 Snap on has an outstanding earnings surprise history   it has not missed estimates in over seven years  Last quarter  the company registered a positive earnings surprise of 2 1   generating an average positive surprise of 3 6  for the trailing four quarters Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement and whether Snap on is set to add yet another earnings beat to its long standing winning streak Factors to ConsiderSnap on s successful earnings streak reflects its consistent capability to leverage on market opportunities for augmenting growth  Encouragingly  the company has been witnessing robust prospects in most of its business lines which signal brighter days ahead  Snap On s broad product line adds to its strength  Additionally  the company s financial services portfolio has been recording steady growth for the past few years Snap On believes that its recent Car O Liner buyout will strengthen its Repair Systems   Information Group offering  enabling it to fortify its footprint in the auto and heavy duty markets  Moving ahead  Snap On anticipates this company will generate operating income margin comparable to the RS I undercar equipment business Snap On Incorporated Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Additionally  Tools Group and Repair Systems   Information segments are anticipated to act as major profit churners on the back of positive industry trends  While factors like rising penetration in emerging markets  and constant software and hardware upgrades have been fueling Tools Group s growth  Repair Systems is gaining from business deals with independent repair shop owners and managers Though Snap On s bottom line performance remained unaffected amid macroeconomic woes  the company is faced with multiple issues that may hurt the second quarter results  The ongoing softness in industrial markets has significantly affected client spending  marring the company s prospects  Also  sluggish oil and gas market activities are likely to affect the company s top line in the quarter to be reported Further  persistent contraction in capital expenditure by auto dealers and intensifying used car asset quality pressure are formidable headwinds for the company  Year to date  Snap on s shares have declined 9 1   grossly underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s average positive return of 4 6  Moreover  foreign currency fluctuations pose a major concern as one third of the company s revenues are derived from its European businesses  Due to foreign currency woes  in first quarter 2017  Commercial   Industrial Group sales declined  4 7 million  Tools Group sales decreased  3 2 million and Repair Systems   Information segment recorded a  2 9 million sales reduction  We believe currency fluctuations will remain a risk to the company s top line in the quarter under review as well Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Snap on will beat earnings estimates in this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for the company is currently   0 78   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at  2 53  lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 55  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our Zacks Rank  Snap on has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Strong Sell  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Imperial Oil Limited   TO IMO    with an Earnings ESP of  7 69  and a Zacks Rank  3  is expected to release quarterly numbers around Jul 28  You can see  Belden Inc    NYSE BDC    with an Earnings ESP of  0 83  and a Zacks Rank  1  is slated to report results on Aug 2 Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT    with an Earnings ESP of  11 76  and a Zacks Rank  2  is expected to report quarterly numbers on Jul 25 Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent

it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Snap on Inc  has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 1  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Snap on Inc  s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is significantly below the highs for this stock  suggesting that the stock is undervalued compared to its historical levels Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with its industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 18 2  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Snap on Inc  has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 14 4  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Snap on Inc  has a P S ratio of about 2 4  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Snap on Inc  currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Snap on Inc  a solid choice for value investors For example  the PEG ratio for Snap on Inc  is just 1 4  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 2 5  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 13  which is a little better than the industry average of 14 1  Clearly  SNA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Snap on Inc  might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives SNA a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging  The current quarter and year has seen no estimates go higher in the past thirty days compared to two lower This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 0 8  in the past one month  while the current year estimate has decreased by 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Snap On Incorporated Price and Consensus   This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineSnap on Inc  is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a robust industry rank  among the Top 41   and a instills investor confidence  However  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall as over the past six months  its industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait analysts  sentiment and estimates to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of  25  per year  With compounding  rebalancing  and exclusive of fees  it can turn thousands into millions of dollars This proven stock picking system is grounded on a single big idea that can be fortune shaping and life changing  You can apply it to your portfolio starting today ,2017-09-06,Zacks Investment

The bottom line benefited from Snap on s robust business model and focus on value creation processes  Also  strong contribution from acquisitions and organic growth proved conducive to the earnings performance 
Inside the Headlines
Net sales in the quarter increased 8 4  year over year to  903 8 million and trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  890 million comfortably  Excluding acquisition related expenses and unfavorable foreign currency translation effect  organic sales rose 2 3  year over year 
Solid sales growth at Snap on Repair Systems   Information and Commercial   Industrial Group drove the top line  However  the company s U S  franchise operations in the Tools Group remained subdued 
Segment wise  Commercial   Industrial Group sales rose 8 7  to  314 6 million  Organic sales were up 0 2   Higher sales to customers in critical industries  along with and strong European based hand tools business  drove the top line at this segment  Weak sales of power tools and tepid growth in Asia Pacific operations offset the growth to an extent 
Snap on s Tools Group revenues continued to show weakness  edging down 1 1  year over year to  392 7 million  Organic sales at the segment declined 1 6   while favorable foreign currency translation impact of  2 million offset the same somewhat  Dismal sales in the company s U S  franchise operations continued to drag the segment s growth 
Repair Systems   Information continued to display impressive strength  as revenues climbed 16 6  year over year to  333 5 million  Meanwhile  organic sales at the segment improved 8 2   Higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers  OEM dealerships and undercar equipments drove strong organic growth at the segment

   Liquidity

Acquisitions
In second quarter 2017  Snap on acquired Norbar Torque Tools  along with its U S  and Chinese joint ventures  for roughly  72 million  Norbar is a leading European manufacturer which boasts a complete range of torque products and also enjoys a robust foothold in critical industries  like power generation  oil   gas  mining and railroad  Norbar will complement and expand Snap on s existing torque portfolio  and help it cater to critical industries  particularly in powered torque products 
Earlier  in fourth quarter 2016  Snap on purchased Sweden based firm   Car O Liner   to reinforce the Repair Systems   Information Group s position  and fortify its hold in the auto and heavy duty markets  The company anticipates this acquisition and favorable industry trends to strengthen its relationship with repair shop owners and managers 
Snap on also acquired torque wrench marker   Sturtevant Richmont   which is engaged in the designing  manufacturing  and distributing of mechanical and electronic torque wrenches  Snap on believes this strategic buyout will improve its critical mechanical performance by addressing critical torque requirements 
To Conclude

Snap on announced plans to enhance the franchise network  expand ties with repair shop owners and managers  and foray into critical industries to strengthen its hold in emerging markets  going forward  Solid prospects across business segments  accretive acquisitions and impressive traction of the recently launched products continue to add to the strength of this company 
However  in recent times  oil market sluggishness and currency fluctuations have been eroding the profitability of this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company  Further  persistent contraction in capital expenditure by auto dealers and intensifying used car asset quality pressure are formidable headwinds  The ongoing softness in industrial markets are impacting client spending  which  in turn  is adding to the company s woes  primarily affecting its industrial business  These factors remain substantial risks for Snap On in the times to come

What s Driving the Better Than Expected Earnings 
Snap on s successful earnings streak reflects its consistent capability to leverage on market opportunities for augmenting growth  The company continues to make significant efforts toward improving its operating efficiency through the Snap on Value Creation Processes  For instance  during Q4 2016  Snap on s value creation process contributed to the 3 6  organic sales growth  operating margin of 19 8  and an11 3  increase in earnings per share

Snap On Incorporated Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   In order to further boost growth  the company recently purchased the Sweden based firm   Car O Liner   for  155 million  Snap On believes that this buyout will strengthen its Repair Systems   Information Group position  thus allowing it to fortify its footprint in the auto and heavy duty markets 
Snap on also acquired torque wrench marker   Sturtevant Richmont   which is engaged in the designing  manufacturing and distributing of mechanical  and electronic torque wrenches  Snap on believes that this strategic buyout will improve its critical mechanical performance by addressing critical torque requirements 
Additionally  Tools Group and Repair Systems   Information segments are anticipated to act as major profit churners on the back of positive industry trends  While factors like rising penetration in emerging markets  and constant software and hardware upgrades have been fuelling Tools Group s growth  Repair Systems has been gaining from business deals with independent repair shop owners and managers  Further  Snap On s flourishing financial services portfolio will likely act as a catalyst for the quarter to be reported

Conglomerates and Transportation being a big drag  As far as consumer discretionary sector is concerned  the total earnings of the sector are anticipated to increase 3 8   while revenues are estimated to rise 11 3  Moreover  we noted that stocks in the Consumer Discretionary sector have been rallying in the past six months  The sector has gained 12 4   outperforming the S P 500 s increase of 9 2

of an improving economic environment  modest wage growth and better employment scenario  Moreover  stronger consumer discretionary spending has fueled an increase in sales of pool construction

The Markets
Stocks sold off on Wednesday as the shooting of a Canadian soldier in Ottawa spooked investors who became concerned of further coordinated attacks on either Canadian or American soil The TSX Composite plunged around 1 6   resisting from a declining 20 day moving average and charting an outside reversal candlestick that encompassed the previous day s trading range  Despite the recent oversold bounce  the trend of the Canadian market remains negative on both a short and intermediate basis  as indicated by the direction of the 20 and 50 day moving averages  The TSX broke below a significant long term rising trend channel at the end of September as the plunge in oil prices acted as a detriment for energy stocks  until a bottoming pattern is realized  the newly formed negative trend must be assumed to continue  Canadian stocks continue to underperform US counterparts  a trend that is seasonally typical through to mid December as energy stocks remain out of favour following seasonal strength in the front half of the year 





Much of the same can be said for American equity benchmarks  which broke below their long term rising trends at the end of September  The 20 and 50 day moving averages of major US equity benchmarks  including the S P 500 Index  NYSE Composite  and Russell 2000 Index  continue to point lower  implying negative short and intermediate term trends  A trend of lower lows and lower highs can be assumed  The S P 500 recently bounced from a level of support around 1815  a break of which would lead to a retest of the February low around 1737  Investors in the US continue to battle with the fact that the Fed will be withdrawing monetary stimulus by the end of the month  an event that has previously led to equity market declines of up to 20   as realized following the conclusion of QE1 and QE2  Should this pattern play out again  stocks may be only in the early innings of a more prolonged decline  Equity markets enter their seasonally strong period at the end of October  on average  therefore any weakness between now and the end of November may lead to ideal buying opportunities for the period of seasonal strength ahead 



Emphasising the risk averse nature of Wednesday s trade was the outperformance of the Consumer Staples and Utilities sectors  two defensive areas of the market that finished the day positive amidst declines in all other equity sectors  The Utilities Sector ETF  SPDR Select Sector   Utilities  NYSE XLU   charted a new all time high during Wednesday s session  while the Consumer Staples Sector ETF  SPDR   Consumer Staples  ARCA XLP   remains a mere six tenths of a percent off of the all time closing high  Coming into the winter season  utility stocks  particularly those relating to electric utilities  can continue to perform well through to the end of the year  Gains in the sector tend to be weather dependent where colder than expected weather results in stronger returns The 2015 Farmer s Almanac is forecasting a colder and wetter than normal winter with the coldest periods expected in late December and early January  The S P 500 Electric Utilities Subindustry Index has strongly outperformed the market since the end of September  benefiting from the risk aversion that has been prevalent for the past month 





Sentiment on Wednesday  as gauged by the put call ratio  ended bearish at 1 14 The Average True Range  ATR  of the ratio remains elevated  suggesting volatile trading  typically a scenario that coincides with broad market weakness  Declines in the ATR  implying a return to a more normal trading environment  would likely lead to the start of the next up leg in equity market indices    Volatility seasonally peaks in the month of October  on average 



Sectors and Industries entering their period of seasonal strength 





The Metals   Mining Industry enters its period of seasonal strength today  gaining  on average  through the end of the year    Gains over the past 20 years have averaged around 7   benefiting from positive tendencies pertaining to manufacturing following a summer slowdown The Metals   Mining ETF  XME  has significantly underperformed the market since mid August  following the familiar weak seasonal pattern  the trend on a short and intermediate timescale remains negative  The ETF recently tested support around  31 40 after trading to the most oversold level in the fund s history  according to the Relative Strength Index  RSI     The industry ETF has yet to carve out a bottoming pattern following the recent decline  suggesting that the door to the period of seasonal strength may not yet be open  even though the average seasonal date has been crossed  a higher short or intermediate low above the recent low of  31 41 is required to suggest a change of trend  A break below the apparent level of support could lead to a retest of the 2009 lows between  19 and  20 as the industry continues to struggle to recoup the losses from the 2008 2009 plunge

106845,328360,SNA,Snap On  SNA  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Snap On  SNA  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This tool and diagnostic equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 08 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 7  
Revenues are expected to be  963 25 million  up 1 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell

For Snap On  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Snap On will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Snap On would post earnings of  2 94 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 96  delivering a surprise of  0 68  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Snap On doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/snapon-sna-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200503302,200503302
